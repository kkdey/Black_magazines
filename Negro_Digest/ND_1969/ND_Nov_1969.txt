the sixties was for v rt v black americans a  ii decade of spiritual ins  quiry and of emotion a j discovery jhe three most important discoveries might be summarized in the following slogans  black is beautiful  the third world  the american dream is a nightmare none of these slogans constitutes a new finding indeed they represent on the intellectual level rediscovery since an attentive read   ing of the molders of black thought in this century will find their clear enunciation in marcus garvey w e b du bois and a philip randolph like all slogans which substitute generality for the elusiveness of the particular insight of the pertinent analysis these acquire in the wake of mindless iteration the shadow of ambiguity and the possibility of confusion a slogan is not a pro gram and lung power is not brain power nevertheless the consciousness of self indicated by these slogans is a necessary first step in the selfrealization of black americans a reahzation only possible when the question of identity has been answered black people in america are a people at once of and apart from the abstraction america this complex situation is the imperative with which all black analysis and all black movement must begin neither the simplistics of integration nor of separatism represents mature responses to this reality in this light our slogans when interpreted in a simplistic manner simply serve to keep the brothers in the wilderness black is beautiful it is also ugly it is ugly when a leader of one of the baddest bands of blacks sips tea with a few woollyheaded whites at a white university and tells them that the students of the black college across town are all uncle toms the third world exists but it no more represents unity or virtue or the affirmation of man than the first or the second do japans investments in south africa betoken afroasian unity does the warfare in which black ibo and black hausa fall at each others throats represent black virtue is the stride cretinism of chinas cultural revolution morally superior to russian imperialism in czechoslovakia or to us murder in viet nam finally who are the denizens of the nightmare are those who buy avidly the insolent chariots of detroit and the most expensive products of the shoemakers art exclusively white are those who in search of identity create a new cosmetics industry really abandoning the merchant mentality of the good old american way in favor of a new black bit a great deal of clarity is needed if the selfconsciousness of the sixties is to become the selfrealization of the seventies selfconsciousness must become a tool in the analysis of the world if it is to become a weapon in changing it at present the newly gained selfconsciousness is being squandered in signifying and putting down white folks bourgeois negroes uncle toms and everybody who does not agree with younamehim when time is not being used in this fashion it is being used to devise time and energyconsuming cults in which neoand pseudoafrican costumes are expected to slap the man in the face is he slapped who is slapped most of all i deplore those activists passivists who can profess no knowledge of the past but who go right on discussing it judging it reviling it a good case can be made for ignoring the past while building the future i am not the one to make such a case but the irony is that those who seem to want to do so cant they are paralyzed by a verbalizing virus which keeps them exorcising the demons whose meaning they deny here indeed is the challenge of the seventies to break the enervating cycle of ritual and rhetoric and replace it by the propulsion of rigor and reason to conserve the energy now expended and exhausted in fulsome denunciation and utilize it in the construction of institutions and modalities arising from the consciousness of self beyond this plane of industry lies the prospect of selfrealization itself a commencement not a conclusion 
hat lies ahead w f for black americans is precisely what happed t them alm° st  years ago when the reconstruction came to an end the gains made during this second reconstruction were negligible and they were made under liberal administrations those of kennedy and johnson during the first reconstruction a multitude of laws were passed but were not enforced the same thing is happening now this nixon administration is a repressive one and black people know it therefore unless the repression and oppression become unbearable  think black people will cool it until nixon and his bosses ruin the nation then move once again under liberal administrations everywhere we look we see racism the tone set by the nixon administration being blatantly practiced there can be no doubt about it we see it in the officials elected by the citizens of various cities see it in the police behavior we sec it in the workers in the churches in the armed forces yea it pours like vermin from the woodwork black people everywhere are in trouble nonwhite people everywhere are in trouble and i think the major task of black art is to defineate the political and social situation because it is the most important one survival depends on it ours and theirs
hs black people we are presently faced j with the most critical jkand s°phisticated de  cisions concerning our colonial status to become thoroughly americans assimilation to separate in some manner withdraw or to seize total control of america revolution within each of these three general goals there are complexities and contradictions that we still must struggle with we are not struggling with them now since the advent of the national anti poverty programs and white americas sophisticated dying vampirecultures cooptation of soul and danshikis et alindeed since whitefolk have been allowed once againto be intricately immersed within our ideological struggles from pantherism  commitemism to doyourownthingism rugged individualism updated with soul many of our brothers and sisters have been busted and have their asses over political hummers brothers and sisters weve got w to stop and check ourselves out where are we going nowhere but were doin it with soul and thats all that counts what do we want as a people as a nation we really are not sure are we a people a nation we really are not sure if we were a people a nation the least we would do would be honest with ourselves and each other check out our brothers and sisters from the socalled cultural nationalists to the panthers afraid of black criticism readv to blow you away if you dont support them or if you criticize them check out the poverticians and movement hustlers hovering around cutting up folk for the best position to receive the piddling chumpchange they say they are robbing and fooling the man for we militantly confront the man so that we can cooly negotiate for a piece of the rancid pie our militant intellectuals our militant activists our militant politicians still have much allegiance to and fear ofwhite america check it out our students struggle for black studies courses and more black students at white colleges for the sake of becoming better americansnot for the sake of aiding in the seizing of control in america there are militantand often violentconfrontations with the cracker for brothers and sisters to join the racistcapitalist unions for the sake of becoming better americansnot for the sake of revealing the racistcapitalist contradictions around the role of black workers we have returned to integrationist meetings and rallies primarily because the mediaprojected black_panther party is working from a white radical preworld war ii marxistleninist ideological frameworkrather than deal with the history of consistent white radical racism and copouts from the arrogant crusades through toussaint louverture gabriel prosser w e b du bois albizu campos george padmore kwame nkrumah to today in essence our present movement is passionately caught up in the moral political and cultural decadence and perversion of white america deep in many of our brothers and sisters hearts there is the heated desire to be president of the u s president of the imperialist ford foundation to be a rich gov rockefeller with soul  to produce and act in a soulful  am curious type flick    have we forgotten our historical destiny fear not the number and education of our enemies against whom we shall have to contend for our lawful right    let no man of us budge one step and let slaveholders come to beat us from our country america is more our country than it is the whites we have enriched it i with our blood and tears so said good brother david walk er in  and yes after  years we have almost forgotten being bedazzled by the trinkets and brothels of a white nation suffering from general paresis if we do not take up brother walkers call today what will lie ahead for blackfolk will be psychedelic slavery the ultimate in peaceful suffering the ultimate in white bestiality our race would be reduced to moonfolk excavating resources for whites if we move to separate our act of separating may satisfy some of our psychological needs but separatism does not destroy white racism or white capitalism and it certainly cannot destroy white imperialism we must and will fight for national control and independence from america as heroically and spiritually as our vietnamese brothers and sisters as our puerto rican brothers and sisters our mozambiquen azanian and nambibian brothers  as well of our panamerican and third world brothers and sisters    because we are the part of the panafrican race most strategically placed within the belly and brain of the white beast because we are the most technologically advarceo of our race because we indeed did and do enrich this country with our blood and tears and because we have a moral and spiritual commitment to our slave ancestors and to our indian brothers and sisters who heroically defended their nations against arrogant bestiality    because of these things and because of our panafrican and third world brothers and sisters strugling against white racism and imperialism we must  we will let no man of us budge one step and let slaveholders come to beat us from our country s e anderson

need systems of v r™t  all kinds that are rer yy i sponsible to black s people one brother j i ¦     who is otherwise very together said he was going to a white publisher to get his book published his explanation was that the publisher could effectively distribute the book what the brother preferred not to see was that a black writer whose book goes through a white distribution system will find that his thoughts are going to whites first and foremost for that is what the distributor is aiming at white money in addition to that the white publisher is editing for a white public the book may have been written for black people but it will end up edited for the white public meanwhile the white man is the intermediary he allows us to speak to each brother by way of him i do not think i have to explain the dangers in that we are just going to have to build our own publishing and distributing systems as best we can values ethics will lead us into program and that is where values should take us around  the wisdom of black people brought us to the intuitive state of rip it down rip their institutions down around  and on the wisdom of black people proposed the additional idea of alternative institutions or systemslanguage dress economics religion education community control what became known as black_power not a new idea but a renewed idea when the cry for black_power went out the first thing the man did was to throw some black spokesmen in front of cameras asking them to define black_power allowing them to speak through him i forget those definitions i know to me and many others black_power meant independent spiritualeconomicpoliticalcultural power for us black people one thing the man noticed was that the spokesmen differedemphasized different areas like politics economics or culture concepts united in the phrase black_power but the man deliberately projected those differences as confusion    and since then the result has been actual confusion the reasons for the confusion are not simple but one of the main reasons was our lack of a value system andor ideology philosophy or system of thought if you prefer no system of basic concepts truths historical examplesrationalizedwhich would allow us to analyze with clarity act with full confidence toward a goal or goals  have one more point to make    we may be the only people in the history of the world who so wholeheartedly send our children to the enemys schools to be instructed then we wonder why we have an historical discontinuity why the children hate their elders why they hate themselves the emphasis here is on children coming back against black parents that in several ways meansleads to selfdoubt lack of confidence in ourselves and in each other ultimately we will have to develop an ideology for only from an ideology can a substantial lasting value system come lack of actual ideology was why for example some of garveys followers fell for naacpism integration marxistleninsm capitalism as soon as garvey was dead some of his top people fell those various ways lack of ideology was not the only problem but it was a central one until we come up with an ideologyworldview if you prefer we wont stand much of a chance against the ideologies of the west the three cs capitalism christianity communism marxistleninism these are the alternatives we have been given the roads we have been allowed to travel we have to have the nerve we have to ask ourselves after the fighting and bloodshed what then marxistleninism freud einstein j p morgan will the master still be master of our minds even in his death if he is master of our minds how different will our fates be how different our leadership how different our world we have to ask ourselves that now
figuratively speaking the first half of the twentieth century was that period when the black americans were rehearsing for a show that they never put on the road the promise of freedom dignity and citizenship was dangled before us like carrots before a rabbit until we realized that the promise was a lie and that we did not like carrots anyway out of this realization the demand for black_power and black history was born the circumstance produced what i call the black and beautiful age thats where we are now and what lies ahead for us will depend on how we move out of this age to another one that will be the real test of our ability to handle the power that we have been demanding before we can move to our next stage of development and responsibility we will have to ask ourselves some hard questions and we will have to answer them honestly if the next stage of our history is nation building do we know how to hold a nation together we are collectively black and beautiful but does this fact help us to know what makes an airplane fly or how to cure a stomach ache what lies ahead of us will be determined by how well we take an inventory of ourselves and how we react to our findings in this kind of world being black and beautiful means very little unless you are also black and powerful
tij will come in the rii £ form of notes ideas ii  and nonideas passing hrou h me like time passes through the year month the world personal notes will be personal keeping in mind that im a black man first then poet reflections in hour thoughts which both kept me awake and forced me to sleep my new found ability to sleep four to five hours a night indicated a new maturity a short preface ive traveled from coast to coast and halfway around the world which means that ive been able to communicate mainly listened with brothers and sisters from san jose california to the university of new york from sir george williams university montreal canada to toogaloo college mississippi from luther college docora iowa to the university of algiers algeria north africa from those points and many smallerlarger points in between i traveled deliberately to give and receive positivenegative messages lets view together from a poets bridge leadership is not as we knew i i it the concept of leadership has to be redefined keeping in mind he who controls the image controls the action i find very little difference between all the news thats fit to print and the worlds greatest newspaper the two papers mentioned and others are only moderate examples of that which is wrong with this country and im sure if confronted none of them would acknowledge that neither truth nor the positive in terest of black folks is a part of their makeup americas image makers developers of myths and the destroyers of weaker men crazy is what they called malcolm_x stokley carmichael and rap brown crazy was their assessment of w e b du bois and paul robeson crazy is the adjective used to describe marcus garvey kwame nkrumah ameer baraka leroi jones etc crazy is crazy only when black people move in an uncrazy way to confront the real craziness of the world actually crazy is crazy only as the crazy canwill define it the new leadership is us each one of us we as a body of one will have to reflect that which should bethat which is necessary too often weve assigned roles to our leaders we must now assign these roles to ourselves we must become the malcolms du boises and nkrumahs of tomorrowdo not ask of others what you are not willing to givedo yourself reflect that which is necessary what it means is  are we serious and  what are we willing to sacrifice our children are watching us and we must not become the new pimps of tomorrow tomorrow is tomorrow if we want one tomorrow is tomorrow if we canwill define it to define and legitimize our own existence is the basis of a continuous existence europe may be a myth but it would be very difficult to prove that it is congress is one of the most corrupt institutions in the na tion but these are just words if no one believes it this white boy may be a sissy a punk and very unhip but he is also undeniably the worldrunner europeans define what europe is those there and those here members of congress define what corruption is those that are and those that are the white boy may be the adjectives indicated above but obviously that doesnt interfere with his running of the world our movement is to awaken the consciousness of blackness of ourselves the closed societies naacp sclc sncc the black_panthers all black fraternities and sororities core and anymost socalled black organizations that are moving to liberate us we are black men and black women human beings we cannotmust not be forced to become something unnatural such as organizational robots each organization mentioned above demands of its members that they reflect that organization and not necessarily black people in order to become a part one has to meet certain prerequisites such as become less blacker become more blacker do not wear a tie wear a tie seek integration seek segregation change yrname do not change yrname seek black culture demean black culture read only this read only that being political not political enough power comes out of here power comes out of there wear yrhair this way wear yrhair that way quote this brother quote that brother get high dont get high formal education self education wear a suit wear dashikis bare arms dont bear arms etc etc the new class division one group of negroes saying that other negroes are not relevant and blacks saying that afroamericans are not relevant and vice versa weve created such divisions among ourselves that our personalities change as television programs do this year its in next its out our actions move as the group does im not advocating a return to strict individualism which in itself is just as harmful but a movement toward combining all efforts which allow and encourage constructive criticism and constructive actions how can one black person blackball another we must move from ego satisfying pettiness and superficial idealism to the real world its popular individualgroups to say that they are going to use the man mainly for their own limitedpersonal goals but if we become products of the realworld well begin to understand that its very difficult to usemake use of the man that uses the world unless one is equipped to do thatand division is not part of that equipment it requires all our talents and most of all it demands of each of us the willingness to listen learn act and grow a man with an ethic a history and spiritual guidance is the beginning of a people with an ethic a history and meaningful spirituality ive often come across black people who wander throughout the world thinking they are a modem day meursaultraskolnikov or frederick henry and have never heard of bigger thomas harry ames or tucker caliban you reflect whatwhere you are if a brother moves throughout the world quoting camus or dostoievsky understand thats where hes at if he digs rubinstein and janis joplin thats where he is to move people from that point its necessary we must do it without alienating them its not to impress one with ones knowledge but with ones actions the values which we believe in cannot necessarily be taughtbut may have to be demonstrated if the ethic history and spiritual life you advocate is important be it your being it will be the most effective attractionor distraction this is the age of power the powerage the vietnam disaster could not exist if the majority of white people in the unitedstatesofamerica did not want it to exist the united nations would not be as ineffective as it is if this country didnt want it that way brothers malcolm_x and martin_luther_king jr would be alive if we could have backed up their words how does one bring down a monster without becoming one if you see a blackman walking around with a perpetual smile on his face its not because hes happy the basis of power is land land is the only hing that nobody nowhere is making any more of we can buy these bell bottoms next year if they are still in style but that mustang next yearbut land is going actionfast and that white boy is hip to it for hes all over the world taking it
future of the j   £ negro in america is inextricably tied to the future of america i  j there is no country at the present time that offers the promise and the hope for our people as does this nation america then must solve her remaining problems by the use of her ideologies so well expressed in the declaration of independence and in  our federal constitution the remaining vestige of the social evils of racial prejudice discrimination and separatism must be abandoned and the doors of opportunity must be opened widely to all americans so that they may seize every opportunity and assume every responsibility for making this nation a great just free and democratic fellowship american negroes must now do more than seek their rights they must also work to preserve the rights that are now available and to take their responsibility with other citizens in the economic cultural moral and spiritual growth of the nation with the ballot now given the future for the negro in politics is greater if the negro himself will accept the fact of a biracial culture and work in it and through it to gain further rights and to make further contributions with the scientific age upon us negroes must do all within their power to develop skills and to become as strong intellectually as any other groups so that their ability will render them essential and worthy workmen in the ongoing culture of this nation if the negro divorces himself from his nation and from responsibility as a citizen and resorts to exploits of destruction and bitterness he shall move from the heights already attained to lower valleys of privation servitude and despair the future of the american negro is with the nation but also with himself
d only knows what lies ahead for black americans and as we review the events of recent monthsthe obvious failure of thepoverty program the spurious efforts toward black capitalism americas refusal to reorder its value system increased activity of black snipers renewed efforts at minority repression and the not  often publicized schism ranks of black leadersnot be blamed for wondering if even god in all his infinite wisdom knows if anything is to point toward new directions for black americans it will be the budding unity which seems to be welding blacks together local coalitions and black united fronts are forming across the land this should inevitably lead to the creation of a national union of blacks made tenacious and invulnerable by the sweet smell of economic and political victories in neighborhoods communities and cities yet there is a warning which must be made as black leaders pitch the rhetoric of promise to the clamoring throngs for in the past the white man has craftily raised the expectations of black folk knowing that the fulfillment was certain to lag behind today however these rising expectations are largely due to the new black instrumentations which are producing a symphony of hope scored with notes of selfdetermination black nationalism black pride and revolution if fulfillment does not catch up to expectations this time the brothers fury will be unpredictable because his own leaders will have been the ones who dangled the succulent but evasive fruits of freedom what lies ahead for black americans depends as much upon the black individual as upon the black leader and it depends upon the quality of the efforts of both  today we talk black we talk tough and we talk revolution rhetoric can substitute for revolution if we see revolution as the movement of a body in an orbit or circle with all the black talk one must wonder if we are indeed in orbit caught in a frustrating circle going nowhere but revolution is also a complete and drastic change and this is the revolution which black americans must not talk but experience america which has been the land of the living dead for black people will never know the revolution about which so many are talking until resurrection comes to the black man individually and in total the movement has reached its most crucial stage rising expectations are near the summit as dr martin_luther_king jr saw the promised land black americans j are beginning to catch sight of the dream black leaders are providing the glimpse and if the movement gets locked in orbit if the  freedom train cannot pull away from the circular track utter despair will shroud black america and the dream may always be a reverie the ultimate success of the movement is not in the hands of those we choose to make our leaders for no matter how great their talents they cannot lead if the multitude will not follow our leaders sometimes march at cross purposes leaving the multitude bewildered not sure which way to head the black masses must rise person by personfrom the american graveyard and declare their godgiven freedom this cannot be accomplished from the halls ol congress nor from the white house the freedom to be a man cannot be bestowed by any leader white or black living or dead from them we can gain inspiration but only from that divine spark within can any man ignite the flame which will blaze into liberation

what do the seventies hold for black americans unity i hope its gotten so i dont know whether im negro black a tom or supernegro digest november  tom    the complainant was a doctor at an interracially attended symposium he got the laugh he also got the explanation he was unable to request he is not a laughable figure for he represents the confusion of the numerical majority of negro america an indiscriminate component which includes the elite the middleclass and the poor who view black as suspect and threatening to the known quality of their daily existence if the sixties have had any positive affect it may be that the turmoil has forced a black minority to examine its premises clarify its definitions and reevaluate directions from this kind of individual and group introspection a certain commonality of thought has emerged and there are explanations we can say we move toward the trauma of the seventies with clarity in certain respects our methodologies may be disparate and our goals variedbut collectively we do know what black is and what it exacts
the path to revolution is the only future course left for black people there is no other alternative that has not been tried repeatedly in an exhaustive search to save the humanity of those most inhumane but the forgiving quality of our african traditions must now be suspended we must commit ourselves to the task of constructing a new world a world of men not beasts a world where love is what time it is and people have evolved beyond hate the ofay has sinned against god we are gods righteous warriors and must rise as gods ourselves the black revolution must burn the earth rid of the white boys curse so that love can reign and we can become who we were really meant to be our immediate future must will be based on the following two processes  the resolution of our identity crisis black becomes the positive reflection of ourselves versus the alien whites and when we really rebel and become our true african selves we will then have started acting out our true role in the postamerican future of the world and in order to sustain and reinforce this new identity new cultural forms will emerge utilizing myth ritual symbol and values  but the cultural solution to the identity crisis is necessary but not sufficient black people must move toward a common analysis of the world a political analysis there can be no revolution without a common political analysis our analysis must be scientific not poetic based on the entire world scene and not one local or national situation and provide a concrete alternative for the future rather than a vague vision of mythical tomorrow we now find ourselves in the preliminary stages of developing in these two ways culturally and politically however to over develop either independent of the other is to deny the possibility of total revolution total black revolution involves both requiring a unification of the cultural and the political
what can we expect j flnrr £ from the seventies of  ™ £ course these times move too fast and too strangely to predict the future history like nature has this strange habit of creating mutations as the african in the americas is a mutation of history itself and therein lies our destiny i will chance to suggest  trends that i deduce from the sixties  we can expect greater military preparation on the pigs part and frequent violent conflicts with them  we can expect new subtle forms of cooptation of articulate black people the communication and education industries are already moving in this direction i expect black studies especially on white campuses to turn into a monster in the  s  think that in  we will find dozens of colleges turning out hundreds of blacktalking bourgies with phds in malcolm_x and john coltrane what a horror revolutionary institutions like malcolm_x university in durham will prove to be the relevant education centers  community control of public school education will continue to be a national issue  coalition politics with white people will prove for the umpteenth time to be a very dead end  large numbers of black individuals particularly men will continue to intermarry and so define themselves out of the struggle  there will be a further decline of large national organizations and an increase in the number of local programs designed to meet the specific needs of a given community it will be the unified efforts by these local programs acting in concert that will produce the synthesis that we need to move to a revolutionary stage  this will produce a dilterent kind of leader one with little national charisma but with a functional local constituency  there will be a radical revival of interest in local politics as black and white people struggle for control of municipal governments  panafricanism around the writings and speeches of osagyefo nkrumah and malcolm will be the dominant ideology  black people will think of something to do that no one black or white ever had the slightest no am certain tion that they would do of this i
nz jahn in the j nr  appendix of his book  ii  neoafrican literature a history °f black writing stated that as of january  there existed no magazine in the united states concerned exclusively with africanamerican literature the statement is rather remarkable when we consider that soulbook black dialogue and the journal of black poetry were all publishing by then the statement thus submerges a whole literary movement the emergence of these journals and others similar to them was the literary enactment of the crisis of the sixties the break with the west through them black literature reorganizes itself serving the cause of blackness by analyzing its suppression and recreating its images and its myths their role is thus revolutionary and since the building of a black national consciousness is conceived of as urgent by those who write in the revolutionary journal it must be accomplished on many levels the immediate outer realities call for a reporting of the facts of oppression for a mobilization of forces for sociopolitical analysis the soul within and the fragmented community require an imagemaking mythbuilding symbolization of that reality political activism and poetry can thus complement each other it is not the subject matter  which distinguishes sociopolitical literature from esthetic literature here the subject matter is really always the same black survival through identity and strength but the fiction or poetry of survival is rendered through imagery through symbols through experimentation with different rhythms with different syntactical forms with a different vocabulary through the indirectness of its statement about our condition the revolutionary journals thus attest to an allinclusive view of the black experience and it would be a mistake to pass them by in the vain search for evidences of the literary expression of a people neatly fractured off from life as is too often the case in old tired societies with nothing left to fight for it would be a misreading of the times all the journals with which we are concerned have certain things in common in addition to their double development political and literary all of them show a noncommercial orientation they have operated on limited funds and a missed edition has not been infrequent they are distributed principally through black dealers and by subscriotion they thus are written by black people for black people and it is rare that a white writer appears in their pages as did ted vincent in soulbook  with manv editorial reservations and a letter to the editor of black dialogue from a rather pompous white reader of the first issue states in part i cannot find one word in  this black dialogue which comes from one of you to me one of us the advertising is limited to black bookstores black publishing companies the other black journals except the first two issues of black dialogue had some advertising from radical white groups the editorial boards tend to have overlapping membership a number of the poets and writers publish in all of the journals most of them do not publish in white journals or anthologies we can isolate the following aspects as typical of the literature appearing in these journals  the black community of brothers those who share our condition and with whom we work for the common liberation may be perceived as national western hemispheric international or the community may be perceived as bandungthe whole of the nonwhite world  the existing black culture may be glorified in a conscious effort to build a sense of identity from the immediate past or it may be rejected as the heirloom of slavery and a new or modified cultural image projected which incorporates bandung elements andor draws on the prewestern past  a gap may exist particularly in the early phases between the political and the esthetic consciousness ie one writer may single out certain aspects of reality as having immediate relevance in practical life yet another may be symbolically working through other aspects in his art  similarly either the sociopolitical or the artisticliterary thrust may have greater emphasis or there may be a shift in emphasis  there is a sustained mythbuilding process which creates new gods and renovates the universe and which provides the black community with black or bandung heroes or restores those heroes to it which white society has sullied and submerged behind negative terms and concepts among the revolutionary journals several types can be isolated those which have local contributorship and readership and deal with local issues those produced on college campuses by black student organizations those which have or are seeking wide representation and wide readership in the black community it is impossible to discuss all the journals here i could list perhaps thirty some of which are now defunct which to my knowledge have appeared in the past four years or so and which share all the characteristics listed above however soulbook black dialogue and the journal of black poetry are the  most important ones in terms of age and consistency of publication circulation and how wellknown the contributors are through these three we can analyze some of the developments which characterize the genre as a whole black dialogue provides a good study in the growth and development of the revolutionary journal the first issue  resulted from efforts by a group of san francisco state college students much of this first issue is local in tone but succeeding issues come more and more to reflect black america generally the editorial board expands at present the board has regional representatives from new york headquarters san franciscowest coast the midwest southern united states africa in terms of content black dialogue has come to include art forms particularly graphic other than literary there are issues in which political writing dominates winter  in which political and artistic content is almost equally divided julyaugust  and the latest issue spring  contains no political articles although political concerns are evident in other ways eg the fullpage announcement dont let them destroy harlem stop the state building with an illustration showing angry blacks pelting a corralled grinning lindsay and cohorts this is by no means the essential criterion by which to judge the magazines maturity the growing evenness of tone which was not there in the first issues is a surer indication the political articles of the first issue show an acute awareness of the international character of black literary expression and of the right of a society of people to nonannihilation ie nonabsorption by the west and to nationhood whether that society is african or africanamerican but the intellectual analysis has not yet been internalized and the fiction and poetry show us still to be in the painful break with white society still tormenting ourselves with the moribund integrationist experience the literature shows us still on the lonely quest which preludes the discovery of peoplehood as a lived experience this attitude is replacedyou can see the process from issue to issueby a sense of group purpose by a growth a hope a conscious creation the personal poems now acquire an archtypal sense which the earlier ones lack the poet is not a black man he is the black mannegative images of black society tend now to have behind them a missionary message we know the trickery that exiles us   and still we dance ed spriggs autumn  black images are now projected on the cosmos as we now begin to perceive ourselves as universal beings our souls are open skies and childrenzooming across green places larry neal autumn  soulbook more militant than black dialogue it is the quarterly journal of revolutionary afroamerica and more consistent in tone and format appeared shortly before black dialogue and also on the west coast berkeley racist usa soulbook publishes a proportionately large amount of political analysis but its short stories and poetry are an important part of its format frantz fanon on the political front aime cesaire on the cultural are frequently featured written about and translated articles and communiques keep us posted on liberation movements everywhere soulbook thus embraces as brothers all the bandung world we black people realize that we have something in common with the majority of the worlds peoples we are all nonwhite and we are all oppressed by white cedric little soulbook  the theme of throwing off the shackles and the call to arms of the revolutionary writings is transmuted in the poetry into various motifs and that of castration is one of the most prevalent by ritual reinactment of the death of virility the poet gives himself andor his audience a chance to be reborn into manhood black soldier marched home     hung up his balls patricia bullins soulbook  when deranged vipers sliced through your black genitals my body was one huge bleeding ball k willy kgositsile soulbook  black bourgeois man    he got no nuts left one in desk drawer wife got other one in pouch tween her legs bobb hamilton soulbook  the journal of black poetry unlike black dialogue or soulbook is mainly concerned with one phase of literature but the journal also expresses activist concerns within its literary format and yet maintains a consistent tone and approach to do this it relies heavily on pictorial expression the center spread for instance of the fall  issue shows an outline map of the united states cut into two jagged halves one half of the map bears part of a photograph of young black men behind bars the caption directly over them reads usa and above that the label others in the other half of the map black hands clasp each other in brotherhood and above the heads of a family unit black man woman and child a raised black arm clasps a rifle the caption above reads afroamerica and above that selfrule also the journal often includes essays which in discussing black art or culture look inevitably to the political aspects when black people talk about black consciousness or power they are speaking indirectly of nationalismwhether cultural political or economic    we are cultural slaves dig it victims of what bro harold cruse calls cultural imperialism  askia muhammad toure rolland snellings spring  black culture and black survival are after all one and the same thing if we compare chronologically the issues of all three journals we discover that the literature which glorifies the subculture works in dialect works which describe the black woman in very sensual terms works which accept or glorify cohabitation occur most clearly in the earlier issues of soulbook and of black dialogue and that the embracing of african and eastern symbols and images some experimentation with the forms within these cultures is most clearly illustrated in later issues of the journal of black poetry clearly there is a widening of the potentials here for a renovated literature and a forsaking of chauvinism as too confining in the work of the poets to give us back our heroes and to provide us with new ones two types of black men are always sung jazz and blues musicians otis redding ornette coleman charlie  parker and above all john coltrane and political activists chaka nat turner marcus garvey patrice lumumba and more than any man any time anywhere malcolm photographs and drawings of malcolm as well as poetry abound in these journals of course poetry about malcolm is not confined to those writing in the journals so much of it exists that it has been anthologized for malcolm poems on the life and death of malcolm_x broadside press it is a sign of malcolms growing status as the source at which to renew our faith in our destiny that his example is invoked in a black dialogue editorial to help two groups within the black community see the way clear to settling their differences his actions in life have become symbolic of the destiny of african americans    the statements and comments made by brother leroi represent a step eastwards in african american culture that was prophesied by the epic journeys of el hajj malik el shabazz malcolm_x to mother africa the holy city mecca and the middle east askia muhammad toure journal of black poetry fall  the choice of adjective epic is indicative malcolm is the epic hero of our struggle of our journey toward a new consciousness toward a new nation his significance far more than historical is mythological these three journals with which we have dealt did not exist more than five years ago yet their writers and thinkers many ot whom are now in their thirties existed long before then as writers and thinkers somewhere in the black communities the journals emerged to fill the need for that meeting place for members of the black community wherever that community may exist to quote black dialogue through these journals and the many others which have sprung up since current black literature is being grouped and diffused digested and in a sense even created the revolutionary black journal made its appearance at that moment in our history somewhere in the midsixties when black people began to forsake civil_rights and integration and began to seek out a sense of self they exist as one manifestation of that intense looking inward to see what we really wanted the direction and developing quality of black literature can be but imper fectly seen if these journals are ignored the revolutionary black journals attest to a growth toward nationhood in an everexpanding harmony with the nonwhite universe they are an important index of the measure and meaning of the sixtiescarolyn

he s have seen us move from nonviolent protest and hopes of integration to selfdefense violence black pride and hopes of black_power our movement has been swift we have suffered losses but we have made gains however  feel we are not in a period of flux a time of indecisiona time of double trouble «  our leaders have either been coopted into the system are in exile in jail or have just plain copped out stokely is in africa but moving in a very positive direction huey is in jail eldridge is in exile rap is under house arrest the brothers are fighting each other on the west coast and in the process have lost the people infighting continues on the east coast malcolm is dead and nathan wright has integrated so throughout black america we see sad spectacles such as these gang warfare between black militant groups a group of black college students in detroit donating a  statue of a black madonna sculptured by a white artist and donated to a white college black studies programs turning into agencies for spying on black people the crime rate among blacks continuing to soar a black female vocalist on tv supposedly promoting black pride but sporting a blond afro wig black nationalists in harlem losing valuable time protesting to whites about a state office building for what  we have always had to struggle for our survival in this land are we so fat now that we can relax or drop our guard i think not but unfortunately far too many of our people are doing just this we are not developing and expanding black philosophy white culture continues to preoccupy much of our thinking and doing every white fad that comes along we pick up too many of our people are hooked on the beatles mod squad and white rock festivals we are not preparing ourselves for economic depression or recession the only farms we have are those run by elijah muhammad and a few determined black southern farmers remember all that money we spent on the poor peoples campaign in washington with that kind of cash we could have purchased two counties in alabama or michigan white economists are preparing now for a serious economic slowdown while we prepare for revolution with old obsolete rifles owning a few farms to feed our people is not the whole answer of course other things are needed we need to explore realistic self defense for survival we  need to establish economic and diplomatic relations with black people in africa and latin america we need to further define and expand black culture black history is wide open for more study research and writing we must stop the systematic education genocide of black children i think part of our problem is our evaluation of the situation here too many of our militant brothers are convinced the philosophy and or tactics of che guevera marx engels or mao can be applied to our problem here when our thinking moves in this vein we are easy prey for the white radicals who tell us that the problem here is a class struggle and as soon as black and white workers overthrow the white capitalistic power structure well all march hand and hand to a class less integrated promised land damned lie the problem in america is racism oppressive white racism against black people whites may be socialists but they still tend to be racists check cuba since the revolution garvey warned us to beware of white radicals he called them greeks bearing gifts if we cant trust white radicals then it follows we cant trust the white power structure our only alternative is to turn to ourselves i know its hard for many of us to do this its so easy to hook up with whites they have a lot of money and a lot of expertise but they also have a long history of tricking black people i just finished reading where one of our leaders is advocating that black people support the peace movement ridiculous unless you want to spend another ten years marching with the enemy nobody wants peace anymore than black people for weve been at war for over  years but joining with whites for anything is a waste of time history has proven that as soon as the crisis is over its open season on black people and our so called white friends are nowhere to be found here are some examples paul robesonwhen the going got tough he was deserted by his white radical friends world i war i and iiunprecedented lilynchings of black people followed each war reconstruction after the civil warall the white liberals and radicals were in full bloom it i seemed for awhile that real liberty equality and power were coming to black people but the northern republicans liberals and radicals at that time sold out to the southern whites in order to get dixie support for rutherford b hayes for president of the united states the klan began to ride black officeholders were killed or kicked out of office and the wholesale murder of black people reared its ugly head again we were not prepared to protect ourselves because we had depended on our socalled white friends for our protection they deserted us then and theyll do it today only black people are the salvation of black people there are no ifs ands and buts about it we must turn to ourselves for our own survival and liberation  wish my black activist brothers could understand this simple rule read the philosophy and opinions of marcus garvey its all there we live in a racist society that never has and never will care anything about black people that might be a hard pill to swallow but its the whole truth let us begin to forge real black unity we must stop begging someone else to do for us what we should be doing for ourselves we must learn to sacrifice to build and to fight effectively margaret walker sums it up beautifully in the closing lines of her poem for my people
in the united states and in africa the caribbean islands and in other parts of the world where people of african descent are numerous the s was a period when we discarded one set of illusions and took on another inasmuch as the seeds of conflict and achievement that are planted in one decade are harvested in another the s can only be understood when looked at from the vantage point of the s this is where our present day illusions began in  in the case of henderson vs the united states the supreme court ended diningcar segregation on railroads by requiring them to permit negroes to occupy any empty seat in the diner instead of being confined to a partitioned section this decision was based on the interstate commerce act the justice department joined the plaintiff in this case in the same year president trumans committee on equality of treatment and opportunity in the armed forces reported that black americans were still barred from  of  specializations in the army despite announced policy to the contrary gwendolyn brooks became the first afroamerican to win a pulitzer prize in poetry for her collection of poems annie allen another fresh writing talent emerged in the presence of william demby whose novel beetle creek see page  was a literary success and he was hailed as one of the new writers of promise in the following year in the case of mckissick vs carmichael the university of north carolina law school was opened to negroes by court order in the political campaigns of  all political parties from republican to socialist had statements in their platforms declaring their abhorrence of discrimination and pledging assistance to the black voters of this country we had the illusion that we were entering a decade of great promise then other things awakened us to a reality the white citizens council became active as a reaction to the supreme court decision outlawing segregation in the schools in  the s reached a ceremonial climax before it was well under way in the presence of the historical march on washington on reflection this event that was supposed to be the monumental turning point in the fight for jobs citizenship and dignity for black americans turned out to be one of the greatest picnics in history in my opinion it accomplished absolutely nothing the march on washington was really a march in washington the power structure let black americans and their white allies indulge themselves but did not yield one iota of the power that man needs to make himself free for a while after the lethargy that followed the march on washington set in the attention of black americans turned toward africa where nations were becoming free almost by the week the africans were indulging in illusions too soon the international colonial power structure started destroying the leaders of these countries through assassinations and coups as fast as they came to power yet the great personalities continued to emerge both in africa and the united states one of the most spectacular to emerge from the black proletariat was malcolm_x as the s drew to a close the decade might be called the period of our great illusions and our naivete we frightened white people with something called black_power but they didnt stay frightened very long before they began to either destroy the black_power apparatus or to buy its leaders looking back on the s and the beautiful hopefulness of a civil_rights movement that was born and died before our eyes i think it is that decade of the black mans beautiful dreaming before awakening to a new reality that reality is that freedom is a hardwon thingt is not left by one generation to and all important lesson in the the other freedom is a thing that s the decade has been his each generation must take and se master teacher and some of his cure with its own hands if the longawaited maturity has emerged black man has learned this simple from itjohn henrik clarke
the two groups of peopl e for whom the black_power movei ment was a matter of life and death were the white liberals and the wouldbe black bourgeoisie james baldwin for all we may come to think of him was the one who jammed the white liberal in a corner and made him choke in his guilt and leroi jones continued it in the early part of the sixties the liberal didnt know where the hell to go in reality his conception of black people was worse than most of us would think he really didnt know the black american and in most cases thought him basically a free spontaneous noble savage the liberal when he came to think about the paucity of black revoltsthere was not really a paucity of them was ashamed of blacks in fact before the black_power movement few whites felt any pride in the achievements of blacks consequently the black_power movement brought black pride and identity not so much to ghetto blacks as it did to white liberals who now can feel proud of their blacks feel proud of the fact that blacks finally are accepting themselves finally creating a black culture finally becoming aware of the white mans pernicious politics for the white the black was invented with black_power before that there were only slaves stupid selfhating niggers who wanted to be white what a weird view of history the wouldbe black bourgeoisie was in the same position as the white he couldnt jump off into the black bourgeoisie because that had been blown he couldnt go back into the ghetto because thats not the american way of life and so he jumped off into what the mass media and the present government termed black_power naturals are beautifuland there were some beautiful black sisters before them too my mother was onebut i suspect the people who were starving before the inception of the black is beautiful craze are probably dead by now what i am suggesting is that one must be very careful with the media for the simple reason that it always does the reverse of what it pretends to do in its attempt to inform the public it only succeeds in providing content for itself the media in other words a televised account of a police attack on the black_panthers becomes finally the content for the newsit becomes television but of course if the show is viewed by another black_panther he will say if someone asks him what he is i watching i am watching this ¦ brother talk about the pig which is real if most viewers would respond thusly the image would be a ii true image of reality it would be true protest and not merely a mirror reflection the media is counterrevolutionarythat is it is against destroying itself hence against destroying the white viewer whom it pacifiesbecause the moment protest is introduced into the media it ceases being protest and become the news a new tv show about spooks etc it is true that the media is one way of getting recognized but the error in this is that most people confuse the presentation of a problem with the solution to the problem the impact of eldridge cleaver in society obscures for many the fact that thousands of black men are in prison because of the injustice of white society television has come to belong to nixon and the white liberals who argue that the problem is not racism but class the latest technique is to have blacks on television yes but to have them putting each other down on screen one evening i watched four shows where there were blacks putting down blacks there is the black cop who puts down the black criminal they had james earl jones saying things like man if racism is your bag youre a drag the black employer puts down the black employeethe assumption being that blacks are racists against themselves if you want to understand the media check this out leslie uggams show she is always kissing white boys and talking sex with them enough to make you puke is the whitest show on the air right and sly and the family stone who are maybe the blackest thing going appear on leslie uggams show why because when it comes to media there is only media it is not simply a matter of saying that black actors will do anything for a part or that a performer will appear on anybodys show for the money like the fifth dimension can be seen on the woody allen show right alongside billy graham its all media although it certainly looks that way but rather they are into a thing which cuts across other categories like politics race sex etc the sixties should have shown us the way the media works against the black man that is the industrialized black man and the seventies should reveal the wavs the media j orientated black man will deal with that in the seventies i suspect black criticism will be keener than it has been in the past will be keen enough for example to detect that the media itself is racist literacy is a technique of the media which has always worked against black people when the white man discovered africa he called the whole continent illiteratethat is pagan voodoo deserving of slavery etc but how could africa be illiterate when it didnt have a literate tradition the white man made the black slave believe he was a slave because he was illiterate and how could the slave defend himself unless in fact he was literate when however the slave did become literate literacy is also christian moral whiteness he became bonded in a way he had never been before he was bonded to white culture and the only way he could free or even explain that bond was to become whiter or rather more literate when the slave learned to read for the first time he experienced the modern white mans sense of guilt and alienation for he felt cut off from his own experiences here is the confession of a slave pennington which is supported by the confessions of other slaves like frederick douglass vassa booker t washington after he learned to read i was made to feel that whatever else i might do i was not qualified to do that as i have myself alienated from himgodby wicked words     was deeply convicted of the guilt of my own sins against god the black writer today must be aware of the influence of literacy on his art he must be aware of all the sideaffects of this medium 	car insurance c v owning a car is usu£ ally a necessity espe dally in areas where public transportation is inadequate and people have to travel long distances to get to work the high prices and declining quality of care the rising cost ol repairs and maintenance are painful enough the cost of financing cars is a great burden especially when the owner has to pay out large sums for car insurance while he is paying for the car sometimes paying interest on the insurance as well in the black community flybynight insurance companies which often go bankrupt leaving their clients holding the bag in case of an accident prey upon their victims by charging astronomical rates there are families of working people who pay a thousand dollars a year just for car insurance to cite once more my own experience when i lived in detroit the only liability insurance  could get involved paying  a year and signing a contract to renew the policy at the same rate for  additional years when i moved to ann arbor i got the same coverage with a reliable company for  i worked for many years in negligence law offices dealing mostly with auto accident cases  worked in plaintiffs work defense work and for the defense office of a large insurance company and my conclusion is that car insurance is a fantastic racket which milks the policyholders and the victims of accidents for the sake of the insurance companies the doctors and the lawyers engaged in the business it is estimated incidentally that half the income of the lawyers in this country comes from accident cases  here is the problem no one can collect damages no matter how great their injuries unless they can prove that the other party was wholly at fault for the accident and the injured party did not contribute in any way to the accident a vast field for litigation is created and many people with serious damages are not compensated because they cannot prove that the other party was entirely at fault furthermore insurance companies will settle claims for minor injuries just to avoid the expense of defending them but in cases of serious injury no expense is spared in defense the case is dragged out to force the victim to settle for less than the case is worth and the more serious the injury is the less likely is the compensation to be adequate then if the victim finally collects about onethird goes to his lawyer another big chunk to the doctors who testify for him charging witness fees in addition to fees for treatment then there are the defense doctors many of them with highsounding titles and qualifications who havent practiced medicine in years since they find it more lucrative to spend their time testifying in court for insurance companies the obvious solution is an insurance commission which would collect a reasonable fixed sum with each car license with which to compensate victims of auto accidents for personal injury and property damage regardless of who is to blame for the accident extreme cases of negligence or recklessness would be a criminal not a civil matter this solution would afford much better protection to the public at lower cost and eliminate the race tax on car insurance guaranteed annual wage or negative income tax this simple and reasonable substitute for the welfare system would eliminate the cost of maintaining a bureaucratic structure manned bv social worko ers who play a largely negative and destructive role in the black community concretely i have in mind the complaint of an adc mother that investigators from the welfare department had broken down her door trying to catch her sleeping with her husband tax appropriations we need to proclaim a new equality equality of public services it is grossly inequitable to allow the congregation of wealthy families into communities where they provide themselves and each other with lush funds for schools hospitals parks and recreation sanitation and every conceivable public service leaving those trapped in the cities to suffer with only a fraction of the funds per capita which is spent in the suburbs the principle should be established on a statewide if not a nationwide basis that tax funds for municipal services be allocated to each community on a per capita basis dismantling and decentraliza tion of municipal government once equitable funds have been provided municipal functions should be localh controlled on the basis of small community units breaking up the purposefully blind corrupt and irresponsible bureaucracies of our large cities police and municipal courts jails and juvenile homes education health sanitation housing inspection the licensing of businesses parks and recreation would come under the control of the local community with officials elected locally and directly responsible to the community inmates of jails and juvenile homes should be transferred to the control of the communities from which they come all jail sentences pronounced in the past should be reviewed by the new community courts capital punishment should be ended as a largely black mans punishment municipal employment and business ownership andor management would be by people residing in the community stores which overcharge customers or sell poorer quality or smaller selection of merchandise than in suburban branches would have their licenses revoked the community could hire comparison shoppers from among local housewives to visit suburban food chain stores and compare price and quality the drug traffic i will conclude with what i believe to be the most vital question that is the illegal drug traffic it is obvious that those who profit most from the drug traffic have little to fear from the police and the courts which are supposed to be protecting the publie hardearned dollars are poured on a grand scale from black pockets into the coffers of the underworld it is hard to overestimate the extent of drug addiction in the black community official estimates are ludicrous i have a friend who was brought up on w th street in harlem of all the boys who grew up on his block he is the only one who is not either dead in jail or a street addict the situation in michigan is not much if at all better the fact that the medical establishment in michigan suffers from selective blindness does not change the real world out there the illegal drug traffic is an extraordinarily ruthless efficient exploitative mechanism fueled mainly by heroin a desperate need for drugs is created and a corrupting structure pervades the community sale of drugs is one important means of supporting a habit pressure is immense to create new addicts to serve as customers spreading the structure into ever widening circles thus a pecking order is established in which survival depends upon ruthless exploitation of the next man or woman and at the outer fringe of the expanding pyramid are those who live by theft and prostitution victimized by the police a mass of highly motivated criminals is created street slaves  lie hardearned dollars are poured on a grand scale from black pockets into the coffers of the underworld it is hard to overestimate the extent of drug addiction in the black community official estifor the organized underworld which collects au leaving the street addicts half starved and half naked avidly recruiting new victims in order to take some of the pressure off their own backs endless tribute is paid by the families of addicts who try to keep them alive and off the street many addicts work sometimes holding down two jobs in an effort to support their habits without resorting to crime as a historian of afroamerican slavery i cannot resist the temptation to compare the relatively crude means by which slaves were forced into theft and prostitution with the much vaster more efficient more impersonal means employed in our cities today in the cities of the spanish empire theft and prostitution were carried out thinly disguised as slaves working for themselves in return for bringing back a certain amount of money each day to the master a spanish law in  forbade masters from sending their female slaves or free black women out in the street to sell things and if they do not bring back the profits which the masters suppose they should they send them out at night to whatever torpor and dishonesty leads them another spanish law of  makes the situation even clearer we have been told of the harsh punishments which some masters inflict upon their slaves even for making small mistakes    with the scandalous abuse of sending black and mulatto women out to earn a daily sum most of them going out in public nude causing a great scandal and committing many mortal sins in order to bring to their masters the money they require in brazil travellers were shocked by the large numbers of  respectable brazilian ladies who lived off the immoral earnings of their female slaves male street slaves were engaged largely in theft clearly the system is more efficient now the masters do not own any particular slave who they had to pay a lot of money for so they dont care whether an individual slave lives or dies they dont need to punish their slaves they have the police the courts and the jails for that and if these are not enough they have the national guard and the army in fact they never see their slaves the only time they notice them is when they threaten the social order then the masters deplore violence rioting and crime in the streets no one even slightly familiar with how openly the drug traffic is carried on in the black community can doubt that it is thoroughly protected but there is an aspect of the protection afforded by the institutions of our society to the drug traffic which is less familiar that is the intimidation of the medical profession by federal narcotics agents who dont seem to worry about the drug traffic out in the streets so much as that maybe a medical doctor will have enough  professional selfrespect to treat an addict i approached several doctors about treating addicts and their response was very enlightening one said theyll investigate my income tax another an eminent member of a state commission dealing with alcoholism and narcotics addiction said he knew nothing about addicts had never seen one and panicked at the suggestion that perhaps the experience would be enlightening another more humane and courageous doctor explained that he had treated an addict and received a visit from federal narcotics agents who scrupulously examine the prescriptions handled in drug stores they asked the doctor why he was treating this man the doctor insisted upon his right to do so thereafter a pharmacist who filled his prescriptions reported to him that federal narcotics agents had been around asking if he thought that the doctor was a drug addict at a highly respectable ritual held at the university of michigan last january  attended a panel on medical aspects of drug addiction i asked the members of the panel from the floor why doctors are so afraid to treat addicts a psvehiatrist who practices in detroit answered that the problem no longer exists since the american medical association had accepted new guidelines allowing physicians to treat addicts thereupon i took out a pencil and paper and asked for the name of a doctor in detroit who would treat addicts he said to write to him and he would send me a list i wrote he never answered our society treats addicts worse than lepers were treated during the middle ages they are ostracized like lepers but unlike lepers they are refused medical treatment i talked to a man in new york who told me he was refused admission to four different hospitals when he was suffering from acute serum hepatitis because he had needle tracks on his arms whatever socalled treatment available until very recent years has been a monopoly of the psychiatric establishment which now has a big stake in its obviouslv false theories o of addiction but patients are a necessary evil if you want to get grants and so the psychiatric establishment clings desperatelv to its besieged positions essentially they blame the victimthe usual pastime in our societyby denying the physiological basis for addiction claiming that addicts choose to use drugs and can choose to give them up elaborate and very expensive hospitals and detention centers are set up sadistic group therapy sessions are indulged in to cure the socalled addictive personality the victims are supposed to beg the psychiatric establishment long and hard for treatment to prove how motivated they are thats supposed to be therapeutic and when the treatment fails the doctors blame the patients and change the patients instead of the treatment there is a very effective medical treatment for heroin addiction it  is safe very inexpensive and widely applicable so far this treatment has been made available to relatively few addicts not for medical reasons but because only a few private doctors have begun to treat addicts the treatment involves substituting methadone taken once a day orally for heroin methadone is a synthetic narcotic it allows the addict to function normally it is not debilitating like heroin the dosage does not have to be escalated it does not produce euphoria it simply represses withdrawal symptoms and drug craving it costs about  cents a day the treatment was developed by dr marie nyswander a psychiatrist and dr vincent dole a biochemist a husband and wife team at rockefeller university in new york dr nvswander after many years attempting to treat addicts at the united states public health hospital in lexington kentucky concluded that psychiatry was irrelevant to the problem and that heroin addiction is basicallv a metabolic disease there are nearly  patients in the program which is now supported by the state and city of new york dr nyswander found that the socalled addictive personality disappears when the drug cravings are satisfied and concludes that heroin addiction is not psychogenic but results when drugs are made available to large numbers of adolescents normal adolescent curiosity would prompt experimentation and physiological predisposition would make addiction inevitable for many of these youngsters the black community has had to face the problem of availability of drugs for many years the problem is somewhat more recent in middle class white communities although there are methadone programs in a number of states there is no such program in michigan i am interested in contacting people especially medical doctors who are willing to initiate treatment either in their private practice or through an institutional framework it is often said that street addicts are very hard to get to know ive found that on the contrary its easy all you have to do is treat them like they are human this is such a unique experience for them that they are shocked into a trusting relationship it may sound strange but my faith in humanity was restored by getting to know street addicts who live by theft and prostitution in spite of the frightful degradation of their lives their desperation their helplessness they go on living maintain a wide margin of decency and a great deal of compassion for each other when i ask myself if i believe that i could survive physically or morally under those conditions my answer is no when i was studying the methadone program in new york i talked to and listened to the conversations of several patients on the program some of them had started methadone maintenance treatment in jail they were speculating about why there was a twoyear waiting list to get methadone treatment one patient said they cant open it up to everyone because if they did seven out of the eight floors at the tombs a large prison in new york would be empty and the wardens would lose their jobs i believe that this profound insightful statement says more than all the thousands and thousands of words in the riot commission report a year after the great detroit uprising we see one new building going up on the skyline of detroit it is an extension to the jail the only other major construction projects noticeable are more expressways to get out of town on and so beyond all the rhetoric it is obvious what the power structure has faith in not a word is required just look at the detroit skyline and during the merciful silence perhaps a few people will have enough courage to perceive our nation the way it really is and enough love for and faith in our nation to try to change it
dr kwame nkrumah the first african leader to win independence for his people in our time has written a new book handbook of revolutionary warfare international  paperback like everything written by nkrumah ever since the declaration to the colonial peoples adopted by the  panafrican congress held in england this book is a call to colonial peoples to unite themselves for the struggle against imperialism and colonialism this latest publication is particularly significant however because it represents the reflections and projections of an african leader who having ruled an independent african state the nation of ghana for nine years was then deposed by a combination of internal and external neocolonialist forces kwame nkrumah has felt the harshest blows that the imoerialist enemy can deal but these have only made him more determined to fight this fact itself gives us an insight into the revolutionary spirit of the man a spirit which is continually reinforced by his scientific analvsis of the period in which we live nkrumah is always mindful that we are living in a period of worldwide revolution and counterrevolution and that revolution is not a matter of a single day or a single battle but entails a long struggle in the course of which setbacks and retreats are inevitable it is this tenacitv of spirit and consciousness of worldwide revolution and counterrevolution backed up by continuing scientific evaluation of the movement which distinguishes such great revolutionary geniuses of our period as mao tse tung fidel castro and ho chi minh from the moment that nkrumah became president of independent ghana in march  he made clear that independence for ghana was only the beginning african nationalism had now been established in the gold coastthe new ghana he wrote in his autobiography published on the eve of his inauguration from now on it must be panafrican nationalism    our task is not done and our own safety is not assured until the last vestiges of colonialism have been swept from africa in the declaration of fundamental principles adopted by the new nation ghana explicitly offered to surrender its hardwon sovereignity in order to further the development of a union of african states in april  only one year after the celebration of independence nkrumah called together an allafrican conference of independent african states to pledge themselves to the eradication of colonialism on the continent freedom fighters from all over africa among them patrice lumumba found in ghana the political organizational and material resources to fortify them for liberation struggles in every african colony from south africa to algeria and from kenya to the congo when the french imperialists retaliated against guinea for its decision to leave the french union by destroying everything and anything from railroad ties to light bulbs that the guinea people might be able to use to develop their country nkrumah responded by sending millions of dollars in aid and ghana and the republic of guinea united to form the nucleus for a union of african states thus in action and not just in words kwame nkrumah in power dedicated all the resources he could muster to the cause of panafrican unity and the continental struggle against colonialism no wonder therefore that to this day the leaders of such progressive african nations as guinea tanzania and zambia refuse to recognize the counterrevolutionary military regime which now claims to rule in ghana the recent political history of africa can be divided into two main phases which obi b egbuna president of the universal coloured peoples association the british black_power organization has called bg and ag meaning before the emergence of ghana and after the emergence of ghana respectively frightened by the specter of ghana independence the british french and belgian imperialists devised a new strategy of giving political independence to other african nations after a period of negotiation to ensure their continued dependence upon the mother country as a result in the s dozens of other african nations have celebrated their independence each enjoying all the trappings of sovereignty in the form of black presidents black parliaments black judges and black policemen but in most cases as the handbook makes clear this independence is only a sham independence since economic power remains in the hands of international finance capital and each nation is too small to be much more than a supply depot to these international corporations legally and politically these nations have sovereignty and independence but in fact they are dependent neocolonialism has taken the place of naked colonialism all over africa these independent nations continue to struggle on each one separately in a pathetic and hopeless attempt to make progress while the real obstacle to their development imperalism mainly in its neocolonialist stage is operating on a panafrican scale before the african people can defeat neocolonialism they must rid their minds of the geopolitical map of africa which the imperialists drew up at the berlin conference of  in place of this map with its little red green blue and yellow pieces each representing a sphere of influence carved out by the various imperialist powers for their own purposes african freedom fighters must substitute a new panafrican map based on the conception of the armed struggle which is now necessary to liberate the entire continent of africa on this liberation map there are only three kinds of territories liberated areas contested areas and enemyheld areas liberated areas are those which having achieved some political independence through the mobilization of the masses make themselves into a base or beachhead for advancing the liberation of other areas which are contested or under enemy control contested areas are those ruled by weak puppet governments and where the revolutionary forces are wellorganized and so close to seizing power that the government is only superficially in command enemvheld areas  are those like south africa where the police state nkrumah stresses the need to clarify the goals of the revolution the nationalist phase is a necessary step in the liberation struggle but must never be regarded as the final solution to the problem raised by the economic and political exploitation of our peoples he points out the danger of unity for the sake of unity in fact the oau organization of african unity is in danger of developing into a useful cover for the continued sterile action of conflicting interests the only difference being that in the context of one big brotherly organization reactionary tactics are camouflaged and applied through all the subtleties of negotiation he calls for a political party  linking all liberated territories and struggling parties under a common ideology he insists on the equality of women women may join the training centers on the same basis as  men and be eligible for the same responsibilities and authority in this period when the black movement in the united states is searching for clarity and direction it  can derive inspiration and guidance from an african leader who at every stage of his political development has made public the principles by which he has guided his actions james boggs
undoubtedly one of the most dramatic events to occur within the last few years has been the emergence of the black_panther party as a moving force within american society the black_panther party as is generally known was founded in oakland in  by huey p newton and bobby seale the oakland panthers derived their name from the black_panther party that was organized in lowndes county alabama by the students nonviolent coordinating committee sncc the purpose of the sncccreated black_panther party was to challenge the legitimacy of the racist political structure in lowndes county this was to be the first programmatic expression of the ideal of black_power as defined by sncc using the black_panther party as its vehicle sncc confined itself to educating and organizing the disenfranchised blacks in lowndes to the importance of the vote in the local primary election in  sncc unsuccessfully ran an entire slate of black candidates in opposition to the democratic partys lilywhte slate of candidates obviously influenced by these developments newton and seale felt that a similar operation was needed in the urban ghettos of the north the major distinction however was that they saw the need to organize black people around the issues of selfdefense and police brutality rather the vote as a result the black_panthers have now progressed to the place where they emphasize a total workers revolution in america rather than the simple acquisition of group political power in limited area where blacks happen to be in the ma jority as the panthers view it it i no longer a question of reforming th democratic or republican party or of creating a few more jobs in the major corporations for qualified blacks but of completely liberating black people from the racist oppression and economic exploitation ink herent in the american system this light it was only a matter of time before the inevitable revealing in side expose of the panthers was written gene marine senior editor of ramparts magazine has undertaken this task in his work plainly titled the black_panthers bantam  marine has sought to capture in print the flavor of the panthers cataclysmic impact on the contemporary american scene marine somewhat apologetically reminds the reader in the beginning of the book that he is a white man seeking along with the rest of white america to learn just what makes these young outspoken black jacketed young black men and women tick as marine puts it i try to be sympathetic to anything i want to understand and write about but the more i work on the subject the more i know that sympathy is not my primary feeling deep in my white possibly racist probably unrevolutionary heart i am afraid of the black_panther party it is fairly certain that the black_panthers will not provide these readers who think of themselves as politically aware with any new facts or insights into the workings of the panthers marine though does present a systematic and concise recount of the panthers past activities the author step by step details the important events in which the panthers have been involved he also gives a wellbalanced look at the personalities involved such as newton seale and eldridge cleaver who the general public has come to intimately associate with the panthers marine however while honestly trying to state the panther case has not attempted to probe at any depth the ideological currents that have produced an organization like the panthers he also does not adequately discuss such questions as what are the historical precedents for the establishment of such a group what are the implications of revolutionary black nationalism as opposed to black cultural nationalism what are the main theoretical distinctions between the panthers and other supposedly militant groups such as core and the nation of islam do the panthers genuinely represent the feelings of the black masses in addition to these questions there are of course many other aspects to the panthers that marine has neglected to touch upon marine as the typical groping white radical cannot really be blamed for any of the books shortcomings in these areas he is white it is difficult if not impossible for a white man any white man no matter how sympathetic to the black struggle or how radical he may profess to be to really understand the complex aspirations of black america the problem for the white writer is doubly compounded when one adds to this scheme the ingredient of a black group that talks and acts as if it hates every value and institution in american society the problem here is even more confused when one considers the myriad of lies and distortions that the racistcontrolled mass media has foisted on the american public about the panthers not to mention those other groups that are demanding basic changes in the american social order little by little though the word is slowly getting out to the masses of people that they too are being victimized by a corrupt and repressive system the black_panthers if nothing else is a positive contribution to those forces that are trying to clear the obstacles blocking the path to black liberation for this reason alone i recommend for those trying to grasp the meaning of present day events that the black_panthers be checked out for as cleaver has warned if youre not part of the solution youre part of the problem earl

when i think of the w home town of my youth all that i seem to remember is dust the brown crumbly dust of late summerarid sterile dust that gets into the eyes and makes them water gets into the throat and between the toes of bare brown feet i dont know why i should remember only the dust surely there must have been lush green lawns and paved streets under leafy shade trees somewhere in town but memory is an abstract paintingit does not present things as they are but rather as they feel and so when i think of that time and that place i remember only the dry september of the dirt roads and grassless yards of the shantytown where i lived and one other thing i remember another incongruency of memorya brilliant splash of sunny yellow against the dustmiss lotties marigolds whenever the memory of those marigolds flashes across my mind a strange nostalgia comes with it and remains long after the picture has faded i feel again the chaotic emotions of adolescence illusive as smoke yet as real as the potted geranium before me now joy and rage and wild animal gladness and shame become tangled together in the multicolored skein of goingon as i recall that devastating moment when i was suddenly more woman than child years ago in miss lotties yard i think of those marigolds at the strangest times i remember them vividly now as i desperately pass away the time waiting for you who will not come i suppose that futile waiting was the sorrowful background music of our impoverished little community when i was young the depression that gripped the nation was no new thing to us for the black workers of rural maryland had always been depressed i dont know what it was that we were waiting for certainly not for the prosperity that was just around the corner for those were white folks words which we never believed nor did we wait for hard work and thrift to pay off in shining success as the american dream promised for we knew better than that too perhaps we waited for a miracle amorphous in concept but necessary if one were to have the grit to rise before dawn each day and labor in the white mans vineyard until after dark or to wander about in the september dust offering ones sweat in return for some meager share of bread but god was chary with miracles in those davs and so we waitedand waited we children of course were only vaguely aware of the extent of our poverty having no radios few newspapers and no magazines we were somewhat unaware of the world outside our community nowadays we would be called culturally deprived and people would write books and hold conferences about us in those days everybody we knew was just as hungry and illclad as we were poverty was the cage in which we all were trapped and our hatred of it was still the vague undirected restlessness of the zoobred flamingo who knows that nature created him to fly free as  think of those days i feel most poignantly the tagend of summer the bright dry times when we began to have a sense of shortening days and the imminence of the cold by the time i was  my brother joey and i were the only children left at our house the older ones having left home for early marriage or the lure of the city and the two babies having been sent to relatives who might care for them better than we joey was three years younger than i and a boy and therefore vastly inferior each morning our mother and father trudged wearily down the dirt road and around the bend she to her domestic job he to his daily unsuccessful quest for work after our few chores around the tumbledown shanty joey and i were free to run wild in the sun with other children similarly situated for the most part those days are illdefined in my memory running together and combining like a fresh watercolor painting left out in the rain i remember squatting in the road drawing a picture in the dust a picture which joey gleefully erased with one sweep of his dirty foot i remember fishing for minnows in a muddy creek and watching sadly as they eluded my cupped hands while joey laughed uproariously and  remember that year a strange restlessness of body and of spirit a feeling that something old and familiar was ending and something unknown and therefore terrifying was beginning one day returns to me with special clarity for some reason perhaps because it was the beginning of the experience that in some inexplicable way marked the end of innocence i was loafing under the great oak tree in our yard deep in some reverie which i have now forgotten except that it involved some secret secret thoughts of one of the harris boys across the yard joey and a bunch of kids were bored now with the old tire suspended from an oak limb which had kept them entertained for awhile hey lizabeth joey yelled he never talked when he could yell hey lizabeth lets go somewhere i came reluctantly from my private world where you want to go what you want to do the truth was that we were becoming tired of the formlessness of our summer days the idleness whose prospect had seemed so beautiful during the busy days of spring now had degenerated to an almost desperate effort to fill up the empty midday hours lets go see can we find some locusts on the hill someone suggested  joey was scornful aint no more locusts there yall got em all while they was still green the argument that followed was brief and not really worth the effort hunting locust trees wasnt fun any more by now tell you what said joey finally his eyes sparkling lets go over to miss lotties the idea caught on at once for annoying miss lottie was always fun i was still child enough to scamper along with the group over rickety fences and through bushes that tore our already raggedy clothes back to where miss lottie lived i think now that we must have made a tragicomic spectacle five or six kids of different ages each of us clad in only one garmentthe girls in faded dresses that were too long or too short the boys in patchy pants their sweaty brown chests gleaming in the hot sun a little cloud of dust followed our thin legs and bare feet as we tramped over the barren land when miss lotties house came into view we stopped ostensibly to plan our strategy but actually to reinforce our courage miss lotties house was the most ramshackle of all our ramshackle homes the sun and rain had long since faded its rickety frame siding from white to a sullen gray the boards themselves seemed to remain upright not from being nailed together but rather from leaning together like a house that a child might have constructed from cardsa brisk wind might have blown it down and the fact that it was still standing implied a kind of enchantment that was stronger than the elements there it stood and as far as i know is standing yet a gray rotting thing with no porch no shutters no steps set on a cramped lot with no grass not even any weedsa monument to decay in front of the house in a squeaky rocking chair sat miss lotties son john burke completing the impression of decay john burke was what was known as ¦queerheaded black and ageless he sat rocking day in and day out in a mindless stupor lulled by the monotonous squeaksquawk of the chair a battered hat atop his shaggy head shaded him from the sun usually john burke was totally unaware of everything outside his quiet dream world but if you disturbed him if you intruded upon his fantasies he would become enraged strike out at you and curse at you in some strange enchanted language which only he could understand we children made a game of thinking of ways to disturb john burke and then to elude his violent retribution but our real fun and our real fear lay in miss lottie herself miss lottie seemed to be at least a hundred years old her big frame still held traces of the tall powerful woman she must have been in youth although it was now bent and drawn her smooth skin was a dark reddishbrown and her face had indianlike features and the stern stoicism that one associates with indian faces miss lottie didnt like intruders either especially children she never left her yard and nobody ever visited her we never knew how she managed those necessities which depend on human interactionhow she ate for example or even whether she ate when we were tiny children we thought miss lottie was a witch and we made up tales that we half believed ourselves about her exploits we were far too sophisticated now of course to believe the witchnonsense but old fears have a way of clinging like cobwebs and so when we sighted the tumbledown shack we had to stop to reinforce our nerves look there she is i whispered forgetting that miss lottie could not possibly have heard me from that distance shes fooling with them crazy flowers yeh look at er miss lotties marigolds were perhaps the strangest part of the picture certainly they did not fit in with the crumbling decay of the rest of her yard beyond the dusty brown yard in front of the sorry gray house rose suddenly and shockingly a dazzling strip of bright blossoms clumped together in enormous mounds warm and passionate and sungolden the old black witchwoman worked on them all summer every summer down on her creaky knees weeding and cultivating and arranging while the house crumbled and john burke rocked for some perverse reason we children hated those marigolds they interfered with the perfect ugliness of the place they were too beautiful they said too much that we could not understand they did not make sense there was something in the vigor with which the old woman destroyed the weeds that intimidated us it should have been a comical sightthe old woman with the mans hat on her cropped white head leaning over the bright mounds her big backside in the airbut it wasnt comical it was something we could not name we had to annoy her by whizzing a pebble into her flowers or by yelling a dirty word then dancing away from her rage revelling in our youth and mocking her age actually i think it was the flowers we wanted to destroy but nobody had the nerve to try it not even joey who was usually fool enough to try anything yall git some stones commanded joey now and was met with instant giggling obedience as everyone except me began to gather pebbles from the dusty ground come on lizabeth i just stood there peering through the bushes torn between  wanting to join the fun and feeling that it was all a bit silly you scared lizabeth i cursed and spat on the ground my favorite gesture of phony bravado yall children get the stones ill show you how to use em i said before that we children were not consciously aware of how thick were the bars of our cage i wonder now though whether we were not more aware of it than i thought perhaps we had some dim notion of what we were and how little chance we had of being anything else otherwise why would we have been so preoccupied with destruction anyway the pebbles were collected quickly and everybody looked at me to begin the fun come on yall we crept to the edge of the bushes that bordered the narrow road in front of miss lotties place she was working placidly kneeling over the llowers her dark hand plunged into the golden mound suddenly zingan expertlyaimed stone cut the head off one of the blossoms who out there miss lotties backside came down and her head came up as her sharp eyes searched the bushes you better git we had crouched down out of sight in the bushes where we stifled the giggles that insisted on coming miss lottie gazed warily across the road for a moment then cautiously returned to her weeding zing joey sent a pebble into the blooms and another marigold was beheaded miss lottie was enraged now she began struggling to her feet leaning on a rickety cane and shouting yall git go on home then the rest of the kids let loose with their pebbles storming the flowers and laughing wildly and  senselessly at miss lotties impotent rage she shook her stick at us and started shakily toward the road crying black bastards git long john burke john burke »come help then i lost my head entirely mad with the power of inciting  such rage and ran out of the bushes in the storm of pebbles  straight toward miss lottie chanting madly old witch fell in a  ditch picked up a penny and thought she was rich the children screamed with delight dropped their pebbles and joined the crazy dance swarming around miss lottie like bees and chanting old lady witch while she screamed curses at us the madness lasted only a moment for john burke startled at last  lurched out of his chair and we dashed for the bushes just as miss  lotties cane went whizzing at my  head i did not join the merriment when the kids gathered again under the oak in our bare yard suddenly i was ashamed and i did not like being ashamed the child in me sulked and said it was all in fun but the woman in me flinched at the thought of the malicious attack that i had led the mood lasted all afternoon when we ate the beans and rice that was supper that night i did not notice my fathers silence for he was always silent these days nor did i notice my mothers absence for she always worked until well into evening joey and i had a particularly bitter argument after supper his exuberance got on my nerves finally i stretched out upon the palette in the room we shared and fell into a fitful doze when i awoke somewhere in the middle of the night my mother had returned and i vaguely listened to the conversation that was audible through the thin walls that separated our rooms at first i heard no words only voices my mothers voice was like a cool dark room in summerpeaceful soothing quiet i loved to listen to it it made things seem alright somehow but my fathers voice cut through hers shattering the peace twentytwo years maybelle  years he was saying and i got nothing for you nothing nothing its all right honey youll get something everybodys out of work now you know that it aint right aint no man ought to eat his womans food year in and year out and see his children running wild aint nothing right about that honey you took good care of us when you had it aint nobody got nothing nowadays i aint talking about nobody else im talking about me god knows i try my mother said something i could not hear and my father cried out louder what must a man do tell me that look we aint starving i git paid every week and mrs ellis is real nice about giving me things shes gonna let me have mr ellis old coat for you this winter god damn mr ellis coat and god damn his money you think i want white folks leavings god damn maybelleand suddenly he sobbed loudly and painfully and cried helplessly and hopelessly in the dark night i had never heard a man cry before i did not know men ever cried i covered my ears with my hands but could not cut off the sound of my fathers harsh painful despairing sobs my father was a strong man who would whisk a child upon his shoulders and go singing through the house my father whittled toys for us and laughed so loud that the great oak seemed to laugh with him and taught us how to fish and hunt rabbits how could it be that my father was crying but the sobs went on unstifled finally quieting until i could hear my mothers voice deep and rich humming softly as she used to hum to a frightened child the world had lost its boundary lines my mother who was small and soft was now the strength of the family my father who was the rock on which the family had been built was sobbing like the tiniest child everything was suddenly out  of tune like a broken accordion where did i fit into this crazy picture i do not now remember my thoughts only a feeling of great bewilderment and fear long after the sobbing and the humming had stopped  lay on the palette still as stone with my hands over my ears wishing that  too could cry and be comforted the night was silent now except for the sound of the crickets and of joeys soft breathing but the room was too crowded with fear to allow me to sleep and finally feeling the terrible aloneness of  am i decided to awaken joey ouch whats the matter with you what you want he demanded disagreeably when i had pinched and slapped him awake come on wake up what for go way i was lost for a reasonable reply i could not say im scared and i dont want to be alone so i merely said im going out if you want to come come on the promise of adventure awoke him going out now where to lizabeth what you going to do i was pulling my dress over my head until now i had not thought of going out just come on i replied tersely i was out the window and halfway down the road before joey caught up with me wait lizabeth where you going i was running as if the furies were after me as perhaps they wererunning silently and furiously until i came to where i had halfknown i was headed to miss lotties yard the halfdawn light was more eerie than complete darkness and in it the old house was like the ruin that my world had becomefoul and crumbling a grotesque caricature it looked haunted but i was not afraid because i was haunted too lizabeth you lost your mind panted joey i had indeed lost my mind for all the smoldering emotions of that summer swelled in me and burst the great need for my mother who was never there the hopelessness of our poverty and degradation the bewilderment of being neither child nor woman and yet both at once the fear unleashed by my fathers tears and these feelings combined in one great impulse toward destruction lizabeth i leaped furiously into the mounds of marigolds and pulled madly trampling and pulling and destroying the perfect yellow blooms the fresh smell of early morning and of dewsoaked marigolds spurred me on as i went tearing and mangling and sobbing while joey tugged my dress or my waist crying lizabeth stop please stop and then i was sitting in the ruined little garden among the uprooted and ruined flowers crying and crying and it was too late to undo what i had done joey was sitting beside me silent and frightened not knowing what to say then lizabeth look i opened my swollen eyes and saw in front of me a pair of large calloused feet my gaze lifted to the swollen legs the agedistorted body clad in a tight cotton night dress and then the shadowed indian face surrounded by stubby white hair and there was no rage in the face now now that the garden was destroyed and there was nothing any longer to be protected mmiss lottie i scrambled to my feet and just stood there and stared at her and that was the moment when childhood faded and womanhood began that violent crazy act was the last act of childhood for as i gazed at the immobile face with the sad weary eyes i gazed upon a kind of reality which is hidden to childhood the witch was no longer a witch but only a broken old woman who had dared to create beauty in the midst of ugliness and sterility she had been born in squalor and lived in it all her life now at the end of that life she had nothing except a fallingdown hut a wrecked body and john burke the mindless son of her passion whatever verve there was left in her whatever was of love and beauty and joy that had not been squeezed out by life had been there in the marigolds she had so tenderly cared for of course i could not express the things that i knew about miss lottie as i stood there awkward and ashamed the years have put words to the things i knew in that moment and as i look back upon it i know that that moment marked the end of innocence people think of the loss of innocence as meaning the loss of virginity but this is far from true innocence involves an unseeing acceptance of things at face value an ignorance of the area below the surface in that humiliating moment i looked beyond myself and into the depths of another person this was the beginning of compassion and one cannot have both compassion and innocence the years have taken me worlds away from that time and that place from the dust and squalor of our lives and from the bright thing that i destroyed in a blind childish striking out at godknowswhat miss lottie died long ago and many years have passed since  last saw her hut completely barren at last for despite my wild contrition she never planted marigolds again yet there are times when the image of those passionate yellow mounds returns with a painful poignancy for one does not have to be ignorant and poor to find that his life

the blue dream  np  it was raining and he  ii  stood in the middle of   the cemetery with a tablet and pencil recording names and dates from tombstones he splashed through mudholes and puddles peering into the darkness finally he saw a city of light and walked there he was standing in a crowded night club an orchestra blared and laughter rose in the smoky spaciousness of the highceilinged room all the people were orientallooking the women wore red chinese dresses and the men wore black flowing robes he walked among the cluttered tables searching for his mothers face at the back of the room he came to a small dimlylit bar there were six bar stools all unoccupied his grandmother stood behind the bar grinning toothlessly and wiping a crystal goblet he sat down the old woman placed a clean towel on the bar before him and then she reached under the bar and brought forth a golden machete she gave the machete to him he wept  he was a small boy again a brown lamb child with a rainbow mind

shoved into a corner his mother took his arm and led him to the door opening the door she pointed out into the black night and said little nigger get out of here he was sitting in the front pew of the church everyone was singing precious lord the pulpit was made of gold the preacher rose and stepped forward to the pulpit the singing stopped as the preacher started to pray one of the deacons started to chant the spiritual leaning on the everlasting anns other voices joined in the singing the slowly increasing rhythm of the singing began to move him and he started to sway from side to side and hum all his fears vanished and he felt joyous and deliriously happy he ran forward and fell before the pulpit crying loudly i repent i repent the singing stopped the preacher stopped praying the room became quiet as he rose and turned to see the congregation stand up the people wore halloween masks and stood mute and frozen he held out his arms to them speechless and silently imploring their forgiveness he was naked and standing before the electric chair which was painted orange the death chamber was pale and empty but above him in the gallery sat all the oriental people from the night club they rose en masse pointing to him and screaming kill kill he stepped up on the small platform and sat down a hooded figure came forward and adjusted straps and buckles around his arms and legs the room turned blue then purple then blue again and finally blackness came he needs these rotten monotonous days he must never forget them must never forget the pain the silent aching pain of black life in the slums he must never forget the hunger and the shame his suffering must not be unlike the suffering of his slave ancestors his anguish must now give birth to beauty and pride kill him crack his black skull is he no less the man for all his faults and highyellow skin than his african forebears is he less a man than the white rapists who stole down into the slave compounds through midnight shadows to brew the wide spectrum of bastard offspring destroy his family unit hide his history much of it is your own history your violence is manifested in his behavior for you are he and he is you the pnk dream the city is rosy pink from the moons midnight glow a running man sprints across an empty street stopping before the ywca entering the building he dashes into the girls dormitory and with a gleaming machete disembowels a sleeping virgin clutching the girls bleeding heart he runs out through a rear door and melts into the jungle as he lopes through the sweltering jungle foliage african drums resound in the night locusts cling to his damp black back and murmuring watusi children shout simba simba as they dance around his fallen gasping body he crawls to the witch doctors hut still clutching the bloody heart the traffic light dances up and down and noises from the traffic stream echo his airy dreams he leaps aboard the clanking trolley car vibrating from shinbone to shoulder he angles his tall frame into the hardbacked seat beside the pinkcheeked white girl whose muskscented perfume invades his breathing he fulfills his need to be punished and says hello white girl she is dollfaced with a button nose and from her poreclain ears hang jade earrings her ruths curls thick and electric frame her blue eyes which dart birdquick and fearful in curious captivity his nearness his black male nearness rasps on her dainty awareness he forces her into conversation flushed with an urge to be hated daring her refusal needing her disdain and contempt her tender neck blushes red as she smiles heroically opening the closed areas of her face she becomes a beautiful black girl stamping her tiny foot she screams for attentiona pregnant sheba in a tenement trap she turns white again her face pinched and hard from too many orgasms she shouts get the torah get the book he does not answer staring into his empty wine glass seeing the bizarre mau mau rites the senseless assassinations and the quizzical look on his mothers face the pregnant blackwhite girl strides toward him raising her skirt certain of her feminine magnetism he falls to his knees the room becomes a cathedral a smil ing priest touches his shoulder and blesses him the christ statue is a black christ as it smiles down from the rood strains of ave maria drone softly and shafts of sunlight crisscross the rooms quietness  he counts the shadows that loom across the empty lonely room quiet earlymorning hours fill the hourglass slowly and sleep will not come to him above him in another tenement flat a strident voice cries out from the terror of nightmare and frustration he turns to his small radio jiggles the red dial searching for a connection with the real world hunger and need make a poet of him oh pauline where are you baby how long must i yearn for your soft embrace i am a wounded tiger trapped and caught in steel and concrete ripped open and bleeding in the darkness i need you now as i fight my way through these murky corridors i need to touch your breasts your lips you are my invisible venus lost somewhere in the streets waiting to be slain by the ticktock beat of blues and rainyday sadness     the death dream running from dark shadows in san francisco he stopped and kissed an old flower woman bought roses from her and ran across the golden gate bridge shot and bleeding as he ran he shouted im guilty guilty do you hear save me save me the old woman saintly in her ancient sadness wiped away his blood and made the sicn of the cross she gathered up her flower box and moved on into the stygian night he framed his tearstreaked face against the windowpane rubbed his swollen wounds and heard the plaintive wail of a crapshooter bet i hit somebody fade me he heard the peal of cathedral bells calling the faithful to worship the sleeping girl naked and lying facedown on his bed groaned and murmured as wispy shadows weaved dark patterns about the room he looked down at her exposed flanks curved and symmetrical and they reminded him of the bomb restins somewhere in a silo threatening the unborn future while furtive dynamiters were creeping into black churches to spew their death and ignorance across the face of the world he stumbled into the small kitchen and slumped down at the table he started to write on a note pad he felt a thundering pumping in his veins eyes apop he felt himself soaring into a glittering humming nothingness he felt himself reaching high for a soft kiss from eternity the naked girl padded into the kitchen to find him slumped across the table he had written two lines on a tablet the girl picked up the note pad and read dear world light a firecracker and explode your fears lets all go to mississippi and vote for albion midnight we

in front of his mothers house was red bright red and shining with the baked redness of autumn trees lined each side of the street but they seemed suspendedfloating above the flowers and shrubbery of the square neat lawns a brilliant orange sun sped across the noonday sky moving easttowest and westtosouth never still his shadow danced around him as he ran stumbling down the street shouting father father he sat crosslegged in the basement wine bottle in hand his blind friend howard reclined on the linoleum carpet humming the blues and scratching himself the house shuddered violently and split open they floated above the shifting scene giddily reaching for the flying debris his mother ran across the undulating lawn calling to them he sat in the last pew over the heads of weeping mourners he could see a bier surrounded by flowers many of which were limpid and bloodstained canada lee stood in the pulpit reciting elegy written in a country churchyard an invisible choir sang a dirge as two nude african girls appeared at his side and escorted him down the aisle to the coffin he looked into the coffin and saw himself he screamed as he gazed down at the lifeless man lying in the lush grey casket the death figure was dressed in african ceremonial robes and a shrunken chrysanthemum was clasped in its lifeless hand a howling chinaman draped in a torn white sheet and hood crashed through a stained glass window he was shouting dirty communists rotten anarchists people screamed and fell to their knees as the death figure floated up from the coffin slowly as he  watched himself float above

with a high mirrored ceiling the windows extend from the ceiling to floor each bordered with gold and white drapes the walls are white and their roundness gives him an odd feeling of shifting dimensions in the middle of the room is a large white round bed upon which lies a young nude black woman she is lying on her back breathing rhythmically with her arms flung akimbo she turns over and her dark muscular form is in stark contrast with the rooms brightness there is no other furniture the windows seem sealed how did he enter he walks around slowly watching the nude woman she stirs looks at him and smiles he stares up into the mirrored ceiling and sees her body reflectedbut not himself he searches the mirror for sight of his own image as desire creeps down into his loins he yells where am i wheres my reflection he claws at the air seeking some tangible reason for his absence in the mirror seeking acknowledgement of his existence the voluptuous black female roots herself in the middle of the round bed crooning softly sweetie you didnt make it you just didnt make it he rips away his clothing tearing it wildly from his body naked he stands with arms outstretched staring up into the ceiling he sees only the woman he turns to face her wanting her to see him to see his maleness and rising desire to realize the reality of his presence he leaps upon the bed prepared to drive her mocking laughter from the room as he reaches out to grab her the room darkens and she becomes a large green and yellow boa constrictor the snake begins to weave its head hypnotically he throws himself backward choked with fear he feels himself caught and gripped in the hands of his mother and father who shove him forward into the coiling grip of the serpent he croaks in wordless terror as he is enveloped within the icy coils which slide and move smoothly around his body from somewhere outside the room he hears the tinkle of glasses and sounds of people laughing and talking as the coils tighten nausea boils up in his throat darkness descends he is alone and shivering the bed is empty the room has become glowing red the ceiling is now transparent exposing a clear blue sky spotted with occasional fluffy clouds he crawls to the edge of the bed and finds himself hovering over the edge of an exploding world
with the burgeoning of v unct  black studies courses  vv a all over the country thanks to the forceful and resourceful efforts of the black community there comes a need to assess and place the works of the black writers of immediate concern is the evaluation of those works now in paperback which are or will be of particular use to school and university teachers one of these is the novel beetlecreek by william demby now in paperback from avon books   already we have had an assessment of the novel by robert bone in his the negro novel ii a merica rev ed new haven yale university press  i would tend to disagree with this critics overemphasis on the existentialist nature of this interesting work and instead i would like to stress its human content biographical details supplied by bone p  have some bearing on the novel william demby was born in clarksburg west virginia in the heart of the mining region which provides the setting for beetlecreek his education at west virginia state college was interrupted by two years of army service in italy on his return he was able to finish his degree at fisk university thanks to the gi bill he graduated in  being interested in art as well as literature he returned to italy to study at the school of art at the university of rome where he has remained to write screen plays for roberto rosellini his recent novel the catacombs new york random house  strikes one as reminiscent of the fellini world of roman society of deeper significance dembys creative writing contributions to the fisk herald while at the university have a cosmopolitan strongly gi antifascist flavor for example in an undergraduate story published in december  and called saint joey a white teenage gang led by a religious fanatic decided to murder an old recluse who has upset the racial mores of the community the antecedents of beetlecreek are obvious in beetlecreek the gang becomes a negro one the old recluse turns into bill trapp a white living on the edge of a negro community the nightriders which the visiting pittsburgh youngster johnny joins is fascist in its fanaticism and sadism and has sufficient motive force to make johnny turn from his new friend bill only to return as a crafty enemy while understanding the relations between the life and the art of demby robert bone overstresses the existentialist core of beetlecreek judging by his criticism the novel is an elaborate framework for the main characters to ask themselves the question what do i want of life and then because they have no positive goals the attempts at assertion following the questioning lead only to their own destruction without doubt this kind of patterning is apparent in the story but ones interest is absorbed far more by the unusual situation of white recluse bill trapp living as the white minority in a negro settlement and more especially by the very human way in which the recluse tries to break through the barriers a lifetime had erected and which kept him aloof from human companionship in the last analysis beetlecreek is a human document not an existentialist one to substantiate this last point one may first assemble the existentialist evidence of robert bone p  and then show how the novel goes beyond this philosophical base in its impact at the beginning of the novel bone explains bill trapp terminates  years of solitude and thus displays the celebrated courage to be of french existentialism set against this striving for life is the deathliness of the beetlecreek community conveyed through the barbershop crowd narrowness and defeatism the funeral scene shallowness and hypocrisy the persecution of bill trapp cruelty the community is a ghost town in a more profound sense than its having exhausted its coal deposit for bone the plot itself revolves around the frustrated negro artist david with whom john is staying the boy is meant to be only a shadow of his host although it is hard to see how this description fits one so lifelike continuing the existentialist explanation bone shows that david is trying to break out of the stagnation of beetlecreek by attaching himself to a childhood sweetheart who is visiting the town but she has the death kiss of the big city upon her for a moment he makes the right choice by supporting bill trapp against the prejudices of the community but he gives in before the mass hysteria of the other townsfolk john who has left his sick mother in pittsburgh is lonely like david but one feels that bone is overstressing the likeness when he equates the adult loneliness of david with that of the boy john also supports bill trapp until he later betrays him under pressure from the nightriders gang the similarity with davids betrayal seems merely situational unless one wants to fit everything into an existential framework bones summing up of the affinities between the two cases seems farfetched in the light of the evidence he states it is true the existentialist definition of evil above all of david and johnny who suffer their creative powers to be perverted rather than endure a spiritual vacuum p  but the boys humanity is being squeezed out by bones cerebral interpretation not by the actual story for instead of being an existential cutout johnny appears in the story as a very real human being  in order to put the philosophical base in the background where it belongs one should note the evidence in beetlecreek that makes it stand as an ordinary story without the props of existentialism the picture of the old recluse at the start trying to open the chrysalis of solitude is not overpainted nor superficially rendered always when he looked in the mirror his eyes were different sometimes they peered from out of the broken glass asking an unanswerable question sometimes they were angry and damning sometimes they were sullen and brooding too often they were the eyes of a dead man jellied and blank william demby beetlecreek new york rinehart  co  p  when johnny johnson invades the loneliness of may farm the old man is spurred on to companionship he ran to the mirror and looked at himself he tried to smile for years and years he hadnt washed his teeth he found a broken piece of comb and tried to do something with his hair he was conscious of a change of life in him a change that seemed to have come suddenly but he knew was prepared for years before p  meanwhile in the town mary davids wife is having her own battle with a selfimage this character is consistently portrayed as truly feminine in her hopes and fears her life centers around the womens club of her church and her animosities center around mrs tolley the president she imagines herself standing in front of the ladies presiding over a meeting as if in shame for what she was doing she pulled the blankets over her face to hide the grotesque expression of dignity she had shaped her face into imagining herself in a black dress saying to the ladies this meeting will now come to order p  throughout the novel marys anxieties concerning her standing at the club and for her stall at the upcoming parish fair afford an extra human background to the main plot as the novel closes david is eloping bill trapps cabin is on fire but mary is basking pleasantly in selfadulation after the success of marys bestest gingercake stall to see john and the recluse merely as existential figures is to miss the warmth of feeling displayed by the old man towards the boy and the latters own troubled reactions towards bill trapp the old man centers his return to companionship around the young negro every morning found him up and about long before dawn he was restless and spent his time doing unnecessary things he mended the traps and pruned trees working always near the road hoping to see the colored boy hoping to see any human walking towards his place p  eventually he is accepted by the townspeople because of his generosity and he appears among them as a pied piper hordes of children ran shrieking up and down the street he tucked in his belt straightened his hat and boldly began to walk past them p  johnny on the other hand is torn between a poetic world in which he sees all nature and all men as kind and the other world of harshness but solidarity in the gang true in the end he succumbs to the pressures of the gang and obeys the summons to bring forth the gasoline that will destroy trapps home but his previous mixed feelings are very much those of the young adolescent they do not need the existentialist philosophy to prove them true demby writes well of this younger consciousness from the time john shows compassion for the beetle to the time when the youth feels that other irrepressible feelings are stirring in him everything he did was frozen out there in front of him so that right after he did it he could look at the action examine it and measure it and say to himself how funny it was and wonder if it was really he who had done it p  david the frustrated artist has similar troublings of spirit in which the consciousness feels that other forces are beginning to stir and black enameled death that he had seen the funeral of mrs johnson of beetlecreek represented everything of beetlecreek and was like the restlessness and dissatisfaction of the birds only inside him swarming and swooping inside him filling him with vague fear and shame preparing him for something telling him warning him separating him from the things that were happening around him apart from him pulling him along towards things that he could not see or know p  but one does not have to see both john and david as examples of the same existentialist patterning in demby both survive as human beings even the subsequent betrayal of davids renewed artistic yearnings is not to be seen as caused by some inhuman force crushing him the author uses a convincing irony to show davids being trapped by his own aspiration not surprisingly the artist david finds beetlecreek a womb in which one is suffocated and this feeling of being trapped throws him upon edith in his frustration he sees her as different and really alive but his charged emotion has caused him to misjudge the situation as demby implies at the very end of the novel when david is eloping with edith she barks at him once inside the coach in a dry scraping voice dont always be so goddam loveydovey he has given up one painful situation for another sufficient evidence has been introduced to show that the human content of beetlecreek far outweighs the existentialist patterning that is brought in by bone as interpretation 
let us begin to be honest with each other by first being honest with ourselves there is no precedent for revolution in this country among blacks we of us are a revolutionary party and we have come to set a series of precedents we have decided that we must first deal with the cultural revolution others have disagreed with it the disagreement has not disappointed us emotionally however ideologically the position and opposition  to the cultural revolution in time and context tends to be incorrect  we have said before that th red book is better read it has no relevance if we never read enough to refer to it intelligently it is mao the master who hat taught us weapons are an important factor in war but not the decisive factor its people not things that are decisive the contest of strength is not only a contest of military and economic power but also a contest of human power and morale if weapons are not the most decisive factor but people then what are we to do with weapons and what path must we pursue with the people us has said and continues to say that the battle we must fight now and always is the battle for the minds of black people and if we lose that battle we cannot hope to win any other battle therefore the slogan pick up the gun is simply a slogan not a program or an ideology nor a value system that would make us victorians for if mao is as correct as those who refer to him would have us believe then what we should concentrate on is not the weapons but the people how can we win the people that is the question it is not a question of how can we kill the enemy for the people must decide that that is necessary themselves or the vanguard will vanish and the revolutionary party which has placed itself in a front position will fall flat on its face and history will hide all of them if we concede that mao is the master and revolution is the reality then words are wasted on discussions of weapons for as mao says again although barehanded the masses can subdue the enemy and then he goes on to say in our daily life is there any object that cannot be used to kill the enemy or any type of action that cannot reduce or destroy his fighting strength since the principal function of an armys weapons is to simply destroy the enemy and or reduce or destroyhis fighting strength therefore we must win the will of the people so that they will have the will to be a nation or the first stage of national development is a cultural nation ie a group of people with a common value system that gives us the will to be together to share and fight together and to seek the sovereignty as a political nation so that we can defend and develop ourselves with national effectiveness  the problem with most people who do not understand cultural nationalism is that they see cultural nationalism in terms of a narrow definition of culture which deals with the arts whereas we of us which is a revolutionary party with a correct revolutionary ideology seek culture as a total value system and institutions to maintain and develop that value system it is no accident that mao says to the chinese that they must combine nationalism with internationalism for in developing it further he says that only by fighting in defense of china during the revolution that they could achieve national liberation and then make it possible for other people to achieve their national liberation therefore we see it as a mistake to make a distinction between cultural nationalism and revolutionary nationalism when nationalism today by its very nature has to be revolutionary if it is for liberation from the colonial power which rules a peoplebecoming if liberation is the chief goal as all wouldbe revolutionaries repeatedly reveal to us then any movement toward liberation puts one in conflict with the people in power and that conflict creates the context for the revolution but what must be understood is that no one can save us but ourselves we must speak for ourselves we must develop our own ideology as we of us have done in terms of kawaida every revolutionary struggle has proved that you cannot import revolution again it is mao who tells us in the fight for complete liberation the oppressed people rely first of all on their own struggle and then and only then on international assistance because revolutions are similar but at the same time time and circumstance bring about differences and not paying attention to differences will ultimately lead to defeat one last reference to mao is appropriate in terms of his concern with the chinese maintaining their culture we have said that mao has made marxism meaningful only by absorbing it and then transcending it that is why we know marxism is for the western people not black people too he said in the new stage that even in relationship to marxism we chinese must adopt a national form before we can find marxism useful and we should never  subjectively or mechanically apply it let us stand as a people first speak our own language develop and reinforce our own culture and revolutionary ideology and make revolution rather than references to other peoples revolution the red book would never be relevant if mao had not won and we have always thought that he has done himself a discredit by calling himself a marxist and the young chinese proved this by calling themselves maoists we of us understand that the revolution can only be made when the people desire that they are a people and want to make it and culture is the cement that binds blacks together therefore it is absurd to make a distinction between cultural nationalism and a suprastructure for all different types of nationalism since culture is a total value system including  religious nationalism  political nationalism  artistic nationalism and even what may be called  atavisma return to the past because one cannot deal with the present and refuse to face the future this is the year of reconstruction let us reconstruct labeling our brothers will not leave us with fewer problems the enemy seems to endure in spite of the debates i but if we as revolutionaries surj vive by that very survival we prove that the enemy is not invincible  
young james alan mcpherson might rejoice in the fact that a man is defined not by what he says but rather by what he does the short stories collected under the title hue and cry little brown and company  leave little doubt as to what mcpherson can dohe can write short fiction as well as anyone living in america who is under  and make all the more inane his dust cover utterings see october  negro digest about trying to keep the color part of most of them far in the background where these things should rightly be kept in the very first of his stories a matter of vocabulary a tale out of what obviously is the authors background mcpherson tells us with rare tenderness how he learned about being black and that sense of blackness is not absent in any of his stories where in the honesty of the telling it is expected to be found indeed as revealed in a story called private domain mcpherson knows something of the exasperation and the futilityof trying to flee from ones blackness but i suspect that his selfimposed estrangement from black writers of his own generation has left him believing that someone would deny him the right to speak also of the identity crisis peculiar to young whites in america which he does remarkably well in the very same story anyone who has sat in morning court in an american city will recognize the old men in the second row in mcphersons story an act of prostitution as a perfect metaphor for the millions upon millions of good citizentype americans who never fail to be entertained by their countrys absolute lack of moral authority mcpherson tells his story with a hand restrained in such a way as to prevent the reader from divorcing himself from the cruelty of its characters it is a story about the powerless at the mercy of the powerful but it does not neglect to demonstrate how a showing of power by the former can quickly alter the style as well as the behaviour of the latter for most of us a lifetime will be too short a period in which to see all the lonely people so clearly as mcpherson sees them but on the other hand neither will most of us throw off the chains that keep us from admitting as mcpherson has admitted that all the lonely people are ones self it is the story of a young man who does not find in his being a user of women a reason for feeling morally superior to a weak and altogether pathetic homosexual he suffers therefore no less for his inability to let himself be used by the desperate man than he does upon refusing the sexual advances of a girl for whom he had selfishly made plans before discovering her to be unattractive at the beginning of the story the young man deceives one woman into believing that he wants her in order to get away from the homosexual she had only been  a convenient and manly excuse for getting out of that shop without having to give an aging fairy specific reasons why i would not have a scotch with him perhaps the american male in his terror has come to view woman as nothing more than an object through which he might escape facing himself and other men a mystery at the bottom of which might rest the key to the american females fastgrowing determination to be something other than a woman all of which suggests a state of affairs about as sad as mcphersons gracefully told story in which the character is forced in his flight to take satisfaction in a certain affirmation of something a certain pride a sense of some small and sensual accomplishment   a solo song for doc is the story of something old something dying and about the people who however unrecognized invested it with a flavor and a style without which it would have been something quite different and who moreover loved it even as they came to hate and fear it and know that it like them had had its day it is about the railroad and the black men who ran on the road finally it is about america in the writing of this story mcpherson makes it unmistakably clear that he has acquired keen and reliable insights into the lives of the masses of black people who go day after day year after year to those unspeakable jobs where they perform in such a way as to appear fairly content with the rules and the rule of the white man his however is the insight of one who knows that what they feel in their bones is not easily measured by their appearance it is of course an insight the full value of which will not be realized until the architects of the revolutionary vision have begun to listen to the people with an ear half as good as mcphersons james alan mcpherson is a craftsman who writes with authority about this america and the people who live and fight and grow dull and die here he has experienced this country and its people rather widely in a short time his writing ought to be celebrated for the clarity with which he comments upon the quality of american life which our best vision would have us avoid mcpherson writes with a quiet power that rips away at the minds deeply buried illusions and works its way into the soul like tears of humility understatement in his hand is as revolutionary in its way as was truth in the mouth of malcolm in his title story he speaks of a black girl being married by nature to a cause and i for one hope that he will consider his own words for i see no rational reason for him to deny that he is a black artist 
volume  of black artists on art is an attractive production editors samella s lewis and ruth g waddy two enterprising west coast artists have gathered a group of artists of varying talents and viewpoints in the covers of the first real attempt at the firstclass framing of black artists in a book since cedric dovers american negro art c  the book is very now and very conscious of the mood among the bulk of todays black artists and intellectuals concern about the present moment and black consciousness in fact animates the book there are photographs of some of the works of the  artists featured in the book but there also are statements from the artists about their motivations their impulses and their craft in her introduction miss lewis a member of the faculty at california state college dominguez hills outlines the context of the book    a truly valid system of aesthetics should be derived from the culture of its inhabitants and should reflect the prevailing spirit of the times in a manner that involves all groups residing within the society this direction would provide for a concept of relationship that would include both commonalities and differences since it is the difference that sharpen or give vitality to the commonalities it would seem that the necessity of a culture to accept and respond to such diversities is a requisite to creative production many pages could be written concerning art and its relative importance from a cultural standpoint it can be briefly stated however that the control of this cultural empire is  and  percent from the white group this is not because whites are more cultured but because they control the economy and consequently dictate the specific aesthetic standards   miss waddy speaks to another aspect of the same theme art is not an intellectual exercise approached through structural learning emotions styles and practiced in museums galleries and private collections art is spiritual the primary function of which is for the benefit growth and improvement of the human animal the artists are quoted as to their views on art and some of them of course are out there on cloud nine holding forth with cliches and irrelevancies some like david p bradford have joined cold reality and beauty into a theory of black art a black art must have the rhythm freedom and excitement of a john coltrane solo as well as make a statement to its viewer mr bradford says    black art must be folksy and natural by this i mean it must derive from pure talent and not from the arrangement of light bulbs and tin foil for the experience of black folk in america have been a folksy experience and black people the world over are close to nature and the natural process of things in nature mr bradfords work is presented in color as is the work of a number of the artists represented in the book there are photographs of all the artists plus a brief biographical statement about each of them in the back of the book since the book is billed as volume  the assumption is that a volume  or volume  will follow in such a case the complaint that the editors have been narrow in their selection of artists would not be valid there is however no indication anywhere in the book as to whether there will be other volumes or when or what area the subsequent volumes will cover it is hoped that future volumes will pay attention to the dozens of superb artists in such cities as detroit chicago philadelphia new york and washington dc volume  of black artists on art seems to place emphasis on artists in the locality inhabited by the editors the book is designed by howard lee it is published in two editions a hardcover  and a paperback  by ward ritchie press of los angeles  riverside drivehoyt w fuller
im done crying by louanne ferris as told to beth day m evans and company  is primarily a story of a black woman whose energies are spent in providing for her family and in proving herself worthy of the vocation she has chosen the author has presented miss ferris story in an alive hardhitting fast paced manner in which no words are wasted the events of louannes teenage marriage early pregnancy and semidesertion by her husband are related in plain lan guage when louanne becomes the sole support of her two sons she finds employment in a big city hospital as a kitchen aide and from that moment the bulk of her story is devoted to exposing the deplorable conditions in the institution she does this in a rather methodical manner beginning in the kitchen and proceeding through to the various wards the emergency room the operating room and the morgue in each instance her observations and descriptions of conditions seem brutal but are in most cases pathetically true the city hospital as an end of the line institution must admit anyone this includes the victims of abortions the junkies and the cats who get knifed every saturday night the malpractices the misjudgments and abandonments on the part of its staff are clearly spelled out by miss ferris as she progresses with the aid of a seriously dedicated but roughmannered registered nurse kilpatrick from kitchen aide to nurses aide to practical nurse to miss ferris a particular job regardless of its title is to be performed cleanly efficiently and with concern for the patient unfortunately she meets with indifference and all too often hosility on the part of her coworkers in her efforts im done crying is more than an exposure of hospital negligence it is also a commentary on urban ghetto life characterized by narcotics the numbers racket and illicit sex these conditions and their existence in the hospital environment presents an angry but interestholding plot characterizations are sensitively presented the reader is introduced to some dedicated persons such as dr durand who had the roar of a lion but sincere concern for all patients and contempt for staff malpractices the inspiration which miss ferris receives from nurses kilpatrick and lome offers an infinitesimal degree of brightness to a somewhat hopeless situation miss ferris story is quite aptly titled she was done crying after she had held many dying patients and after she had seen her son die from a then incurable kidney disease her determination and consequent survival offers a degree of hope to others like her this is a disturbing story but one which will be read and reflected onjo hudson
