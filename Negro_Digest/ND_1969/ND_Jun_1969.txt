white incubus
by ottilie markholt
white liberal sits fnrl like a giant incubus on the black freedom movement it has devoured the interracial civil_rights organizations and waves their empty husks at the black people trying to cajole them into fleshing out the dead organizations with their presence probably it is futile to belabor the white liberal for his blind arrogance he is so clearly incapable of understanding his present role in the civil_rights movement that he professes to believe in and cherish he is after all whitesharing the views of his white culture and by choice preserving his place in the white community at best he was an innocent dogooder whose presence in civil_rights activities could be tolerated by the black community at worst he has become the pawn of the white power structure in its desperate attempt to avoid facing and dealing with the emerging black strength in america alone among white americans the white liberal has a conscience of a sort he believes that he is a moral man and america is a moral nation this is essentially what separates the white paternalist from the white bigot but the white liberals conscience and his morality are inseparable from his white superiority during the last decade as the black revolt gained momentum the white liberal discovered that the hitherto nonexistent black people were being outrageously treated in america he became indignant over their wrongs and he began to march he picketed to integrate schools jobs neighborhoods he crossed arms locked hands and sang black and white together we shall overcome some day he gave time energy money and occasionally his life for years he was theredoing the right things for the wrong reasons the white liberal worked from several basic premises that it was tragic to be bom black that black people should wish to be and should be exactly like white people and that he knew at least as well asprobably better than black people what they should want and how to get it his morality his social justice consisted of deciding that people with dark complexions should share his white america on his terms live in his neighborhoods attend his schools and work beside him what more could they want he did not question the basic values of white america for they were his values and therefore absolute he argued with complete sincerity they are just like us the only difference is the color of their skin to himself he might add if some of them are culturally deprived they are not to be blamed they have been segregated so long integration will help them advance to black people he said im completely color blind i dont even think about it and he tried earnestly to practice this enlightened outlook when he socialized with black people he relished his own broadmindedness in offering himself as a true apostle of integration and giving his negro friends the opportunity to associate with a white person his utopia was a completely integrated america peopled by lightskinned white men and darkskinned white men the black ghetto was alien while he might fraternize in the civil_rights movement with individual blacks in the black community their numbers and strange closed faces frightened him he ventured into the ghetto as a civil_rights crusader but at night he went home thankfully to his white neighbor hood this was the white man who marched and sang in washington dc and selma sincere dedicated paternalistic and completely white he performed his good deeds with the blind arrogance of a white man dealing with black men the white liberal failed to ask the hard question he does not know they are there to be asked how can i know what black people want what place in white america do they really seek am i bound to respect their right to make their own decisions or respect them as equals there is a watershed of identity from which values arise almost all white americans are glad they were born white and they accept without question the superiority of their white western culture they feel sorry for people who were born black and who do not share freely in that culture to them the black man must automatically wish above all else to lose his black identity and be completely assimilated in their america when black people do not welcome this they are thought to be ignorant backward or prejudiced they think the black community and black institutions should dissolve as rapidly as opportunities for integration will permit for example the persistence of the black church puzzles them now that many white churches profess to welcome black communicants when the central conference of the methodist church chose to retain its identity white liberals smiled knowingly and said it was because negroes liked to flourish their bishops titles that the black methodists were too selfimportant to give up their little empires for integration they believe black clergymen are trying to keep their flocks out of white churches because the black preachers would surely lose their pulpits because white is right they assume that white churches could serve black people better than black churches they do not doubt that when black people have progressed sufficiently they will turn to the white churches they have not the least understanding of the great and living strength of the black church the actions of black and white demonstrators were the same their motives were not the black man picketed a segregated school because he knew his child would have a better opportunity to learn in a predominantly white school where it was assumed the pupils could and would learn and the school was oriented toward that end he knew that no matter how intelligent or gifted his child might be the child would learn little in a segregated northern school th where the staff considered black pupils culturally deprived and unteachable and many of the children responded to this rejection with equal hostility he was not seeking to thrust his child among white children because they were white but because education was available in their classrooms the white man picketed because he thought black children would be improved by attending wfiite schools and mingling with white children he knew his schools were better and he was willing to be generous and dilute them with a few disadvantaged black children the black child could only benefit from assimilating the cultural values of his white schoolmates the relative merits of bach and rhythm and blues were certainly not debatable the black man demonstrated for open housing because he wanted the opportunity to live wherever he chosebecause the ghetto walls permitted landlords to charge him more for poor housing than he would have to pay in an open city he did not wish to destroy the black community but to breach the walls that surround it the white man picketed because the very existence of the ghetto which he equated with both a slum and the black community was the ultimate mark of humiliation and shame he was trying so hard to help his darkskinned compatriots forget they were not just like himtrying so hard to forget it himself during the late summer of  i was associated with a core chapter in a large eastern city it was the second chapter to be organized there almost entirely black national core had revoked the charter of the previous affiliate organized and dominated by white university students this black chapter had the confidence of many of the militants in the black community a white social worker director cf a large settlement house in a black neighborhood worked with the chapter he was a small intelligent energetic man who loved power he had been active in organizing the march on washington in another city he gloried in what he thought was his successful manipulation of this core chapter and its supporting groups he told me as much the black leaders watched this supposed exercise of power utilizing the mans energy and talent completely aware that they must retain control of policy decisions they did the glimpse i had of national core was different and distressing that fall i attended as an observer a regional core conference in new york city it was dominated by three white experts on the national staff two of them particularly were assured white men i could not imagine them pausing to doubt their competence to tell  the black freedom movement what to do the black staff members had minor roles in the conference i do not know what the black delegates thought of these white experts this was two years before the blackwhite struggle in core became public i first saw seattle core during the school boycott the spring of  the morning of the boycott in response to a lastminute call for additional help i reported to the core office the second floor of a vacant store building in the black community i had been receiving the core bulletin and was impressed by the chapters activity a white woman was minding the office coordinating activity for the freedom schools under cores direction she sent me immediately to a large catholic community center overflowing with children her daughter a college student bubm bling with excitement drove me over arent they just adorable those little deprived black children she cooed i grunted we reached the center before i could reply that the little black children were not deprived the principal of the freedom school was a strong black man most of the teachers were white liberal intellectual types some of the special features of the curriculum reflected white values the white woman playing a gavotte on the harp was obviously a brief exposure to the better things for the deprived black children a white man played southern racist songs on a violin for each class black music was ignored there was no proud statement that black is beautiful one learned black scholar lectured on the history of black people in america concluding with langston hughes rivers otherwise black culture was not recognized the white students almost a fifth of the enrollment were largely the children of the white liberals who supported the boycott they tended to be mouthy and selfassured seeking to monopolize the class discussions they probably duplicated their public school roles outwardly the boycott was successful in numbers of students who participated but im not sure what it did for the black community it appeared that whites dominated the planning and certainly the teaching staff had the freedom schools grown from within the black community i should think there would have been black sunday school teachers to staff them as it was many of the white teachers showed little understanding of their black pupils and the pupils had the experience of another white teacher rejecting them the dominant mood among the white staff members was we are noble and benevolent in fighting for the right of these deprived black children to attend our schools and mingle with our children i wonder how clearly the black children and their parents got the message a few months later i was appointed to our local naacp executive board protesting that i didnt think white folks should be making policy i was told by friends who privately agreed with me that so many white faces were necessary on the board and if i declined some other white person would be appointed so i began to attend meetings resolved to say little shortly after that another white board member concerned over the naacps lack of support in the black community proposed we send representatives to various organizations to explain our program and invite them to discuss their problems all board members white and black were expected to speak for the naacp in the black community i objected to the idea of sending white members into the black community to tell black people what to do this was arrogant and paternalistic i tried to explain white peoples limitations their place in the civil_rights movement as helpers and not leaders the members present black and white were either firmly disapproving of or outraged by my statements that the black community would not and should not be expected to accept white naacp spokesmen some denied angrily the black racism they thought i was implying the black community contained a black woman warmly defended the white paternalists citing mary white ovington and her spiritual descendants in the naacp through the years the two black board members who would have agreed with me were not present that night the consensus was resolutely color blind but the project of speakers before black organizations was not mentioned again i can only guess how the black civil_rights activists felt during those years about their white liberal allies the white liberal was talking about freedomjustice equality but it was freedomjusticeequality on his terms as he chose to grant and administer them this may not have been apparent at first possibly the black activists credited white liberals with more understanding and less arrogance than the whites possessed possibly they believed the whites would lose their paternalism as they came to know and understand the black community i have often found black people more charitable in their assessments of whites than i thought was warranted judging by their own humane culture they seem unable at times to believe that white folks can be so mean the deep cleavage between white liberals and the black community was dramatized when the concept of black_power became an angry slogan hurled at white america the white folks illusion of allowing darkskinned white people to share their white western culture  on their terms was threatened white liberals had approved the humble and prayerfully supplicant posture of the nonviolent black demonstrators to them it was right and natural that powerless black people should beg and powerful white people should decide to grant they had accepted black people on the assumption they were trying to become white now they were forced to look at black men who did not beg and did not wish to be white their treatment of adam clayton powell revealed their inability to accept a proud black man socialists and other hitherto staunch civil_rights supporters joined the white establishment in attacking and reviling powell they could not understand black peoples loyalty to him then stokely carmichael shouted black_power and the sorting out began many white liberals who had marched and sung in  and  retreated to silence those who remained by their own definition dedicated workers in the civil_rights movement joined the establishment to denounce this frightening new idea or searched desperately for negro leaders who would say the things they wanted to hear no wonder the white liberal was horrified and alarmed by the black_power slogan and its attendant concepts his paternalistic role was challenged with all his blindness and disdain for the ghetto and for blackness he had claimed the ancient white prerogative of knowing what was best for the negro now he was being told he could merely help it was a deep affront to his white superiority he could not accept a subordinate place so he defended his paternalism by attacking black_power assuming that black nationalism was indefensible he attempted to destroy blackness with it how did this white man suppose black people had lived for the last three hundred years in america in complete negation and selfrejection in limbo waiting for the final day of integration when they could forget they were considered black first and american second the white liberal was shocked that black people were not sorry to have been born blackthat they considered themselves beautiful most of all his ego was shattered by black peoples defense of the fearsome and alien ghetto to him it was a slum to be wiped out bulldozed as soon as possible it was the supreme gesture of arrogance to question the precious gift of integration the white liberal was working so hard to bestow not to want complete and immediate integration on his terms was separatism racism prejudiceinreverse anything less than his kind of integration was antiwhite he saw nothing valuable in the black community he saw black culture only as a willful and misguided failure to become white in the name of his mythical integrated negro he  would destroy the black community and its culture he was unaware of his double standard for a black man to criticize white culture and defend black culture was antiwhite and biased for him a white man to criticize black culture and defend white culture was not antiblack but objective those white liberals who remained in the civil_rights organizations fought the black militants for control black militants in the naacp have charged that the united auto workers faction in the last two conventions used every tactic from bribery to threats of physical violence to retain control of the organization its declining membership nationally reflects the black communitys growing lack of confidence in it last fall a group of leaders in the black community here tacoma wash organized a strategy committee to press for certain goals among them were officers and members of the naacp their first target was the personnel of a newly created human relations commission and particularly its executive director a prejudiced white man in whom they had no confidence they called for nonrecognition of the commission as constituted and appointment of a black director the commission was characterized as an instrument of appeasement controlled by the white power structure this program was presented to the naacp executive board with a request for naacp support and implementation led by the white liberals the board recommended rejection of the program i reported the boards action in our monthly newsletter and wrote a signed letter to the editor that began it is time for a white member  to speak plainly after reviewing the presentation to the board meeting i said the merits of the proposal are basically not at issue clearly the program was being brought to the naacp by the leaders of the negro community the opposition    was led by three white board members for all their lip service to the idea of respect for negroes and recognition of their rights these white members were displaying their superiority and paternalism in not recognizing the right of negro leaders to make basic civil_rights policy in this or any city anything less than our recognition as whites of the absolute necessity of negro leadership is to bring our white paternalism with us right into the naacp we whites are not equal to negroes in our understanding of and ability to communicate with the negro community how could we be we have not walked the earth one day of our lives as negroes granted that these white members have worked hard in the branch that they mean well this isnt enough unless they support loyally the negro leadership they  are doing more harm than good to civil_rights if they really respect negroes let them accept this leadership and work to carry out the will of the negro community       if the naacp does not support the committee it will certainly alienate itself from the negroes struggle for human dignity    i appeal to white naacp members to move beyond their paternalism and join the struggle as loyal followers just before the branch meeting the newly appointed director of the human relations commission hastily joined the naacp he showed up at the meeting with a lengthy appeal for fair play and another chance before being condemned he had already bungled his first case the white liberals were there in numbers indignant at my attack completely unmoved by my appeal they voted down the proposals of the black leaders the arrogance of the white liberals in this branch and their insistence on compromise and appeasement have tended to discredit it in the black community in the seattle core election the end of  the whitesupported moderate black candidate for chairman defeated the militant black candidate the defeated faction withdrew and formed an aggressive black community organization the whites may have saved core from the black militants but they seem to have silenced it in the black community in san franciscos fillmore district this spring i passed a vacant core office i saw no evidence of its activity in the community maybe it too was saved from the blacks recently a friend of mine a black woman related how impossible it was for a white man with whom she was associated in an interracial cultural organization to get along with his black peers he seemed unable to avoid the appearance of patronizing them and his feelings were hurt because they did not welcome him as a soul brother he was aggressive in the affairs of the organization the black men universally disliked him what can i tell him she asked me to make him understand tell him that he is a white paternalist i replied he probably is incapable of understanding this or he wouldnt behave as he does white men are the lords of creation and it is virtually impossible for them to be otherwise dont let the white paternalists dominate the organization or they will drive the black people away they already are she replied sadly this last year the civil_rights movement has seemed to make some progress local white power structures are beginning to make concessions to the moderate civil_rights organizations to avoid dealing with the black militants they are engaging in sham battles with these organizations rather than rec ognize the growing power of the black communities for years the seattle school system resisted integration by changing boundaries or busing while de facto segregation steadily increased under its open enrollment plan the school board ignored appeals picketing and the school boycott then the fall of  at is  the new  junior high in harlem black parents demonstrated for a black principal and community control of the school the summer of  seattle community organizations moved toward a similar program for their black schools this spring the seattle school board announced plans to close a black elementary and a black junior high school to reduce the ratio of black students in the high school by transfers out and to bus the children from the closed black schools to white schoolsthe naacp and white liberals applauded the progress the black community protested vigorously against busing its children out and demanding a black principal for the high school and community voice in its schools the naacp denounced this program as irresponsible it is true that the state board of education had finally established requirements for racial balance in school districts receiving state funds but to me the real reason for the seattle program is the changed options for the school boards for years the alternative to the civil_rights movements demand for dispersal of black students throughout the white schools was to do nothing and keep the black children penned up in their black schools now the white community has realized that those black schools are the breeding ground for a continuing crop of young black militants and the focal point around which the black community is uniting to demand community control and black administrators now the dispersal of these black students has suddenly become desirableto stifle their rising black consciousness the school boards program was not a victory gained by a strong civil_rights movement but an attempt to thwart the growing strength of the black community the same changed options were operating before and after the assassination of dr martin_luther_king jr for years the white community had been opposing his demands and demonstrations then early in  as the nation began to look forward to another violent summer his nonviolent philosophy became a viable alternative to that of the black militants just before his death the saturday evening post featured an article in which he said that the poor peoples march on washington would be the last chance for nonviolence to prove its usefulness he implied that one of the purposes of demonstrations was busy work to allow black anger and white guilt to be vented in harmless channels malcolm_x told us years ago the  march on  washington was busy work dr_king still believed white america had a conscience that could be awakened and he preached love for all men for these reasons he became the acceptable alternative to the black militants the appeal to conscience could be ignored as it had been for hundreds of years the lavish public mourning after his death by the same white power structure that had fought him during his life was a cheap attempt to buy time and appease black anger that great opinion manipulator the readers digest for june featured two great sermons by martin_luther_king and a lead article plain talk about hatred and violence by a white liberal to me passage of the civil_rights act of  was not a tribute to dr_king but a comment on the flames in the sky over washington dc white paternalism is inherently as racist as white bigotry it stems from the same concept of white superiority and the same lack of respect for black people and black culture the white paternalist embodied in the white liberal demonstrates his abhorrence for blackness by seeking to wipe out the black communities and assimilate blackskinned white men in his white western culture with increasing urgency the white liberal is being used against the black community he is truly the last best hope of white supremacy 
lawyer his sibility crisis 
by judge raymond pace alexander
t was  years ago when i then only a few years out of law school accepted an invitation from a distinblack lawyer in des moines iowa george h woodson and an equally brilliant lawyer of chicago a much younger gentleman c francis stradford to address the proceedings of the national bar association at its third annual convention i had never known either of those gentlemen before that convention george woodson then in his middle fifties was the founder of the national bar association organized in des moines iowa in  c francis stradford then in his middle thirties was its president in  neither of these revered barristers is any longer with us but each of them left his monumental contribution to the glorious history of this great association for a long number of years the national bar association truly was the lone voice crying in the wilderness as it were among all the organized law associations in americawith one exceptioncrying for justice and equality for the american negro the lone exception to which i pay loyal and respectful tribute was the national lawyers guild do you remember those years forty years is a long time ago and it might be well to recall some of the events of those years briefly and what the negro lawyer faced in his convention city detroit what he talked about his then problems before the american courts and indeed before america itself they were bleak and dismal years his future the future of the american negro was uncertain the full history of those near three decades  to  is an intensely absorbing and in many aspects a heartbreaking story which is well worth telling because it is an important part of the history of the american negro and of the american negro lawyer and his contribution to the ongoing and difficult struggle for better race relations in america time obviously prevents a detailed discussion of this subject what were our problems at that timein  what were the subjects on the agenda for the negro lawyers assembled in detroit at the outset you must be reminded that we had no detroithilton or any other firstclass hotel white or black in which we could meet the white hotels just would not have us and we had no recourse to any court of law we met as did all negro organizations at that time in the ymcas and in the negro ymcas at that the total number of negro lawyers in america in  barely totalled  and half of that number were concentrated in three cities washington d c had about  but  were working in government offices there were approximately  in the new yorkbrooklyn area and about  in chicago as an illustration of their few numbers there were only  lawyers in philadelphia as contrasted to todays  less than  in pittsburgh the remainder scattered principally in the large industrial cities of the north such as cleveland detroit indianapolis st louis and los angeles and san francisco there were perhaps less than  in the entire south where they were most definitely needed where a mass of  million black americans lived and labored in the farming cottongrowing states these people were crying for help but the law gave them no protection and their white overlords cotton plantation owners farm labor bosses sheriffs kkk night riders and other race baitors and terrorizesgave only the whip and the lash the torch and the rope if they made any organized effort to assert even the barest minimum of their constitutional rights to register to vote to serve on jury to be free from beatings to obtain forced confessions or to demand abolition of segregated rail and bus transportation in fact any organized and entirely peaceful protest against intolerable working conditions would cause the most cruel and inhuman abuse of those who protested to recite all the crimes and injustices committed against innocent black people of the rural south from  to  when we lawyers took up the defense of these people would cause your blood to chill in your body there was a crying need at that time for bright dedicated and courageous black lawyers there still is such a need today there was an equally crying need for a national organization of negro lawyers in those days there still is a great need for the national bar association today and let no one try to convince you that you have done a good job your mission has been accomplished    and now since the american bar association has dropped its racial bar the national bar association is no longer necessary i would like to tell you my own personal experience in trying to become a member of the aba from  to  and of their refusal to admit me because of race but that is not a pleasant story and i prefer to let it rest to be told in detail in my memoirs the national bar association is needed more today than ever before in its historyand in a few moments i hope to tell you why let me remind those of you present tonight especially those who were too young to know the events of those years that at our annual conventions where cases of the character just alluded to came to our attention by our members we would discuss the legal points involved and assist the lawyers who were handling these cases from the hearings in the police court through the trial and state appellate courts and thence on appeal before the united states supreme court it was the negro lawyer who gave hope to the defenseless masses of black people of the south and sustain them in the belief that america offered a future for black people free from torture and despair and to the everlasting glory of the negro lawyer he was victorious in the overwhelming number of civil_rights and human rights cases argued before the supreme court during the last  years including the greatest in the field of education in all its history the brown vs board of education case in  to those who are interested in further research on this subject i prepared an article for the association for the study of negro life and history entitled the upgrading of the negros status by supreme court decisions which is published in bound volume xxx no  a later and more complete study in book form appeared in  entitled the petitioners the story of the supreme court of the united states and the negro loren miller a great lawyer and later a distinguished judge of the municipal court of los angeles who died quite unexpectedly in july   commend these works to those who want to know more about the legal status of the negro who was in every respect a ward of the united states supreme court for more than  years as loren miller aptly put it   as befits a dependent a ward the negro has had to solicit the intercession of his guardian when he has sought to exercise rights and privileges enjoyed by grown up white citizens as a matter of course    that negroes have had to secure supreme court decrees in order to do what white americans can do without question such as buy or rent homes vote in primary elections ride in pullman cars    read daily newspapers in city libraries loll around in public parks eat in bus stations or swim in the ocean most of these cases were argued and won by negro lawyers many by loren miller himself who was eminently successful especially in the field of restrictive covenants barring blacks from open housing the names of these negro lawyerheroes as i like to describe those brilliant barristers who have been so successful before the highest court of our land are many and long and the list of heroes is increasing annually it is perhaps improper to mention a few without naming all but i must pay deep and solemn respect to two successful advocates in a number of unusual cases one was the architect and planner of scores of landmark decisions favorable to blacks a profound scholar in the field of law with whom i was associated as an underclassman while he was a senior at harvard law school i refer to the late father of civil_rights charles h houston i also pay deep and profound tribute to dean houstons protege who became one of the most successful advocates at the bar of the supreme court now mr justice thurgood marshall a member of the supreme court he was a student of charles houston while houston was dean of the law school at howard i also pay tribute to the law faculty of one of americas great law schools the law school of howard university it was the faculty of this law school that inspired and sharpened the minds of the bright young men of our race encouraging many of their graduates to follow the leadership of houston and marshall to countless victories in the state and federal courts throughout this nation i cannot leave this part of my subject without adding that a score of howard university college and law graduates now grace the benches in at least  state and federal courtsa great step forward from the year  years ago when we could count at that time and for twelve years thereafteruntil  only one negro judge in all america the late judge james a cobb of the municipal court of the district of columbia in an america which spends mounting billions of dollars for defense and additional billions in the frenetic and chauvinistic race in the search of outer space we as negro lawyers guardians of the increasing millions of our people who are still wards of an affluent society living in the ghettos the cesspool inner core of great wealthy cities must challenge our government to retrieve and cultivate the inner space values of the negro of america we must challenge the government to find the true soul and heart and meaning of the negro what it means to be a negro and what he as a man and his family as a unit and his people as a race means to america and the future of this country the black lawyers of america the same professionals who with consummate skill and advocacy mastered the lawyers highest art the art of the relevantalways focusing their argument on the principal problems germane to the case at hand must now become the leaders of their people and fill the vacuum created by the death of one of the worlds most treasured souls dr martin_luther_king jr black lawyers must make relevant to america that today the need for new unselfish dynamic and talented leaders among the negro people is greater than at any time in the last  years in no other way can the death of this great and most holy of the worlds modern men be vindicated in this way alone can the mortal wound to america be healed the black lawyer can fill this void he is among the best trained professionals of his race he has had years of study of the history of mankind the social ethical psychological and socioeconomic problems of masses of people of diverse background living together in great urban centers etc he also has had additional years of study of the increasingly large number of subjects and areas of investigation making him the ideal person to assume the leadership role in finding and proclaiming to america and to the world the relevant issues the relevant values and objectives which american negroes seek and demand from america above all we as lawyers must always demand equal opportunity equal treatment and full justice for the negro in every matter necessary for his total participation in the life of his country to be able to do this he must have three things that go hand in hand to make him a functional literate and healthy citizen he must have good quality education in the finest schools with a large percentage of male teachers to restore the father image so long removed from the lives of the young because of the sick society that surrounds the negro family in the ghetto an education free from the defeating handicaps of segregation in both the north and south so that the child will be able to get and hold a job to fit his skills or to further his education in the sciences or the professions the doors of commerce and industry must be opened widely to provide jobs at every level this may mean we lawyers must take some harsh measures against labor unions that deny negroes apprentice training and others that bar negroes from membership these cruel and repressive practices have for many long years deprived the negro worker both the skilled and the able apprentice of his manhood and of the ability to provide for his family racism has denied him the needed skills to work in industry in effect denied him his right to work and therefore his right to earn a living third in our list of objectives is the all important one of a decent place to live all these goals go hand in hand education jobs and nonsegregated housing either one education or two jobs without the third nonsegregated housing will weaken and ultimately destroy the new structure that must be built for a free negro in a just america we must select from the great black talent at the american bar now numbering  negro lawyers a very encouraging increase from the  lawyers in  one man orif need be a committee of three one of whom i suggest be a womanwho will reject all ideas of separation of the negro from the mainstream of american life and of setting aside a negro state this is an utterly stupid and ridiculous suggestion completely devoid of any sense or reason it is sheer fantasy we have fought separation of the races in america all our lives many of our great lawyers some no longer living and many in our audience here tonight have literally sacrificed our lives our homes and subjected ourselves and our loved ones to assaults abuse and insults too degrading to mention to save our country from the shame and world stigma of an apartheid america how can we support the claims of those who say integration is irrelevant to the aims of the negro what we have fought for described in brief detail earlier resulting in countless victories in the highest court of our land is a documented story that speaks louder than my feeble words that america itself accents integration as the sensible goal to seek in the continuing struggle to make one family of all americans an equally important goal to seek is to commit america to the eradication literally the complete elimination of the hardcore ugly ghetto areas in the cities which is the real crime in the streets the disorders that flow from these disgraceful blots on the landscape are seeded nurtured and allowed to grow to full bloom by the willful neglect of the heartless the apathy of the disinterested and the failure of those who know better to become involved in americas problems the census if taken today would show the black population of america to be close to  of whom nearly  live in the inner cities the five largest centers of black population are washington d c  per cent newark  percent baltimore  percent chicago  percent and philadelphia  percent there is a very forceful human problem underlying this whole question clearly if for no reason other than an economic one though the human social problems to my mind are the greatest the country must see that if it is to survive there must be radical and monumental efforts made to eliminate this cancerous sore in the midcities but we as lawyers who live in or near these communities from which so many of our clients come must know how destructive these conditions are it is our duty to see that the black members of congress by appropriate legislation urge our government to provide billions of dollars to remove the poverty families from the lifedestroying ghettos and provide healthy suburban or outercity areas so that these people may have some hope for the future and perhaps for the first time in their lives a sense of selfrespect faith in their fellowman and pride of race we as lawyers know from our travels in the backwoods and muddy swamps of the south where we have often gone in the dark days of southern justice to save the defenseless poor among our people from the curse of irrational intemperate and degrading racist justice in southern court houses that those people and now their descendants in the north who live in these ghettos have been confined to a life of voicelessness and powerlessness we have seen the breakdown of our families the absence of a father so long denied the right to a decent job hopeless emasculated in spirit we the lawyers must in a sense invade the ghetto and help to create for the people faith in themselves and faith in their fellow blacks and restore their faith in america which is greatly needed to do all of the above we must have help it is not too much to ask america to unlock its store of treasures and give to the poor and disadvantaged in the richest country in the world some of its wealth this is the only industrial democracy in the world that does not have a family or childrens allowance and as has been pointed out by so many scientists not only is this the wealthiest country in the world but it also is the only one whose streets are filled with rioters each summer canada as does several scandinavian countries has model family allowance laws which if enacted in america would effectively eliminate poverty and the ghettos these laws would give to the people a new psyche new faith in themselves and restore the status the strength of and the respect for the family as a social structure as an alternative to this the black lawyer should urge the guaranteed income plan to congress as a very real and scientific way of creating a base upon which the povertylevel family would be provided the means of becoming an integral and productive part of the american community this is a time to dareand the black lawyer must always do the daring if we could dare to take on the cruel and entrenched establishment and the courts of the old south and win we can dare to go forward against the counterparts of those barbaric institutions now infesting the north there are thousands of northern segregationists equally as dedicated to negro inferiority and secondclass status we can make america a healthy society for all its people the job will not be easy but we have as partners in our efforts millions of fairminded honest and sincere whites what is more important to us as lawyers there are thousands of members of the white bar throughout america who have offered their help both financial and physical and their resources to destroy racism wherever they see its ugly head and to create an america free from all restrictions or barriers free from every economic social or political restraint only the lawyer with his special training and experience to cope with the most difficult legal situation and the most extreme legal emergencies can bring quiet and order out of the overwhelming problem that face the poor within our group we would be able to define the lines of action between what is lawful and permitted within the framework of state and federal laws and acts which inevitably lead to destruction of life and property which are totally against the law and which defeat our purpose while serving to inflame the hatred of those too willing to perpetuate a racist america the call is clear the time is now the need for intelligent unselfish dedicated and courageous leadership awaits your answer is the black lawyer listening     
a middleaged negro tells it as it is
by lloyd l brown
am going to talk back to the young black militant talkers who have been doing all the talking lately talk talk talk or to use their expression rap rap rap if all the talk was put together you would have a storm that would really blow the man down but then what would there be to rap about i have been listening intently to all the talkat meetings and conferences and seminars and workshops and on radio and tv discussion panelslistening to everybody tell it like it is and reading all the books and articles and interviews that tell it like it is until i feel impelled to stand up and talk back and tell it as it is its a lot of stuff thats what it is just a lot of stuff i use that word defiantly with no apology for not using one of the fourletter words that every young black militant talker must use in every sentence in order to keep in good standing as a ybmt let us start on that subject why fourletter anglosaxon words arent there any fourletter words in swahili the fact is my young brothers your bold bad use of obscenities from the speakers platform is definitely not in the black cultural pattern it is merely a steal from the revolutionary white kids especially the uppermiddleclass white kids who now that you wont let them play with your revolution are doing their own thing by painting fourletters words on their foreheads because they dont have any old board fences in their fancy suburban neighborhoods on which to chalk dirty words if you call me a brainwashed negro i will argue back but if you call me a mouthwashed negro well you are so right around the age of seven when i first verbalized my own young black militant mood we matured earlier in  those days one of the old folks grabbed my neck with one hand and a hunk of brown soap in the other and reamed out my mouth clean down to the tonsils more than  years later i can still feel that hellfire of homemade lyesoap and hear the accompanying flow of words that burned into my soul enjoining me henceforth and forever to respect my elders and mind my manners and act decent and not like some poor white trash that dont know how to act the old folks are gone and so is the brown power of their soap and the black_power of their monumental dignity and selfrespect now we have packaged detergents from the a  p and young black militant talkers who aint going to respect nobody man and who act just like some rich white trash that dont know how to act according to the ybmts there are of course some words that nobody is allowed to usefor example the word negro at one black_power seminar i heard the chairman interrupt a speaker with the warning that no black person who respected his blackness would ever refer to himself as a negro of course the chairman said we know there are some negroesunfortunately but they got to go laughter and applause anybody really wants black_power calls himself black thats our own word for ourselves nobody who ever considered himself a man ever called himself a negro like most of their white fellow students the ybmts know little or nothing about the history of our people call us what you will five minutes in the library would show that the greatest heroes of our freedom struggle have through the years referred to themselves by various designationscolored people afroamericans blacks negroes another five minutes would show that our worst traitors have also called themselves by those varied terms one of the earliest documentary records of our history in this land is a letter informing the governor of south carolina in  about a planned slave rebellion the judas signed himself a black  most of the black nationalist ideas of our ybmts were formulated by marcus garvey who insisted that no selfrespecting black man would ever call himself anything but a negro regardless of white efforts to term him something else in his essay who and what is a negro garvey wrote let us not be flattered by white anthropologists and statesmen who from time to time because of our success here there or anywhere try to make out that we are no longer members of the negro race if we were negroes when we were down under the hell of oppression then we will be negroes when we are up and liberated from such thraldom black is a good solid word but it is just as white a term as any you can find in the dictionary webster traces the origin of black all the way back to indoeuropean and that is as aryan as you can get and unless mr webster was a soulbrother black is not our own designation for ourselves it is his colored afroamerican negro blackyou still cant judge a book by its title and every ybmt will have more to talk about if he reads walkers appeal to the colored citizens of the world as well as black reconstruction in america the negro as capitalist as well as black bourgeoisie the negro mood as well as the souls of black folks i say take your pick of the names for our group and please dont call a brother a bad name if he picks one you dont like someday and all too soon you young ones will be old black militants and you wont like it if the next generation calls itself young colored militants and gives you a hard time for designating yourselves with the white word black as for me i still want to call myself a negro which is short for the way the old folks taught me to answer whenever the white kids called me something else im a negroandproudofit i still am another thing you might think about is this negroes and even colored people knew about guns long before the first ymbt hollered get your guns men for the benefit of tv cameramen my boyhood chum chester had several older brothers who owned hunting rifles whenever we had his house to ourselves chester and  would take down a couple of the gleaming winchesters not having permission was an added thrill to use in our favorite gamethe kluxers are coming we began by taking our positions at the parlor front window chester covered the street from one direction and i from the other our rifle barrels poking under the starched lace curtains sometimes we waited grimly silent and alert for as long as half an hour before chester would shout that they were coming it was his house and his brothers guns so naturally he had the right to be first to yell bangbang at the imaginary invaders our armed defense of the house was no doubt inspired by the reports we read each week in the negro newspaper about the ossian sweet trial in detroit when a white mob in that city stormed the newly purchased home of dr o h sweet a negro physician one of the attackers was killed by a rifle shot from the beleagured house the physician his family and several friendsabout a dozen persons in allwere charged with murder the naacp took up the case employed as defense counsel the famous lawyer clarence darrow and after several trials all of the accused were acquitted chester and i were only eighth graders thennot college students like so many ybmts of today and so we didnt know a lot of things that seem to have been discovered lately for instance we did not know that our winchesters could achieve a whole lot more than homedefense with them we could have taken power man we could have captured the whole city putting chester in as prime minister with me as his no  gunbearer and second shot we also did not know that our playshooting was directed at the wrong kind of people chester and i it now seems should have been banging away not at the attacking klansmen but at the main enemies of our race the majority of negroes both in and out of the naacp who believe in selfdefense but not selfdestruction and also white liberals like clarence darrow who defend them i have saved my most serious complaint about the young black militant talkers till last some of them are preaching white racism those preachments are sometimes called black racism or racism in reverse but you cant turn white into black by a switch in names racismthe idea that there are superior and inferior races of humankindis a modern idea originating from western europeans who happened to be white after the rape of africa and other lands where the populations happened to be nonwhite the most antihuman ideology ever to afflict mankind racism reached its depth of depravity in hitlerism which preached and practiced genocide the extermination of socalled nonaryans the nonpure whites according to the nazis who were a ku klux klan in power nothing they did in carrying out their racial policy was inhumane because the nonaryans were classified as untermenschen subhumans well heres how a socalled black militant leader recently expressed himself black people cannot commit any crimes against white people    anything we do to the dog cannot be wrong    the only crimes we can commit are crimes against humanity and white people arent part of humanity the name of the speaker isnt important our debate should stick to ideas not to personalities and i would like to hope that this man might think it over and change his mind his statement is racism it is precisely the idea that has branded and burned millions and millions of people most of them black people through the years if racism is in every respect a total evil opposite to the idea of the brotherhood of man does it change its nature when preached by a black person instead of a white race hate and black pride do not go together they are opposites in his famous credo written more than  years ago i used to see it framed in our peoples homes w e b du bois after asserting his belief that all men black and brown and white are brothers went on to avow his special belief in the negro race in the beauty of its genius the sweetness of its soul    and dr du bois added this profound thought i believe  in pride of self so deep as to scorn injustice to other selves dig malcolm_x came to see that our struggle is not a matter of race against race but as he put it is part of the rebellion against the oppression and colonialism which has characterized this era    in his last formal speech malcolm stressed that point the negro revolution is not a racial revolt we are interested in practicing brotherhood with anyone really interested in living according to it racism is not a weapon that we can snatch from the hands of our enemy for use against him since racism has no foundation in fact is a total lie and a fraud it has no use except to justify and maintain an existing oppression because racism can serve only an oppressor it is of no use at all to anyone fighting for freedom what we have to do is not embrace racism we have to destroy it the old folks who wiped away my tears of pain and rage when i came home battered by my first encounters with the monster never called it race hatred they did not call it prejudice they called it ignorance though they themselves could not read or write the old folks had a withering contempt for what they saw as ignorance anybody call you that is ignorant anybody believe color makes him better is ignorant plumb ignorant come to think of it nowthe old folks did do more than mouthwash me for life somehow they pounded into my seat of learning and into my head as well most of the fundamentals you are as good as anybody and dont ever forget it carry yourself like a man respect everybody god dont love ugly you come from a wonderful people you young black militants that soul you are always talking about didnt grow in a jukebox it was a long time agrowing and like the old folks songs that so richly expressed it that soul is warm and vibrant with humanity with compassion with love you did not invent the concepts of selfrespect and race pride you did not start the struggle for liberation and survival but those concepts and that struggle are your heritagea heritage to be cherished and to be fulfilled 
black poems poseurs and power 
by nikki giovanni
like all the milii i tant poems that tell jj how we gonna kick the honkies backside and purge our new system of all honkie things like white women tv voting and all the ugly bad things that have been oppressing us so long i mean i wrote a poem asking nigger can you kill cause to want to live under presidentelect nodick nixon is certainly to become a killer yet in listening to smokey and the miracles sing their greatest hits recently i became aware again of the revolutionary quality of you can depend on me and if you ask whos loving you just because i say hes not a honkie you should still want to know if im well laid there is a tendency to look at the black experience too narrowly the maulana has pointed out rather accurately that the blues is counterrevolutionary but aretha is a voice of the new black experience its rather obvious that while think was primarily directed toward white america ted white could have taken a hint from it we must be aware of speaking on all levels what we help to create we will not necessarily be able to control the rape of newark in the past election was criminal if revolutionaries are going to involve themselves in politics they should be successful and while im sure poems are being written to explain the success of the newark campaign and essays and future speeches are being ground out on brand new scott tissues in living color blaming the black community for not supporting the united brothers i would imagine the first problem the united brothers encountered that they were unable to overcome is that they were not united leroi jones for whatever reason had no business appearing on a show with anthony imperiale issuing joint statements about anything at all because he leroi did not have equal power in his half of the joint joint statements and meetings with the governor did not encourage the black people of newark to support the united brothers because of the prestige of leroi no newark voice is being lifted to analyze what went wrong in the allblack central ward of the people who turned out to vote only  percent of them voted for councilmen period they did not vote against the united brothers but they would not vote for them either in a year when black people showed little to no interest in national politics the stage was set for massive involvement in black_power there was no oppositionthe people were not involved in another camp so what went wrong militarismfor one thing to enter the main headquarters of the united brothers one had to sign in this turned most people off then you were asked quite tersely what do you want and if you couldnt answer concisely and accuratelyyou were dismissed the height of this attitude at headquarters was reached when a man carrying  to give to the campaign was requested to sign in then engaged in conversation by one of the keepers of headquarters the man turned from the conversation to speak with someone else and was told by a second headquarterskeeper the brother wasnt finished with you when the mans response wasnt satisfactory they pushed him up against the wall and the brothers guarding him were told do anything necessary to keep him in line the man with the money finally made his way upstairs and complained to karenga and leroi and was told his treatment was an honest mistake it was a disaster if that kind of treatment was accorded a man with as much prestige as he had we shudder to think what happened to those who just drifted in to see they offered an apology to the offended brother but that missed the point entirely the people of newark became more afraid of the black candidates and their organization than they were of the present scandal ridden blackhating administration and at this writing not a single black candidate was elected leon ewing has contested the election and asked for a recount this is too badto put it mildly the contradictions are too great revolutionary politics has nothing to do with voting anyway but if we enter electoral politics we should follow the simple formula that every black person is a potential vote and must be welcomed and treated as such with or without dashiki with or without natural i the latent militarism of the artistic community is even more despicableart and the military have always been traditionally opposed we saw the epitome of the new alliance at the recent black_power conference at philadelphia every artist worth his salt had a military wing attached to him the conference had guards the artists had guards the guards had guards even one of the highlights of the conference to me was karengas guards complaining about stanfords guards this is foolish because it has already been proven beyond a reasonable doubtwith the murders of martin_luther_king jr and robert kennedythat anybody the honkie wants to take off he not only can but will whenever and however he wants to stage it the artistguard syndrome seems to center around the impression we can make with the various communities the artist impresses the white community with his militancy and the guards impress the black community with their power its a sick syndrome with again the black community being the loser there is no cause for wonder that the black community is withdrawing from involvement with the black artist watching soul which appears on educational tv in new york the same simplistic crap was taking place soul is funded by the rockefeller foundation and the negro ensemble company is funded by the ford foundation yet the people on soul after giving  barbara ann teer credit for founding nec put it down as not being black enough and the last poets which is probably a truer title than they know performed die nigga its just not the same concept as kill it would seem to me that the most important and valid aspect of cultural nationalism would be the support of other black cultural ventures especially since one cultural function is funded by the same white folks who fund the group being put down since black people are going to look at tv they should look at julia diahann carroll is prettier ie more valid than doris day any day of the year and while the idea of cops is bad to me period and extralegal black cops are even worse if black people are going to watch cops shows on tv then mod squad beats the other white vigilante shows and if  spy is indeed as ive been told the new lone ranger then bill cosby by becoming the new tonto should help make us aware that we are the indians of this decade the parallel institutions that we hear so much about must certainly have reached their apex with  spy for love of ivy is as fine a movie as weve had since nothing but a man and its certainly more valid to us than planet of the apes space oddessy  and those other white things we are forced to watch it would sometimes appear some elements of the black artistic community are against popular success unless its theirs sidney poitier has moved into the area where we have said we want actors to goonly we didnt mean and make money i guess everybody knows guess whos coming to dinner is a bad movie but it is neither the beginning nor the end of poitiers career and the righteous indignation we spout is really quite out of place black people will soon quit listening to us if we cant get in tune with them i would imagine its a question of wigs everybody has done his wig poem and wig play you know where we put black people down for not having taken care of business but what we so easily forget is our own wig while we put down commercially successful artists we scramble to the east side to work we fight for spots on tv we move our plays downtown at the first chance we getwe do the very things we say are not to be done just because our hair is natural doesnt mean we dont have a wig we are niggersinresidence at white universities and talk about voting as a means to take over a city then put james brown down for supporting hubert humphrey its all a wig we obviously have no concept of power because if we did wed recognize that the power of black people forced james brown to go natural everybody cant come up through the civil_rights movement cause it just doesnt exist any more when black boys and girls from mississippi to massachusetts write jb letters complaining about this is my country too or was that a john a williams book then we ought to rejoice that brown changes his position the people we purport to speak for have spoken for themselves we should be glad and its not as thoughif we just like to complainthere isnt an abundance of issues to complain about what was john coltrane doing with music that make some people murder him why isnt otis reddings plane brought up from the lake what about the obvious tieups in the murders of john and robert kennedy with martin_luther_kings death what elements in this country conspired to murder both richard wright and ben bella what did malcolm and nkrumah say to each other that caused one to die and the other to be overthrown why have so many arabs and people of arab descent been recently arrested for murder or conspiracy to commit murder and id like to know what the cultural nationalists think about james forman living with a white woman who has borne his children controlling and directing sncc while stokely married to a black woman was kicked out these are cultural questionsrelating to survival but it sometimes seems that the only thing that culturalists care about is assuring themselves and the various communities that they are the vanguard of the black revolution they have made black women the new jews while they remain the same old nigeers we c w have got to do better than this our enemy is the new york times not the amsterdam news its look and life not ebony and we ought to keep our enemv in sight if were going to talk about parallel institutions then we have to recognize the parallel institutions we have it is just not possible to have a crisis of negro intellectualism unless we recognize that negro intellectualism exists young writers ought to recognize that an old writer cant put down other old writers to our benefit a nonswimmer flailing around in a turbulent lake is sometimes better left to drown than that swimmers in trying to save him should go under also this may however be a personal decision one of the main points id like the culturalists to remember is that the jews had over  art festivals while in concentration camps the warsaw ghetto itself became the cultural placetoplay until the germans carted them off and while it pleases me to know that we are making cultural strides it also worries me that we are failing to make political connections poems are nice but as don l lee  points out they dont shoot no bullets we must as marvin x says read our own poems as a group we appear to be vying with each other for the title brother and sister black that will not get us our freedom poor people have always known they are black as rap brown pointed out just as poor honkies have always known they are white these are facts we need to know where our community is going and to give voice to that the onyx conference recently showed just how far from the community we had strayed  we didnt even want people there who werent artists and while onyx will probably come out with an issue now that they have properly impressed the proper people we are in grave danger of slipping away from our roots the new hustle starting with claude brown and brought to its finest point by eldridge cleaver and bobby seale with their hustle of huey newton in hueys biography serialized by that great known black militant magazine ramparts   seems to be who can get the ear of the enemv for enough money andor prestige to float on a pink damn cloud to the concentration camps everyone who is breathing easy now that wallace wasnt elected ought to check againthats gas youre smelling artistand it will take more than a black poem or your black seed in me to rid this country of it  
organizational development in the black community
by clifford e darden
urban ghettos  have often been comjm pared to underdeveloped countries in that widespread poverty poor housing inadequate educational opportunities low health standards and general powerlessness of the inhabitants tend to characterize both to varying degrees in underdeveloped countries much thought and effort has gone into tracking the vital role which institutions and organizations of all kinds have in the development process there has been little comparable examination of the organization of the ghetto in most of the studies being debated the focus has been on individual ghetto residents aggregated into the percentage that are unemployed poorly housed poorly educated etc while this approach is useful for some purposes it completely ignores the organizational life of the ghetto were it not for the fact that black people must for the most part organize themselves collectively in order to achieve the degree of political economic and communal power desired this lack of attention to ghetto organizations would not be very distressing in real it v however the collective energies of black people have played and will continue to play the major role in the economic political and social transformation of black americans in the united states in a time of great uncertainty and confusion one observation seems only too valid progress in all important spheres will necessitate increasing organizational abilitv and skill on the part of the black people it behooves us then to take a more critical look at the current status of organizational development in the ghetto this paper will focus on the basic problems which tend to impede the efficient and effective operation of organizations which are created to deliver collective responses to collective needs and problems the current status of organizational development in the black community could best be characterized as being in the takeoff stage the crucial element of determination to do something about the many ills that afflict black people is now evident in every ghetto across the nation we now see scores of organizations moving on and off the local scene as more or less conscious and purposeful responses to perceived community needs nearly all of these organizations are encountering problems some of which should be briefly discussed historically the most stable and influential organization that affected the largest portion of the black community was the black church this is not to say that the black church was the only organization of any significance in the black community certainly there were others however the black church was unquestionably the most universal of black organizations it existed in nearly every community where there were sufficient numbers of blacks with religious leanings and in those days before the development of intensive black consciousness the number of blacks without religious leanings was insignificant this was before blacks cared about the typical portrayal of christ as a white anglosaxon the black church focused mainly on the nonmaterial aspects of the lives of black people and attempted to soothe and sing away the very real and mundane problems of being poor and black in america it wasnt that the black church wasnt cognizant of the misery and poverty that permeated black ghettos on the contrary these facts were dramatized each sunday when people had to shout and afterwards when collection was taken shouting was a way for blacks to release some of the tensions and burdens which cropped up during the first six days of the week it was a way of giving behavorial vent to the frustrations caused by daily misery except in the larger and wealthier parishes the sizes of the sunday collections were sufficient evidence in themselves that the parishioners were already living in hell the black church as an organization was aware of black peoples misery but tended to either minimize or ignore it in many churches black people were told not to worry too much about living decently here on earth heaven would be the reward of those who toiled and suffered throughout their earthly existence so effective was the church in disseminating this emphasis on the afterlife and future rewards in the celestial kingdom that even today we find a large segment of the black populaceespecially the older peoplestill hung up on not attempting to build treasures here on earth but in heaven this type of religious nonsense has reinforced a lifestyle that can be characterized as essentially fatalistic it is difficult to convey to some blacks the idea that one does not have to leave this world in just as wretched a condition as one came into it all too often many blacks act as if god himself prescribed the pattern and perimeters of their lives and that to attempt to alter these prescriptions would be futile not to mention contrary to his will now the black community finds itself in a transition stage which came on the heels of the great civil_rights movement we are caught between the moribund ethos of fatalism and the nascent ideology of black_poweror progressivism if you wish but old lifestyles which were so deeply ingrained do not die quickly and new ones do not take root overnight consequently we find ghetto organizations in which members have varying degrees of both lifestyles these organizations are somewhat schizophrenicexisting in more than one world and reflecting to a great extent the uncertainties and transitional states of the members but there are other factors which must be discussed before the current state of organizational development can be described and accounted for the reasons for the lack of trust and lack of group cohesiveness within black communities are historical various individuals have presented compelling arguments that much of the historical basis for these phenomena lie in the slavemaster relationships which forced blacks to relate to white superiors and to shun close association with black peers for whatever reasons the concepts of trust and group cohesion are not fully operative in most black communities the lack of trust is evident in different ways it shows in the recurring situations in which several leaders have to be on the board of directors of every organization of any import in the community of course other motivessuch as power status and influenceare present also it would seem that many leaders feel that unless they personally oversee every activity in the ghetto things will surely go awry the inability or unwillingness of various leaders to cooperate as equals has dire implications for the form that organizations take and more important for the pace of development march and simon  and other social scientists have shown that the limited cognitive abilities of an individual necessitates a differentiation of tasks and a decentralization of decisionmaking authority without such differentiation and decentralization development depends very substantially upon the finite energy and limited skills of a black elite the lack of group cohesion while not as pronounced as it was  or  years ago is yet another factor which has reverberations in ghetto organizations conflicting ideologies and the lack of trust combine to reinforce the american ideal of individualisman ideal which some blacks have taken far too seriously forgetting that man establishes and sanctifies ideals but seldom behaves in a manner which is consistent with those ideals some blacksfar too manyhave developed the ideology of individualism into a fine art this serves to obscure or negate the need for collective action and commitment to group goals this adherence to the philosophy of me first and everybody else second leads to the interesting and saddening situation in which a black professional to take just one  example declines to assist a community organization because he has prior obligationsto his wife his friends and the standards of his professional association it also leads to the disgusting even nauseating spectacle of certain prominent negroes being paraded around the nation by a houndstoothclad richard nixon as living proof that hardwork and individual effort are still the keys to success this lack of group cohesion is also at least partly responsible for the large number of violent crimes which black people perpetrate against other blacks one would be naive indeed to suppose that salutations of brother and sister have had an appreciable effect on the numbers of heinous offenses which occur each day in ghettos across the nation it would appear that the same system which bred the ghetto has set in motion forces which threaten to make a mockery of all the external shows of unity and brotherhood it is not so much that most black people do not recognize the mutuality of their interests and the commonness of their destiny rather it is that no one person or organization seems capable of sustaining for long periods of time the group effect which is the logical answer to group problems to turn to the influences exerted by ideologies we could if it were necessary classify them along several different dimensions but it is most useful for our purposes to note simply different ideologies do exist and then go on to show how these ideologies affect the performance of organizations the  national convention of the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp provides a ready example at that convention a heated debate arose at one point as to whether the organization had been and was still effective in fomenting change and ushering in progress for black people there were those who argued that much had been done and that black people were too close to their goals to turn aside an opposing faction retorted quite sincerely that black people were just as far away as ever from their goals and not a few individuals declared that the naacp had actually moved blacks backwards from where they were several years earlier implicit in the arguments of each faction were different sets of goals and priorities based upon different ideological perspectives this example merely points out the organizational difficulties that arise when several conflicting ideologies are operative in one organization such ideological debates are not peculiar to the naacp recent months have witnessed an increasing number of fiery confrontations between various groups of ideologists within the same organization those community organizations which have thus far escaped the heat of such debates should not feel that they are beyond the danger zone ideological confrontations have a way of rudely imposing themselves upon organizational pacificity ideologies can be useful to the extent that they give purpose direction and even feelings of moral excellence to an organization but like a person an organizaiton cannot go in two or three different directions simultaneously when the ideologies of its constituents become so  divergent that the performance of the whole unit is impaired one of several things will occur the organization will become ineffective until the strongest of the ideologies subdues the others or the organization will suffer a defection andor expulsion of those who cannot implant their ideology upon the total unit especially the decisionmaking center or the adherents to all contesting ideologies will continue to battle until the whole organization is reduced to but a caricature of that which existed initially one has but to look around to observe these three processes in action within any number of black organizations it is on the subject of ideology that we wish to proceed into a discussion of organizational development in the economic realm of black communities a word of caution is appropriate here the reader is asked to remember that these characterizationslike all such generalizationsare necessarily but rough approximations to reality and are not presented as the ultimate truth about ghetto organizational development this is but one way of ordering our understanding of how black organizations are faring in the initiation and implementation of change and progress one of the most intriguing developments in the black community is the dilemma over whether to push for progress via community development corporations and the like or via individual entrepreneurs there are several issues involved in this choice the dilemma revolves around the issues of widespread participation by the black community in its own development the psychological and sometimes economic needs of the entrepreneur to do his own thing without the bother of seeking the approval of the community the peculiar criteria by which the white financial source decides to extend or withhold credit and the often critical tradeoff between shortterm purely economic gain and longerterm investment in human resources which ensures future successes or both economic and noneconomic natures the black entrepreneur is a new breed of aggressive energetic black capitalist in his struggle to build a successful enterprise he is both helped and hindered by a wide spread belief within the black community that black capitalism which has been called a contradiction of termsshould not be allowed to replace the oppressive system of white capitalism this belief forces the typical black entrepreneur to modify his operations to provide broad social service eg training for the unskilled daycare centers for working mothers etcfor his employees and others in the community the black entrepreneur is helped to the extent that his provision of or his statement of his intentions to provide social services enables him to obtain loans and even equity capital which would not normally be available to him the tendency of white bankers and other capital suppliers to base loan decisions to black entrepreneurs on criteria such as how much social development will accrue to the community as a result of the operations make it expedient for the shrewd black entrepreneur to devise paper schemes for social services in order to obtain needed capital there are obvious dangers inherent in this situation first a community which is already suspicious of this new phenomenon of black capitalism and of the intentions of black entrepreneurs is likely to monitor very closely the progress of these persons in providing promised social services failures of black entrepreneurs to deliver is already creating increased disaffection for capitalism and entrepreneurship as vehicles for black development second the management talents of black entrepreneurs are already being severely taxed to create and sustain efficient and profitable operations black entrepreneurs see themselves as businessmen not as social workers and they resent efforts by white financiers and black community leaders to force them to assume social service obligations they have had enough contact with bankers and sources of capital to realize that white businessmen obtain their loans throueh sound economic policies which appear on the financial statements and not through their willingness and ability to provide social services most black entrepreneurs have neither the time nor the personnel to fulfill social service promises any time and resources devoted to running a nursery center are resources unavailable for use in the economic sphere of the operations hence black entrepreneurs are involved in a very complex game of trying to operate like any other businessman in a community and financial environment in which they must appear to be more than just businessmen third white financiers through their strange insistence upon seeing a proposal for social services before they lend to black entrepreneurs are burdening the entrepreneur with the problems previously mentioned perahps it is to the white establishments advantage to do so in a very real sense they are encouraging a dangerous con game only the black entrepreneur and the black community can lose it is not the financing source that has to walk that delicate line which separates in the communitys mind exploitation from development all of this is not to say that black entrepreneurs are insensitive to the need for social services in the ghetto nor is this to say that they are not in agreement with the longrun goals of the community black entrepreneurs are as concerned as anyone else about the lack of social services in the ghetto but they question whether they as fledgling businessmen are the ones upon whom the responsibility falls for providing such services they rightly ask why it is that the black community does not put more pressure on city and state and other governmental units to provide for the welfare of community residents black capitalists voice fears that the black community will never build a solid business structure if wouldbe businessmen are shackled by noneconomic burdens so far we have dealt with only the environmental factors which constrain the black entrepreneur looking now at the internal operations of entrepreneurdominated organizations we can see that he faces the problems in a different sort first the entrepreneur dominates the organizationbeing at once its guiding spirit its designer its key man and its primary politician he usually moves at such a rapid pace that his ideas outstrip the ability of his skeletal organization to structure itself to absorb the new undertakings thus the typical entrepreneurdominated organization is likely to be undermanned illdefined and crisisprone because of the lack of sufficient numbers of trained black managers in the ghetto and elsewhere the entrepreneur finds it difficult to hire the persons he needs to develop his organization this is one of his chief organizational problems entrepreneurs are not noted for their ability to develop the organizations necessary to manage the new enterprises that they pull together usually their time is fully occupied in just negotiating the acquisition or development of new operations and not infrequently this is the activity they enjoy most can the entrepreneurs organization survive let alone grow in the absence of trained managers to supervise the operations if it does it will do so mainly because of its adeptness in riding out crises many entrepreneurs lack even the staff necessary to maintain efficient accounting systems hence they seldom know what their profitability cash positions etc are at any point in time perhaps the greatest difficulty the black entrepreneur faces is conflict with representatives of the community over the issue of com munity participation in the development process this conflict is of course ideological in nature briefly many community leaders want to involve as large a portion of the ghetto as possible in the planning and implementation of change and developmentpolitical economic and social they argue that black people have for too long sat and let others do for and to them and that a community which helps draw the blueprints for its own development will be committed to the execution of that blueprint going beyond the participationcommitment argument community leaders argue that the low level of selfconfidence and skills among ghetto residents necessitates a development program which actually trains and educates the residents as an integral part of the process in short it is an argument for total development with the emphasis on human resources a fast pace of economic development is not the primary goal of most community leaders because they realize that such a fast pace may outdistance the participation of the majority of the community residents against the model for economic development which the black capitalist represents many community leaders offer the community development corporation as a more desirable model the community development corporation cdc is held to be the organizational mechanism by which blacks can develop a sense of mastery over their immediate environment both physical and human and over their destiny as a people the sense of mastery which a strong cdc is deemed capable of developing is important because it facilitates constructive participation from all community residents the cdc can and does take many different organizational forms nevertheless there is a common theme which distinguishes the cdc from other organizations in the economic realm it is the theme of broad ownership of the organizations enterprises and of course participation in the decisionmaking processes of the cdc accompanies the theme of broad ownership the cdc allows community residents more than just a fraction of the ownership and a voice in the direction of development under this form of economic organization it is also possible for residents to acquire new job skills and to upgrade existing skills because the community at large has more decisionmaking authority in the cdc than in the private black corporation the community is more effective in forcing the cdc to be more responsive to the noneconomic needs of the people frequently the cdc is involved in economic ventures solely because of the noneconomic objectives that are made possible thereby thus the cdc promotes the development of skills and confidence throughout the community against these advantages there are several problems of the cdc first the recruitment and motivation of topnotch administrators and staff personnel is not easy because of the many attractive jobs which private corporations offer it takes a person with a real sense of dedication to the cdc approach to forego attractive opportunities elsewhere second the cdc official has to be able to deal with that sometimes nebulous usually contradictory and always changing entity called the community it is sometimes quite distressing to discover that the communityor the body of persons interested in wielding influencevaries from issue to issue and from decision to decision the cdc official must accept his role as a servant of the community yet he has to relate to a variety of governmental and private organizations in order to accomplish the cdcs objectives his job is not an easy one because he is highly visible and often subject to the sometimes whimsical will of the community to complicate matters even more the community usually contains strong factions of nearly every ideology that the combined civil_rights and black_power movements have produced the cdc official has to be agile and thickskinned in order to ward off the poison darts that are occasionally hurled by the various factions another serious problem that the cdc official has is that of trying to balance community education and training with economic objectives the cdc loosely defined is a school a social service agency and a business the administrator has to be astute in directing the organizations energies among these several tasks he has to make the decision whether to call in experts or let the community do it through trial and error for example he has to know when to contract with outside firms to build a needed shopping center and when to create a subsidiary which will train blacks to build it this is the type of tradeoff between shortterm and longterm advantages which must be made in organizations with multifaceted objectives finally cdcs face financial problems not only is the government sometimes a rather capricious source of capital and operating funds but it is also an entity which responds most readily to strong political pressures and it is still true that the strongest political pressuresthose that make public bodies actexist outside the black community in most instances administrators of cdcs are not infrequently caught between the mandate of the community and the restrictions imposed by governmental funding sources at the crux of such binds is the determination of black communities to control their own destiny and the reluctance of public bodies to accede control however as it becomes increasingly difficult for political bodies to control the actions of the black community this bind will become less problematical and cdc administrators will devote less time to complex political battles with outside agencies will the cdc form of development work community leaders argue that it will work because black people have faith in it and because the people will demand an ever increasing role in the whole development process many assert that unless the peoples voices are heard in the development process increased alienation and bitterness will result the people ultimately have ways of eliminating that which is unacceptable and alienating it remains to be seen whether economic development in the black community will take the organizational form of black capitalism or community capitalism in either case it behooves us to be clear about the organizational choices and consequences of those choices it appears certain that the black community  years hence will reflect greatly the types of organizational decisions being made by black people today 
a short storu
by walter myers
t had taken two minl i utes at the most he standing at the regis ter with the woman as she stuffed the money into a brown paper bag and jeff turner standing with a gun on the man something had happened maybe the man moved a little too quickly and jeff shot him down the old man fell his silver rimmed glasses dangling from his face by one ear his hands crossed in front of him the woman screamed and fell down on her knees next to her husband and began to moan quickly began to moan as if she had been waiting for something to happen and had been saving the moan moses looked over the counter and saw the man lying there the blood creeping across his white apron front his face trying to hold a twist of agony and even then it was slipping away then he was still one knee still up and one hand pointed towards the beer freezer they used to ask down where he came from in biloxi how long forever was and they used to answer two to foteen years for a nigger two to foteen years    the first time that moses had come up for parole after seven years the other guys had said that he might as well forget it it was an automatic turndown maybe if he had just killed a nigger it would have been different but not a white man when moses walked in they were sitting around the big dark mahogany table laughing and joking among themselves and he had thought they might be in a good mood he said that he was sorry about the guy that was killed and that he hadnt actually done it that jeff turner had actually done the shooting and that he had given evidence for the state it didnt matter they said no and it all seemed so fast after waiting for seven years and the next time he had asked them please to give him another chance and even got down on his knees making the guard nervous and begged them as hard as he could but they said no again he had to stay somebody said it wasnt as much time to go as had already past that night sitting in the corner on the stool was as long as he remembered his whole life being all the guys said that they might give him a chance the next time around if he kept himself straight he intended to do just that he had to get out he was beginning to forget how things were on the outside what mornings felt like and what just running loose was like and how good food used to taste on sundays and he didnt know whether he remembered how a woman really felt or just remembered himself remembering a few years back he thought of himself in the country in mississippi near biloxi or laurel getting his high tops wet in the morning before the air cleared from the dampness his mother was still in biloxi waiting come on home she wrote before death gets here and take me moses wanted to see his mama again that was for sure he hadnt seen her since then and that was a long time he was nearly  now a long piece gone from being a boy well it was going to come up again his chance for being free and everyone told him that he would be let go this time for sure even when he had done some work for the warden the warden m had said for him to keep clean because he had a chance to be free this time when the warden said that he went back to his cell and looked at himself deep in the mirror he was still black and walleyed but he was going to be free   bbs  hey nigger i hear you going home in a few months what made the guard jenkins so sinister was his eyes almost colorless in his pale face dont call me no nigger man moses kept his head down what should i call you whitey i got a name moses hated working under jenkins it seemed that every time he did jenkins pushed him a little harder he finished putting the last of the old library books in the carton to be taken to the incinerator what kind of man did you kill nigger i didnt kill nobody you in for murder aint you moses didnt answer i said you in for murder aint you jenkins raised his voice and edged forward you want this box tied or should i just carry it like this tie it moses turned to tie the box he had just looped the rope around the box once when he felt the pain in his crotch a wave of nausea swept over him as he sank to the ground in a second he was up turned and faced jenkins he crouched low hands spread apart come on nigger hit me youll have about  years to think about it so make it a good one come on shine im gonna tell on you jenkins moses breathed deeply his chest heaving his eyes glued to jenkins im gonna tell the warden on you  what the other guards gonna think if you tell the warden on me huh they gonna think you some bad nigger and they gonna have to get you right right moses knew that jenkins was right if there was anything at all against him even if there was some question to it he might not get his parole he picked up the box and started off to the incinerator jenkins walked behind him sliding his feet as he walked i hear you going to do some work over at the wardens office next week moses didnt answer you aint talky huh well i tell you one thing i bet that nigger clerk that williams that you wouldnt make probation this time bet him five dollars he didnt want to bet but i said whats wrong dont want to bet on your own race he bet then man he sure hates being a nigger he thinks hes gonna get white brownnosing around the guards anyhow i bet him so naturally you aint gonna get out moses stopped at the incinerator and handed over the box of books to the burning squad books from the library any good ones the dark slimfaced youth asked yeah some real hot ones jenkins answered come on we got more work to do we got to go over to the plant room and wipe up real good i got to go to the bathroom moses said now thats just too bad come on or ill write you up for sloughing off i got to go and that aint no damn sloughing off you raise your voice to me one more time and im gonna beat your ass silly nigger long as you got that uniform you can meet me some day when im free free you aint never gonna hear that word long side your name nigger i keep telling you that why you have to insist on disbelieving me they reached the plant room and jenkins signed the sheet for the guard to open the door there was a phone inside the plant room that the guard would use when they were finished only one of the huge generators was operating see all that oil on the floor over there go clean it up moses had cleaned the plant room before he went over to the sawdust box and filled the small scoop from it with this he started spreading it all over the oil watching it bead up around the sawdust tell me about the guy you killed nigger you know we dont have to talk about it jenkins thems prison rules moses hardly had the words out when jenkins club smashed across the small of his back the pain searing down the back of his legs he turned and grabbed the stick jenkins was only a foot away from him his thin lips tightened into a smile hit me nigger moses released the stick look jenkins i aint done nothing to you why dont you give me a break tell me about the guy you killed he was just a guy why did you kill him i didnt kill him you in jail cause you didnt kill him he slapped moses the sound was lost against the noise of the generator the guy i was with shot him was he white or black the guy you shot i didnt shoot him he was black moses lied you know what i saw the other day nigger what i saw that made my damn blood boil just leave me alone will you look i get three dollars when i sell my blood next week ill give you that ill tell you what i saw i saw that nigger with the bald head that big nigger on h block screwing a white boy you mean jake thats his name jake dont go that way you know jake dont go that way you calling me a liar i aint call you a liar why dont you give me a break when the last time you had some had some what some woman moses turned and continued spreading sawdust on the floor     the next morning at breakfast the warden came around and talked to some of the men he did once in a while when he came over near moses he walked so fast that moses didnt have a chance to say anything to him     i got chewed out about how that plant room wasnt properly cleaned they accusing me of sloughing off cause you didnt clean it good jenkins prodded moses along towards the plant house with his stick you tole me to stop moses protested shut your ugly black face nigger jenkins signed the paper to get into the plant house as soon as the door shut behind them he hit moses across the back with his stick big as you are nigger you aint nothing you hear that you aint nothing moses was already on the way to the saw dust bin you married no you got a mama yeah she put out you dont have the right to be  talking about nobodys name whats wrong with you you supposed to be a guard and    you ever have a white woman no you lying bastard i bet you picked up some white tramp someplace moses finished spreading the sawdust and started sweeping the floor you can tell me what was it like was it any different aint no use to being sullen lord moses thought dont let me get next to that man tell me about it and maybe ill lighten up a little moses continued to sweep he saw jenkins coming near and stiffened for the blow jenkins swung his stick again and again catching moses on his shoulders and arms moses tried to cover up his head and jenkins lifted a knee into his crotch moses fell to his knees he saw jenkins foot coming again but he couldnt move fast enough as it sank into his stomach dont hit him back he warned himself the foot came again always in the same place moses tried to curl up again again from the back and again until moses couldnt see until the nausea was more than anything else until his crying and helplessness shamed even him until he thought again about getting his high tops wet in the mississippi long grass at last it stopped and moses lay listening to the awful sound of his own breathing the sweat dripped from his face and the taste of puke was strong in his mouth somewhere in the back of his consciousness the generator grumbled like a brewing storm moses tried to stop his head from clearing he felt as if something was touching his knee sliding along his thigh fumbling with the front of his pants there was another sound quiet even close to his ear it took him a long while to realize that it was jenkins crouching over him hitting jenkins was more than good god it was glorious and every time that the thin white face jerked away from his fists every time that the eyes rolled to the top of his head so that only the white showed every time the blood spurted from the twisted nose and the face reddened moses felt better it was as if a great burden had been lifted from him and there was no use in stopping just because the figure in front of him was still no freedom had gone with the first blow and there was no use in stopping now until the swinging arm black and muscular could swing no more now the frenzied rhythm of a moment ago had slowed to an occasional smack against the inert figure that moses held across his lap then even that stopped and it was quiet for a while almost solemn in the stillness and then moses laughed him a laugh and once he had started there wasnt much use to stopping

hats right i y  sent the letter thats rightdavis im pease t f meet you too one of you can sit here by the bed one of you can sit here heres the ash tray thanks fresh out and i still dont feel like much walking thats all right the nurse wont mind good now ill tell you the whole thing and all im asking is that you print it like it is i told you how they messed it up down here first of all most people didnt like himthe prof we called himbut he was really some guy he was brilliant if you ask me but he was strange and strange looking very tall all angles you know with a long bony face frankly if you didnt know otherwise youd take him for a white man in fact many people did say that he was white maybe he was but like i always say i dont see why a white man would want to be a negro in fact sometimes i dont see why anybody would want to course thats one of the funny things about prof he didnt have to be a negro but he said he was fact he was always trying to convince you that he was or trying to convince himself i dont know i swear he made you more race conscious than anybody i know and you never knew how to take him he was always making you mad calling you out of your namein class too man and you couldnt ignore him believe me hed read you right theredumb nigger you know the magic word and he didnt give a damn i think the administration was scared of him either that or they knew he was a heavy stud but like i said you couldnt ignore him one time i was downtown with a couple of fellows waiting for the bus and it was kinda crowded like everybody in town was waiting white folks too you know when up walks the damn prof togged to kill man continental and all that and you should see the gray chicks diggin him well here he is towering all over everybody like a great big playboy ad and what does he do as soon as he spots us he says hello spooks whats happening real jazzy like you know and the white folks looking all silly man because he knows us they dont know whether to laugh or to crap so we sort of talk for a while till he takes out this paper the afronyou know what i mean and starts talking about spooksl man i got so damn mad i liked to hit him and here he was enjoying it and all the patties were just looking man but they were squirming too he liked to make people squirm he told me so we got to be kinda tight after i left his class he kinda took to me i dont know why maybe because im real dark man like charcoalgray anyhow he told me that this whole business about race was stupid and the only way to destroy it was to embarrass people out of their pride well he had a good point and he had all kinds of arguments real convincing too and i think it was then that i halfway got to understand him he was always stirring up stuff though you know he nearly caused a riot downtown in one of the theaters he was with this fay girl see and this indian couple came in and sat down by him man he started to perform you know talking about niggers and mess like that so the indian guy jumped up and started lecturing on american hypocrisy and the ushers came over and everybody was raising cain and all the time the girl was trying to tell him honey they arent niggers theyre foreigners then suddenly the prof said well i didnt know youall were really liberal anyhow he said real loud i just want you to know that im a negro they didnt believe him of course that made him mad goddamn it he shouted im a negro a niggah a bootunderstand a darky the people just laughed at him then he turned to the girl look baby doll im a nigger a greasy spook see and you been sucking my tongue all day that did it they almost wrecked the place i dont know how he got out alive that was his favorite story and the white papers gave it about five lines he was a heckuva fellow and like i said didnt nobody like him worth a damnbut me and a couple other kids and i guess what we liked was the way hed go around popping egosyou ever put a cigarette to a tick anyhow like thatpoptake the dean well hes a good stud but hes the pious type you know always getting up in assembly with the glad tidings and the harkbacktothe religious ideals of the foundingfathers mess anyhow he called the prof in they say to talk to him about going to chapel and all that the prof put a whole lot of points on him so he left him alone for a while well something else comes uplisten im gonna tell it like it is same thing happens everywhere elsewell i tell you some of these campus broads had eyes for the prof so they put a little pressure on him and my man started chopping right and left it caused a big mess but they hushed it up and put  him on probation and all that the way they do in big time but they couldnt hush up the chicks though and he had a tough rep with the ladyfolks yessir anyhow next thing i heard he was chopping the deans ole lady no lie man it was something terrible like i dont know why they didnt get rid of the cat anyhow the dean called him in but the prof told him if he didnt leave him alone hed you know make the ole babe quit him and like that yeah man he got into a whole lot of stuff rough parties and things you know that guy even married a prostitute no lie ugly chick toospitterpure scheaffers anyhow he brought her to all the concerts and art festivals and things like that and made people respect her and they did because they were afraid of him and he got a big charge out of it then when he got tired he put the broad down said she was cutting out on him as if he gave a damn well that gives you some ideas of what he was like except that every now and then if you could put up with him you could see that he was just jiving i remember the time i saw him down in the bottom talking with a bunch of tough looking kids i know they were tough i used to live down there he was just cutting up laughing and kidding with them and they were kidding him just having a ball he didnt see meill never forget that id never even seen him smile before that is a friendly smile and here he was laughing like mad and you know one thing he used to dance with those kids he knew it allmambo chacha stroll rubberleg madison shimmy everything he really goofed behind music guys like bartok and miles and thelonious monk you know he really dug sounds some times you know wed go to his place and sit down on this stray pad he had on the floor and hed give us peanuts and syrup and sometimes dates and wed you know try to dig too i   and i forgot to tell you the cat could lecture too no lie you name it he knew it i mean really knew it i mean like hed tie up guys who were specialists visiting lectures and folks like that and he was always giving the papers the ass he was a terrible terrible cat i guess he must have been around  or so but he looked younger sometimes sometimes he looked older it was hard to place him like ive been saying all along he seemed to change according to the angle that you saw him from or the situation that you saw him in one time i got the feeling that he hadnt made up his mind at all and that he was just trying on selves for size i dont know i had a weird conversation with him about three months before the happenings and it left me confused for a long time but as i think about it now it helped me to realize what was what not only about the prof but about a whole lot of things we were over at his place sipping a lil tea and feeling nice when he starts talking you know halfway to himself first then to me about the situation somehow he always got around to it i was tired of it but i didnt want to hurt the guys feelings so i listened at him take up the white mans burden kid he hasnt got the courage to take it up himselfnot the burden of empire the burden of conscience we are the worlds conscience now as the jew used to be yeah year i was real nice man he could talk all he wanted to remember jesus and simon the cyrene i looked at him well there you have it two ways the nigger taking the white mans burden but also jesus the eternal nigger carrying the burden of the world simon was really riding christs back as we all have done but simon earned the right he was a nigger too he was making me mad but i kept my cool and kept sipping the tea as i said before you cant ignore him baby he keeps pressing you he was very solemn your niggemess is divine boy its the best damn part of you im not a nigger i said i was still cool no he said youre not a nigger youre a negro a colored person thats right youre a damn fool he snapped but maybe one day youll grow up and be a nigger look at me im serious a man has to develop into a nigger hes not born that way the nigger is not necessarily a negro you know the negro is not unique in fact he has no real existence hes just a sunburnt savage or some white mans shadow wherever you find him but the nigger hes alive hes real webster says nigger is a vulgar and contemptuous name for a negro thats what webster says but how would he know he wasnt a nigger nigger is more than a name nigger is a state of being i was mad enough to puke well its a state i dont dig i see you dontso what does nigger mean to you anyhow dont you knowit means that nobody gives a damn about you cause youre black they despise you they spit on you lynch you say you stink you steal youre oversexed youre dumb yes now what about the negroes who call themselves niggers they mean the same thing sometimes he said sometimes they dont when a guy calls his wife nigger he means something  else or when he tells nigger jokes where the spook is always outfoxing the white man and chopping the fay chicks nigger means lots of things well nigger means just one thing to the white man a black ape with rheumatism in the joint he smiled curiously yes now why is the white man so fascinated by that image ill tell you why it both repels and attracts him why because its the image of his lost manhood the image of his own primitive amoral self with all its brawling black fecundity oh jesus i thought its the eternal image of the dark force within us the force that civilization is destroying the force with many namesthe devil chango dionysus bacchus the fisher king the green knight gargantua osiris buddha and last but not least jesus christ youre crazy im not talking about your sweet lil blueeyed jesus im talking about jesus the tiger yeah some jazz black jesus the tiger well if he was so much of a tiger why didnt he make like samson instead of acting like a punk youre very young he said sarcastically the fact that he didnt make like samson made him superior to samson he didnt make like samson no he made like a nigger oh man i got up im sick of all this niggerness im cutting i thought you were perceptive he said but youre just like the rest youre sick of the niggerness so youre cutting all right then cut but where the hell are you cutting toill tell you to be a shadow a clown holding your whiteness before you like a mask well the mask doesnt fool anybody but yourself because when mr charley sees you he doesnt see your mask at all he sees a mirror if hes benevolent he sees you as his own smug reflection if hes not he sees through the mirror sees his real self in you and what he sees terrifies him he hates it and scorns it and spits at it because he doesnt have the courage to accept it as himself all right old mirrorhead cut i stared at him he was talking a whole lot of crazy stuff i thought he was blowing his stack but he was real solemn id never seen him like that before thats a trick mirror too by the way he said it also reflects inward and you can also see through it quite tricky boy you can see in it and through it it shows you all kinds of things but its damn sure hard to tell which ones are you i gave him one hard mad look and made it i didnt see much of him after that as i said i was fed up with all that niggerness after all i came to college to get myself an education to make something out of myself hell i wasnt ashamed of being colored and all that but i didnt consider myself any goddamn nigger i dont care what mr charley thought all the shooting and cutting and crapping and raping and scraping i was sick of all that shit i mean damn sick like the man says sick unto death jack and i wanted to rise above that i wanted to be somebody after i got my degrees and things people would respect me well thats what i thought then that was two weeks ago i was young then yeah baby im serious yeah im just  but like im  now since what happened you dont just chop off pieces of yourself like the prof said and you have to look real hard in the mirror and through the mirror and in all the goddamn mirrors that come flitting your way yeah i guess that if a fay cat calls me a nigger now i wouldnt get mad at all id just kinda look at him and smile anyhow the last time i saw him was at the sitins you remember thats what you wanted to hear about anyway it was a nice day in november when our kids got in on the act we had been reading about the action down in north carolina and thought that maybe we could jolt some egos here in virginia so after this big secret campus rally we slipped downtown and jack we struck hit six stores the first day the white folks were surprised they thought there was an invasion from mars or something and cops were swarming all over the streets with the k mutts ready to chew up any black butt they could but i have to give them credit they didnt mess with us fact they protected us but you could see that they werent too particular we had all kinds of signs you know like the real thingdont eat where you cant buy support our cause segregation is unchristian and stuff like that the kids really trooped out starryeyed and dignified as hell thats the thing that surprised the white folks you know the dignity and the way the kids dressed you know real collegiate they didnt dig that at all man they really must think were a pack of savages all the papers you know well dressed well behaved you know stuff like that man they dont know whats happening these kids tog all the time and theyre just like any other kids it really made you feel good to see them sticking together like that course ill tell you the truth some of those guys didnt really dig the movement you see passive resistance in fact i didnt really dig it not because i was chicken or stupid or anything like that but i have a heckuva temper man and i didnt know whether i could stand listening to some mudgy fudgy call me nigger to my face ill tell you something else  wasnt a christian even so the reasoning behind it you know the brotherhood jive well that didnt move me at all anyhow here i was in the mess man im always in the mess anyhow we split up and went to about six stores like i told you we sat  down at the counters and tried to order stuff but the babes wouldnt serve us just stood there acting silly trying to pretend that we werent there at all man that really peed me offthey just give you that blank stare like you dont exist its a bitch im telling you i was almost glad when the trouble came first the storemanager came and asked us out we asked him for service he asked us out again so we got out our books and started readingwords you knowi was real tense man my stomach was so upset that i couldntve eaten anything even if they had served me all kinds of weird mess was running through my mind i dont know how we made it but i didnt want to let on like i was nervous we pulled it off for a couple hours then left when we got outside the stuff really started to boil a bunch of young rebs were following us waving reb flags and calling us black niggers and things man i really wanted to get loose but i kept talking to myself kept telling myself about the cause and you know something i started believing in the cause funny man funny there were cops and dogs and reb flags all over everywhere but i wasnt scared anymore not even mad later when i got back to the campus i found out that they had arrested a bunch of the kids that night we gave them a big party next day we started the picket line we had all kinds of rallies and things and everybody kept talking about the cause about the strategy but thats where the hell really started there were about  of us in the line it was november baby but hot hotand here we are tramp tramp the spooks are marching and here comes some sonavabitch and throws a block on you and nearly knocks you down now here comes a sweet old lady who turns up her nose like shes smelled something though christ knows she couldve smelled my aching feet and all kinds of expressions on those faces but the worst ones were the blank ones those that didnt pay any attention at all and here you are carrying the goddamn sign not even making a ripple and i thought about the prof and i was digging all the talk about the mirrors and things and i thought to myself that jesus christ himself could be in the picket line and these crackers still wouldnt budge i had been out there for almost an hour absorbing all the jazz when a woman walked up to me and hawked and spat in my lace man i started to swing the sign to cuss to crap to cry but i didnt do anything but try to wipe my face i guess i might even have been crying some i was so mad anyhow i looked up and what the hell did i see abraham lincoln thats rightabraham lincoln you think im crazy i thought i was too everything was getting blurry what kinda crap was this he started talking to me and i thought i was nuts the people passed around us chattering the cars buzzed in the streets and the kids paraded with their signs i was still mad but i could see now that he was phony yet somehow i wasnt sure i wasnt sure of anything as i looked up at him he took out his handkerchief and wiped the snot off my face and said with malice toward none it was the goddamn profi caught his voice with charity for all that big lanky phony that goddamn niggerham lincoln i wanted to cuss him and break the crappy stick over his head he just stood there as though he actually was lincoln then he got in the picket line and nobody paid any attention to him but us but me what was his gimmick was he mocking us again who the hell was the sonofabitch anyhow i was going to ask him first chance i got but as we reached the back of the store a car pulled to the curb and three guys jumped out and started banging on the prof i tried to run round to the front to call the cops but one of them hit me real hard thats all i remember i dont know how we got there but the next thing i remembered was this clearing in the woods somewhere we mustve been a good little ways from the highway because you could barely hear the sound of the cars i was groggy and sick and suddenly i felt this great big throbbing in my skull i put my hand to my head there wasnt any blood but there was a hickey big enough to fool a guinea hen i tried to get up and i fell the bastards had handcuffed my ankles they sure dig the tv i was telling myself wisely and i managed to get to my knees when i realized that somebody was watching me he was tough and tall and red dark hair i remember with the elvis type sideburns the jeans and all the other jazz but no leather jacket just an ordinary gabardine windbreaker he stood with his hands on his hips like an ad for levis or something grinning well now mr niggermr college niggerwe got a surprise for you i didnt say anything i was scared baby no lie say now niggermr nigger we goin fix yall up real fine give you somethin to write home about you like to sit down dont you i stared at him you hear me nigger he kicked me in the chest and laughed when i tumbled over on my back ya wanna sit down next to white women now dont you go on say it say it goddamnit when we through with you you wont wanna sit down for the rest of your goddamn life i mustve looked scared he seemed to get a sudden spasm of  satisfactionkicks he took a razor blade out of his pocket and walked up to me and pressed it against my throat and the sweat popped out all over me and i felt this warm trickle down my leg he reared back and roared he was really getting his kicks dont worry mr nigger he said after a while we aint goin kill you just goin make you safe goin make a real man outta you i didnt know what he was talking about but i had read the colored papers and i had ideas and jack i was scared scared sick you rotten mucker fother i was screaming in my mind but the words couldnt get past the vomit from somewhere deep in the woods there came a long animal cry it was the prof theyd done something awful to him i could hear them laughing and cussing they were drunk pretty soon i could hear them coming back to the clearing the dry leaves and things crackling as they walked there must have been about ten or twelve of them two of them were older fellows about  one of them had a razor in his hand and another had a dauber that had been dipped in pitch drag him back there with the other one someone said hell do it here let the nigger bleed no dont want no killin just goin fix him up they grabbed me and thats all i remember when i woke up again i couldnt move there was a burning all over my chest and i couldnt move my legs at all like somebody had dropped a big rock on me or something i saw the blood and my stomach gave out i cant stand to see blood i puked all over the place somebody put a wet cloth to my face and my senses started to clear and i saw that it was a cop who did this to you boy he said but i couldnt talk somebody calledit was another copthere were cops all over now they found the prof and brought him out on a stretcher three or four cops gathered around him looking half puzled half amused one of them was finishing the first aid what the hells going on whats the gimmick abe lincoln well he shouldve stayed dead hes in the wrong territory anyhow aw quit it you guys this is some actor type guy looking for publicity he damn sure got it its a goddamn shame theyd denut christ if they caught him talking to niggers this guy is a nigger you kiddin he looks white to me checked his identification didnt help any he had cards for both white and colored their voices were hazy in my mind there was a siren screaming somewhere and dogs barking cops were all over the place i could just see the prof lying there his pants were all bloody and the blood was caked on his face i knew that he wasnt going to make it even with the first aid he was already in shock i retched again but this time i didnt pass out here at the hospital they told me that the hoods didnt have time to rob both my jewels well thats not too bad one is enough but i wasnt worrying about myself i was thinking about the prof and all the crazy things he used to do and just who he really was and why did he want to let himself suffer like that like an animal he didnt have to he couldve told them that he was a white man or something or that he was just trying to gimmick up the niggers picket line it was almost as though he had asked for it what was he trying to prove and who the hell was he and what a hell of a way for a man to die you know i was thinking about that when you guys walked in and you know i was feeling bad man bad then the thought came to me and i dug the whole thing the cat was a nigger yeah baby niggernot nigger like negro but the magic word

enny loman had enough money to buy two reefers or two pills he wasnt sure which to get he weighed the alternatives the reefers would be mellow he knew where he could cop some good strong grass and he might like the kaleidoscopic effects he got from the weed he felt like digging some coltrane sides tonight but then somebody might be using the gangs layout and he couldnt dig or smoke in peace in that case if he ran by there first to check it out and somebody was thought he there theyd probably ask him  what he was going to get into tonight and he would surely end up having to share his jive with someone maybe two or three someones and then he would only have a lightweight high that wouldnt last no time naw he wouldnt do that    he could buy the pills that was probably the hippiest thing to do cause fact was you didnt have to do much sharing of them a dude wasnt expected to split em in half and turn somebody else on and everybody knew that one pill made you sick before it made you high so hed have the two pills all to himself but he was wary of them the high was cool except that it made him sleepy and he would go into a nod anywhere any time even while he was talking to someone and especially vice versa and they made him have a loose tired weightless but weighed down feeling then too he had vowed the last time hed had pills not to take any more it had been two weeks ago he remembered what had happened to him he had been on his way downtown to take in a james bond flick met one of his partners lou jean on the kedzie l track lou jean was a poorass puny nigger with no daddy and a parttime momma he had nine sisters and brothers and once benny had seen them fight over two slices of stale bread yeah he had been glad he could help him out they had been partners since last year when they had both got kicked out of school the same day for the same reason gangbanging lou jean had turned him on to two reds and a yellowjack for  cents said he needed the dough for something to eat benny had ridden downtown and had stopped at the burger king for a hamburger and some french fries had washed the two reds down with his coke when nobody was looking he had left the walkin and had gone into the roosevelt theatre paid his fare took a seat waited after about  minutes he decided to take the yellowjack the reds were too slow he got up and went to the mens room it was empty he took his time and looked into the mirror at his full yellow face he was definitely his mothers child same thick nearly wavy hair and flat nigger nose same heavy set body yeah his mothers genes were as loud and dominant as her voice for a few moments he tried to visualize what his daddy might have looked like but all he could distinguish was a mixture of himself his momma and every man he had ever seen when he returned to his seat james bond was rapping to some broad with big titties and fists full of slick red hair for a second sean connerys face changed colors and was brown like his and the redhead was pearlie his girl yeah it was cool the pills must be working he sat back and relaxed and soon the dialogue was his i dig you baby we could do wonderful things together his body melted into the chair and his head felt like a drunken spinning top he felt that free wild reckless something bubbling up in his chest that made him ache to laugh to bare his teeth like a horse and howl with joy with abandon with something    yeah it was mellow after the movie he found his way to the l and somehow paid his fare and got on the train but he took the wrong train and it went south instead of west the next thing he knew somebody it was the conductor was shaking him telling him it was the end of the line he got off the l and went into a restaurant some coffee might help he had puked all over himself in the goddamn restaurant and a barrelshaped black lady had told him to pay his bill and get the hell out he had reached into his pocket for his dough no wallet aw man someone had wasted him on the l while hed been out he found  cents in change had enough left over to call his aunt who lived on the south side and to tell her to come pick him up ooooo hed been sick he had puked all over himself in the alley behind the restaurant and he had smelled ugh but all that had happened two weeks ago and it wasnt gon be like that tonight naw he wasnt going on no train rides no movies uhuh none of that shit none of those  changes he might go over to pearlies and sit and rap to her and if he got sick or sleepy well she would take care of him see that he either got home or got to bed hell thats what women were for maybe her old lady was gon be out for the evening yeah he would cop the pills then decide what to do he had better hurry up it was almost  oclock and the cops were out for blood after the  curfew if he got busted they wouldnt do nothing but rough him up a little and cop his pills but shit that was bad enough no pills no money and no high that would be a drag he made it on over to the poolroom found lonnell the local pusher of everything and copped the pills he kidded around with some of his partners for a few minutes then split he was making it on down the street when he saw officer dobel waiting for the light at the comer uh uh fat white bastard officer dobel hated all cats wearing naturals and bennys half wavy hair was past the maybeheneedsahaircut stage if he could just make it to the alley maybe dobel wouldnt bother him tonight he had to get them pills in him that was the main thing dobel might be in a nasty mood and take him down for possession the light changed just as benny made it to the alley he stopped and bent over as if he had dropped something and popped the pills into his mouth he almost choked trying to swallow them dry but after the third attempt they went down he gagged a couple of times and then he was okay as he straightened up and breathed a sigh of relief the squad car pulled up along side the curb and the m cop slowly got out all right up against the wall sonofabitch you know goddamn well youre violating curfew you are under arrest yeah benny thought he had known it was going to happen well he would be cool the pills would begin to work soon and he would leave the funky cops right in their tight sweating skins and soar up into the universe everything was going to be okay at least for the time being he backed against the wall his hands up to show he wasnt protesting or anything and a mischievous smile slid onto his face cmon now he drawled why you dudes wanna mess with me im just a poor country boy out here trying to make it home  
the top hat motel 
by charles k moreland jr
awn was fast approaching and the black sky was mellowing into a purple tapestry q f gtars an j j ac y clouds leslie parham was racing the saturday sunrise to the top hat motel and his rendezvous with sharon sharon was dark and bony her lean shoulders offered little resting place for the straps of the multicolored sleeveless minidress she wore leslie peered into his rearview mirror at himself surveyed his short woolly hair with a widows peak in front his smooth broad nose and lips with a shadow of a mustache his high hairless cheekbones and thought that he should have been able to get a healthier broad than sharon sharon was practically the only girl who would take a chance with him though and he drove on mumbling he had spent  minutes driving by looking at and trying to pick up a girl at th street and western avenue all but two of the half dozen girls there looked at leslies white fourdoor valiant with black wall tires and his dark ivyleague suit and stood where they were whispering that he was a policeman one fat girl in a skirt about a foot above her knees walked up to him and said lets do the thang he looked at her fat thighs which touchedoverlappedall the way down to her knees and shook his head and breathed an inaudible no thanks another girl came up more cautiously than the other and looked at him with suspicion where do you work she asked  surprised leslie stammered wilshire and western what kind of work do you do well uh im an artist shit you must be the police the rest of the girls ignored him completely now and he sat there for  minutes drove around the block a couple of times and sat there for another five or  minutes with the engine idling for a time then stopped the radio on then off the parking lights on the high beams then off altogether after what seemed like an eternity of ignored signals to the girls he pulled the car onto western avenue and headed for home then he saw sharon she was down the hill about half a block from adams boulevard and two white men driving out of the arcadia sanitarium were calling at her she was walking away coolly adjusting the cheap red wig that sat high on her head ignoring them leslie slowed down and looked in her direction she waved at him and bent over to see into the car he slid the car over to the curb beside her you wanna date well yes    how much you spending how much is it what i mean is how much do you    how much can you spend you got  and three for the room well no have you ever dated before where do you work im an art student ive got  or  dollars okay meet me at the top hat motel down on western do you know where it is leslie said yeah and drove off to the motel when he got there he had trouble parking his car and a man with a beard in janitors overalls told him not to park in the red zone leslie was embarrassed when the man saw him he wished he were invisible the man told him to wait in front of the office that his date would be there soon and then continued a conversation with another man about an foot cabin cruiser in the parking lot sharon came and ushered him into the motel office to pay for the room the office was a dingy slot in the wall there was a single bare light bulb and no chairs the room couldnt have been more than fiveby and the window where the manager stood was covered by a board with only a tiny slot for her eyes and a threeinch one at the bottom for the money do i give her all the money damn you really havent dated before have you naw dont give her but threefifty a pair of varicose white hands counted leslie his change from a five dollar bill and a voice from behind the slot drawled heres the key go to room seven and leave the key in the door when youre finished inside the room which had a coinoperated television and air conditioner sharon was cheerful take off your clothes she said as she quickly unzipped her onepiece dress and wiggled out of her black lace slip  oh hell what are you doing she screamed as he reached in his back pocket for his wallet im just getting your money oh i thought you might have been getting ready to arrest me okay sharon stalked around the bed and in and out of the bathroom in her bra garter belt and stockings for a moment or two while leslie removed everything but his teeshirt and socks i better not take off everything he thought she didnt you just relax now while  find my vaseline she told him digging through her purse she dug out a tiny bottle and came out of the bathroom then she turned back the bedspread revealing only one sheet flopped down applied the lubricant and told leslie she was ready he was still standing in the spot where he had taken off his last shoe watching her every move asking questions yeah you can wear a rubber i do enjoy it sometimes but usually i dont notice its mind over matter leslie sat down on the bed about three feet from her staring at her frail looking body and the woolly black part of her that seemed to hang from the black lace garter belt he asked more questions and tried to ignore his own organ which seemed to literally shrink into his stomach i do it so my two kids can eat  she answered look if you want to hump for a long time or talk a lot itll cost you more money he said he didnt have any more money and sprawled on the bed beside her she smiled at him apologizing for the harshness of her tone and moved over to him and started caressing him look here for five dollars more ill give you some head too she said after a few minutes of caresses i cant afford it i havent got any more money youre clean arent you she asked and proceeded to service him not waiting for an answer leslie lay paralyzed for a moment this is no way to love he thought then he sat upright hey listen forget the rest of it okay im really sorry really he said putting on his clothes i cant tell you how sorry i really feel about this seriously dont think nothing of it    oh and my names sharon her head peeped out of the door as she shouted and he walked past the cabin cruiser the crisp morning air chilled him he noticed the sky had turned pink driving home past western and th street he noticed only one girl on the corner two men were standing with her as if they owned the street i would have had more dignity jackingoff he thought out loud as he drove by cursing himself and wondering why men spent their money like that i didnt want her so much as i wanted her to want me     the little known band in hollywoods haunted house was really good by leslies standards he had come to see them a half dozen times during their twoweek stand always alone and always optimistic none of his friends had ever heard of the village callers and when he tried in his tuneless way to sing their record which he always heard on the soul radio station he confused them more he stood in the back of the night club sipping a drink and shaking his head with the music he was totally oblivious to the people around him and he wondered how he could manage to get any one of the pretty girls there to notice him he didnt smoke but now he wanted a cigarette when he turned to the cigarette machine behind him a girl in white pants was standing there you shouldnt stand in front of the cigarette machine why not  well youll block the light and they need all the light they can get out there to write down telephone numbers oh really yeah really you should come out on the dance floor with me and dance all right but i dont know where to leave my books what kind of books are they poetry leroi jones i write poetry oh yeah leroi jones ive heard of him he wrote dutchman didnt he right on i like the way he writes youre pretty fine you know that oh yeah i mean youre really nice looking thank you she was chin high to the fivefoot inch leslie and she had curly black hair she was only slightly plump but he didnt notice that for almost  minutes you know you kind of look like shirley temple oh wow how come ive got to look like shirley temple well your natural its kind of curly and your rosy cheeks make you look kind of like a moppet a moppet oh wow i aint hardly a moppet she laughed they talked until the band announced that the club was closing they walked down hollywood boulevard away from the club and leslie offered her a ride to wherever she was going she had her own car but agreed to let him drive her to a bookstore she wanted to visit the bookstore was closed however so they rode around for nearly an hour and finally settled in a coffee shop for breakfast her name was jeanie  im in the black_panther party you ever hear of it she said spreading apple jelly on toast of course i have who hasnt i went down there one time to join even and wow it was a bitch what happened well as soon as i walked in everybody started looking at me like i had a tail then some dude started following me around following you yeah i know when im being followed and this brother was following me they must have thought you were the man yeah well i never went back ill just have to get it on by myself when the time comes dig ive got a little secondhand store down the street from the watts towers and we use that for a meeting place and some of the brothers and the party captain will be there tonight if youd still like to join okay well go now these eggs and hash browns aint saying nothing to my stomach you do kind of look like the man you know you arent are you he started the car no not really i mean look i work for the police department parttime im going to be perfectly honest with you cause i aint got nothing to hide i work for the pig department im an artist i do sketches of suspects from descriptions but i hate those punks down there sometimes when i get a description of a brother that did something you know like shoplifting or something i figure he did it cause he had to eat or just make it i kind of make the picture not look like him so he wont get caught i wouldnt do that though if he hit some old lady in the head or something i shouldnt be telling you all this because it sounds so damn corny but thats the way i feel you know its funny i was just thinking about this good friend of mine she just got out of jail and her husband is still in soledad she was telling me just the other night that if i was lined up with any three other people and somebody was asked to choose who had sold out to the man i would get picked every time right on she laughed i dont mean to laugh but you really would i was out here when they had the watts rebellion in  i called it the boston tea party at home in newport i was working for the newport police as an artist then but i actually wanted to waste some people i wished i knew how to make bombs not just molotovs bombs and mines honestly so that i could have wasted some police i saw so much stuff go down in newport it would turn your stomach and i know it must be  times as bad in a big city like los angeles no really im not on his side im definitely for the brothers the car slowed in front of a dark building with a large sign which read watts teen center where is the place thats the store ive got to get a new sign made itll either be my favorite things or libra  i havent made up my mind yet she said pointing to a driveway for him to park they went inside and were greeted by piles of musty old clothes and broken toys all over the floor the fourroom house had only one light bulb which had to be taken out by lesliebecause he could reach the ceiling without having to stand in a chairand moved from room to room the brothers must have gone home already but why dont you sit down for a while anyway jeanie said leslie sat on a dusty divan and jeanie spread clothes over the already cluttered floor making a pallet mattress which she covered with a bedspread jeanie sat down beside him and they talked she about the panthers he about his paintings that he would hang in her shop to sell before the first cut of the john coltrane album she had put on the record player was over they were rolling on the improvised mattress they kissed long and hard and his fingers and palms moved over her soft body by the end of the third album jeanie was pushing leslie away not now she said softly ive got to check in at the pad but ill see you again and then well have more time dont forget the paintings you promised me and oh ill get a ride to my car in the morning thanks for a nice evening  the university of southern californias bovard feld was well lighted and well patrolled panthers with twoway radios monitored and watched the eight or  unmarked and black and white police cars that monitored and watched them two dozen bearded peace and freedom party officials in blue chambray shirts with huey newton buttons sat nervously as eldridge cleaver campaigning for the partys presidential nomination concluded his address leslie was more interested in seeing jeanie again than in politics and he constantly scanned the crowd and the blueshirted female panther section for her face he had brought some of his drawings but he left the pad in his car so as not to seem too obvious after  minutes of warnings by less prominent panthers and guiltfilled statements by sometimes dishevelled whites the meeting ended and leslie wandered around looking for jeanie    leslie it was jeanie calling him leslie over here by the gate i want you to meet my roommate as he approached he saw the delicate looking girl with a well shaped short natural standing next to jeanie his brow furrowed and  he wondered where he had seen her before both women were wearing blue sweatshirts with gothic lettering above and below a black cat reading black_panther party this is my roommate sharon sharon it was the the girl from western avenue leslie stood there  seconds waiting for the charged silence to explode and leave him with only his shame his teeshirt and his steadily shrinking joint to protect himself well arent you at least going to say hello jeanie has told me so  much about you i know damn well you know how to use your lips if just to talk oh    yeah    how do you do he said hoping she wouldnt recognize his voice damn jeanie shy aint the word for this brother right on jeanie chimed my roomie tells me youre an artist she said youd do a picture of me even yeah    sure    uh any time you dont have a sketch pad now do you cause we can get it on right now uh no i dont i uh left all my stuff at home oh well maybe you can come by the house some time yeah then you could see my paintings im kind of interested in art myself i do mostly water colors and id like to get the opinion of a professional even if he does work for the pig department lighten up sharon jeanie pleaded i told you that the brother is for real i understand where hes coming from you just lay dead and keep your damn mouth shut yeah okay then lets split the brothers are leaving for the office im driving and ill decide when we split wheres your car leslie can i give you a ride to your car uh no i uh didnt drive well can i give you a ride home no  no thanks my grandmother lives just on the other side of vermont on th place and i was going to go by her house at  sharon said yeah sure shes expecting me    she is expecting me okay ill see you and call me tomorrow jeanie said lf   more than  people were strolling all around will rogers park hurrying to enjoy the last hours of the third watts summer festival leslie fumbled in his mind trying to recall the details touching off the watts riot some drunk and his mother yeah thats what it was when the police started beating up the mother the riot started yeah he thought the anxious energy that spawned the riot had been replaced with a festive air of rebuilding and rededication among the adults but leslie sensed that many of the teenagers though raucous and rowdy in their celebration were still sullen and angry about conditions in watts and neither did the presence of uniformed police in helmets help to allay the tension welling up inside him as he walked from the art show in the center of the park he saw people run past him toward the rd and central entrance to the park he heard shouts and screams from behind a refreshment stand a few yards from the corner he ran up in time to see police dragging a woman into a waiting police car the youths reacted violently as if magically they pulled rocks and bottles from their hats and sleeves and hurled them at the police curses and insults hung in the air leslie trembled until shots rang out he dived behind a rock landscape facing central avenue with about three other frightened people in front of them a black and white police car was parked idling a blue vapor street light barely lit the symbol of the city the goldoutlined black letters reading police and slanted italic letters saying to protect and serve on the side of the police car people were screaming all about him behind the rock one girl swore another cried one man ran from the park shouting tve been shot im shot he ran dashing in and out of the street for three blocks to the doorstep of the watts  police substation he stumbled there on the step and fell he died there whimpering im shot a lieutenant from the hollenbeck division had come over when police called a tactical alert as they were clearing the park of all people he recognized leslie who also worked in that division parham the lieutenant said as a policeman searching leslie pushed him toward an exit parham we could use you here in the field go report to the command post at the corner right over there he pointed in the direction of six idling police cars blocking the intersection of rd and central id rather not sir and if its all the same to you im going home now leslie protested the lieutenant was walking away giving orders to some other policemen now and didnt hear his protest a burly blondeyebrowed cop grabbed leslies arm pushing him towards the command post you heard what the lieutenant said now be a good boy and do what the nice man said leslie snatched his arm from the mans grip turned and stood facing him clenching and unclenching his fists and gritting his teeth punk ass he whispered under his breath he walked toward the circle of cars in the middle of the street glass covered the ground all around the police barricade where police had shot out the street lights only the bluish moon and police spotlights lit the shadowy park the stark whiteness of the full moon hanging almost directly overhead made the degree night seem unnaturally cold leslie had his sketch pad in his hand a night so he could not even sneak away under the pretense of going for his work pad go home now goddammit he heard a policeman yell to a crowd of youths go home or go to the morgue one of the boys sauntered casually away from the el taco stand at nd and central where they had been standing leslie watched from the door of the car in which he had been put to work the cop ran up and smashed his gun barrel into the boys back the boy stumbled and turned the officer used his gun again this time on the boys collarbone the boy moaned and fell to the ground and three of his friends started to help him two other cops cocked their shotguns one said just give me a reason just give me a reason leslie felt a chill flash over his shoulders and chest and he dropped his pad and pencil he was afraid again like when he first heard the gunshots his mind raced ahead of his emotions a young boy no older than  beaten for what for felonious walking too slow three other boys junior high school kids playing the grown up movie game one false move without the hollywood director to yell cut and without blank bullets leslie heard a scream a shrill womans scream shit naw i aint going home thats my sister in that car and she aint done a goddamn thing bitch shuddup or youll be in there with her leslie looked hard then ran over to the corner where the woman was standing in the street in front of a police car trying to drive off it was sharon he ran up to the policeman officer i know this woman ill take her home and who the hell are you the policeman said putting his gun butt into leslies stomach hard pushing him back a fat sergeant in a shortsleeved shirt ran up he was holding his helmet on his head with his right hand and his shotgun in his left comically as he ran he fumbled and trained his gun on leslie i work for the police department leslie told the sergeant the other cop told sharon that she was under arrest and she shrieked again i aint going shut up dammit the officer said and brought the barrel of his gun down on her head making a clunkingrattling sound as the pump handle shuddered from the blow leslie bolted for the policeman his face looked calm a kind of sideofthemouth smile all but disguised the tears streaming down his face he hit the cop in the back of the neck then surprised more than hurt by the blow the policeman turned leslie leaped into the air with the hardest kick he could deliver to the cursing blondeyebrowed mans groin before his left foot touched the ground again a shotgun blast from the sergeant amputated his leg at the knee two more blasts hit him as he fell away from the policeman the first caused his head to jerk shot from the blonds gun in his face the second laid open his vneck sweater and ivyleague shirt the silent breeze leafed through leslies drawing pad lying on the ground one of the police shoved sharon toward the car her wrists were handcuffed behind her back and a large gash on her left forehead was bleeding profusely closing her eye several drops of bright red blood fell gently on a drawing of the top hat motel as she back with the impact of the buck stumbled past 
i remember omar
by mae jackson 
mar was a bad revoy
 lutionist and real hep
  too he had a fro so
v y high that it almost
nvr touched the clouds
everybody that omar passed
would just stop and stare that
omar in his red green and yellow
danshiki was something else he
was so militant that one of his
friends had a specially designed tiki
made for him man all you had to
do was push a button and out from
the center of the tiki would pop a
blade sharper than lighnen
amar was a lover too yes he
was he had women running after
him from sun up till sun down he
had himself some fine looking sisters
and they were together too
one sister would meet him at his door with slippers in hand while
the other sister would be in his kitchenette preparing all kinds of soul food red beans and rice pigtails and cabbage barbque ribsand potato salad like i said before
omar was a lover some kind
of a beautiful cat militant and coolhe sho nuff had a way with
women now some people said it was because of his really bad rapbut i have always maintained that it was because of his dine african
features he was six feet one in chtall had a very broad nose and
thick juicy lips see he was the type of dude that spent a lot of time kissing it was his custom to kiss every woman he met long and passionately he was what you would call a family man he loved contact and unity now look here omar was also a very good brother the kind of dude that you could depend upon when you were in trouble a naturalborn fund raiser he spent a lot of his time raising bail for his friends who were constantly being picked up bv racist cops and being jailed just for being black you know how this country is when it comes to black folks we are always being harassed and jailed on trumpedup charges well like i was saying before you could always depend upon brother omar especially when you needed bail money or when you were down to your last reefer i remember the successful rebellion that took place in destroyed once known as detroit yeap omar was there he set fire to every white owned business he could see in sight im here to tell you that the brother had to vision the kind that see only white when it comes to destroying i read in one of those white papers that  fireboys and over  policeboys were killed while trying to put out a fire in an old warehouse building you know how the white press does it they never print the whole truth now that i think about it they dont print half the truth but of course by hanging out on the corner i finally heard how it really happened through some reliable sources three thousand fireboys  and over  policeboys went running into this old building guns drawn and hoses out trying to be heroes so that they could cop some kind of special citation for something called bravery now when the black community saw this act of stupidity they contacted omar who went over and lead a prayin the kind of prayin that was just pleading for a strong wind and sure enough it came being that the people and their faith were so strong the old warehouse that was built of brick and iron just gave way and caved in now just you imasine that each and every one of the  white american boys were trapped and burned to death fire is a mighty powerful thing all right everytime a rebellion took place omar was there to lead the prayin omar and the people got rid of a lot of trash that way that omar knew his business he was a credit to his profession now just as fast as the brother could lead a prayin strike a match to burn a building shoot a gun or push the button on his tiki he could whip up some really hep danshikis in no time flat yeap he was a very talented guy all right he could even beat the bongos with his tongue every afternoon after the sun went down omar would send messages via the bongos to the brothers and sisters in africa yeap like i said that omar could do just about everything a real talented guy if you ask me the brother is what you would call a grassroots intellectual he had read every revolutionary book around such as our folktale by julius lester one of his closest and best friend and black feeling black talk by nikki giovanni a real finelooking sister with a fro alomost bigger than omars nikki weighed  pounds and that was with her machine gun on she was real lighthanded if you know what i mean well like i was saying before omar was a real grassroots intellectual he could hold you a conversation on just about any subject from white power to black_power from civil_rights to black rights from freedom schools to liberation schools he knew everything about everything you never could win an argument with him now some people said it was because he was a very emotional person but in my opinion he was just an ordinary aggressive cat just like the brothers and sisters everywhere once he had made up his revolutionary mind on a specific thing wasnt nuthin you could give or offer him that would make him change his mind he was real set in his black ways all right its been seven long months since i last saw omar dig i heard from some brothers and sisters in harlem that  racist hunky cops kicked omars door down and walked into his apartment talking some kind of nonsense about them being there in the name of the law the brother got so mad that the first thing he did was reach in his pocket and pull out his comb to get his fro together slipped into his red green and yellow danshiki went into his drawer took out his nationalist flag and placed it on his automatic rifle and blew all  cops away in the name of revolution some friends took a trip home yeap went back to africa where they ran into omar that omar they said hasnt changed a bit he had a fro so high that it had finally reached the clouds it was so heavy that he had two beautiful sisters dressed to kill walking beside him just to hold the sides up they tell me my friends that the brother has opened up a bookstore in the window were pictures of malcolm_x leroi jones and rap brown yeap like i said that omar was always a talentive cat a bad revolutionist real hep too

reeman left the dif  rectors office and j walked directly to the elevator nodding briefly at the directors secretary on the way out he pressed the button calling the elevator to his floor and inspected the attache case he had been presented as his goingaway present it was serviceably large of saddlestitched leather with brass fittings it contained the few things he had cleared from his desk in the office which had been his for years in the suite of offices behind the armed guards and door marked simply director the elevator arrived and he rode it down walked across the vast marble hall to the entrance and waited at the door for the directors limousine he had known that it would not be awaiting him at the steps and he showed no surprise no anger he had waited many years for what he had to do and a few minutes more for a car was no problem it might take him many more years to do what he had planned for so long and an impatient man he had carefully schooled himself in patience he stood at the door looking out into the huge courtyard of the building and out toward the trees that screened the building from the potomac river toward the city of washington hidden by the trees the courtyard was bright with the virginia spring sunshine unveiled by factory fallout he could not hear the birds behind the big glass doors of the entranceway but he knew that they would be singing in the trees that lined the river he had often brought his lunch to eat among the trees there listening to the birds watching the slow current of the river sitting among the pines and sycamore recalling the smells and sounds of summers spent in a boyscout camp in michigan a city boy from chicago he had never lost his awe and love of the woods their sights and sounds the building squatted vast and ugly a marble and granite conglomeration of the worst of neoclassical and governmentmodem architecture an ugly abscess created by bulldozers and billions in the midst of the oncebeautiful north virginia woods a cancerous abscess he thought sending out its tendrils of infection tens of thousands of miles he stepped through the door into the sunshine and listened to the sounds from the woods placing the case at his feet he was dressed in quiet bad taste his suit a bit too light his cuffs a bit too deep lapels a bit too wide shoulders a shade too padded tie too broad trousers too wide at the knee and ankle socks too short he wore large airplanetype sunglasses his hair was closely cropped and there was a thin surrounding of gold around a front tooth his suit was a bit too cheap and his wristwatch of  karat gold a bit too expensive he walked with a gangling shuffle his head tilted slightly towards one shoulder and there was always a smile on his face even when alone in the building in which he worked broadening and flashing the thin gold when people approached he was very wellliked and would be missed waiting for the directors car he never once glanced back at the building in which he had spent a great part of the last five years of his life the black cadillac limousine swung into the drive and stopped just ahead of where freeman stood the negro chauffeur made no effort to get out to open the door freeman knew that he wouldnt open the door for him and patiently walked to the car opened the door for himself and climbed into the airconditioned interior the driver started moving before freeman was seated throwing him awkwardly into the far corner of the rear seat smiling gently freeman disentangled himself and leaned back into the foamrubber cushions looking out at the potomac river as they sped toward washington through the bulletproof glass you really going through with it you really quittin yes said freeman and they aint pushing you out i thought so at first but they aint pushing you out i didnt think cats like you ever quit a scene like you got i seen a lot like you in washington but i never knew one to quit on his own your kind love it  here you dont even quit for more money someplace else it just dont make sense you really going back to that job you had like they say working with street gangs in chicago yes but this time ill be in charge of the program i shoulda known a title a goddamn title the only damn thing you cats dig more than money special assistant to the director wasnt enough now you going to be a director yourself or did they think up something more fancy the driver snorted in disgust freeman said nothing and they proceeded along the riverside road in silence they moved briefly through arlington and then onto the drive and past the cemetery the big statue of the marines raising the flag on their right they went across the bridge and past the pompous lincoln memorial the phallic washington monument at the end of the reflection pool and just short of the next bridge the jefferson memorial the cherry trees were in bloom a blaze of pink against the green the blue sky above with big fat cumulus clouds floating marshmallowlike against the bright blue sky they turned right on pennsylvania avenue and drove to the white house where the guard waved the car into the drive in front of the white house the driver again did not bother with the door and freeman let himself out and walked into the office annex he was met at the office door by a pudgy redfaced man with nervous mannerisms dan how are you right on time right on time well be going in to see the president in he looked at his watch and then glanced up at the clock on the wall behind the desk of the secretary exactly ten minutes now we go in between the boy scout delegation from east bengal and just before his monthly tea with some of the congressmens wives splitsecond timing around here you know and you know how he is if there is a foulup we have four minutes with him and then its finished hell give you a little present say a few words and then pose for pictures should get some play in the chicago press which wont do you any harm and ill send copies to you in chicago next week i dont know what his present will be hes pretty cagey about that kind of thing but you know what kind of response to give little surprise gratitude thanks and tell him how sorry you are to be leaving the team but i dont have to coach you dan you know what to do hey boy you know were all going to miss you around here remember that time he gave a rebel yell in the taj mahal and you smoothed things over with the indian press we havent forgotten that boy around here not a little bit you were always in there swinging in the clutch yeah sorry to see you go keep in touch now you hear make yourself to home i got to go check on those congressmens wives be right back and then we can go on in freeman sat in a big leather arm chair and looked at the big fourcolor portrait of the president on the woodpanelled wall behind the secretary in a few minutes the redfaced man returned all right lets go now we stand outside his office until the boy scouts come out then we go right in you know the drill they waited at the door until the scouts left beaming each holding a multipurpose jackknife they entered the office of the president the president was seated in his rockingchair his aide bent over and whispered in his ear as freeman approached the president arose and extended a hand thrusting his own quickly far up toward freemans thumb so that it couldnt be squeezed a trick learned from countless campaigns and handshakes well foreman mighty glad to see you again sit down sit down he had heard freemans name incorrectly the aide looked at freeman in a moment of panic freeman ignored his misspoken name and the aide relaxed in gratitude well now son they tell me youre leaving us sure we cant get you to change your mind the general now tells me hes mighty sorry to see you go says you do a good job over there by the river and the general doesnt hand out praise very easy you know yes sir i know and im flattered that he wants me to stay but im afraid i have to leave ive given it a great deal of thought and conscience calls you see ill be going right back where i grew up to try and use my education to help kids who are like i used to be well foreman thats a right fine attitude but dont you think you might be making a bigger contribution for those very people here in washington offer some inspiration for them to achieve to emulate you you know local boy makes good thats a point well taken mr president but id rather make my efforts in a more personal way my small contribution to our great society well now thats good very good we could use you around here maybe speechwriting i like that a small contribution to our great society the president turned to his aide put that down smitty want to see it in my next speech he squinted and gazed out into space as your president it is my humble pleasure to be able to make a small contribution to our great society got that smitty we could use more of your idealism around here foreman i  certainly wish you the best of luck i spoke to your mayor last week and they plan to do more in that area im sure he could find room for you in his new commission well mr president i already have a position with a private social welfare agency one i worked for before i came into the government well now foreman never underestimate the good the government does for the people even though i am a firm believer in private enterprise as you know yes sir i recognize the great contributions the government has made toward the lives of the individual citizen and that is at the head of the war on poverty but there have to be increased efforts by private agencies and individuals youre right of course we cant have people dependent on the government to take care of all their problems now can we no sir and i always ask not what my country can do for me but what i can do for my country the presidents smile tightened his aide hastily thrust a package into his hand foreman heres a little momento id like to let you have a little token of my appreciation of your efforts in your countrys behalf freeman opened the package it was a multipurpose pocket knife identical to those handed to the east bengali boy scouts freeman wondered if the congressmens wives would find pocket knives useful he smiled his thanks you remember that time we were on that tour of the east and all that fuss they made because i gave a little old rebel yell in the taj mahal well you sure handled those indian newsmen well but i never could understand why they were so riled well sir its a tomb you know it was a little like someone being disrespectful in the alamo well now that you put it that way but i meant no disrespect yes sir i told them that his aide gave him a signal and the president rose and grasped freemans hand down my way when you give a man a sharp instrument as a present you have to give him something in return so that the friendship isnt broken yes sir here you are freeman slid off his tie clasp and gave it to the president there was a cold silence the presidents grin frozen on his face his aide hurried freeman to the door recovering the president called out now if you get down my way you stop in to see me you hear the president frowned down at the tie clasp in his big hand it was in the shape of a pt boat he walked out into the bright spring sunshine paused on the steps of the white house and looked out at the traffic on pennsylvania avenue he walked to the side of the building to the parking lot the chauffeur was leaning against the fender of the shiny black cadillac smoking a cigarette he looked up at freeman well bigtime the man say you can have the car as long as you want it today where you want to go you can go back to the office i have a bag in the hotel where the airport limousine leaves for national ill walk from here the driver looked at freeman and flipped the butt at him it landed just short of the toe of his shoe freeman looked at the stillsmoking cigarette butt then he looked up at the driver nigger he said if you had hit me with that butt it would have been your black ass the driver stiffened and moved forward from the fender of the car come on said freeman you been wanting some of me for years now lets get it on ill lay your black ass on the white house steps youd like that wouldnt you you out of a job and now you get big and bad in front of the white house no i aint going to fight you here you come down to u street and ill kill you you couldnt kill me on the best day you ever had now you can drive me lets go the driver started around the hood of the car to the drivers seat freeman stood at the door and waited until he had reached the other side nigger open my door they stood looking at one another across the long low top of the car their elongated reflections almost touching the driver walked slowly back around the car and opened the door freeman got into the back seat he told him the name of the hotel where he had been staying since the packers had shipped his effects to his new apartment in chicago the weekend before they stopped at the entrance and freeman passed the check for his bag to the driver he got out then returned with the bag without a word they rode to national airport in silence when they arrived at the terminal freeman got out and handed the driver his plane ticket park the car and check my bag through bring the ticket to me in the bar upstairs he walked into the terminal and upstairs to the bar  and ordered a carlsberg he sipped the cold brew until the driver returned heres your ticket bigtime one day im going to kill you go polish the car boy you wont be killing me anytime the driver stood looking at freemans reflection in the mirror to the rear of the bar freeman sipping his beer coolly returned his stare the driver frowned in curiosity he had never seen that expression in the five years freeman had been with the agency finally he turned without another word and left the bar that was stupid freeman thought five years of cooling it and when i blew it it had to be him hell we could probably be poolshooting buddies tasting a bit and chasing chicks but there was no other way the cover had to be complete no holes anywhere it had had to be that way and now he was ready or was he had his mask become him he would find out soon now had he really put them on or had he been putting himself on for a half a decade although trained for it he had never been allowed to be a functioning agent but then that was not why he had been recruited they had never felt he had either the guts or intelligence to function in the field and he had reinforced their thoughts on that score he smiled to himself he had conned them all and in his own way had been the best of the spooks and they might never know it for five years he had been the cia nigger and his job had been to sit by the door 
what  can we say to you that will help you to believe
you are learning now about the american revolution the declaration of independence the founding fathers and the constitution and each morning in class you place your hand over your heart and pledge allegiance to the flag and to the country of your birth and it all has meaning for you you are an american and that proud heritage represented by the events and documents and words you are learning is your heritage but soon you will begin to learn other things things which inevitably will leave you in a quandary things which will force you to call into question the meaning of the events and documents and words you have treasured you will learn that for you the heritage in which you have had pride also has emptiness and the knowledge will break your heart we who are older who have traveled the way you must go have not yet found a method of sparing you that heartbreak we want you to believe what you are learning now for the passions and the principles which brought into being the american revolution the declaration of independence and the constitution represent humankind at its noblest we want you to believe in these things even as we concede in sadness that you will need strength beyond what we can give you to hold on to your belief in the world that awaits you
