nineteen hundred and sixty nine over p million americans of crrs rm african descent still ix fincj themselves occupying space in a foreign land a land that is alien to them and even though they know it is alien to them they are still crawling for crumbs refusing to accept the inescapable fact that we are not wanted here because we are not needed here unfortunately black actors belong to and are a part of that same oppressed minority there is nothing they can do about this fact the choice has been imposed upon them by racist white america so it would seem that they would all immediately join some black organization and begin to work side by side with their other brothers and sisters toward building a black nation the signs are all around us america is erupting its splitting at the seams but rather than face m this reality black actors continue to keep on pushing trying to reach the top obsessed with the ideal of making it yet when a select few do reach the top they find it is somehow still the bottom because white people are still running the show so they wrap their troubles in a sack of dreams and keep on keepin on each day swallowing another lie dying another death trying to adapt to this mans culture a way of life that is directly opposed to their very existence they refuse to believe that they have bought a lie the myth of the american dream that perversion which says one nation under god with liberty and justice foi all to some degree this would have been true if the wording had been slightly changed to one white nation under one white god with liberty and justice for white folks only but somehow the forefathers neglected to include this most important fact you see everything white people do or have ever done culturally socially economically and politically has been solely to perpetuate their power andor to maintain the status quo history proves this to be so so it behooves us all to stop struggling and to decide now who we are and what we are the hand is on the gate we are at war in this coun try and we cant continue to aimlessly wonder around in negro confusion searching for a perverted dream these are the cold faced facts make up your mind do you continue to help the man help himself or do you go back and begin to help your own to help themselves and we can only help our own by first ripping ourselves away from that american dream somehow black actors shy away from this decision because they see in this choice the necessity of giving up something precious rather than gaining something vital they see in this choice a denial of some material comfort which they now afford or hopefully someday will be able to afford they are stuck with a slave mentality and would somehow rather let white people continue to take care of them giving them jobs and telling them how when and what to act they seemingly have so little confidence in themselves as black men and women that they refuse to break these ties they are afraid to stand up and accept the responsibility of controlling their own lives and providing work for themselves so instead they go around spouting universal phrases of humanity which will allow them to maintain their solo position in the unchanging system if they would just sit quietly and ask themselves how do i see myself in relationship to my physical surroundings brother leroi jones answers the question very simply slave or free black or white eitheror there is no in between but many brothers and sisters because of their basic feeling of inferiority refuse to accept this so that they continue to operate out of a negro bag its as if they see themselves in a grey world an assimilatedintegrated world but the assimilation of something is the complete destruction of one thing for another thing when you take on the other thing you also take on a different name and consequently you are not the same thing anymore you have forgotten the first thing in order to become the second thing so when it all boils down you are still left with two choices black or white because for black people to view the world through greyintegrated eyes is really the same as viewing it through white eyes theyre simply straddling the fence occupying space theyre neither one thing nor the other theyre immobile indefinite and indecisive and more important their silence is an endorsement of white power and to be black and to endorse white power is a very dangerous position to take because they are then working directly against their people if they would appraise this situation properly they would see that this condition occurs because of an insatiable hunger for personal power and recognition a thirst for authority and dictatorship which stems from the need to constantly prove themselves prove that they exist so it seems that everyone wants to be the master and no one wants to be the slave but its not about me and i anymore its about striving toward nationhood and peoplehood its about bridging the gap between niggernegro and black its about unity which is the only solution to our struggle for liberation unity means working together all our forces and resources co operatively to build and develop black institutions institutions which will hopefully begin to blacken all the whiteness we find ourselves surrounded with everyday so the next question becomes how can we do this and still survive again the answer is unity once we begin to think collectively we can begin to bring about a change change suggests revolution and revolution is a very frightening word most socalled black actors dont fully understand the depth or the meaning of this word nor do they understand the seriousness of their plight so they refer to themselves in meaningless nonpolitical and romantic terms constantly appearing and posturing on television rapping and chitterchatting about some phase of blackness or making pseudomilitant statements in magazines and newspapers concerning the emergence of this new phenomenon called black theater consistently associating the word with community theater which in turn means nonprofessional or amateur theater well i hate to shatter their illusions but the very words black artistblack theater inherently have political connotations and black artists can no longer divorce themselves from this issue no more than they can continue to divorce themselves from their people if black theaters are to be at all valid they must meet the psychological needs of all black people they must bring the people closer to an awareness of who they really are they must be used as a tool to strengthen and to build enlighten and to elevate and they must be totally run by black peopie who view the world blackly and in order to view the world blackly you must first decrude yoursif that is purge yourself of all those years of white indoctrination and white ideology living black then becomes a full time job because to live black is to think black to think black is to feel black to feel black is to act black to act black is to know black to know black is to build black and to build black is to be black just as there are churches on every corner there must be theaters on every corner theaters which will put into practice the principles of blackness theaters run by black artists who with all their beings will create black forces forces which will help tear down the walls of western rigidness and sterility forces which will lead black people out of bondage theaters which will pour out new images new symbols new patterns of thought theaters which will clear away all the old dehumanizing forms of cliches that for centuries have blocked the way we must place our energies in a new direction a direction whicn goes out instead of up leading us back to our original sourceand at the very core of that source is a spiritual tradition black theaters must portray these people so that they can see themselves in all their glory and once again walk proud praising themselves and their blackness biack people are a feeling peopie a sincere sympathetic and giving people a soulful people full of love and vitality a people with a conscience and this conscience must permeate black theaters everywhere well it seems that black artists have a tremendous task they must consciously and willfully commit themselves to change and this commitment must stem from a deep compassion and love a love that is so moving so charged with emotion that it will destroy any and all evil evil that blocks the way and keeps us from building a more beautiful and healthy world a world where black people can love laugh and sing again black artists must sing new revolutionary songs songs which will force black people to turn into themselvesinto the really real of themselvesnot the full fearing fear of themselvesnot the confused cagingcage of themselves not the aimlessaim of themselves but the fieryfire of themselves the sparklingsparkle of themselves the manwoman of themselves their voices must help black people stretch outpull in transcend step out of that narrow western concept of themselves that way of life that is killing the real self of themselves their voices must change the myself of themselves into the ourself of themselves let these images drip down for the us of ourselves giving strength and determination to all those who are a part of the us of ourselves let these images roll out into the real world giving guidance and direction but first black artists must show the real of themselves to themselves before they can teach the world to sing again do it quickly time is running out plays with themes about black people p sprang up all over new york during the past year however this activity is not to be confused with black theater which is still going through hard times struggling to gain a foothold in black communities if black theater is that theater written directed produced and financed by blacks located in black areas and geared to black audiences then few plays of the last year qualify they were mostly located downtown and designed to attract that theatergoing we shall overcome blackandwhitetogether crowd the most ballyhooed play to open this past season with a black theme was howard sacklers the great white hope the stillrunning broadway hit is based on the life of former heavyweight champion jack johnson and gives veteran actor james earl jones a vehicle for a bravura performance a black person attending the play had best keep in mind that this is a white mans version of jack johnson just as william styrons book is a white mans version of nat turner take a hard look at it forgetting all the rave reviews and see that many of the old stereotypes creep through for instance johnsons white woman is sanctified and idealized to the heavens while his black woman is depicted as a constantly nagging shrew be aware that the real jack johnson married three white women with at least one rumored to be a whore another play wellreviewed by new yorks white liberal audience is big time buck white supposedly a satire on the shenanigans of black militants what it turns out to be is a white author creating amos n andy images of black men to the immense pleasure of his predominantly white audience honey man weasel hunter rubber band and jive get those names spend the first threequarters of the play shouting signifying shuffling and cussing about how to divide up the antipoverty money they belong to an organization called beautiful allelujah days bad everyone is waiting for buck white and when he came out during the last quarter of the play i hoped that he would bring order to the chaos instead he evasively answered questions from the audience some of whom were plants i never knew whether he was serious or just putting everyone down the answers were usually uninformative and irrelevant to the rest of the play big time buck white has no meaning for black people a satire on some of the absurdities of the more rhetorical militants we may need but a satire on black militants by a white writer we can do without the next major opening was ed bullins in the wine time at the new lafayette theatre in harlem in this play which depicts a day in the life of tenementdweller qiff dawson his wife his nephew and assorted neighbors bullins proves that he is our top playwright his characterizations of the black urban poor are without par today cliff is a harddrinking shell of a man whom the oppressive system has beaten down despite his tough talk he has decided to escape into his wine bottle his defeat is not yet total though and he halfheartedly tries to encourage his nephew ray to break out of the oppressive cycle the two chief flaws of wine time are a somewhat abrupt seemingly forced ending and the lack of one character to suggest concrete ways for the entrapped black poor to break the vicious cycle a community theater assumes this responsibility it is hoped that bullins future plays will do this wine time is a good play and gave the new lafayette theater a good vehicle to launch good black theater in harlem much further downtown the douglas turner wardrobert hooks negro ensemble company nec started off its new season with ray mclvers god is a guess what harshly criticized last year for not doing a play written by a black american playwright nec this season scheduled four such plays unfortunately their first offering proved a disappointment god is a guess what is a cute piece of trivia about an attempted lynching of a virtuous negro jim by two southern rednecks jim has faith that his god will rescue him from the evil whites and sure enough he does just before the dastardly deed is completed god bursts on stage not black not white but a suavely neutral gray proceeding to deliver long and profound monologues on brotherhood there had been a little snap to the play before god appeared but after his entrance it was all down hill the play was oldfashioned and resembled something that a local high school drama class would love to do in fact mclver wrote it as an exercise in a college drama class years ago its production was a waste of necs talent and i hope that their subsequent productions will be more challenging these are ceremonies in dark old men by lonne elder iii which deals with a harlem family an evening of one acts a program of plays drawn from the black experience and man better man by earl hill which is set in the west indies another interesting play is the believers directed by barbara ann teer currently shown off broadway which gives highlights of black history through the use of music in january robert riches message from the grass roots ran at the james weldon johnson theater arts center in east harlem based on the life of malcolm_x it covered a year period of his life what we get is a white playwrights interpretation of what he wanted malcolm to be not the forceful black nationalist which brother malcolm was riche almost made him into a minor martin_luther_king jr the play did contain a strong performance by dennis tate as minister william malcolm he has a striking facial resemblance on stage and the voice imitation was almost perfect leroi jones spirit house players are still active in newark using the theater to increase the black consciousness level of newarks black majority it is hoped that this in turn will help to achieve the political aim of electing a black mayor in another active local group is the afroamerican studio for acting and speech which is headed by ernie mcclintock performing only on weekends they did highly competent productions of amen corner moon on a rainbow shawl and black nativity this group has survived over a year in harlem with no foundation or city financial support they are deserving of support from those who endorse black theater the east wind cafe is another harlembased enterprise which provides an outlet for black arts devotees mostly poetry readings are held there but anyone who has seen what black poets are into know that this is true black theater besides the plays mentioned above black performers are in several nonracial shows on and off broadway these include hello dolly hair boys in the band and riot a yearold black musician harold wheeler is the or w chestra conductor for the hit musical promises promises it would be a mistake to assume that all this activity signals an upsurge of black theater as critic clive barnes of the new york times so loudly proclaims except for the new lafayette the spirit house and the afroamerican studio none are located in black communities and except for these three none operate out of a philosophy of cultural nationalism true black theater is still in dire need of support financial and otherwise from those who yearn for the development of a strong and viable ethnic theater chicagos south side center of the performr ing arts under the rm guidance of general f rji i i manager ted ward produced two plays during included were a month run of wards prizewinning reconstruction drama our lari and ronald milners whose got his own the milner play closed after a week run due to illness of one of the principals the south side center has an enviable location in the heart of the south side ghetto and could develop into an important black cultural institution housed in the louis theater a former movie house on east th street with a capacity of more than the center plans a season of original plays by black playwrights for scheduled for production are ted wards candle in the wind a bill of three oneact plays wards whole hog or nothing ron milners the monster and the penny game by chicago playwright james blackwell also scheduled is the spook who sat by the door a stage adaptation of chicagoan sam greenlees novel of the same title the play was adapted by greenlee and melvin clay of the living theater greenlees novel has been rejected by major american publishers but was scheduled for publication in london this spring the spook who sat by the door has as its theme a black revolution which begins on chicagos south side we intend that the south side center of the performing arts reflect and interpret the lives of the people of the surrounding neighborhood said ward we welcome greenlees play because it does exactly that ted ward has a long and distinguished background in black theater and was one of the founders of the negro playwrights company in harlem in association with langston hughes paul robeson and richard wright in wards play our lari was winner of the theater guild award and was subsequently produced on broadway ward is recipient of numerous awards among them national theater conference awards for and and a guggenheim fellowship in muring the last year ttx the free southern jljf j theater has undergone os a significant solidification of structure and financesso that now the future of the souths only black touring theater can be said to be quite secure plans have been finalized for the sixth southern tour beginning in april in new orleans under the directorship of gilbert moses one of the founders of the troupe in the company will perform a repetoire of east of jordan a full length play by evan walker and a second evening of several short oneact plays slave ship by leroi jones riot sale by ben caldwell roots by gilbert moses and happy birthday jesus by valerie ferdinand of the writers workshop in new orleans consisting of approximately actors and five apprentices the company will tour four to six months depending on funds covering louisiana mississippi alabama georgia and texas john oneal now free from alternative military service as a conscientious objector resumes duty as producing director roberta jones coordinates fund raising and financial affairs as associate producer in new york thomas dent is assigned to the community writingacting project as associate producer in new orleans brock peters assumed chairmanship of the board of directors in november new orleans community workshops early in the company decided that the idea of a performing touring company was not enough to insure that the free southern theater would develop viable roots in the south to an extent the idea of the fst perpetrated imported art which though it hoped would be relevant to the needs of the black communities where it played did not have the advantage of developing out of the communities themselves for this reason it was decided that a community workshop program would be started in the community where we domicile ourselves new orleans which would be equally as important as the professional touring company carmel collins and eluard burt helped to develop community projects in and early which resulted in wide participation in the extremely exciting and successful first afroamerican festival at dillard university in february included was a workshop production of an original oneact play the smokers by charles self a promising young new orleans writer since then the community program has concentrated on a combined actingwriting workshop with quality material from new black writers as its objective this workshop recently produced a page magazine of explosive and probing poetry gumbo and plans several issues to follow the next issue will concentrate on new orleans that rich cultural gumbo of irresolvable contradictions by the summer of the workshop hopes to produce a packet of six to eight oneact plays which the touring company and other black groups can use the actingwriting workshop is just one objective of the new orleans community program on the drawing board are plans for projects which utilize the talents of new orleans musicians a community newspaper and workshops in dance and current events nevertheless it is the task and role of the actingwriting workshop to begin producing new material for the black stage material which utilizes all of the many rich and heretofore unexploited possibilities of black culture looking ahead so we look with anticipation toward a new southern tourall the familiar places laurel hattiesburg jackson west point prairie view holmes county bogalusa tuskegee sunflower etc and some new ones like empire la in plaquemines parish deep in leander perez country on the river bank its an exciting time in the south the publicity and focus is all northern ghetto right now but for three years black people in southern communities the movement came to then left almost as suddenly well these people havent been sleeping theyve been slugging it out by themselves slowly and undramaticallybut its been their show and the changes one realizes are here to stay dig that we are on the move in mississippi that in dead ole new orleans three black oriented community theaters have sprung up in the last year nat turner dashiki the place shreveport has a new community theater so does san antonio jackson miss will have one soon to be able to play in these communities to offer them something which they in turn will turn into their own conscious weapons developing their own strong black community voicesthis is the measure of the thrill of touring again as the key thrust of the fnr foregoing reports on black theater across the land is that black theater still is searching still gathering its forces still languishing in a state of hope and pregnancy despite the emergence of an exciting new talent like ed bullins the undoubtedly great potential of black theater in america remains as yet unrealized which is not entirely negative there must be time for the new voices to gain their strength the process of weaning is not yet complete the influence of the american commercial theater in particular and of western theater tradition in general hover heavily over the new talent perverting it when not strangling it too often the older voices are too fundamentally entwined with the dogma of the past to speak with relevance to ears attuned to the present and the newer fresher voices have not yet found the form with which to force the final breakthrough the young playwrights whose work was brought before the public in the special issue of the drama review edited by ed bullins was proof enough of the new spirit and of the great potential and the new paperback anthology which bullins has prepared under the bantam label will extend this young people like edd johnson of new orleans a writer with the nat turner theater and carolyn rodgers of chicago a writer with the obac workshop are stretching their imaginations and coming up with exciting ideas for the black theater and of course the leroi jonesfounded theater of reality at spirit house in newark continues to experiment occasionally touring the campuses at the invitation of black student groups black theater continues aborn ing then but in the meantime black people are involved increasingly in some theater activity in the principal population centers of the country during the past year in new york for example a number of productions featured black performers among them poetry and folk music of american negroes in central park with roscoe lee browne ellen holly cicely tyson amanda ambrose josephine premice gloria foster and leon bibb riot with margo jefferson and tony harrington jr a play brought to the broadway united church of christ by the om theater workshop of boston christophe at the brooklyn academy of music with j a preston and marilyn berry the cuban thing on broadway with jane white big time buck white transported from watts with dick williams arnold williams and ron rich americana pastoral at the greenwich mews with marcella lowery ron oneal and louise stubbs cities in bezique at the public theater with paul benjamin joan harris and cynthia belgrave god bless at the yale repertory theater with carl lee message from the grassroots at the james weldon johnson theater arts center with dennis tate as malcolm and walk down mah street at the players theater with kenneth frett and lorraine feather the new lafayette theater and the new heritage repertory theater in harlem were joined by the national black theater workshop inc under the direction of the dynamic barbara ann teer also its founder in february miss teer reported the following we are in the first phase of our program training the company we have spent the last five months experimenting with new techniques of working and are developing totally new and different methods of communication our goal is to establish a black art standard the first word deleted from our theatrical vocabulary was the word actor we have declared ourselves liberators keeping in mind that before we can psychologically liberate black people we must ourselves first be liberated in order to do this we have had to expose and analyze all our niggernegroness because liberators must first be strong wholesome positive africanamericans completely committed to revolution and revolutionary black art we have therefore through a process of decruding ourselvesthat is cleansing our minds so that we can change images reappropriate values and constantly strive to reaffirm our spiritual essencebecome revolutionary black artists the national black theater workshop inc is aiming at a major production for this spring officers of the theater with miss teer are larry neal charlie russell bill strickland velma banks and shirley mckie the negro ensemble company downtown opened in february with ceremonies in dark old men a play by lonne elder iii of the nec staff the play was received with guarded enthusiasm by the new york times drama critic clive barnes it was the second play of the necs second season by a black american writer the first play was ray mclvers comedy god is a guess what which was mentioned in the new york report by peter bailey out in chicago black theater fared less well even by second city standards and expectations sam greenlee mentioned ted wards theater and plans in the chicago report but did not emphasize that oscar brown jr and jean pace were being sought as the leads for his own play the spook who sat by the door an adaptation of his novel of the same name published in march in england miss teer has agreed to direct mr greenlees play if her prior commitments permit ann mcneil doggedly continued with the obac drama workshop aided by a loyal core of actors and supporters which include young bill eaves clarence taylor len jones and harold lee harold johnsons group was working at press time toward an opening theater in los angeles presented a happier picture even if a less black one harry e dolan director of the douglass house founda tion reported that the group was remodeling its theater which will be the first significant development to come out of the revolt in watts and more significant it is the first real thing of black development mr dolan said that the theater would use material from outside the community as we did with big time buck white which has a white author three other plays were scheduled for production house divided by jeanne taylor the pet shop by cal wilson and pornoff by elvie whitney we also will be doing a play by myself entitled nat turner a far different one from that william styron farce the confessions of nat turner mr dolan said the acting company includes bill jackson sonara mckeller quincy troupe charles thomas and james jackson the studio watts workshop under the leadership of james m woods and the direction of melvin longmire now has apprentices connected with the workshop according to mr woods the workshop presents four productions a year with additional performances for university campuses and seminars one of the workshops requirements for university appearances is that a seminar be held that workshop participants live on campus and that each performer receive last year the workshop produced black girl in search of god an adaptation of the george bernard shaw short story by wanda

ready for occupancy for the fourth annual watts festival this summer the mafundi board is interracial the performing arts society of los angeles pasla is producing oneact plays by the young black playwrights with works by ed bullins ben caldwell evan walker joe dyer and jimmy garrett scheduled van tile e whit field founder of pasla is concerned with new forms and new means of exploring and dramatizing the black experience in this connection the companys repertory includes a compilation program called give me back my drum which tells of the black mans original method of communication in mother africa the drum the program begins with the joyous message of a successful hunt being transmitted throughout a village via the drum there is rejoicing and a feast then the message of the drum changes theres a warning sound there is terror a ship is approaching a ship carrying white men who will ultimately enslave the people of the village the drum becomes hysterical the white men capture the people there is a woeful sound narration written by mr whitfield describes the plight of the black man rendered communicatively important in a land of no friends pasla also performs an anthology of black writings a compilation of scenes from plays by black playwrights improvisational drama and a program of black folklore which includes the acting out of african folktales pasla is seeking funds to renovate its theater the inner city cultural center iccc and the house of respect which is affiliated with the douglass house foundation are active in los angeles as is the ebony showcase in detroit the concepteast continues its spark in the community but much of the theatrical energy has been directed to other outlets actress sylvia king for example keeps busy reading black poetry with groups performing before school and university audiences and on television programs in washington d c the arena stage theater has attracted some of the best local talent from the black community in new orleans the nat turner theater black theater for black people struggles toward solidity and permanencehoyt w fuller it must have been two or three years after high school or at least two or three years before collegethere was a five years gap for methat i found langston hughes i didnt find him in high school or college in the high school that i attended especially the american literature classes black writers were foreign black poets were nonexistent in my college they were ignored during the fifties when i came of age discovering searching groping for identification teachers often turned me on to robert lowell vachel lindsay eugene oneill william faulkner robert penn warren mark twain henry james hart grane and of course ernest hemingway they were described as true american writers because they were white born here or wrote here there was no labelling of langston hughes as american because in his poetry and prose there is a deep and abiding love for this country as well as for the black man in this country i found langston hughes during my intense study of the black theatre i discovered theatre in the five year gap too dr alain locke discussed black writers in the collection thirteen plays for the negro theater it is one of the earliest published anthologies of plays about black lifestyles i wish i could find that book he mentioned how langstons plays had received praise at the karamu house theater in cleveland langston led me to other black writers black institutions he led me to richard wright crisis magazine james baldwin ralph ellison w c handy mercury magazine even to carl van vechten from articles and books i found that he was a poet short story writer translator and adaptor i exhausted myself in the library reading langston hughes soul gone home at least times a good job done times early autumn one of the most beautiful short stories in american letters two or three dozen times poems weary blues a house in taos to ive known rivers montage of a dream deferred so i was aware of him long before i met him similar i am aware of god of pushkin if only i could have met them it was the newspaper the negro newspaper announced that langston hughes would be coming to detroit given the key to the city and would be escorted from the airport by police motorcade downtown to the citycounty building our new city chief mayor jerome p cavanagh would then present the poet with the key to detroit on the afternoon of the following day after he had received the key ronald milner a writer friend called me he had met langston and he had impressed langston my friend wanted me to go with him that very afternoon and meet langston hughes are you available man he asked langston was staying at the parkshelton in the art center section of detroit equidistance from everything downtown westside eastside it seemed that all my artsycraftsy friends knew him yet before the negro press announced his arrival i assumed no one knew him because no one ever mentioned him or his work however he was a celebrity among the blacks ie the factory workers the car washers the day workers domestics bartenders they knew one of his poems or one of his short stories or one of his plays or some of simple they had read in the chicago defender margaret danner the poet and a dear friend to detroit artists and writers had introduced ronald to langston so naturally respect and aspiration for langston grew because i knew then that the man had to be real one can determine the effect of a man by the ones who love him so it was with langston hughes before i met him at about that time we were involved in something in detroit called for nothing better black discovery we had built our own theater called concepteast margaret danner had opened boone house for poets henri king had opened the contemporary art gallery and both tony brown and richard henry brother imari started publishing little magazines we had a lot of things to talk to langston about would he listen had the new mayor and the middleclass negro doctors and lawyers cornered him on this detroit visit the first thing he did on my arrival at the hotel was to offer me a drink i refused i dont drink what a writer and director dont drink then he smiled the cigarette with the ashes not falling sort of blocking some of the smile how can i describe that smile have you ever studied the mona lisa draw in a cigarette with ashes langstons smile would create the same effect he told us how swinging the suite was man wish l had one of these permanently this is something isnt it wow hey they gave me the key to the city he started looking for the key but evidently had misplaced it brought me in by motorcade wish i had the money they spent on me and we all broke up laughing he was real later that evening he spoke for arthur coar local director for the association for the study of negro life and history the organization founded in the twenties by carter woodson also one of the first men to hire langston he and i talked again that night i told him how much i liked his short story early autumn he told me to look him up if i came to new york i talked of the conditions of the black man in the theater i do remember he gave ronald milner a copy of his plays dont you want to be free and soul gone home and we tried to get a cast together to do a reading of his poetry and the two plays but he left two days later before we could get the actors parting he said something like its kinda hard to get colored people together but once you got them well and he smiled that smile preoccupied with his packing in early i moved to new york i found the opportunity via rev malcolm boyd and his play study in color i called langston after about a week of the cruelties of new york city hi woodie he said come on over how is ron did he finish that big book he lived in harlem on th street in one of those beautiful brownstones i had trouble finding the house i searched around and finally i asked a policeman yeah the poet he lives in the next block his office was on the third floor it was filled with books by black writersfiction and nonfiction from blacks the world over most of the books had some personal identification for him because langston had helped in getting them published or had written the introduction or had helped the writer when the writer was beginning the first thing he said i read that story beautiful light and black our dreams in negro digest its good i didnt know how to respond i do remember there was a long pause he did not fill the pause he made me fill it i started explaining the story gaining confidence as i talked suddenly i realized that we were talking man to man not student to teacher or student to great artist we talked about the works of other writers particularly ron milner that big big bookis it really going to be pages malraux ellison sandburg whitman wright and dostoevsky i found he never talked about his work instead he gave me copies of his book including the autobiography the big sea autographing it in large bold green ink strokes especially for woody kingwith a hearty welcome to new york sincerely langston hughes harlem u s a april on my leaving he invited me down to the greenwich mews theaters sanctuary to see his play jerichojim crow in that brief visit langston hughes as he must have done with many other black artists opened himself and thus accepted me and listened to me i dont think i had talked to any artist as i talked to him yet the meeting was brief less than two hours but this is a long time for a busy writer within the next year we met often he invited me to other plays recommended me for parts i even read for his play prodigal son in october of i invited him to the opening of ron milners whos got his own at american place theater i was directing it as a workinprogress he was eager to see milners play he liked its construction but he felt that boy tim jr is awfully mad they better not put a white character on stage talking about negroes that way theyll get picketed our next meeting was in cleveland ohio at karamu playhouses golden anniversary i had been invited out by the theater department i didnt know langston would be there but i did know they would be doing his play simply heavenly as fate would have it we all stayed in the same hotel and since it was some distance from the playhouse we shared a cab langston malcolm boyd frederick oneal sidney lanier its something of an event to have langston back rowena jelliffe remarked on the opening panel langston hughes was karamus first playwright away back when it supported the gilpin players his play little mam received wide acclaim at the karamu playhouse on the panel discussion that included the above mentioned participants he did not put anyone down he praised leroi jones as one of the finest young writers in the theater he felt leroi jones was equal to the best of the th century poets at this point leroi was catching hell from the white press because of his black arts repertory theater while we were in cleveland talking about theater new york was in the midst of the now famous black out most of the new yorkers decided to remain an extra day in cleveland until it was over thus i had an opportunity to continue my dialogue with langston about poetry and the blues he knew of my interest in the blues we had certainly talked about it enough so much that i thought he was bored with it i told him what i wanted to do take his first book of poetry the weary blues adapt it to the stage using the prose and poetry from that first book to his last set it in harlem and add w c handys blues as an integral part since he and handy were saying the same things he liked the idea the possibilities he even gave me a few more copies of his work the idea would be to follow a young black american from a storefront church through the harlem streets and finally to the foreign soil of some distant land an american soldier protecting this country from his death the cleveland visit brought langston and i even closer if only for a fleeting moment now i would be able to adapt his work with his consent and his help for two months i worked off and on with him we agreed that no corrections would be made until i finished a first draft in march of i gave him a third and final draft of my adaptation of the weary blues he made large bold corrections and additions in the perennial green ink and returned it to me in april i went to his home again to pick it up you did it he said yes it took a lot of research i said man you got work in schomburg nobody ever heard of since i wanted to use something from the old mercury and opportunity magazines i didnt want you to use any piece that was dated thats the only thing i was afraid of he said people find the skeletons in your closet they dont understand they get uptight i knew exactly what he meant i had been tempted to adapt a huge fulllength play between the countee cullens library and the schomburg collection i compiled enough material for a dozen full length plays when i started cutting material from the scottsboro boys as it appeared in theater news a piece that was good and fitted weary but outdated i knew i had found a spine for the play agitprop theater of the thirties did not fit the theme we had set for the weary blues he gave me his corrected copy of the weary blues with it was seven new poems that he felt should be included plus a new play mother and child i directed it at the american place theater about a month later while he was in dakar he had marked the script appropriately large green arrows indicated where the new additions should be placed then it was off to dakar for the first world festival of negro art for langston he sent me a post card then in august he called to let me know he was back in new york for a minute whats happening with weary blues good news we have a production at the lincoln center museum and library series sponsored by equity library theatre the weary blues opened at the lincoln center in october of for a limited engagement it was packed every night langston was there almost every night he would give a little chuckle every night because i had mississippi john hurts got the blues and cant be satisfied at full volume to put the audience in the right mood before the play he brought a lot of black guests he also helped cast the play by securing the services of miss theresa merritt i remember after the performance the actor robert hooks invited us to his apartment for drinks it was a lively evening and as i remember it langston only stayed a minute but he did want to come by to tell all the young performers how much he enjoyed the play and the direction in which we had taken his prose and poetry he was especially pleased with eleo pomares beautiful junkie dance and norman bushs preacher and cliff fraziers hustler it was a strange evening after langston left we spent the remainder of the evening quoting and reciting his poetry you see langstons leaving never meant that he was gone he always left something behind for the black people he was always busy he had a lot of things going works not yet completed publishers after overdue manuscripts i always dreaded the thought of dropping in on him i would often wait until ronald milner came into new york so that we could both spring ideas which always meant a long and rewarding evening for me in december of his secretary novelist lindsey patterson called and told me that langston hughes was busy but that he wanted to compile a book of short stories for little brown and company did i have anything of course i sent him the story that he liked from negro digest beautiful light and black our dreams he liked it and published it in the anthology best short stories by negro writers i ran into him a month later january of in a small village restaurant after a performance of day of absence and happy end ing it was one of those cold evenings threatening rain i dont remember exactly what we talked about i do know i had given a friend who was starting a magazine langstons private telephone number and i was afraid he would not approve of it he was annoyed about it i told him i had tried to reach him by phone to tell him he would get this call but that his researcher raoul abdul told me he was out he was with friends in the restaurant so we didnt talk much i thought he would never talk to me again i told him i would call him but he said he would be away until the middle of february and would call me when he returned he did call he wanted me to adapt his collection on jesse b semple to the stage are you interested drop by this evening old boy we have a producer for the fall season i remember standing in his library saying for lack of anything better man man he knew i knew the work because of the earlier research on the weary blues he wanted to give me original material from the first chicago defender article to the final new york post article in addition he wanted to know if i could do it by june because the producers stella holt and francis durcker would have to read it he also told me they had alvin ailey set to direct it i remember telling him it would be ready by the middle of may after reading the material again i told him what i wanted the character to cover the time of action and of course the place harlem usa we both got excited talking about what should be done with simple it would be set in the night since the black ghetto usually comes alive after dark simple would be allowed to move freely in the chaos of existence he would desperately search for some order in this chaos always explaining searching hoping in langston hughess dialogue langston hughess poetry showing how white folk is the cause of a lot of inconvenience in my life how they steal piece of him how his moral and religious faith in others save him from total destruction i finished the play simples blues on april langston called me april from the hotel wellington at the time he was working on a project for harry belafonte he moved into the wellington because there he could get away from the phone it also gave him a chance to read the play immediately he liked the play but he felt it had too many characters it would cost over the producer had only for the two plays ask your mama and simples blues we had some cheese dip he and raoul abdul had wine with theirs and ordered me coke i suggested that he should eat better we laughed we felt we had a hit if stella holt found the extra money or if i found a way to cut some of those people out i understood what he was indirectly telling me and went to work on rewrites i finished them on may i called langston

go there again and again and each time come away the better for it i was introduced to the amen corner in by owen dodson head of the drama department at howard university of washington d c ten years would pass before i would be privileged to amplify those luminous words upon the stage words capable of enlightening and encouraging us to bridge the gap of our crisis in black and white a crisis of understanding it would wait upon mrs maria cole to sponsor its broadway appearance in the distance between my first reading of the amen corner and its presentation prepared me to confront the challenge of its form and content after thirty years of work and study in the theatre i found it necessary to examine the causes of our social pathology symptoms of which seemed to be the subject matter without end in every medium of mass communication the time had come when the questions that itched my conscience could no longer be scratched away by reasoning why in a great society of many different cultures was there imaged no acknowledgement for the culture of the negro where were the demonstrations of the reality of integration in society why were there no black faces in commercials on tvdid not the black customer pay the same advertising tax why even in the great war epics were there no images of the black soldiers who gave their last full measure on those distant battlegrounds a couple of latins died there too where amid the many forms and techniques of stage screen tv communications was the negros point of view expressed concerning and promoting his own understanding and acceptance of himself questions concerning how to communicate respect of self and wellbeing prerequisites for respecting others it seemed to me that answers could and should be discovered and developed in the theatre vhich is the most personal the most intimate and the most direct means of communication i determined to produce the amen corner baldwin wiser than his knowledge had written the amen corner in a flush of inspiration which drove him past conventional forms of dramaturgy those forms and techniques have evolved from and are sustained by a conglomerate of european cultures which have historically done injustice to the negro baldwins play images the negro as he sees himselfnot consuming his genius protesting against invisibility or the myosis of others who are unable to see his total humanity this is the communication from an uncommon point of viewof a people who have known the range of wretchedness denial and abuse and who have hidden from these words and other labels of pain and hurt which have been their lot in the amen corner they are seen emerging digging themselves outachieving their realization of self inured to the disease hate but not victimized by it it is truly representative of a negro folk art serious and genuine as harold clurman has stated the presenting of the negro in his total humanity should concern the producers of theatre cinema and television communications and our critics as well the fundamental spiritual characteristic of a people cries out against suppressed into conformity with the standard a standard which has no criteria concerning the image of those characteristics manifested in their universal being the communication of the ethnic life of the negro is of profound significance at this time negroes are people very human beings who must integrate themselves through the acknowledgement of their own culture before they may be equally represented or integrated into a society of many different cultures the interchange of respect and selfrespect is the valuable aim and purpose of culture it is reciprocal and selfsustaining the interest increases with its being spent the amen comer is something of human value which becomes of greater human value as its distribution increases it is the meaning of compassion made manifest that seeing and feeling from anothers point of view their trials and triumphs as human beings searching to find the meaning of their existence in our human predicament there is no screaming or cursing or spitting back of hate the play is an affirmation of life an affirmation of value and an affirmation of the universality of man it is the negro from his point of view concerning and promoting his own understanding and acceptance of himself after the ultimate expression of

multiple disappointments the daily struggle to achieve accompanied him as a young child in washingtons black ghetto in high school in acting school in philadelphia and finally into the theatrical world of new york critical acclaim and national recognition were gained by hooks for his performance in the offbroadway production of leroi jones dutchman in many theatre people befriended hooks during his successful rise as an actor and producer for example joseph papp founder and director of the new york shakespeare festival cast the talented actor at a crucial point in his development he was offered the role of king henry in the mobile theaters production of henry v which toured throughout new yorks five boroughs during the summer of this theater unit was created to supplement productions at the delacorte theater in central park the permanent home of the shakespeare festival since the traveling theater introduced livedrama to many people for the first time actors and audiences came together in a fresh stimulating manner rewarding to both only within recent years has the company employed a number of nonwhite actors reflecting the various ethnic groups in new york city as the popular theater the festival has a critical responsibility to the multiracial community that supports it through city taxes and small individual gifts integration on the basis of talent has consciously been pursued by producer papp and greatly influenced his decision to secure hooks for the title role of henry v he remarked in an interview i dont think he is a great actor but he is growing as an actor in many ways he fulfilled the obligations of the part with distinction and a great deal of dignity i think he brought something to the play the white actor would not bring his own understanding of power in his special way this did not distort the play but on the contrary illuminated certain aspects of it at the time for a young leading man with a fair command of the language and a certain amount of emotional reality he did very well even though he brought some colloquialisms which think are domestic they added something here and there this statement attempts to clarify papps choice of hooks for the role and to illuminate the positive values he felt were forthcoming because of this choice several program notes under the caption about the play offer some indication of interpretation the story of henry v is a universal story of a ragged sick and hungry army plunged into battle against fresh and overwhelmingly superior forces both in numbers and in arms the emotional impact of the play is to be found in the audiences identification with the underdog in this case the english soldiers and their king it ends with the summation although the play is a paean to the glory of england it transcends flagwaving and is transformed into a statement of triumph for all ragged men fighting everywhere against impossible odds as a practical man shakespeare is not above propagandizing the prowess of england as an emerging world power through the heroic achievements of a popular monarch but as a playwright he transcends the plot for a higher purpose which though romantic in essence bears universal significance a sense of mysterious power guiding and directing causes of righteousness many things happen in the pace of a production which an audience never notices things that are immediately apparent in a close reading or analysis of the text for instance many of the lines in shakespeares better plays have an articulated energy uncommon to contemporary drama the richness of imagery and the accelerated delivery of dialogue makes it almost impossible to assimilate the total experience at a single performance an additional problem confronting american audiences is the highly figurative language used in shakespearean drama a catalogue of meaning common to playwright spectator and actor is necessary for total comprehension and enjoyment of period drama being twentieth century audiences we must make adjustments to the emotional association and sensory impressions common to the theatrical language of the elizabethan age for greater comprehension and enjoyment we expect the playwright to provide us with experiences that are more dynamic more objective and more coherent than the contradictions of actual experience it is therefore the responsibility of a director to discover the authors intent and to recreate this ordered experience without augmentation or distortion this particular production placed emphasis upon elements of spectacle such as a handsomelymounted stage sumptuous costumes physically attractive actors exciting and realistic sound effects and movement patterns of choreographic dimensions comic scenes were broadly exaggerated yet imaginatively staged however they were out of balance in proportion to their significance within the context of the play such corollaries as language used and poetic imagery projected were often distorted henry as a man and henry as a metaphor lacked syntheses in this production critical comments of hooks performance are vague and contradictory a statement such as king henry was especially good combining fiery grace with an almost tragic sensitivity contradicts with mr hooks strains a little and wears a perpetuallyworriedangry look as if the cares of knighthood and the demands of the role were a little beyond him add to this statement it took courage on mr papps part to put a negro in the role of henry v and one has a collective opinion of the new york press it undoubtedly takes more than almost tragic sensitivity and courage to achieve a high degree of competent acting be it shakespeare or shaw of particular interest to me was the performance of ellen holly as well as that of robert hooks she had been cast in the role of the princess of france and displayed the type of wit and style demanded by her high comic role hooks as henry was not totally convincing as the mature and farsighted statesman a seasoned warrior a dedicated religious man speeches of lyric quality were within hooks technical and emotional range when the heroic language became intense and saturated with emotion he sounded like a sophomore playing hamlet and badly the appearance of this black performer in a major shakespearean role seems to offend john simon drama critic of the hudson review papps casting policy is attributed to laudable integrational zeal and hooks is criticized not for artistic competence but because a black monarch supposedly negates the lifelikeness of the play papp comments whenever you do a classic you recreate life in the terms that now exist both politically and socially if you try to reproduce a play the way it was done originally it becomes a museum piece you have to draw from what exists what exists in new york and all throughout the world are different colored people and you cant deny their existence these two men agree on an essential point that an additional comment is made when a black actor confronts an audience in a role regarded traditionally as white papp feels that such an innovation allows an audience to watch the production in a more interesting manner if the actor is talented harold dewindt who stage managed the production observed negative reactions on the part of some white spectators to the initial appearance of hooks as henry these reactions obviously stemmed from psychological associations of having previously seen or certainly imagining only a white actor in the role when an initial reaction becomes a psychological hangup it is impossible for some spectators and evidently some critics to witness a play without imposing subjective feelings attitudes and perceptions upon it indiscriminately an individual can iimit and in some cases destroy an art experience by applying predetermined political and social references upon a play and upon performers who exist momentarily within the play historically henry v was an english monarch of the blood he was neither black nor yellow shakespeare as playwright has created a character who functions as man and metaphor fact and fiction and the play attempts to define mans basic instincts for domination conquest and survival integrated casting may perhaps work better in plays that are less historical or symbolic it may be that more sophistication is essential for spectators to be able to recognize the universality of human problems while disregarding color certainly the theme of sixteenth century english selfdetermination and nationalism alluded to by shakespeare is the same as that expressed by many contemporary black dramatists who are attempting to define the world in their own terms robert hooks as actor producer and black man is committed to the black arts movement which seeks a solution to the schism that exists between art and action in our society the unequivocal decision that ultimately faces every black artist is whether it is more rewarding to move delight and instruct black people in an allblack theater or whether it is better to accept the limited types of roles offered in the commercial theater and neglect black cultural expression hooks reached a decision four years ago with the creation of a group theater workshop that he cofounded with barbara ann teer he still considers this project to be his greatest achievement the group began with seven talented young blacks seriously interested in acting hooks modest manhattan apartment served as a studio during this early period but rapidly became too small as the group enlarged today the group theater has expanded to become the negro ensemble company with its own playwrights directors and choreographers a grant of from the ford foundation was largely responsible for this rapid growth and a recent gift of from the same foundation gives some indication of the success this theater has enjoyed in its short history hooks chose the framework of black theater in which to express his creative energies because it attempts to resolve the antithesis between the aspirations of art and the actions of men it is at the funcitonal level between art and action that drama is vita and relative whether white american producers directors and audiences can interact with the complexities of human experience that unfold through the dramatic process is highly questionable if they are unwilling or unable to extend themselves beyond considerations of color and there is strong negative indication that they cannot then black artists must separate themselves completely from an institution that in theory and practice denies restricts and destroys black creative energy and selfdetermination through l t ward the his four characters in the baptism leroi jones dramatizes a dichotomy in attitudes tochurch among black people conservative acceptance is reflected in the minister and the old woman militant rejection is embodied in the homosexual and the boy the sacrosanct yet worldly minister filthy with success epitomizes the status quo of low income black churches he plays his role of spiritual leader and soul saver seriously so seriously in fact that his potential as a community leader is obviated myopically he focuses on the minute activities of his congregation becoming little more than an expert voyeur and singer of banalities he confides to the homosexual i smell your lovers and pray that you be redeemed i bathe them in my holy water and they are as baptized children and when the old woman swoons in a semierotic state he pronounces solemnly she has swooned in the service of the lord the hypocrisy of the minister is revealed in his dress and his high appraisal of himself the homosexual comments enviously and contemptuously you are filthy with success you religious motherfucker who may i ask is your tailor in the midst of a slow dance the minister dedares with candid egoism i fuck no one who does not claim to love me you the homosexual are less selective in the minister also is a reflection of the matriarchal inclination of black lowincome churches despite his egotism which is somewhat juvenile he accepts the directions of the old woman without reservation both when she decides that the boy is christ and later when she decides that the boy should be killed for lying the dominance of the old woman augmented by a chorus of young sleek village types of women dramatizes the strong appeal the black church has for black women in it are found many emotional outlets and a sense of control which is psychologically gratifying significantly the energy of the old woman is concentrated in a fierce righteousness an emotioncharged vindictive will to serve god in a fervent expression of this will she cries out i cast the stone because of your sons virtue to root the sinners out make a list lord make a list of them and ill root them out and cast them in the pit it is she who denounces the boy and causes him to seek baptism and later it is she who demands his death when the boy asks forgiveness she screams blasphemer you spilled your seed in prayer you sacrificed these vestals to your lust you should die die and the women in a choral response call upon god may our true husbandtobe castrate you with his lightning liar devil these words of the chorus raise another aspect of the black churchbehind the hysterical domineering woman hovers the shadow of the black mans failures and the trauma of the separated black family lacking a secular husband the black woman waits and trusts in her husbandtobe and invests in his sexual potency he thus becomes the big stroker of the universe who popped us in those various hallways of love but the feverish eroticorighteousness of the church is not sufficient to hide the materialistic influences which have pervaded it these influences are cuttingly commented on by the homosexual who represents a free thinking intellectual point of view christianity as a doctrine of love is defunct in white america overruled by the protestant ethic consequently the militant thinker rejects the church and turns to the political arena the homosexual therefore demands let it be politics or shut up and when he learns that the boy is christ he asks lemme see you turn this place into the white house or something cool like that aware that the village girls supposedly escapees from a materialistic hell pray for a new doll and a monopoly set and an fm radio and a picture of monk the homosexual tells them devout citizens stop it go home to your radios he also makes several references to sports suggesting that in white america and parts of negro america the world series is taken more seriously than the sermon on the mount with tongue in cheek he gives himself pseudohonors by proclaiming i be willie mays of the queers by his references to sports the homosexual expresses his consciousness of the pastashumiliation for the black man he chides the old woman for singing that old nigger song and delcares that he will not be limited to tiny nigger songs paradoxically the homosexual is the freest most loving of jones characters he only tries to save the boy and he alone possesses a true joie de vivre as he says the pride of life is life and flesh must make its move i am the sinister lover of love the mysterious villain of thought i love all things as they are issued from you know who god if anyone in the play has soul it is the homosexual it seems that jones is indicating christianity as a debaser and distorter of the black mans psyche an impediment to black unity and black understanding and this indictment reaches a climax in the character of the boy after an initial denial the boy finally reveals that he is christ by then the woman and her followers and the minister are bent on sacrificing the youth his pleas for understanding are totally disregarded as the group whips itself into a righteous frenzy chanting we must cleanse ourselves you must be sacirficed at this point christ negates his mission by taking arms a long silver sword he will not be a savior of those who possess no charity no humanity no love wielding his sword in selfdefense and anger he shouts there will be no second crucifixion the attitude of jones christ is symbolic of the new direction in black thought and feeling the name is black_power the message is there will be no second enslavement whereas in the baptism one sees the turning point of a people assuming that christs rejection of his mission represents the black mans rejection of nonviolence in the toilet a personal dilemma is presented ray foots an intelligent sensitive young black man finds himself caught between the demands of his black friends who subscribe to a code of violence and those of his white friends who relate to one another in more socially accepted ways the setting of the play has a sinister symbolism the high school latrine is described by playwright jones as a large bare toilet built of gray rough cement there are urinals along one wall and a partition separating them from the toilet must resemble the impersonal ugliness of a school toilet or a latrine of some institution a few rolls of toilet paper are spread out on the floor wet through the actors should give the impression frequently that the place smells this place of course is really the nether world of the american society it is one of the sewer system and the city dump necessary but impolite to mention it is the underside of our crisp cheerful bureaucratic fagade and the assumption is that here if anywhere one can relate to another without the mask the plot is simple rays black friends have discovered a love letter written to him by one of his white acquaintances ray has scheduled a meeting in the latrine in which with the blacks as spectators he will beat the white boy james karolis and save his honor when the play opens a few of the spectators are waiting in the latrine for foots to bring karolis in evidently class is in session and they are waiting for it to end jones dramatizes the code of violence of these young men by showing how they speak to one another that is constant signifying on each others mothers and girl friends and how they express themselves kinesthetically shoving boxing wrestling pretending to play basketball together fearlessness and agility are prized ora the loudest crudest and least sensitive of them often brags about how fast he can run and how well he can crush another cat they all feel disdain for karolis because he is slightly built and eventually ora jumps another white boy donald farrell one feels simply because he appears so vulnerable when foots enters karolis has already been brought in by two boys his condition is rather pathetic karolis head is hanging and he is crying softly and blood is on his shirt and face although he hides it foots reaction is one of horror and disgust he conceals his feelings by continuing to play a gruff role and by using the language his black friends expect of him his first question is what the hell you hit him with ora a goddamn train foots reveals his difficult position to the audience when he explains why he is late for the confrontation that goddamn van ness had me in his office he said im a credit to my race he said im smartasawhip and should help him to keep all you unsavory elements in line the audience must assume that foots is an aboveaverage student who gets on in the white world of the high school as well as he does in the black cunningly however he laughs as he mentions the principals words and even imitates him so that it will appear that he takes none of the white mans premises to heart karolis condition causes foots to hesitate he had not anticipated the extent of the violence his friends were ready to indulge in foots tries to squeeze out of the situation by saying he cant beat anyone who is already sprawled on the floor but at this point farrell white makes the mistake of commending foots for his decision by saying i sure am glad somebodys got some sense here at this foots gets angry and demands that farrell leave farrell then wants to know what is so important that foots has to revenge himself on an already defeated person then one of the blacks laughingly tells farrell about the letter the response is an interesting one a letter oh ray come on why dont you come off it this suggests that foots has revealed something about himself to the whites which the blacks were unaware of it is a subtle hint which is missed by the boys in their efforts to get rid of farrell after farrells departure karolis staggers to his feet insisting on going on with the fight to everyones amazement he gets the best of foots and when it seems that karolis is going too far ora and the rest of the crowd jump in to aid their man karolis is beaten and left alone on the floor during the fight with foots karolis reveals everything he admits sending the note you have to fight me i sent you a note remember that note saying i loved you the note saying you were beautiful not only did he send the note foots himself responded to karolis advances ill fight you right here in this same place where you said your name was ray ray you said your name was you said ray you put your hand on me and said ray and finally as he is being punched in the face karolis manages to say no no his name is ray not foots i love somebody you dont even know this last statement by karolis is the theme of the play when he says i love somebody you dont even know he is referring to a sexual aspect of rays personality but i think it can be taken in a racial context also foots dilemma is the dilemma of the integrationist to what extent do you profess and abide by the mores of your socalled subculture and to what extent do you accept the dictates of the suprasociety which is also a white society at one time one would have said that foots was trying to rise above a subnormal perverted culture today we know that violence is a legitimate way of life for those who have been violated psychologically economically socially and physically in the conclusion foots has not resolved his dilemma he has remained hostile to karolis before his friends but after they leave he returns and stares at karolis body for a second looks quickly over his shoulder then runs and kneels before the body weeping and cradling the head in his arms n his first book the crisis of the negro intellectual harold cruse critically examined the intellectual history of the afroamerican in the twentieth century it is not at all surprising then that the collected essays published three years later than originally intended under the title rebellion or revolution morrow now provide us with the recorded intellectual history of one black american harold w cruse all but two of these essays have been published previously over a sixteenyear period beginning with the daily worker in through studies on the left liberator presence africaine the new leader and from les temps moderne an essay printed in english for the first time in he reviewed the movie king solomons mines pointing out its exploitative and imperialistic significance the early cruse essays typical of a young writer contained a naivete in style and tone it seems that since that time cruse has given considerable thought to marxism as practiced by blacks and whites alike in their treatment of the black mans struggle for selfdetermination in the united states the path from my very first articles to the crisis turned out to be a road years long but i didnt know that then in fact i had no idea where i was headed but as each year went by i saw the road leading deeper into a peculiar kind of american cultural sickness hence in response to julian mayfields criticism cruse is indeed engaged in an ideological crusade but not for the sake of egotistical satisfaction these articles and essays were all derived from my great need to interpret what i perceived as a unique interplay of political economic and cultural factors at work behind the various freedomseeking fronts of the black movement factors which needed what camus once called a theoretical frame in devoting all these years to the task of what i judge to be a rational inquiry into certain disputed facts of our reality i persevere in the hope that i have helped to make the future of the arts more relevant and secure i believe that the only antidote to the present irrational thrust toward social oblivion is more rationality whether one agrees or disagrees with cruse is not the concern of this review rebellion or revolution is testimony to the evaluations set forth in the crisis a book so controversial and challenging that it has been the subject of conferences and symposia and has solidified friendships among us even while opening the closet doors but cruse would prefer that we evaluate his ideas judgments and dialectical method instead of himself the cruse approach is essentially marxist by an afroamericans cultural views indicated in its tone that the writer was certain of his commitment to a cultural rehabilitation in the outlook of black america by the marxian dialecticism and cruses frustration is much more noticeable as his prose assumed a clarity often tempered by a sharp wit as of early the dialectical process literally had jelled and was second nature to his perceptions and their analyses cruses technique involves a review in historical perspective of black intellectuals and their respective ideas and tendencies juxtaposing them against each other observing their opposites and similarities and perceiving them as historical antecedents to the contemporary scene the cruse approach has been influenced not only by marx but also more or less by lenin stalin eduard bernstein camus and c wright mills although cruse would claim none of these as a particular intellectual godfather in his approach he has evaluated what he calls the contemporary programmatic crisis through a systematic treatment of socialistic theories and tendencies which he clearly explains despite entertaining seemingly contradictory principles besides the introduction the essay behind the black_power slogan is the other previously unpublished commentary it was originally prepared for and subsequently rejected by the socialist scholars conference of and its point of departure is the uncertainties of the biack power conference in newark during the summer of the same year cruse by the way has had an ideological war with white marxists and communists particularly with the noted authority on black history herbert aptheker and the younger selfacclaimed jazz authority frank kofsky white marxists cannot see blacks as a nation and their europeanbased theories are totally irrelevant to the american situation yet it is the black marxists whom cruse feels are the most irrelevant political animals of our times who paradoxically are the only blacks who have any firm theoretically oriented longrange commitment to socialism the wilkinses youngs kings sncc core the black_powerites the urban guerrillas etcnone of these has any longrange commitment to socialism the heart of cruses uneasiness is that he perceives uncertainty in the meaning of black peoples use of the term black_power in that the black movement suffers from historical discontinuity the resolutions of that particular conference show a revolutionary posture

would not let him live and function as a man linda is in love with donald a bright young man who wants to be a writer and she spends much of her time at home fantasizing about donald and their future together linda is teased and tormented by her older cousin nora and by the neverending cynicism of her grandmother linda wants to believe in donald she wants to believe that he can overcome the traps which destroyed her grandfather and which forced her own father to abandon her mother in the two scenes which precede this excerpt from the long oneact play linda has been cleaning the house in anticipation of donalds visit at the same time arguing with her cousin and grandmother and daydreaming mr milner has titled his play the warning a theme for linda it is a oneact play in four scenes two of which are published on these pages performance of the excerpt in any manner is expressly forbidden without permission from mr milner or his agent james forman in bringing to light the story of sammy younge sammyyounge jr grove press undertook a task which for some time now has gone begging seemingly because of a marked indifference on the part of those who are involved in what has been loosely labeled the movement forman through the medium of print has sought to do what many in the socalled vanguard of the black liberation struggle have only talked about and that is to pay homage to the movements dead by keeping alive their memory as a consequence what emerges in this work is a very profound and moving political biography which is in fact one of the first of its kind to appear in the literary genre of the as yet embryonic black liberation movement in america the prime significance of formans book lies not in the notoriety of its subject character the usual motive behind the writing of most definitive biographies but rather in the contemporary import of the political message in its content the story of sammy younge is at once both a chronicle of the developing roots of todays radical awareness exhibited by the black college student and an insightful look at the inner political trends which have shaped the newfound outlook of snccan outlook which in little more than two years has caused sncc to view itself as a human rather than civil_rights organization dedicated as such to third world liberation and black_power the book for the most part is constructed around a series of interviews and conversations gathered by forman and an ad hoc committee set up to publish sammy younge sammy younges parents along with close friends and associates which include such notables as stokely carmichael and willie ricks have combined here to convey their impressions and feelings of sammy and the movement as it developed around tuskegee sammys home perhaps the singular most distinguishing feature of the book is the refreshing attempt forman has made to reveal sammys personality too often in similar works there is a serious drawback in the manner in which a characters personal life style is illuminated many figures emerge simply as a set of cold descriptions to be considered for the moment by the reader and later forgotten sammy younge on the contrary here can be seen for what he was a sensitive black man who experienced and felt all the hurts and joys as well as inner conflicts over girls school and society incidental to an average life it is later related how sammy unable to resolve the many contradictions that daily face every black person living in racist america sought outlet for his tensions and frustrations in drink and fast cars nonetheless sammy although only years old and living with one kidney already had deeply involved himself in political organizing and defense of the black community this at a time when most black people were busy cursing malcolm_x for advocating independent political struggle and black selfdefense as stokely remarked sammy just before he was murdered was seriously considering the formation of a black_panther party in his home county sammy continued to move along this line despite the many doubts and misgivings that had begun to grow in his mind over his ability to continue to function in the movement however as is made clear it was too late for sammy to turn back for he had already become a marked man bad nigger in the eyes of tuskegees white and black which too had a vested interest in the maintenance of order and stability establishment from this point it was only a matter of time before the inevitable happened according to forman the murder of sammy younge by a white gas station owner and the subsequent acquittal by an allwhite jury momentarily had a sobering effect on tuskegees black bourgeoisie it served to bring them to the realization that what happened to sammy could just as easily have happened to them for it is a welltested truism by now that no matter how much money or power a black man in america has hes still a nigger forman with this view has fittingly chosen to title the chapter that deals with sammys actual murderthe death of a myth sammys death also had an effect on the student community at tuskegee university it forced many black students there for the first time to reevaluate some of the goals and ideals of the university itself in fact a large number of the black students there who had been hitherto uninterested in anything other than getting the piece of paper and moving on to the american promise of money and status themselves became committed to the liberation struggle a struggle which in the neardecade since four black students from north carolina a and t college sat down at a segregated lunch counter in greensboro in has steadily progressed in scope today of course the demand is no longer the narrowly defined objective of integration as san francisco state college and columbia university have shown black students are demanding that the university and thereby american society since the university is in reality only a microcosmic extension of this society be transformed into a genuinely free institution for all rather than simply an academic brainwashing factory sammy younge who was described by forman as the first black student to die in the black liberation movement then represents in a very real sense every black student in america in the end therefore on the strength of sammys commitment and vitality to the freedom of black people rests the strength of formans bookearl ofari in the past two years several welldocumented soberly approached books have been published which tell how minorities in general and how black people in particular are routinely brutalized by the nations police of course for black people mexicanamericans and puerto ricans there is nothing new or revealing in these books the books are designed for the enlightenment of the white reading publicor for that segment of it which does not automatically approve whatever the police do against black people or hippies or those with the wrong color or ethnic background the big blue line coward mccann by ed gray was one of the first of these books published long before the chicago confrontation of august when the bullyboys of mayor richard daley demonstrated for the whole world the kind of viciousness of which they are capable mr grays report dealt not only with police violence against people in the streets but also with the collusion between the policemen and the courts and the police practice of beating up whomever offends them and then charging the victim with resisting arrest both police power pantheon by paul chevigny and the people and the police mcgrawhill by algernon d black cover much the same ground as the big blue line but with added dimensions of the three books police power is probably the most direct and the most infuriating mr chevigny a staff attorney for the new york civil liberties union writes out of firsthand experience his book which has the subtitle police abuses in new york city grew out of two years or investigation of cases involving the police and ordinary people most of them black and puerto ricans all thiee books deal in various degrees with the police personality the mental bent and psychological hangups which too often transform men entrusted with maintaining lawandorder into mere brutes with guns and nightsticks the documentation speaks for itself mr black by the way was chairman of the new york civilian complaint review board which the politically powerful new york p ironically less than a year after william styron defiled black history with confessions of nat turner frank yerby has published a novel which will test the objectivity and the sincerity of those critics who defending styron proclaimed an authors license to interpret the personality and the culture of historical figures of a different race judas my brother dial yerbys twentysecond novel tells the story of a jewish youth sensitized and alienated by his belief that he is illegitimate blessed with a hypnotically forceful personality wealthy friends and credulous audiences he accomplishes miracles in addition to those which biographers invent for him after persuading himself that god has appointed him to exemplify righteousness as a sacrificial lamb he suicidally provokes hebrew and roman authorities into executing him when they finally do he dies in despair believing that god has slaughtered him this of course is the story of the carpenters son yeshua ha notzri known to contemporary americans as jesus of nazareth i suspect that this novel will disappoint the yerby enthusiasts who have not already been dissuaded by the cost of his recent works some may be shocked by the obviously controversial theme especially since yerby in his first years of glory an nounced that a novelist had neither responsibility nor right to meddle with the prejudices of his readers other enthusiasts may be disappointed by the diminution of sex and by the limited appeal to sadismonly one gang rape in pages the reduced quantity however does not lower the intensity in fact yerby exceeds his earlier horrors when he describes the suicide of a prostitute who rips herself open from the navel to the womb and when he recounts in tortuous detail the process of death by crucifixion judged according to literary criteria judas my brother is not exceptional even for yerby the main plot is too familiar it is the story of the loves and other adventures of nathan bar yehudah who marries yeshuas younger sister yerby writes sentences as crudely as usual and his penchant for interpolating foreign terms continues to be annoying the minor plot is more unified than usual only because the gospels furnished yerby with a tightly knit wellconstructed outline nevertheless although he may disappoint enthusiasts and literary purists yerby has developed his most significant themean interpretation of the greatest story ever told troubled by the discrepancies and contradictions which are obvious to anyone who compares the four gospels yerby searched through other historical materialsespecially the antiquities of josephus visited the original locations studied aramic and hebrew and familiarized himself with hebrew ritual in order to present an accurate account he has not always succeeded for example in an unnecessary effort to explain each miracle he occasionally has resorted to melodramatic contrivances more absurd than any propagandists romancer could have devised furthermore he sometimes annoys by thrusting his fictional characters into some of the more familiar incidents of the new testament one is hardly prepared for the reappearance of a fictitious prostitute as the woman whom yeshua or jesus saves from execution by stoning occasionally yerby arbitrarily discounts familiar stories for example he ridicules the legendary flight into egypt by advising credulous readers to ask miriam mary whether she knows anything about that country nevertheless serious consideration must be given to much of the material which yerby has documented with pages of footnotes for example he has argued persuasively that jesus was not born in bethlehem because at the supposed time of his birth there was no census which would have compelled joseph to go there yerbys attitude towards the different gospels diverges from scholarly tradition he has paid little attention to the estimate that mark was probably the earliest ignoring the possibility that matthew was written by a churchman concerned with establishing ritual and justifying the legend he dismisses matthew as a fool to be valued only for his exact transcriptions of the words of jesus he has drawn heavily on luke who admitted that he was merely retelling what was popular tradition among later christians and even though he has borrowed material from john yerby has served humanity by proving repeatedly that john was a remarkably imaginative inventive and skillful storyteller who knew little about hebrews and less about palestine probably the section deserving the most intensive study is yerbys account of the last supper the trial and the crucifixion if his explanation of the disappearance of the body from the tomb disappoints those who believe in miracles it is at least valuable in pointing up what is clear in the gospelsthe fact that for a significant period of time no one guards the tomb this sketchy summary may suggest that frank yerby has gleefully written sacrilege to the contrary yerby actually seems to love mary and jesusas human beings not as gods as he says he has nothing to report about the virgin mary for his subject is the human miriam mary who solves first the problem of persuading her husband that he fathered their eldest son and later as a widow solves the problem of rearing a family which includes an itinerant son who damages the familys reputation by wandering around the countryside preaching and continually provoking authorities yerby also admires and pities yeshua a phenomenal personality destined to become an ironically tragic figure because in his name men persecute by violence to enforce the lesson of love and mercy which he taught in the sermon on the mount yerby even sympathizes with lovestricken gullible judas who receives no money for his betrayal and who lives to old age burdened with the memory of that betrayal yerby does not condemn the human beings who suffered the sorrows that shaped the legend instead he attacks the pauline myth which rooted in pagan tradition has been used for almost years to delude and destroy godly men this book then climaxes the theme which he formed in the saracen blade and developed further in an odor of sanctity although some of yerbys interpretations may be questioned his book should stimulate a reader to question the myth and to seek his own answers judas my brother should be read by everyone who professes to be a christian for a change a yerby novel is worth darwin t turner he raw pearl harcourt brace world isnt necessarily the jewel it could be the story of the life of pearl bailey and if it were you may not go completely wrong if you possessed it miss bailey did us all a great service by writing the book herself she is no writer but she is a rather fabulous person who has tried to honestly evaluate her life as she has seen it over some years negro autobiographies are always frustrating because we lead frustrating lives unless we or someone else fictionalize there is always going to be a certain level of drag repetition and rationalization because even the most successful of us always carry a sign on our backs saying for a negro which is of course a circumvention of the level of our success this frustration and rationalization shows clearly in miss baileys autobiography it could not be that she was just talented she must surely have beenstill be aware of many people who are as talented as she but not nearly so successfulher own brother the one and only bill bailey is one exampleyet she made it and they didnt she ascribes her success to faith in god and while we would never quarrel with her faith we are aware that many people who are just as talented have just as much faith and still are not as successful because the society in which we live is built on limited demand we recognize that miss bailey was as aggressive as all hell and pulled no punches climbing to the top she was hesitant to put it that way she was afraid of her father competitive with her brother and abused by her first husband we could conclude that with the exception of don redmond she had negative relationships with black men her subsequent happiness with louis bellson must have had some relationship to that an autobiography is by definition limited to the view of the person writing it yet we wish she had given a little more thought as to just why her relationships were as they were she appears to love her children and only two other people louis and peetney redmond peetney is her lifelong friend and seeing the genuine affection that miss bailey holds for her is necessary to an understanding of the pearl but a climb to the top isnt necessarily geared to finding and making friends miss bailey has a delightful way of climbing over someone then saying but i think they have respect for me everybody has respect for a conquerorthey won didnt they but not affection miss bailey has peppered her book with little poems by friends thoughts she has jotted in poetic form and prayers she has loved her famous stage asides appear also although on stage they are witty while in written form they have a tendency to border on moralisms which are more sickly than cute but the raw pearl has something to offer and if one has a determination to read it one may find it quite interesting the most explanatory statement in the book isnt a comment at all but a picture next to page with the word pappa that says a whole lot about the pearl and may possibly relate to its rawness nikki giovanni the jewelers eye g p putnams sons a collection of pieces by william f buckley jr is subtitled a book of irresistible political reflections to the white liberal american mentality buckley is indeed irresistible perhaps owing to among other things the way in which he fills the white style vacuum they call him charming moreover unlike the typical conservative buckley meets the qualifications of the liberal establishment having read all of their literature and is respected by them as an intelligent man thus buckleys rejection of the liberals cannot be dismissed by them as crude as in the case of the great masses of their countrymen but is instead curious and no matter that he never tires of chastizing them buckley presumably is as content as the liberals with the arrangement if for no other reason than that his metaphors would be wasted on a conservative audience reading buckley now and then occasionally viewing him in debate one might find oneself at once outraged by his audacity and yet a victim of his wit sarcasm and endless syllabizing one might in fact come to think of him as nothing more than the most articulate spokesman for the other argument rather than an evil man buckley seducing weaklings on tv may perhaps be more entertaining than the commercials or the corny white actions on other channels however in the course of reading an entire book of his opinion there is little that would distract one from his worldviewa view of the universe that excludes all but affluent white westerners from the family of man buckleys is a holy war no less fanatic than the crusades in which anyone who would shudder at the thought of a world ruled by the strategic air command it is already a fact is beyond god was it karl barth who said that anticommunism as a doctrine is as dangerous as communism understatement scolding schlesinger fulbright and other harmless liberals who are distinguished from him more as a matter of aesthetics than ethics as william stringfellow once noted concerning the difference between northern and southern white men buckley might leave the impression of a con man but deadly buckley more a madman surfaces when the people under attack are sartre susan sontag stauchton lynd and others who are not satisfied to dismiss the crimes of the west as something apart from its cultural legacy one neednt labor over the chasm between buckleys point of view and the interests of black people it is as though one has been asked by the chief of police in a mississippi hamlet what are you doing here at the conclusion of a piece on the newark rebellion buckley advises a little hard labor on history and morality and the causes of the rise of civilizations and the fall of civilizations bill buckley suffering from moral infancy thinks himself a civilized man but the future of civilization is of course not dependent on eloquence and money alone the jewelers eye as a reflection of its author is unimaginative and depthless leaving one not allured but in the very worst sense boreddavid llorens
even since the publicae tion of the report of js the presidents commission on the causes of civil disorders racism and racist increasingly frequent and justified use while the usage of these two terms may have a cathartic effect on the oppressed the terms have seen black american they may also serve to take the place of critical thinking human beings seem to prefer to name things rather than to think about them and consequently to talk about things rather than to do something about them effective action depends on accurate knowledge about phenomena however and not on descriptive labelling since the fundamental issue facing black americans today is survival in its most literal sense namecalling activities are best left to children and to enemies the hour is too late and the situation too critical for honkybaiting necessary as such activity might have been in the past what then are the priorities related to survival first and most important black americans must learn to reorient their thinking from what can be termed dependency analysis of their situation to an interdependency analysis of it for example to describe low educational achievement among black children as the result of dependent on racism is to engage in dependency or cause and effect analysis a better explanation one more attune to modern scientific thinking is to describe such phenomena as not only the result of one or more phenomena but also as the cause of these same phenomena thus it is just as meaningful to talk about low educational achievement as the cause of racism as to describe it as an effect the meaning of this statement will be made clearer i hope in the subsequent paragraphs white largely liberal thinking has brainwashed us all into believing this for example if education is increased income will increase and if income is increased better housing will ensue etc such thinking is strongly dependencyoriented and while it lends itself neatly to prepackaged programs to help the disadvantaged it cannot deal with social reality the fact of the matter is that the problems facing black americans are infinitely more complex and are related to systemic social forces and not due to a group of elements which operate independently of each other to adequately deal with these forces necessitates a radical break with traditional modes of thinking most white people are incapable of making this break it is becoming increasingly clear that the countrys last source of originality as well as creativity lies within the black community it is necessary for black americans to examine american society as a system a social system can be defined as a group of people in interaction with each other any social system can be described in terms of its subsystems and components the city of philadelphia can for example be described as a social system subsystems of the system might include the various sections such as north philly west philly etc a component of the north philly subsystem might be a particular street or neighborhood there are several facts to recognize in the analysis of social systems a systems are dynamic ie they change through time b they operate according to certain rules and c a change in one element of the system has an effect on the totality of the system social systems operate by means of communication the communication of information is the social cement of all human societies information includes much more than just newspaper or television content however information is anything which people or systems use to make decisions these decisions may range in triviality from what tie shall i wear to what is the most feasible way to move large numbers of black people into concentration camps information is the crucial type of input into a social system in much the same way as electricity is a crucial type of input into a stereo or hifi system once a system has some source of input it transforms this input in such a way as to produce a certain output the output of a stereo system is music the output of many social systems are certain actions which people transform the information input into outputs ie who the decisionmakers are depends on the system in question in a typical school for example a principal may produce the outputs these outputs may take the form of firing of certain teachers the input might be the hiring of others thus it is possible to conceive of people eg teachers as constituting information the hiring of certain teachers makes it possible to fire others and viceversa people attempt to change systems when they perceive the outputs of the system to be detrimental to their interests to most black people in america the outputs of relevant systems are detrimental bad housing bad business prac tices bad schooling bad press treatment bad jobs etc are all outputs of specific social subsystems it is not surprising that the focal point of demonstrations and insurrections has been on these outputs nor is it surprising that such activities have failed the reason that they fail is that in all systems there is a direct relationship between inputs and outputs and it is useless to focus on one set of factors while ignoring the other in other words there is feedback see diagram between information outputs and information inputs ie the effects of certain decisions has subsequent on the type of information input into the system thus to return to statements made earlier the effect of racism low educational achievement is also the cause of racism racism is thus a system input the relationship between inputs and outputs is not a onetoone relationship ie if we know what went into a system in the way of information we still could not be exactly sure what would come out in the way of actions the inputs into a system are transformed or worked upon in the production of specific outputs these transformation activities are performed according to certain implicit and explicit rules the explicit rules are usually written in the form of charters bylaws constitutions etc an explicit rule in a school system for example might be as follows all students must pass fourth grade reading test x before promotion to the fifth grade on the national level an explicit rule is that no one should be deprived of the right to vote because of race religion or national origin in most social systems however explicit rules are less operative than are the implicit ones implicit transformation rules are those cultural beliefs values and sentiments which guide most human behavior thus while many white people will give lip service to the explicit rule stating all men to be equal they will operate under the implicit rule that black men are not equal to white men whatever set of rules a system or a systems decisionmaker operates under they play a part in determining the outputs of that system thus to transform a system it is necessary to not only change the inputs and outputs of a system but to also change the rules governing the operation of the total system this latter change is the most difficult of all for it involves convincing people black and white who believe the world is flat that they are fundamentally wrong such perceptions of reality are rarely changed short of some kind of revolution thus to the extent that black people engaged in boycotts and other activities directed at system inputs we are involved in an economic revolution to the extent that activities are focused on system outputs we are involved in a political revolution and to the extent that we are engaged in changing the implicit rules governing system operations we are involved in a cultural revolution and as harold cruse has noted all three revolutions are mandatory racism is best defined as a cultural sentiment or belief regarding the inherent inferiority of nonwhites it is less an individual characteristic than it is a system or societal one there will always be racists but there need not always be racism systems differ with respect to the degree that they depend upon racism for their functioning virtually every social ss tem in the south would disintegrate if racism were to disappear overnight in the north however there are other sources of system input and racism is more of a reserve source in any case racism as a sentiment pervades the entire culture north and south east and west the differences occur in the uses to which it is put in terms of system functioning the function of boycotts is to cut existing sources of system input while most uses of the boycott have been in relation to systems which depend on money as a source of system input it should be clear from the discussion above that economic boycotts are but one of an infinite number of ways to prevent information flow when students at columbia university brought the system to a grinding halt they were engaged in input disruption it should be noted that all actions designed to cut off system input need not be violent the differences between a liberal a radical and a revolutionary can be defined in terms of the price each is willing to pay for the cutting off of information input into an illegitimate system people who refuse to pay taxes to join the army to pledge allegiance to a flag to vote to provide census information are all performing the same function viz they are refusing to supply input to the system if enough people perform these functions over a long enough period of time the system will disintegrate the question of tactics in the black liberation movement concerns these very issues the question of foreign intervention in the internal affairs t of underdeveloped countries has long been a bone of great contention but the question of what constitutes the underd development of a nation impresses a far greater influence on nat ure cf this intervention than is commonly understood given the natural disparities in economic existence in the modern world it is only to be expected that the large nations whose existence is to a great measure determined by their ability to ensure that development in the socalled underdeveloped nations proceeds at a pace dictated by the assurance of continued prosperity for themselves would view intervention in the internal affairs of the weaker nations as a primary objective on both political and economic grounds the reality of the present day standards of developed existence is that the white nations are the developed nations because the nonwhite nations are forced by circumstances of time and lack of technological breadth to supply the basic needs for their continuing prosperity this constant and regular outflow of basic property saps the nonwhite nations industrial and economic energy and produces an enormous disparity between the nations will to self determination and its ability to realize self determination taking the above generalities into consideration it is not hard to discern the need for and the advantages of a drive towards a greater unity of spirit that would give rise to an exchange of resources among the international groups that make up the underdeveloped world it is at this point that one should begin to examine the peculiar role that the afroamerican community has been forced into in this ideological breakdown of national interests the afroamerican community and by this i mean africans born and living in communities in all the americas exists within and supplies a large percentage of the labor force that produces export material in the american sector of the economic community of developed nations but the afroamerican has never beenand will never beallowed to participate in the policymaking base of the developed communitys existence by the very nature of his involvement with a past that holds as its basic standard the most obnoxious institution and symbol of the history of whitenonwhite relationships slavery as an industry the afroamerican is a continuing predicate of revolution within the developed community he is an alien in his land but knowledgeable about its mores he is by the very nature of his emotional loyalties the most advantageously placed member of the underdeveloped community for make no joke about it afroamerica is as ruthlessly exploited even in its ephemeral geographical existence as any of the more concretely recognizable nations of the underdeveloped world not only her labor resources but her resources of will and incentive are disestablished by the very nature of the surroundings in which they are called to function because the native history of afroamericas presence coincides politically with the colonial or subservient history of most of the underdeveloped nations her historic place in the present coincides with the dynamic meaning of the postcolonial drive towards self detemination that represents the positive side of the underdeveloped presence and role in modern political life emotionally the realistic desire for the vague but firm value freedom binds the afroamerican to the african or asian mass at the root point of their present respective existences it is now that we should begin to examine the role of method and ethnocratic identity in modern politics in an effort to justify the involve ment rather than intervention of afroamericans in the problems and successes of africa spirit as method the method of making any alliance subservient to its creative outcome must involve the activation in practical terms of subjective principles such abstract values as brotherhood must be understood in terms of beneficial interchange thus black brotherhood that seeks to bridge the barriers created by centuries of enstrangement and even more forbidding worlds of immediate existential in temperament and experience must be understood as ethnosocial expression with practical advantages again the most public and manifest expression of this phenomena must be seen in the possibility for an appeal to emotional pride that is common on extraracial grounds that predicates a promise of future selfdetermination of spirit for afroamerican and african alike when the late malik el shabazz malcolm_xand may his soul rest in peacesaid that the problem of euroamerican exploitation of afroamerican resources should be taken before the united nations he visualized the afroamerican stand not as a new divergence in that extensively fragmented juggernaut but as an integral and cohesive agent of action within the already firmly established revolutionary wing of the afroasian bloc this vision was not the result of a dream but was in fact a vision of reality for if afroamericans can ever begin to fight against the inequities of their internal position on the same terms of international intercourse that other underdeveloped and economically exploited communities do then the settlements that they extract must of necessity have similar international results and implications this would in itself be the first step in the conscious involvement in african problems and successes blanket name affairs of the afroamerican community that is predicated by personal involvement in specific african situations by afroamerican individuals a genuine honest and nonpatronizing interest in and decision to aid or at least lend service to distressed or beleaguered africa by afroamericans is in all simplicity a great blow for the cause of freedom of self determination for the afroamerican community for by this interest or decision the signal is given for the judgement of and evaluation ofthe afroamerican communitys destiny in world terms rather than in narrow neocolonial formulas of need vs want later we shall outline the virtues that might be considered basic tenets of the method implied by this intimation but from this general structure the question of ethnocratic identity as a positive force must evolve in the establishment of this argument the ethnocratic principle the ethnocratic principle is the principle that recognizes in a common ethnic identity the possibility of a collation of strength rather than a vague intimation towards superiority ethnic superiority is a false direction both politically and structurally but creative and dynamic political strength can be established on the basis of ethnic unity the resultant elite is an ethnocracy the causes and effects of such an establishment of ethnocratic principles can only be evaluated in terms of positive beneficiary action and analyzed in terms of active results thus it is that the emotional experience of the afroamerican community can be transformed without the added benefit of history into the modern bridge between the unconscious exploitation of resources that indicates the style of modern underdeveloped existence and the desire to determine the value and utility of such resources that indicates the confines of the underdeveloped communitys dynamic ability to fulfill its drive to self determination the characteristic malaise of the century is a natural attainment in the existential experience of the afroamerican an acquired taste in the existential experience of the modern african this malaise created by the awareness of abundance and the waste of human material in a plethora of wars and crises arising as often as not out of vague and nonideological stupidities that pass for political disagreements between developed communities has touched the afroamerican as a participant slave but has only touched the african as a conscripted servant here the african advantage compliments rather than overshadows the afroamericans desire to create a history outside of the history that created and continues to mould him in short a movement away from the emotional malaise of his native communitys status quo attitudes the conscriptee status must be forcibly revoked by the african the afroamerican has been a member of the conscripting force and so has intimate knowledge of its establishment and inner motivation but he has never beenand will never bea manipulator of energies within the conscripting force the desire to escape from the membership of the conscripting force is in him similar toand even more overwhelming watts vs sharpeville mandela vs el shabazz thanthe africanasian desire to escape the conscriptee status the above is only one of the huge and looming shadows of ethnocratic justification evolving from any dynamic examination of a possible afroamerican comity with african political realities today but it is the most patently symbolic and at the same time realistic reflection of the true nature of the enthnocratic and revolutionary relationship that can be established out of the quality of brotherhood between these two member communities of the underdeveloped world it is an awareness and recognition of the international crosscurrents of attitude and social stance that binds african and afroamerican experience in a comity of loss and hope that will be the final and most creative point of establishment for the basic unity of spirit that may eventually give rise to a broadbased african community that includes without second thought africans in and from the americas the root of awareness what we should now consider is the root of such awareness and the various moot areas of its beginning for any such awareness to take positive emotional and plastic ideological form in terms of national and or economic policies the patent humanistic elements of the overall theme of brotherhood unity and freedom must be examined and not underestimated programs of development in which afroamericans may be invited to participate in africa must have as their root the principle of mutual and voluntary access to knowledge thus gained rather than the principle of mutual economic hoodwinking which underlies most present day expatriate advisory programs but the quality of sacrifice demanded in terms of misconceptions on the part of the host and guest must include the sacrifice of broad areas of preferable error in the relationships between strangers in other words the afroamerican must seek to understand the african as an estranged brother rather than as an exotic host and the african must seek to comprehend the vital changes that his brother from the americas has undergone once the afroamerican working in africa for african causes understands that these causes are his own and the african working beside the afroamerican in africa understands that only the unimportant factors of time and geographical distance have served to alter the existential experience of his guest truly dynamic styles of cooperation will come into effect it is in this area of understanding that even emotional history becomes economic understanding because in the process of understanding the changes wrought in the spirit of his enslaved brother the african is understanding the true attitude of the white comity of nations towards his own dynamic existence this without the pain at the same time in understanding the dynamic existence of the african as an immediate lifereality rather than as a strange and somewhat quaint abberation the afroamerican is unconsciously reevaluating his own source of history and his own present being in the establishment of a third world force out of this awareness several subtle differences in programmatic behavior must be developed the afroamerican fighting with the angolan or rhodesian freedom fighters is fighting to free the nations resources for the nations good and this rather than the salary received must be his root drive he must not be a privileged soldier must be willing to take must insist on taking a salary commensurate with that paid his angolan and rhodesian brothers the afroamerican who possesses particular technical skills or technological knowledge and who is invited toor volunteers towork in african technical programs must not be a mere replacement of his likely white adviser predecessor who more often than not had merely engaged himself in days of sweat and nights of liquor in the club feeling particularly justified if he was a good one that he had come out at all to help the natives at a cut in salary forgetting always that his overseas allowance invariably raised his actual financial gain way above what he could have had by remaining as an obscure artisan in his own ultra technological society the afroamerican must involve his heart in the most prosaic forms of technical advisory posts in which he serves in africa and must be willing to eschew must insist on eschewing the principle of the overseas allowance this is merely another polite term for increasing the outflow of the underdeveloped communitys wealth the afroamerican whose involvement in african affairs has influence on political trends must seek to be as critical without fear or hypocrisy as he can be the african whose workmate is the afroamerican in such a situation must not be any less critical brotherhood cannot be built or sustained on the gloss of hostguest politeness the critical relationship at this point we examine the nature of criticism as an aspect of discipline in human relationships criticism comes to full fruition not merely as an offspring of understanding but mainly as an evolution of feeling it is here that the organic youthexperience of both africans and afroamericans must come into recall minor anthropological figures of this century have had a field day pointing out the superficialities of the african connection across the atlantic and positing these superficialities as profundities this fallacious attitude has had an almost disastrous effect on africans and afroamericans alike who seek the easy way to identity but on the much more hidden level of ethnocratic growth much less has been either understood or written some contemporary political writers have pinpointed the growth of the mass awareness of africa on the part of the afroamerican community as having burgeoned with the spate of independence movements in africa that accompanied the downrush of european colonial fortunes in africa after world war ii but such writers are patently wrong the mass awareness of africa among afroamericans grew steadily and on a broad proletariat front ever since the earliest years of this century the marcus garvey syndrome although to a great extent confused with many of the minor anthropological fallacies mentioned before created at least a foundation of thought for possible politicaland therefore ethnocraticcooperation on the basis of a unity of spirit brought about by a unity of cause then in the late forties and early fifties what was added to this evergrowing proletariat conviction was the reciprocation of articulate feeling from african leaders that began to be known on foreign campuses where such leaders had either studied or were still students but active when such leaders returned to their homes and spoke of this kinship the words rang truer in the ears of the middleclass afroamerican community than they had hitherto when only the low class were associated with such sentiments in the late fifties and now in the sixties out of this new legitimacy has grown the articulate revolution of the middleclass youth whose public power is considered more dangerous to the status quo than was the power of the proletariat mass which could always be suppressed and was not the least of the agencies of danger involved in this new growth of understanding between the articulate elite of the afroamerican youth vanguard and the revolutionary community in africa is the fact that the afroamerican youth is able to marshal and consolidate emotional and even mystical ties of blood into concrete as well as abstract political formulas and thus to further legitimize the drive of the community away from the euroamerican status quo towards the revolutionary spirit in africa which in itself seeks to negate european and euroamerican exploitation of noneuropean resources thus the afroamerican has become a named danger in the very midst of the force that his will seeks to negate this precarious situation is what then forms a further basis of critical justification for the afroamericans involvement in the affairs of african nations he understands what it is to be threatened by white prosperity and is critical of any underdeveloped community which allows complacency to destroy the nervous urgency that is established in him on the other hand the afroamerican can be overwhelmed by this need for urgency and can go too far in trying to bring home the need for this urgency to the more relaxed and less pressed african community he often sees in black and white to the exclusion of strength and expedience it is on this level that his african brother is often critical of him these critical areas must not be allowed to grow into antagonistic forces but must be deployed in terms of constructive exchange the afroamerican whose involvement in africa carries him into the very midst of controversy must cultivate discretion as a political style he must not seek office and must rarely turn it down when offered either act can tear away the curtain of discretion when called upon to sacrifice his comfort or his life he should do so in silence he must not aggravate national disagreements by siding openly with those who take traditional stands of hostility within the community but he must not be afraid to take his stand on national issues with the group that seems to understand the international implications which implications are responsible for his own justification best of all even then his stand must be firm but discreet publicity must devolve on the work done by him rather than on the fact that he is doing the work for this era the afroamerican must be the sacrificial african for upon his effacement rests the reunion in spirit cause and meaning of the construction and reconstruction of an african revolutionary drive with international terms of reference what is more the african will to self determination can infect and sustain the afroamerican will to uncompromising survival only if and when the afroamerican community establishes itself as an integral part of the african community in spirit and direction these are facts of the heart more than that they are circumstance of reality contrary to the popu ar belief held by li many black people torttsfl da black inen dd not initiate the black liberation movement in the s just as the concept of blackness is not solely a product of the current mood of afroamerica the ideal of black_power is neither new nor originally conceived the struggles that have occurred whether in watts or ocean hillbrownsville should be viewed as only an extension of the black struggle for human dignity which first took shape when proud african warriors threw themselves over the sides of european slave ships rather than submit to the degradation of slavery or rebelled aboard the slave ships as was the case with joseph cinque who freed the black warriors aboard the slave ship amistad in however more important the th century saw the greatest prolonged surge of black radicalism america has ever experienced many of the demands black people are beginning to raise today historically are directly traceable to the freedom struggles waged by black people in the th century in respect to todays call for armed struggle voiced by many black militants the th century began in a prophetic manner in gabriel prosser skillfully planned one of the first organized black slave rebellions in america gabriels plans were upset only because of a gigantic rain storm which washed out many of the roads in the area and treachery within his ranks uncle toms are also not a new development as a result gabriel was caught and he along with other black freedom fighters was summarily executed although in this instance and later with the abortive rebellion planned by denmark vesey in in south carolina black revolutionary violence was thwarted the lessons learned from these experiences were not lost in nat turner in virginia organized a tightknit cadre of slaves into a disciplined fighting unit turner then proceeded to stage a protracted uprising against the neighboring white planters before turners rebellion was suppressed more than white people were killed turner vesey and prosser although the best known early practitioners of revolutionary violence were by no means alone in their stress on armed struggle as a tactical weapon in the fight for black liberation numerous other slave rebellions both recorded and unrecorded took place throughout the south at the same time the sentiment among black people toward armed struggle was not exclusively confined to the slave south in in boston david walker wrote a position paper on white america this later became popularly known in literature as walkers appeal in it walker openly embraced the principles of armed struggle for black people as walker put it it is no more harm for you to kill a man who is trying to kill you than it is for you to take a drink of water when thirsty the view expressed by walker was quite widespread among black people however much hidden as a matter of record little more than a decade later a national negro convention meeting in buffalo new york in came within one vote of adopting as the conventions resolution a speechcall to rebelliondelivered by a then little known presbyterian minister henry highland garnet garnet stirred the participants of the convention with these words let your motto be resistance resistance resistance no oppressed people have ever secured their liberty without resistance note here that garnet wasnt talking about resistance to slavery alone but to oppression all oppression in his speech garnet also praised the fighting spirit of turner vesey and cinque garnet in effect became the first black leader in america to call for a national liberation struggle nonviolence and moral suasion the tactics then advocated by most abolitionists both black and white were not in garnets vocabulary it is interesting to note that frederick douglass at this convention led the opposition to garnet douglass remarked that there was too much physical force in the address and the remarks of garnet without a doubt garnet as an historic figure deserves much closer attention largely neglected by history garnets ideas clearly conform to many of the feelings held by blacks today garnet was in every sense a visionary of his times garnet unlike many of todays socalled black revolutionaries did not merely talk about armed struggle this was exemplified several years earlier in when garnet and some friends were attacked by a white mob while attending school in new hampshire garnet then only and suffering with a fever managed to beat off the attackers with his shotgun after a pitched gun battle in addition to this garnet at the same national negro convention became one of the first black leaders in america to call for the establishment of a national black press which would be solely under the control of the people of color this as garnet saw it would be an effective means of both promoting black unity and of attacking the institutional oppression from white america garnet also was very international in his outlook fluent in german and french he traveled to england in on a lecture tour sponsored by a british labor society from there he attended the world peace conference held in frankfurt at one time he was also the american delegate to the world antislavery convention as is apparent from this garnet like douglass needs to be resurrected from history and given his proper reward as a valiant black revolutionary for if frederick douglass is the acknowledged forefather of the civil_rights movement of the early s then henry highland garnet should be equally acknowledged as the forefather of the current black_power movement in the subsequent years garnets influence on the american political scene continued to grow in john brown who was so inspired by garnet that he had his call to rebellion speech published at his own expense attacked the federal arsenal at harpers ferry this of course directly precipitated the civil war it is also known that at least five black men fought with brown at harpers ferry two of them shields green and john copeland were browns closest confidants copeland captured with brown is reported to have stated on his way to the gallows if i am dying for freedom i could not die for a better cause i had rather die than be a slave over a century later h rap brown would express a similar sentiment no slave should die a natural death alongside armed struggle black men then were beginning to think about a rediscovery of their brutally severed african cultural ties martin delany a black physician was the prime th century mover behind the movement toward black cultural nationalism delanys emphasis on black awareness was so strong that frederick douglass was once prompted to say i thank god for making me a man simply but delany always thanks him for making him a black man delany as a serious student of african history and society laid much of the groundwork for the latterday backtoafrica separatist movements quite significantly delany was the first black leader to formulate the concept of selfdetermination which is so much a part of todays black struggle in delany wrote every people should be the originators of their own designs the projector of their own schemes and creators of the events that lead to their destinythe consummation of their desires also the interest in black history and black studies a major demand of black students today began to gain momentum among black people in the mids in william c nell a black abolitionist wrote one of the first black history textbooks in it nell detailed the exploits of black men who fought in the war of independence and the war of another black leader john rock along with delany gave major expression to the beauty and power of blackness in a speech in commemorating the boston massacre rock said white men have no room to taunt us with tamely submitting if they were black men they would work wonders but as white men they can do nothing rock in his speech went on to extoll the physical features of black people the fine tough muscular system the beautiful rich color the full broad features and the gracefully frizzled hair of the negro similarly the present cry for black control of the black communities has deep roots within the black experience the legitimate desire of black people to own and control the institutions that directly affect their lives was first given formal expression during a national negro convention held in rochester new york in the convention went on record calling for a national council of the colored people attempts also were made during this convention to form committees on protective unions and business relations both measures were designed to speak directly to the need for black people to control the economies of their communities in conjunction with this the convention called for the establishment of black educational and training institutions and a black library within the black community as the convention noted when we are called upon to consider the subject of education with reference to ourselves and to ask what kind of an institution would best benefit us the answer comes in the light of the announced doctrine namely one that would develop power and that kind of power most essential to our elevation as can be seen not only are the proposals that came out of this convention farsighted and in some respects exceedingly contemporary but the fact that black people were able to convene in such a manner is strongly reminiscent of todays black_power conferences in the year period from to there were at least four national negro conventions held since there have been three black_power conferences all were national in scope and allblack in character it should be understood that this all too brief overview of th century black radicalism is in itself incomplete there were numerous other black men many lost to history who were engaged in constant struggle against the forces of american oppression there were black men such as charles langston who in a speech in seem ingly anticipated malcolm_xs famous dictum by any means necessary when he said i have long since adopted as my god the freedom of the colored people of the united states and my religion to do anything that will effect that object or black men like william wells brown leroi jones th century literary predecessor who as one of americas first black playwrightwriters adopted black themes in his works with this historical backdrop one can recognize that black radicals such as web du bois william trotter marcus garvey malcolm_x and stokely carmichael who were to come later simply made modifications on the foundations which the early black radicals laid therefore in any future discussion of the historic development of the black liberation struggle in america it is hoped that the th century will be remembered as the era that gave formal birth to black_power gegeographically harlem lies within manhattan between g y the rivers and north of the park yet it seems to be its own p reality an inner reality encased in a larger outer reality manhattan the other world left and right south and north rises the wall impassible four poets from four diverse parts of the world all hear harlems heartbeat the spanish poet federico garcia lorca with gypsy blood running in his veins came from granada and heard the rumored frenzy of harlem ah harlem in disguise ah harlem menaced by the tribe of headless dresssuits your murmur comes to me leopold sedar senghor with the night of senegal in his eyes evokes harlem harlem i have seen harlem harlem claude mckay too coming from jamaica and nostalgic for the warm tropical island sees and hears the halting footsteps of a lass in negro harlem when the night lets fall its veil i see the shapes of girls who pass and the poet langston hugnes wno came to harlem from missouri knows harlem and is harlem i feel and see and hear harlem i hear you hear you hear mewe twoyou me talk on this page the four poets identity with the near you hear mewe twoyou me talk on this page for they all sing and in their nocturnal symbiosis tell of the prostitution and the living in harlemcreate four shadows of harlem garcia lorca in his poem the king of harlem dramatizes the frenzied anguish and the chlorophyll hopes of harlem leopold sedar senghor in new york conjures up the phantasmagoria and tattoos out its rhythmical throb in his lyrical rhapsody claude mckay in his harlem shadows with deep pathos wearily laments the prostitution of harlem ah heart of me the weary weary feet in harlem wandering from street to street and langston hughes the poet of harlem wryly humorously if not sardonically bebops the deferred dreams of harlem four poets in impressionistic tones the flitting shadows of harlem life externalizing or internalizing its rumor but since this rumor reaches manhattan all of the poets speculate upon the infusions the coursing or simply the flow of blood between the divided siamese twins manhattan and harlem garcia lorca admonishes harlem that blight and deception will be a consequence of the hasty desire to merge with new york the blood is coming the blood will come by roof and shed everywhere to burn the chlorophyll of the blonde women take flight take flight past the corners hide in the highest story for the pith of the forest will penetrate every crack to leave in your flesh the light trace of the eclipse and a false sadnessthe discolored glove the chemical rose senghor on the other hand urges new york to drink vivifying blood from harlem new york i say to new york let the black blood flow into your blood cleaning the rust from your steel articulations like an oil of life givingyour bridges the curve of the hills the lianas suppleness langston hughes neither admonishes nor urges he knows that for better or for worse they are joined as the poem theme for english b illustrates you are white yet a part of me as i am a part of you thats american sometimes perhaps you dont want to be a part of me nor do i often want to be a part of you but we are thats true as i learn from you i guess you learn from me so even if emphasis is on harlem the interrelationship of manhattan and harlem is constantly thematically projected by the poets how then do the poets present the outer reality for which as garcia lorca puts it mulattos pulled rubber hoping to reach the white torso for claude mckay that outer world is stern and harsh inflicting deprivation on harlem and bringing about the degradation of its people ah stern harsh world but to garcia lorca and leopold sedar senghor the outer world does not inflict wounds on harlem in itself it is afflicted like harlems the dreams of manhattan are deferred dreams the vision which both garcia lorca and senghor conjure up of manhattan is unlovely unwholesome a picture of stagnation and rot amidst its startling scientific thrust in stark colors garcia lorca writes of the insomnia of manhattan in the wards are people staggering and sleepless like late survivors of a bloody ship wreck and senghor cries out insomniac nights o nights of manhattan tormented by fatuous fires while the klaxons cry through the empty hours the poets see the fatuousness the emptiness the hollowness in life in new york they speak too of the unwholesomeness of relationships sometimes the coins in furious angry swarms sting pierce devour abandoned children in a transferred image of shipwreck and abandonment senghor picks up the theme of dark waters both see pollution present in manhattan the images become grey and dark in antagonistic terms which emphasize the unnaturalness of phenomena in manhattan lorca depicts a hurricane of dark doves dabbling in rotten water in senghor all the birds of the air fall suddenly dead below the high ashes of the terraces the girth of science too pollutes creating from the natural a metallic unnaturalness science is without direction and so obfuscation follows light is buried among the links of noise in a shameless challenge of unrooted science consequent on unrooted science is that artificiality which senghor makes patent in the first part of his poem new york in broken antagonistically stark lines mouths become lipless girls legs almost turn to nylon no tender words hard cash buys artificial hearts and all around them the poets find the rigidity of steel girders which by extension moves into the rigidity of feelings things and emotions lack the softness of the curve and so senghor marooned in manhtattan moans the nostalgia of childrens hands and mothers breasts seeing only the hard anguish which stifles creativity thus from the painters palette sprout not things that grow but things that are ossified and dead the painters palette flowers with crystals of coral the poetic vision of new york to garcia lorca and senghor is one of pollution and sterility fraught with hopelessness and anguish dawn comes no one receives it on his mouth for here no morning nor hope is possiblethere too in manhattan in the outer reality beyond the walls of harlem dreams are deferred and lorca reiterates the american girls bore in their bellies children and money bags and the boys hung swooning outstretched on the rack of the waking yawn another part of the deferred dream comes together to form the total the montage of a dream deferred for those people from harlem who have gone to the outer world fleeing the bitter dream of harlem though they seem to have achieved success they too hughes ironically suggests live a deferred dream and the one who has moved downtown from bebop to bebach misses harlem on sunny sunday afternoons when the kids look all new and far too clean to stay that way the preceding quotations reveal all the tenderness and lova which hughes feels for harlem and because of this feeling of tenderness and love when hughes conjures up the nightmarish quality of harlems dreams deferred his tone becomes bitter and sardonic though always wryly humorous for more often than not there is no sunday best in hughes montage of a dream deferred there is not the sheer delight of being wrapped by harlems neon lights or of dancing in a warm embrace with harlem as in manhattan dawn is hopeless and awakening is darkened by the shadow of an unfulfilled past and overcast by a cloudy future the dance then becomes only a drugging hiatus all these are but hallucinations where temporary technicolor lights shine on the nightmare of a dream deferred sex too enlivens a dull existence lights up the night of hughes harlem montage with a witty banter that highlights this problem hughes jibes by question and answer jibe and jive from bebop to bebach upbeat to downbeat hughes recreates harlem in all its social dimension reveals its hopes and frustrations its laughter and tears he depicts too a careless bebop insouciance a nonchalance a careless disregard with which many cats in harlem coolly view legal institutions and jailings in that ooppopada is all the flinching laughter everpresent in montage of a dream deferred hughes presents harlem bebop boys and girls together in the gutter and claims that to rise out of it to not have the dream deferred to achieve anything at all requires a morethanhuman effort in montage of a dream deferred the pulse beat of the poem the tempo constantly increases as we move from dream boogie boogie am through ladys boogie through blues at dawn through dream boogie variation to nightmare boogie there is the tingle of a tear the trilling the treble whirling of a treble and it looks as if the musicians eyes are teasing pain but sometimes we sense in the bass notes of the boogiewoogie rumble an ominous note langston hughes does not explicitly answer the questions as does garcia lorca in the king of harlem hughes and garcia lorca the one from harlem and across the park the one from granada and across the seas two poets who felt and wrote about their solitude at columbia universityboth foresee an ensuing confusion if a dream is too long deferred garcia lorca in his long poem objectively dramatizes with elemental motifs the frenzy and confusion which he senses throbbing in harlem the poem externalizes barrenness and sterility anguish and violence ruin and chaos both people and phenomena all are disturbed frenetic the picture is unrelieved the shadows are deep and dark here there is none of the humor or sardonic laughter of langston hughes none of the fantasy of senghor or the evocative pathos of claude mckay the poem opens with a series of four graphically elemental slashes hard brush strokes which are repeated throughout the poem and present a totally stark and lovely canvas the king of harlem is raving his subjects are weeping the children pursue their little cruelties the landscape scurries away in dread throughout the poem the kings delirium the kings obvious powerlessness evoke the uncontrolled weeping and confusion of his subjects whose anguish and stifled violence reach out to the poet and the poet cries outthe imprisoned bloodthat too as it seeks an issue any issue to the outer reality may bring with it selfdestruction and emptiness may find only the blood that speaks by a thousand roads death powder dusted ashes of nard the blood from commingling with landscape from living in the daggers thorn in the heart of landscapes now takes on added fury and power and is rusting the careless tradewind in a footstepmelting the butterflies on the window panes and the wind in its turn takes on the fury of the king of harlem becomes a wooden south wind which in this picture of total confusion and destruction in which eyes of crocodiles are gouged out squirrels are beaten in frenzy in which moths and butterflies are smothered and beatles are drunk in this picture of violence the poet asserts that it is necessary to kill the goldenhaired whisky seller for the king of harlem to chant with his full choir like hughes but more explicitly garcia lorca repeats that the dream that is deferred too long may explode but the poet sees the explosion as endemic to the outer reality which has its own confusion this is the same wise silence which the dancer in claude mckays the harlem dancer keeps as she proffers her body to prostituting glances there is none of the harshness of garcia lorca in these poems of mckay neither is there the ironic laughter of hughes there are only bare shadows and painted prostitution mckays harlem dancer evokes all the nostalgia of distance and of deferred dreams in contrapuntal tones the poet reveals the two distinctive ways of seeing the dancer to the applauding youths and their prostitute compaions the dancers perfect body awakens desires and highpitched laughter they only see the externals of movement and body the poet however lyricizes the dancer whose outwardly perfect form is heightened by her silent resistance to prostitution to me she seemed a proudlyswaying palm but others who have to prostitute themselves bodily are not as resilient as mckays harlem dancer in his harlem shadows the figures of the girls are thinly clad they are not swaying palms but rather uprooted wandering and weary here the poet conjures up the mood of unending hopelessness of unending weariness on and on throughout the night the feet go trudging here there is only a certain amount of tramping in a dream deferred there are no undertones of the bass beat of the marching feet of hughes in the harlem dancer even though her dancing for her livelihood seems as unending as the trudging of the feet there is a sense of otherness and escape she is almost through a transmigration of feeling theres a certain amount of escape in a dream deferred in mckays harlem shadows the figures that flit through the dark streets are timid fragile almost on the verge of being consumptive phantoms conversely in the harlem dancer the picture of the dancer is that of a beautiful black woman upon whose swarthy neck black shiny curlsluxuriant fell in langston hughes the faces the figures who rumble through the night possess shadow facesin the shadow night momentarily however the poet transforms his usually shadowy faces into those found in the poem the harlem dancer and hughes will dance with you till daydance with you my sweet brown harlem girl in garcia lorca there is no transformation in the shadows the darkness of the shadows is unrelieved the night has no portals in your night face up no blush there is no harlem dancer rather there is frenzy in the dance the wind ruptured the veins of the dancers in senghor harlem night is transformed into a fantasy one can almost hear hughes says take it away senghor senghor picks up and we hear the notes from mckays harlem dancer the sound of blended flutes blown by black players upon a picnic day and senghor proclaims i have seen them preparing at flight of day the festival of the night i proclaim there is more truth in the night than in the day the wind is not an element of destruction the shadows have taken on strength night a positive force where the feet of the harlem dancer are charged with earth rhythm and the poet rhapsodizes harlem harlem i have seen harlem harlem a breeze green with corn springing from the pavements ploughed by the bare feet of dancers ft differing from garcia lorcas the king of harlem phenomena in senghors poem are not jarring elemental and destructive the wind does not rupture the veins of dancers it becomes a lifegiving breeze green with corn phenomena do not jangle they harmonize into ballets of lilies and fabulous masks even though in harlem senghor finds licentiousness and violence the mangoes of love roll from the low houses under the police horses hooves even though there is bacchanal where there run down the sidewalks streams of white rum and streams of black milk in the blue haze of cigars the scene is carnivalesque it does not contain the sterility and barrenness which we noted in the outer reality where the poet senghor found no well or pasture but rather encountered blue metallic eyes and frosty smiles the poet had cried out to the outer reality insomniac night o nights of manhattan these nights become purified in the poets vision of the inner reality harlem where the curative elements of manna and hyssop flow nightfall is the pure hour when god sets the life before memory germinating in the streets in those streets of harlem senghor like lorca feels the anguish of harlems blood garcia lorca had cried ah harlem harlem harlem there is no anguish like your shuddering blood within the dark eclipse senghor had echoed listen new york listen to the muted anguish of your tears falling in great clots of blood c to the anguish garcia lorca had coupled a garnet violence senghor allied to the muted anguish a brazen male voice a vibrant oboe voice this is the voice which senghor urges new york to listen to a voice which might bring a harmony which might bring about a time of signs and reckonings when the outer reality manhattan and the inner reality harlem become a chorus blending their voices and so the harsh visions of the outer reality proffered by garcia lorca and senghor the four shadowy visions of harlem evoked by our four poets may be reconciled senghor invokes new york to listen to the far beating of your nocturnal heart rhythm and blood of the drum drum and blood and drum garcia lorca admonishes the shadowy figures in his king of harlem not to remain the ivory salamanders in the cleft of the night but urges them to if mankind survives faraway generations will wonder what i america was likenot because america is now great or powerful but because it is the vast laboratory where one ispaicqsiis most pr f und experiments in the history of human life is still taking place the subject of the experiment is the negroa hypothetic average of the american black manand the object of that experiment is the identification of those characteristics and methods by which men might achieve humane survival in the face of demoniac obstacles it is a hopeful assumption that the experiment is presided over by some cosmic force kindly disposed toward our earthly race a force into which our forthcoming adventures on the moon and other planets might give us some unexpected insight america then has been a metaphor to mankind while it has been both a time and a place for the evolving spirit of the black man torn from africa stripped of ancestral culture family affections and many hopes and after two and a half centuries of slavery thrust suddenly into a complex industrial society while mankind has watched this black man from a distance coming closer largely through books motionpictures and radio and television programs conceived mostly by white men the black writer has lived the metaphor he has known america with an intensely prophetic vision inaccessible to the routine mechanics of the historian and other scholars the most subtle insights of the black man have daily preserved his sanity and optimism in a brutal environment of irrational color prejudice if it is true that the best writers of black america like the best writers of any society are among mankinds most sensitive beings it follows that their best literary creations are a universal resource of thought and feeling precious to the world what these writers have had to say before therefore is authentic commentary upon the willingness and capacity of the united states to function for its black citizens as a civilized nation black america has more than lived up to its social contract paying its way through the thankless toil of its ancestors in bondage through the largely unremembered blood of its sons in every war and through its monumental patience from the days of the slave drivers lash to the present decade of the assassin and the spy it is the determination of white america that raises doubts verification continues that the nation is grappling with a historic sickness but nations like individual men do recover if they have the will to surviveand if the abuses of the laws of being have not been so enormous as to invite an irreversible doom a word of caution must precede even a brief glance at years of negro literature especially since the phrase protest literature has obscured the whole tradition the black writer like the unappeaseable old captain ahab in melvilles moby dick paces the deck of his memories wearing an ivory leg to replace the one bitten off not by a whale but by an agent of a force capable of greater evil and like old ahab walking on life and death and unable to forget the malice and the challenge of the white whale the black writer inevitably walks on one leg of death and unforgettable anguish and on another leg of life and hope readers must not approach the writings of a black man then expecting to categorize them neatly as social protest for the black writer has achieved a marvelous equilibrium in balancing himself on both legs the mere fact that he must walk at all explains his literary attack against conditions that would keep him forever crawling the fact that he must walk like a man but at his own pace and with his own stride demands diversity in content and style conceding at the outset a limitation here that barely allows drawing aside the curtain on a literary scene of real magnitude i choose three important literary formsthe novel the short story and the poem to convey a glimpse of black writers views of america searching the records of novels written from the beginning of that tradition through one can find about published by negroes ranging from william wells browns clotel or the presidents daughter in to frank yerbys prides castle in before the harlem awakening of the s which is a focal point in the development of negro literature black novelists began their evolution in artistic sensibility and political sophistication of the two novels that appeared before the civil war clotel combines some of the facts of slavery with rumors of president jeffersons amours with negro women the second one is interesting for its early analysis of racial prejudice in the north there followed a year lapse in the production of novels by negroes an apparent example of the effect of the ascendancy of force in contemporary events on creative human energies the civil war and the reconstruction period were the oppressive factors in this instance in the last years of the century only six novels by black writers appeared and of them only two merit special attentionattention unrelated to their small artistic value frances e w harper was the first negro to write a novel about the reconstruction period her novel lola leroy shares its bit of historical value with paul laurence dunbars the uncalled worthwhile for its autobiographical references between and years which include primarily the vast migrations of black people from the south as well as world war i the most important novelists were charles w chesnutt dunbar w e b du bois and james weldon johnson as novelists they anticipated the literary themes of the harlem awakening or as men they personally influenced the leaders of that movement chesnutts the house behind the cedars began the serious treatment of the theme of negroes passing for white dunbars scenes of gay lowlife in harlem in the sport of the gods forecast famous novels of the s du boiss scholarly novel the quest of the silver fleece brought a new factual political sophistication into the narration of racial struggle for he explained how the cotton industry affected washington politics northern industrialism and southern prejudice james weldon johnsons novel the autobiography of an excolored man which directly influenced five or six novels of the harlem awakening freed the negro novel from its dependence upon southern and other american scenes for his cosmopolitan novel was set in europe as well as in the north also his treatment of negro life and music in new york was transitional other black novelists of the period whose names are less well known now have the historical distinction of being the first to write novels totally or substantially on the following themes black nationalism negro pioneers in the west negro war veterans and the great migrations to the north novels by at least eight black authors of this period developed the washingtondu bois controversy which argued the relative merits of the policy of racial submissiveness followed by booker t washington and the policy of aggressive militance exemplified by dr du bois this controversy was simultaneously carried forward in autobiography short fiction poetry and drama the novels published during the harlem awakening of the s are less important than the phenomenon of the decade itself its social glamor and artistic vigor have never been equalled the several causes of the harlem awakening therefore are significant first negroes who became soldiers abroad or migrants to the north learned that all people with white skins were not prejudiced and that freedom for black people within the american system of government was possible second the emotional dazzle and racial appeal of marcus garvey with his black dolls black newspaper black steamship line and black god stimulated authors as well as the poorer negroes garvey pulled together several strands of negro philosophy the selfreliance of booker t washington the militance of du bois and the emerging selfpride of black people third a new interest in afroamerican history was stimulated by publications that followed the creation in of the association for the study of negro life and history and similar interest in african painting and sculpture was encouraged by the revolutionary discoveries and work of picasso of the art collector paul guillaume of the art critic guillaume apollinaire and of several french painters composers and writers fourth there was the attraction of harlem itself the home of the garvey movement and of the most powerful negro organizations magazines and newspapers most of the negro writers and artists who were to achieve fame before came to harlem during the s harlem was also an attraction to whites a fact which was the fifth cause of the harlem awakening some whites who visited nighttime harlem merely wanted to forget the war and to engage their new freudian awareness by escaping into exotic black cabaret life other white visitors were serious writers and artists such as theodore dreiser and george gershwin white readers unable to go to harlem night clubs could feel their attraction by reading the primitivistic works of eugene oneill sherwood anderson waldo frank and especially carl van vechten whose controversial novel nigger heaven was very popular there were a few other causes such as personal relationships between black and white writers examples were the business and literary associations with white writers experienced by claude mckay james weldon johnson and langston hughes consequently leading national publishers who seldom handled books by black authors before the s began to recognize both their merits and their commercial possibilities the final overreaching cause of the harlem awakening was the steady decline in the popularity of the late booker t washingtons shameproducing conciliatory philosophy giving way to the assertive pride of what was called the new negro langston hughess statement of has often been quoted as the manifest of this new negro in his essay entitled the negro artist and the racial mountain hughes declared we younger negro artists who create now intend to express our individual darkskinned selves without fear or shame if the white people are pleased we are glad if they are not it doesnt matter if colored people are pleased we are glad if they are not their displeasure doesnt matter either we build our temples for tomorrow and we stand on top of the mountain free within ourselves out of this creative upsurge came a dozen or so black novelists among them at least three who deserve special mention du bois mckay and nella larsen each publishing a novel in the same year du boiss dark princess treating a group of african and asian revolutionaries explored the negroes plight in its worldwide setting mckays home to harlem with its colorful violent depiction of harlems lowlife and underworld was probably the most popular novel of the decadeits sequel of the following year entitled banjo even more dramatically used the european lowlife of the marseilles waterfront as a setting for the clash of negro and white attitudes nella larsens novel quicksand dealt with questions of morality and color prejudice by converting them into passions in the breast of a neurotic woman of mixed parentage also in there appeared a novel important for its inauguration of satire into the tradition rudolph fishers the walls of jericho in the subsequent decades of the depression at least three separate influences marked negro literature first the proletarian ideology encouraged by national introspection urged american writers to use art as a weapon in the class struggle the black writers racial pride that characterized the harlem awakening therefore was in the s some times merged with the proletarian insight that a workingclass hero fighting industrial and propertyowning tyrants deserved a place in literature second that racial pride was in the s given extra intellectual depth by essays in new journals such as the journal of negro education founded in and the negro history bulletin founded in black peoples civic and higher educational institutions also increased their emphasis upon racial history third the governments federal writers project which gave many black authors literary work to do during the depression sponsored serious regional and historical studies that provided both facts and inspiration the novels published during the depression encompassed at least seven types and some of these novels were the first of their kind the first type was the war novel represented by victor dalys not only war the earliest negro novel about world war i the second type was the novel of folkways which was practiced by zora neale hurston george wylie henderson and george w lee hendersons ollie miss was about sharecropping and lees river george was about a legendary racial hero a mississippi college student named george who planned to free his race from oppression the third type of novel was the historical novel best represented by arna bontemps black thunder on gabriel prossers slave rebellion of the fourth type might be loosely called the proletarian novel forcefully represented by the short novels of richard wright collected in the edition of uncle toms children the fifth type was the college novel originated by owendell shaws greater need below which explored life in a southern negro college the sixth type was the family history initiated when waters edward turpin published two novels these low grounds in and o canaan in the former traced four generations of family life and the latter covered one generation of the chicago experiences of a family from mississippi the seventh and final type dealt with migrant workers william attaways let me breathe thunder influenced by steinbeck was concerned with white boys trapped by the fate of migrant field hands perhaps only four or five of the odd novels of this decade would repay close analytical study such as bon temps black thunder hendersons ollie miss and the work of zora neale hurston but the tradition of the negro novel was gaining solid substance in the publication of one great novel wrights native son had the impact of a national event unforgettable in its variety of indications literal allusive metaphorical and symbolicalof ways in which the sensitive black protagonist is doomed before birth in his struggle toward human selfidentity native son stands alone in literary history world war ii itself had a less profound influence on the negro novel although the war did force advances in civil_rights those advances culminated in supreme court decisions favoring social justice in interstate travel housing voting and education presidential executive orders ended segregation in the armed forces and made the gesture of ending employment discrimination by firms having government contracts but while negro soldiers abroad were absorbing a new cosmopolitanism that would widen the themes of novels they were deeply aware of the nazilike attitudes at home which caused riots in both harlem and detroit in in the s then the followers of wrights literary example were urged on by at least three forces by the emotional magnetism of native son itself by racism in the national environment and by the naturalistic tradition already famous in the novels of dreiser dos passos and farrell wrights followers however did not share his genius their work is best represented by chester himes if he hollers let him go and by willard motleys knock on any door himes battered his raceccnscious protagonist thoroughly before letting him ecape into military service motley borrowing wrights main plot rather than his intentions gave a naturalistic picture of the defeat of his young italian hero the most ably written novels of the decade did not depend upon native son william attaway in writing blood on the forge improved upon turpins earlier account of migrants by adding symbolism and deeper realism attaway treated the deterioration of three kentucky brothers working in northern steel mills two other superior novels were written by women ann petry and dorothy west the formers country place employing symbols and metaphors reminiscent of the work of nathaniel hawthorne explored the declining yankee traditions of a connecticut town dorothy wests the living is easy satirically condemned the harmful behavior of middleclass negro bostonians struggling to escape their racial heritage because of unrestricted length and relative freedom of style in the novel one can assume that its fullness of negro expression has been limited only by the imagination and skill of the novelists as a group one must of course always keep in mind the inhibiting effects of unimaginative publishers perhaps then a notion of black writers views of america before can be gained by the addition of less detailed references to short stories and poetry the first short story published by a negro was frances e w harpers the two offers it praised a white woman who was an antislavery crusader between that year and the two most important short story writers were chesnutt and dunbar both men but especially chesnutt had to consider white magazine readers accustomed to degrading or simpleminded stereotypes popularized by such white writers as thomas nelson page and joel chandler harris chesnutt whose publisher did not reveal his racial identity for about a dozen years explored the following themes color prejudice folk negro psychology and southern hatreds that cause both subtle and brutal injuries dunbar more so than chesnutt created simple negro characters who spoke plantation dialect but he also deviated into such themes as negro leadership and negroes problems in industry and education between and george marion mcclellan and joseph s cotter took advantage of the groundwork laid by chestnutt and dunbar mcclellans volume of stories was noteworthy for its study of the disadvantages suffered by negro women cotters work began the emphasis upon sordid realism in negro experience during the harlem awakening three short story writers predominated jean toomer rudolph fisher and eric walrond toomer wrote uniquely poetic stories about idealistic young people fisher writing while practicing medicine turned out prizewinning stories published in atlantic monthly and other distinguished magazines walrond reared on the island of barbados wrote a volume containing vivid morbid pictures of human deterioration in the tropics the tropics also provided the setting for half of the twelve stories in mckays volume of the early s although these storiesas well as the remaining ones which were about harlemnarrowed their main interest to sexual intrigue and color prejudice it was langston hughes and richard wright however who led the short story writers of the s hughes explored new depths of common negro urban life with humor and satire as well as with bitterness wrights work powerfully dramatized the ways in which southern black people both young old were brutalized the best known other short story writers of the depression were the following john f matheus rudolph fisher zora neale hurston arna bontemps and ralph ellison the s brought more writers of short fiction to public attention the best being ann petry chester himes frank yerby and john henrik clarke ann petrys work appeared in the anthology best american short stories of himes by had published ten stories in esquire alone and clarke wrote stories while starting a career as editor book reviewer and essayist the destiny of yerby whose early stories show that he might have become a follower of wright was changed by the popularity of his novels although these writers placed their stories in firstclass traditional periodicals they found special encoragement in new negro magazines for example negro story in its spring issue alone published two stories by ellison two by himes three by hughes and several others by minor authors black poets who deserve a booklength history of their own were first represented by three slave poets lucy terry who in wrote verse about an indian raid by jupiter hammon whose work appeared in and by phillis wheatley who after her original publication in imitated alexander pope and received much acclaim in england the next poet of historical consequence was george moses horton the title of whose volume the hope of liberty indicated his purpose in writing it the book did not bring horton enough money to purchase his freedom but it did secure his reputation as the first slave to use poetry to protest his bondage he was also an early stylist in the humor and satire that were increasing in american literature fifteen years after the hope of liberty frances e w harper the bestknown negro poet of the s preserved in her poem the slave auction a generalized picture of the grief of black families callously divided and separately sold on the auction block negro poets in the second half of the nineteenth century generally fit either a precivil war or a postwar category the prewar poets were usually conventional versifiers demonstrating that they were cultured americans deserving firstclass citizenship their names are minor in negro literature the postwar poets however thrown into the literary war started by irwin russell harris and page had to choose between striking down or humanizing the stereotypes popularized by those white founders of what has been called the plantation tradition the postwar poets as diversified then as black poets are today were divided in their choices albery a whitman chose to strike the stereotype down sounding sometimes like spenser byron or tennyson and sometimes like whittier or bryant whitman used both negro and indian themes to picture black men as heroes the rise to fame of paul laurence dunbar just before has been called the most important event in the history of negro literature but when americas leading critic william dean howells praised dunbar without racial condescension the poets public image as a writer of negro dialect was also confirmed howells praise ironically trapped dunbar in the shadow of the plantation tradition he is not usually associated with poetry written in standard english which is the kind he most often wrote the lyrical poems that he preferred are not forgotten but he is famous for his dialect poems and for such sternly racial poems as we wear the mask dunbars contemporaries who worked with less originality in the dialect tradition are little known today between and black poets remained divided into two main groups that approximated the earlier categories first those who imitated past english and american masters and second those who claimed the heroism and rights of negroes or sympathetically pictured their folk ways the first group achieved a literary detachment from the racial repression and violence of their own times representative of their work were the lyrics of william stanley braithwaite the charming verses of benjamin brawley and the nature poetry of george marion mcclellan the second group which includes du bois fenton johnson and lesser known figures breathed into their poetry the anger they felt in the midst of racial abominations du boiss vehement poem a litany at atlanta an outstanding example was written on the train he was riding to investigate the atlanta riot of the black poet and college teacher margaret walker commenting on the wealthy white patrons who financed some of the poetry writing of the harlem awakening observed that they did so as a fad to amuse themselves and their guests at some of the fabulous parties of the twenties the poetry itself however was usually serious and volumes of permanent value were written by james weldon johnson claude mckay countee cullen and langston hughes johnsons best poetry especially o black and unknown bards and his book of freeverse poetic sermons gods trombonesretained the eloquence and rhythm of important predecessors without depending upon dialect mckay an intense poet who seemed to one of his firends to have a furnacelike fire within him wrote excellent sonnets and lyrics that were angry but artistic expressions of negroes many discontents his book harlem shadows represents his best work his most famous poem is the sonnet if we must die which is so eloquent in its insistence upon negro resistance to tyranny that winston churchill appearing before a joint session of the american congress quoted the poem without naming its author to inspire americans to enter world war ii countee cullen who said that he wanted to be a lyric poet like john keats but who responded more and more to racial injustice as he grew older had the gift of making the ordinary seem beautiful a classicist at heart cullen wrote remarkable sonnets his first volume entitled color was his best his own favorites among his poems appeared posthumously under the title on these stand langston hughes whose most famous poem the negro speaks of rivers was published when he was composed two outstanding volumes during the harlem awakening the weary blues and fine clothes to the jew also in the s hughes who was to remain the most important innovator and experimenter in all of negro literature initiated the practice of reading poetry accompanied by music in addition he introduced the pattern of the blues into poetry hughes was the first poet to picture black people regularly as merely people and to find permanent human and literary worth in such lowly negroes as porters bootblacks and field hands two other poets who were important in the harlem awakening but who did not then publish volumes were jean toomer and arna bontemps the black poetry of the s shows two tendencies regionalism and a sometimes classoriented social criticism thus exhibiting both the concentration and the expansion of racial thought characterisic of the decade the best volume sterling browns southern road reflects the regional and slaverytime studies fostered by the federal writers project as well as lingering garveyism and the historical awareness promoted by new negro journals and organizations a new poet frank marshall davis published black mans verse and am the american negro volumes filled with harsh criticism on the other hand black labor chant a book by another new poet david wadsworth cannon jr who died while a doctoral student at columbia university reveals negroes expanded vision of themselves as part of the workingclass which should unite before names now well known were being heard melvin b tolson robert hayden owen dodson and margaret walker among their socially realistic early poems were at least two that would become prize winners margaret walkers for my people and tolsons dark symphony in the s three poetic modes were dominant the lyrical the experimental and the racial the lyrical tradition always carried forward by the very nature of poetry was maintained principally through volumes by hayden tolson and braithwaite the experimental tradition on the other hand represented a delayed response on the part of black poets to the stylistic freedoms that other american poets had taken between and that is the free verse imagism and other techniques used by walt whitman and emily dickinson by french symbolists and by spanish modernists hayden belonged in this tradition as did dodson and a few others the racial thrust almost as natural to black poets as lyricism was continued by davis and hughes and was joined by a newcomer gwendolyn brooks her second volume the pulitzer prizewinning annie allen showed a flair for symbolism and experimental syntax hughes halfway through his long career was especially effective with his satirical poems in shakespeare in harlem and with his humorous but biting madam to you series in oneway ticketa his experimental inclination continued in his topographical poetry in oneway ticket as well as in his blues and jazz verses between the eighteenth century and then black writers of fiction and poetry have suggested such a complex varied picture of america that no single impression emerges nevertheless a brief synthesis of their common evolution might simplify that picture before the civil war they mounted their attack on slavery and northern prejudice after the war through reconstruction and until some black writers replaced the stereotypes of the plantation tradition with heroic figures or with humanized folk negroes while other writers either turned to the psychologcial and economic effects of racism or imitated english and american masters between and certain subjects received original or increased attention especially those reflecting new political and societal insights during the harlem awakening black writers became less selfconscious more cosmopolitan more satirical and they composed some of their finest poetry during the depression several new types of novels appeared common negroes were used more respectfully in literature and social criticism indicated the writers widening knowledge of racial history between and while native son was firing the imagination of many black authors a few writers of fiction turned successfully to the use of white protagonists and new england settings and a few poets taking late advantage of liberating techniques merged racial experience and experimental style with brilliant results black writers views of america are the aggregate unmanageable total of their literary works showing that intellectual unity would be unnatural showing too that the phrase the negro is an illusion the country has violated nature itself by refusing to recognize actively the individual differences among its black citizens in the face of white americas continual blindness negligence and hostilitymitigated far too seldom by the decencies of individual white peopleit is the artistic personality especially that is flooded with revulsion negro literature is the record not only of that revulsion but of the irreducible will of black america to preserve a sane and sensitive existence through every means known to civilized man cjr a senior in business management at tuskegee institute is concerned with the essence of the lives of ordinary black people

characters who live inside of this childs gonna live lawrence delacorte and her readers and successfully more than a lifeflownearly a transference of presence all of which makes reading the beautiful experience it can be mariah upshur is a black woman concerned with survival for her children and the movement of the story of mariah her husband jacob their children living dead andabouttobeborn centers on her anxious impassioned desire to take them out of the wasted land of death in which they live mariah and her family live vividly as the reader feels into their minds sister wright avoids none of the conflicts of black marriage black family life and her insights are relevant for now even though the setting is the depression years strong parental figures are worked throughout the story there is incest and the weaknesses which give rise to it themes of superstition undercurrent motivations for mariah and they do not really conflict with the strong reality of her christian religion but are interwoven and absorbed and traditionally so with her rational beliefs when i began the reading of this book i was tempted to feel that this is a womans book but it is not it is a book for black people and it is that because of the fullness with which sarah e wright has given us the panorama of a black family over several generations who have owned their own land and have been gradually losing it to a local white family as the story is created mariah discovers the reason for the loss and also discovers the blood relationship between the two families there are themes which all black people are familiar with the personal conflict between black and white the struggle for economic independence the parental will for security for one s children the guilt from infidelity with concommitant selfpunishment and conscience flagellation but these themes are not tired in this childs gonna live they are rather alive and challenging and involving as the pages are turned it is a creation well worth reading it has power and it lives and flows on october in the small town of brundidge alabama i was christened alexander by my parents james lucus and annie marshal bell this information was related to me by my grandmother who reared me from a baby both my parents died before my third birthday other than the fact that they both died young my mother from a chronic illness and my father from an injury suffered while serving in the second world war there is little that i know about my parents for some reason my grandmother never talked much about them and for the same reason perhaps i never asked many questions before my ninth birthday we moved to troy alabama another small town twelve miles north of brundidge there i grew up and lived a very normal childhood by my seventeenth birthday i was already a rapist a high school dropout a threetimes jailbird and well on my way to the reformatory school i hated and feared the world and felt that the world hated me how i came to that state of being is a long and complex story however i have always felt that the early death of my parents had much to do with the problems that i encountered during my adolescence at the date of my birth my grandmother was over fifty years of age had reared a large family mostly as a widow and was tired the task of adequately caring for a male child without the assistance of a man would present a difficult jobeven for a young woman for my grandmother the task was impossible in the streets my running pals were neighborsguys whom i had known most of my life and felt that i could trust two of them were my cousins sonny and love who were brothers the third one we called peanutthe joke around the neighborhood being that peanut had small dried up balls which resembled a pea of the three of us love was the oldest the strongest and the wisest peanut sonny and i always looked up to him as our hero and protector and during all those years that we were together i dont think love ever disappointed any of us whenever we would get into trouble after acting toughwhich we did often enoughlove would come to our rescue and our foe would always reconsider love as they say had a reputation peanut the youngest of the group was an amusing character of highly imaginative spirit who constantly sought adventure i find it very difficult to describe sonny except to say that he was cunning and he was loves brother it was peanuts love for adventure which led to my first encounter with the police it was saturday morning and a doublefeature was playing at the pike theater neither of us had any money and we both wanted to see the flicks as usual peanuts imagination came to the rescue the solution to our problem was simple we would steal iron from one junkyard sell it to another junkyard and with our earnings we could attend the movie it sounded easy enough to me ill never forget the shocked and disappointed look on my grandmothers face when she saw me standing in the doorway trembling tears pouring out of my eyes and knots swelling on my forehead where i had been beaten with a billy club with the burly white cop holding me by the collar of my shirt and blurting out indignantly auntie we caught this here rascal stealing iron if you wanna get this little thieving bastard back you better follow me down to the station in the following years i had many encounters with the police but i never hated any cop more than i hated that big dumbfaced bully that dragged me in guilt before my grandmother for many years to follow it would be difficult for me to live with her both of us would be tortured by a sense of failureour failure to understand each other the ironstealing episode was my first encounter with the cops but it wouldnt be my last during the following month i became totally disgusted with what might be referred to as the systemthe school the teachers the students the whole bitand began to hang out with love and sonnypeanuts iron stealing experience having slowed him down considerably at the house of a group of young ladies who were notorious for their charm the casey house became a place of recreation and a refuge there we drank booze gambled made love and ate and slept in a relaxed atmosphere by this time i had intellectuallyif not emotionallyrejected the moral standards of my grandmother and society in general the caseys home served as a source of inspiration to my rebellious attitude the happiness that i witnessed there confirmed my belief that many of the moral standards of society are not only useless but that in many cases they are a hindrance to the common good as for the casey girls i believe they are some of the finest people i have ever met but as with most black people in troy as with sonny love and me they were caught in a world of despair and as with most black people in troy they sought a means of escape but what made the caseys different from other blacks is that instead of seeking refuge in the church they sought relief as they saw fit one of the things i admired most about those girls was that during our many years of association i never knew or heard rumor of them having relationships with white men a phenomenon which occurred frequently in troy even among the high class negroes the caseys were black women nearing my fifteenth birthday i had completely quit school the immediate money in the streets as well as women and booze coupled with my dislike for authority were all factors which influenced my decision to become a dropout but perhaps the strongest persuasion was my knowledge of what happened to other guys who had their high school diplomas most of them seemed to be in worse condition than i the best that a black high school graduate in troy could hope for was a a week job as a delivery boy for a drugstore was aware of the fact that it was possible to make more money than that in one night on a billiard table or in a dice game i was convinced that the time one put into getting a diploma wasnt worth it however a series of events were to occur to change my opinion on october five days before my sixteenth birthday love sonny and i were confronted by an angry cigarchewing tonguebiting bill casey the indictment was seriousrape the night before sonny and i had gotten drunk from homemade whiskey while at the casey house bills woman came looking for him appearing highly drunk and highly sexy sonny suggested that if she couldnt find bill we would be glad to act as substitutes bessie mae said something to the effect that only bill could satisfy her we proceeded to prove her wrong at first everything seemed to be going fine sonny held her legs while i screwed i held her legs while he screwed and bessie mae seemed to be getting a kick out of it herself boastfully joking as we wrestled with her on the bed that she was too much woman for both of us then suddenly before we knew what was happening the house was full of buckeyed males pulling out their rods and hopping on bessie mae realizing that the situation was out of hand the two of us wished her good luck and made a fast exit stage right when bill learned that a train had been pulled on his woman he pretended to be fiercenot that he ever claimed to love her or anything like that his ego had been hurt as usual love came to our rescue and as usual he was persuasive billwho had a lot of respect for loveagreed not to press chargesprovided that we pay him a small fee and agree to stay away from the casey house we agreedtemporarily anyway approximately two weeks from the date of our meeting with bill i found myself picking beans on a small farm a few miles north of orlando florida my grandmother had somehow learned about the episode with bessie mae and i found it a little too uncomfortable at home the sense of disappointment and failure that existed between us had deepened to the point that she seemed to have developed an accusing indifference which was expressed in an ivegivenuponyou attitude the silence was too tormenting it buried me in guilt i had to escape i borrowed a few dollars from love a few from sonny and went south why i went south i dont know there has always been something downward about me my money gave out before i reached orlando so i said goodbye to the greyhound and started hitchhiking after walking for what must have been a couple of hours i came to a truckstop with a sign in front of it which read bean pickers wanted a basket i had never picked beans be fore but i was well familiar with the cotton fields of alabama besides i was broke and getting hungry for the first time in my life hard work was unavoidable i worked three weeks on the bean farm during which time i slept in the cab of a van i was the only black in sight my coworkers were white rednecks from the appalachian area of alabama who seemed to delight in having a strange black creature in their presence they assured me that no blacks were allowed where they came from they were very nice to me while working on the bean farm i did more thinking than i had ever done before it was obvious that i wouldnt last long picking beans it was late in august and all the beans would be harvested within a couple of weeksthree at the most after carefully pondering my fate i came to the conclusion that the best thing to do was to return home and reenter school i began to understand that the poor and uneducated would always be at the bottom level of a capitalistic society just like the poor rednecks in the field with me and the poor blacks back home i hated the system but i would try to use it besides i was lonesome i missed love and sonny and the caseys all the people and things at home i missed my grandmother fate was on my side the next day i caught a ride on a van all the way to bainbridge georgia that night i was picked up by the bainbridge police and spent hours in the bainbridge city jail i was thankful compared to the slanted seats of a van the cell bunk felt good from bainbridge i caught a chicken truck to dothan and from dothan i rode with a minister to troy i returned home and reentered school but instead of getting better things got worse i found it difficult to adjust to the authoritative atmosphere of the school the freedom and dangers of the street had made me somewhat of an independent and aggressive person i resented being told what to do how to do it and when and where to do it my instructors sensed my rebellious attitude and hated me i hated them even more i was sure that my experience in the streets had given me a certain awareness of life that many of them would never obtain as i reflect on those days i sometimes think my instructors knew this to be true maybe thats why their dislike for me was so great they found my constant questions on morals religion and race frustrating there were no answers in the instructors manual my problems at home werent getting any better either the tension between my grandmother and me reached its climax i ended up in jail on a disorderly conduct charge at this stage in my life i was years old for some reasoni find it less painful not to ponder the matter my grandmother withdrew charges from that point on my situation seemed to change for the better while in jail i made one important decision if i was to survive in this world would have to discipline myself i realized that it was much easier to make a decision than to execute it but i had to try things began to go my way the following year i joined a school organization known as the new farmers of america nfa an agricultural organization for black male students of the south the school director of the nfa mr julius kennedy is one of the few high school instructors i ever respected kennedy was a big man lie encouraged me to stay in school and as a result of his inspiration i participated in many nfa activities winning state and national honors my success with the nfa greatly increased my prestige on the campus the ds and es which i had been receiving in certain classes turned into as and bs even my problems at home tended to decrease i could sense a feeling of pride for me in my grandmother during my senior year in high school i felt myself slowly pulling away from the old crowdlove sonny peanut and the caseys we still hung out together at times but my class work i had a lot of catching up to do the nfa and a parttime job kept me busy ive never learned to like the system or institutionalized ways of doing things but by my senior year i was determined to attend college had nipped on the wine of success and i wanted a larger drink however the decision to attend college meant i had to work twice as hard as before i didnt have any money and my grades werent that good yet i had two aces in the game the first was my nfa record the second was mr julius kennedy they both came through on september entered through the college gates of the pride of the swift growing south to have the veil of ignorance lifted from my head i had a lot to learn it suffices to say that my general impression of the pride was sickening that impression has never changed approximately four months after i entered college a fellow student jimmy strong was shot in the back by a white service station operator because he sought to use the white restroom the college family marched in the rain while the murderer went free i repeatthe atmosphere was sickening a few weeks after jimmys death i received a telegram from home love was dead he had been knifed to death in a dice game the ironic connection between the death of jimmy and the death of love hit me like a stone jimmy was a college student love barely had an elementary education jimmy was of a middleclass family many times love had worked in the cotton fields while hungry jimmy had a working knowledge of political and racial concepts love understood the primitive law of the jungle the law of survival yet they shared one thing in common which outweighed all their differences they were both victims of a white racist society i marched for jimmy i wept for lovenot the strong proud and commanding love the love who was always seen by those who never really looked but the love who was seen by those who knew his mercifulness carol held her report card firmly in one brown hand and clung to the tall wire fence with the other peering through the spaces at the men working in the sun most of them were shirtless and sweat glistened on their backs and stained their pants as they carried their boards from one place to another making them into giant standing xs a drop of water trickled down one side of her face and dropped inside the collar of her apple green dress she clutched the report card her first a little tighter she hadnt waited at the flagpole today for sylvie now that she had completed kindergarten she felt that she was too old to be escorted to and from school so she had walked on alone feeling maturity on her like a coat of shiny paint that announced her new standing to everyone she passed she had intended to rush home before sylvie who lived next door could report her missing but she hadnt been able to resist stopping to watch the banging the lifting the excitement of a building growing she hoped that it would grow into a toy shop like the one downtown with the little player piano in the window or an ice cream store with hundreds of flavors to choose from two of the workmen standing a little apart from the others had stopped working and were talking carol watched thembig men with big frowning facesstraining to hear what was being said but their mouths moved silently like television when the sound was off their heads jerked as they stepped closer together and she could hear their voices now low and rumbling like a storm coming up then rising into a booming clap of thunder what you call me the man spoke the words slowly through his teeth his wet black chest shining like the seals carol had seen at the zoo you heard me i said nigger the other mans face was splotched with red and pale pink as if it had been pinched in certain selected spots and the thin mouth curled and twisted around the last word nobody nobody calls me a nigger curling and twisting his thicker lips pushed out the same word yous a lousy nogood nigger a few curious passersby stopped at the fence and the other workmen began to move toward the argument but too slowly to stop the black man as he picked up a board and smashed it against the pinched face man again and again until he fell to the ground with blood popping out all over and even afterward it seemed to carol that the first blow had thrown a switch to change the action from slow to accelerated motion so that now the workmen ran stiffly back and forth like windup dolls bending over the man on the ground and yelling at the other man who waved the bloody board in an angular circle in front of him and shouted stay away from me over and over in a hoarse voice by now a crowd had gathered at the fencelatecomers eager to hear the details and early arrivals eager to share their various versions there was a lot of gasping and several oh my gods and one tall man gently pushed carol away and carefully blocked her view she went as far as the other end of the fence and squeezed between a woman in a pleated skirt and a teenaged boy neither of whom paid any attention to her when the sirens approached the police cars screaming the ambulance hummingthe workmen backed off from the man still swinging the board his whole face was twisted now as only his mouth had been before and the policemens guns went off as the arm was swinging upward stopping it high in the air and reminding carol of the game of statues she had played at recess with patty and janet the police ordered the crowd away and most of them left though reluctantly carol headed down fourth street toward home again taking care not to invoke bad luck by stepping on the lines in the concrete her dress stuck to her back and her stomach felt funny she whispered nigguh nigguh to see if it made her lips curl she wondered what it meant carol baby it was her mother swooping down on her like a plump angel in a frilly apron she threw her arms around carol and squeezed her i heard the sirens and i thought and then angrily why did you leave sylvie im all right mama im big now carol said she was concerned that some of her friends might have seen her mother outdoors hugging her as if she were a baby her mother took her hand and carol had to trot to keep up with her when they reached the house her mother frostily sent her upstairs to change her clothes in her room she kissed jenny the redcheeked doll lying in the middle of the bed then changed into her yellow shorts and white blouse removing the green ribbon that held her short pony tail it didnt match she wishedagainthat her hair would grow long so it would swish from side to side and hit against her face as did the girls in the television commercials and so she could tie her own ribbons in the top drawer of the dresser she found a yellow one and holding it in one hand and jenny in the other went down to the kitchen her mother was in a better mood she kissed carol after she tied the ribbon and carol kissed her back enjoying the warmth of her mothers soft arms now that she was in the house and regretted having upset her mother mama whats a nigguh carol asked her stomach still felt a little fizzy so she only nibbled at the coconut cookies her mother had placed on the table for her she saw her mother pull the inscrutable secret face over her usually expressive one and realized that an answer would not be forthcoming she decided immediately that she wouldnt ask her father when he came in from work because although she had not yet figured out the correlation she knew that the questions and incidents that caused her mother to wear the secret face always angered her father its just a word baby her mother said finally nothing for you to be worrying your little head about finish your cookies so you can watch television carol took jenny with her into the living room to watch cartoons but found it hard to concentrateshe kept seeing the mens faces and the blood and hearing the shouts and sirensthat word it was the power of the word that frightened and fascinated her whether it was a malediction hurled with a pointing finger by a pinkfaced sorcerer or whether it was an attack by a black giant upon anyone who dared to use the forbidden word made no difference either way it was the word itself that held the power to transform a man carrying planks back and forth into the thing with the twisted face carol remembered the day not too long ago when her father had become so angry that hed smashed the glasstopped coffee table with the big orange ashtray he had been pacing the floor shouting about an electrician screwing in light bulbs and her mother had tried to comfort him dont worry so much about it honey shed said we cant change things thats the way they are carols father had picked up the ashtray and turned toward her mother then back to the coffee table and hit it generating cracks that travelled across the sheet of glass in intricate patterns since that day her father had been very quiet almost as if he were not really there when he talked to carol or laughed at one of her jokes she had the feeling that he was looking over her or beyond her at something far away but her fathers anger she knew had been about his job and some other things that she didnt understand not just one word she wanted her brother robbie to get home from junior high school he almost never failed to answer her questions when he had the time a commercial had replaced cartoons on the television set and it was the one with her friends in it the one about toothpaste she loved the glow in the little girls faces the silky beauty of the swishing hair and the swinging skirts she loved them all with the hope that one day she would be surrounded by them or people like themshiny joyous people and she would live happily ever after robbie slammed the front door and the small number of times his feet touched the stairs on the way up told carol that he was in a hurry she took jenny and scampered up the steps behind him hi shorty robbie said without stopping to look at her he was pulling baseball gloves shoes socks and bat from under the bed where you going carol asked where does it look like i want to ask you something not now he said pulling on his sweat socks im late i saw a great big fight and the police and everything she said rushing the words robbie looked up from tying his shoe what happened he hit him with a board because he called him a nigguh oh robbie jerked the shoe string what does it mean robbie he straightened up slowly carol saw his nose wrinkle and his eyes were blinking the way they did whenever she had asked a truly difficult question its its a bad name that white people call negroes what are negroes the word sounded familiar but she couldnt remember where shed heard it before people with brown skin like us you and me and mama and daddy and our friends well what are white people she asked puzzled as to who was left people with white skin they dont like negroes you always see em on television and downtown and like jenny well yeah only jennys just a doll after robbie had left to play ball carol went to her room and pulled out her toy chest she opened it and placed jenny face down in the bottom letting the pile of blocks and plastic chairs and books slide down on top of her she wondered if blood had popped out all over jenny she went to the mirror and examined her reflection dark brown face edged with tiny stubborn balls of hair short stubbly pony tail barely extending past the yellow ribbon she pulled off the ribbon dropping it on the dresser picked up her comb and took it downstairs to her mother mama will you plait my hair her mother took the comb smiling indulgently as she sat down on the sofa baby i thought you liked your pony tail carol sat on the stool at her mothers knee not any more she said perhaps the complexity of most west inl dian societies is very obvious because of the icqpttunisti heterogeneous nature of their composition aldous huxley in the introduction to alfred mendes first novel on trinidad entitled pitch lake observed that the islands mixed population was a gift to any novelist it was its variety of races religions and economic classes that prompted him to make such a remark west indian novelists have certainly not failed to exploit this gift of variety in the caribbean in order to fulfill their purpose as writers take almost any novel of recent years and you will find that whether the scene is set in one of the islands or on the mainland territory of guyana it is the unusual variety of social forces that gives paradoxically both a peculiar and a universal significance to the human drama depicted edgar mittelholzer was almost obsessed with the fact of ethnic confusion in the life and death of sylvia and a morning at the office even in the novels of wilson harris who can hardly be regarded as a social novelist one finds that the six peoples of guyana form the groundwork of his theme as treated in his metaphoric saga from the palace of the peacock to tumatumari although guyana and trinidad are the clearest examples of multiracial populations most if not all west indian societies are composed of the same four basic elements race religion education and money these determine the nature of what grantley russell a character in the life and death of sylvia describes as the complicated social setup in georgetown positively astounding how life goes on at all there are the whites in an exclusive little corner of their own then the highc coloured coloured in various compartments according to good better and best families with money and quality of hair and shade of complexion playing no small part in the general scheme of grading take two steps aside and youre up against the east indians in another cluster with a hierarchy of their own ranging from ricemiller to barristeratlaw and doctor and then down to busdriver chauffeur provisionshopkeeper and sugarestate coolie stumble around and youre face to face with the chinese either shopkeeper or business man stagger off a pace or two and youre sniffing at the portuguese split up into rumshoppawnshop class and professional man class and bigbusiness class my god if it isnt bewildering russell the expatriate englishman married to an illiterate guyanese in his stumbling staggering be wildering vision can hardly be said to hold things in a steady focus his impression is therefore naturally one of senseless confusion but even in a sober clinical analysis of racial types presented in andrew salkeys the late emancipation of jerry stover the impression remains of strains and tensions in the wouldbeemancipated jamaican elite from the bondage of race and colour in chapter four he provides the pedigrees of the chief characters who are a cross section of negro inidan chinese english jew syrian and carib the nature and action of religion vary with the particular history of colonization and immigration in the individual territories where the population is predominantly christian differences between protestants and catholics may come to the surface in times of crisis there is a legion of protestant sects and syncretistic cults in a number of west indian societies the extreme emotionalism of some of these religious bodies derives from african sources for example that of the shouters in trinidad is a legacy from the shango worship of the yoruba of west africa the religious fervor of some of these unorthodox sects and cults is sometimes exploited by demagogues for political ends as may be seen in v s naipauls the suffrage of elvira in guyana and trinidad the majority of east indians are hindu or muslim by religious persuasion naipaul deals mainly with the hindu community in the mystic masseur and a house for mr biswas in the former he studies the astuteness of ganesh the mystic masseur and selfcreated pandit in manipulating the rivalry of hindu groups to get himself finally elected to the legislative council of the island in a house for mr biswas naipauls satirical references to indians converted to christianity for material advantage are unmistakble but he seems to disregard the advantage of christianity as a liberating force from race and a step towards the intermarrying of indians and others in naipaul the hindu religion functions mainly as regards namegiving initiation marriage and death it will be observed that ganesh uses the bhagawat devotional readings and its feasting as a means of gaining favour with the hindu electorate the symbols of indian dress are similarly used by ramsumair ganesh for rising to the position of an executive member of the legislative council when he can safely doff the trappings of hinduism and bask in his european suit as g ramsay muir mbe as naipaul points out towards the end of the novel such a career as that of the mystic masseur would not have been possible without the advantages of the grammar school education for which his father could afford to pay education is the chief aid to social mobility as both xavier and jagabir in mittelholzers a morning at the office realize xavier is black but he knows that a black man can be mayor of port of spain tiger in samuel selvons a brighter sun too knows that the light of learning will show the way to progress and selfawareness many a west indian novel is in one way or another a commentary on the kind of education that makes a west indian into a g ramsay muir mbe or a mr indarsingh bachelor of arts of oxford university london england or perhaps something better than either of these now that there is a university of the west indies the universal bilingualism of the educated west indian fluent in the idiom of the people whether called creolese or by any other name and having also at will a conscious control of standard english is more often than not a sign of the dichotomy of culture that is due to exporting british education to the caribbean complete with bat and ball h o patterson shows this to be true in the case of alexander blackman the chief character in an absence of ruins nourished on just william cricket and celtic melodies blackman comments with nostalgia memory becomes the vehicle merely for the empty shells of melodies for the recollection of a friend who never existed for the odd blindly obeyed commands of a game i used to play for a child who used to walk from street to street and dream of other places of friends he did not know of heroes he did not understand of the adult he would one day become the adult whom he is now who dreams vainly of the boy he once was who used to dream so much the tension between the peoples idiom and the language of education is apt to cause a disintegration of individual personality and to widen the rift between the working class or peasantry and the middle class a combination of educational and economic factors seems to aggravate racial and color differences thus causing political fissures in the state the late emancipation of jerry stover shows the jamaican population falling into two main camps the voice of the people supported largely by the middle class and the just proletarian destineers to which the working classes belong these two parties represent the government and the opposition there is also the third minority nonpolitical group the rastafarian brethren the three groups are described by jerry as thieves on all three sides opponents on two and everybody rassing around and aspiring to middle class status jerry stover has just obtained his alevels and is a recruit to the civil service but he is unwilling to conform to the respectablility of the middle class to which he belongs he chafes against the routine of the service is oppressed by the claustrophobic atmosphere of island society and as an apparently irrational gesture of defiance he dedicates himself to debauchery with his fellow middle class termites pledged to undermine the establishment at heart jerry feels the futility of his way of life and a visit to the dungll turns his attention to the needs of the rastafarians with whom he identifies himself after resigning from the civil service he takes up his residence in the squalor of the rasta with the intention of helping to educate them and support their cause for rehabilitation but not for emigration he is joined by a fellow termite the nearwhite mason who is an oxford graduate their rastafarian interlude which begins in lent is an experience of shared communion between all classes and colors the rastafarian brethren in this way become for a time a symbol of the search on the part of all the characters for selfintegration and social unity peace and love the novels of salkey and patterson reveal a genuine desire to enter into the experience of the rasta cult since the brethren are a concrete manifestation of the social malaise in the west indies and also a symptom of the universal unrest typified in the characters of jerry stover and alexander blackman the rastafarians emerged as a social phenomenon before the passive beatniks of america or the activists of black_power roger mais so far ahead of the times wrote a perceptive and significant novel about the true ideal of the peace and love cult in brother man it is an ideal however overlaid in the popular imagination by the caricature of the rastafarian dream of a return to a romantic africa and betrayed by the inconsistent behaviour of adherents of the cult it is obvious that the emancipation of jerry stover and mason is one from traditional values and conventional ways of seeing things but their emancipation fails to bring lasting satisfaction salkeys gratuitous moralising on the frustration of the termites takes this form they all knew it in themselves some of them were willing to continue as they had been deluding themselves contradicting their hopes the others were frightened and panicstricken both sides were without a palliative they knew that black seal bad rum was never intended to be effective both sides were without a plan for their spiritual reclamation jerry and mason had claimed the dungll in desperation but they had not worked out a personal programme in terms of their claim they had not willed themselves to a balanced and precise attack on their weaknesses and cruel excesses they secretly feared a concerted voice a possible remedy they had no private philosophy no binding discipline no real faith in anything all they had was their freedom an emancipation that had come too late they had not had the time and the kind of society in which to use it intelligently to benefit from it to build on it it had come all at once in a frightening lump it had a tired colonial shape there had not been the time to divide it up to live with it to transmute it to put it to work for themselves and their islands destiny both salkey and patterson explicitly state that at least part of the reason for the failure to realize a sense of personal or national identity is the fact that west indian society lacks a true cultural heritage of its own there is what patterson calls an absence of ruins associated with the crum bling empires of the historic past in spite of his initial cynicism with regard to political parties and social reform jerry stover does try to commit himself to the rastafarian cause but alexander blackman in an absence of ruins does not wish to be committed to a world not worth winning when lloyd says we are black men in a white civilization and whether you like it or not youre committed to the freedom of your race blackman replies i dont want to spend my life being a negro or being a jamaican or being a socialist or a capitalist or what you like if you must know i simply want to be me to be what i am and that alone takes a lifetime of knowing avoiding involvement with society he ends by being an outsider without identity among the london crowds like ellisons invisible man in new york pattersons character laments an absence of ruins wilson harris strives to reconstruct from the history of guyana a present that contains all time and space associated with the caribbean yet the metaphysics of these two writers complement each other the former seeks fulfillment in the wholeness of the individual being through the negation of everything else the latter aims at the transmutation of all experience into the identity of the individual being when the writers at a recent conference of caribbean artists were being called upon to declare themselves unequivocally in their writings on the side of nonwhite minorities harris made a courageous defence of the noncommitted artist however to see his novels as unrelated to the human predicament of today is to misread him though not obviously engage like several other west indian novelists he is none the less engaged in the same quest for individual and national identity but a national identity that does not violate any human values in his recent novel tumatumari occurs the significant phrase immunity from race which is achieved by the anoni im uymous dead to achieve nity from race the chief characters have to absorb in their individual life the personalities and experiences of all the races of all the periods in the history of guyana the decimation of the amerindians and the slavery of negroes equally form part of the legacy of ruins on which to build the present the violation of cultures was the hidden reality of history itself upon which all things were converted and built and which one sought to fashion under the name of economic selfrighteousness and selfsufficiency though the drama of harris novel is played out against the guyana landscape the message is universal to expiate the past one must evoke from the depths of ones own complex psyche all the cruelty inflicted and all the suffering endured by all the races of mankind only in this way will selfawareness come and coming engender a sense of the sanctity of all life the west indians depicted in these novels strive to break through the old barriers of insularity and to cross the frontiers of hinterland fastnesses maybe there are important political implications in this fact
the history of the black man in america has been one of end i less struggle against the forces of racism oppression and exploitation yet today years after the enslavement of our fathers we remain still on the fringes of society as a despised deprived decitizenized minority no longer held in physical bondage yet bound nonetheless by a history of social economic and cultural oppression which has been just as damaging in its effects as physical enslavement malcolm_x once said that nobody can give you freedom nobody can give you equality or justice or anything if youre a man you take it if you cant take it you dont de serve it the history of mankind amply demonstrates the essential truth of this statement the early american settlers did not wait for the british to give them their freedom they rose up and took it the natives of algeria and kenya and nigeria got their freedom not by asking but by acting and so it has been with oppressed people throughout the world the tragedy of black people in america is that we have never as a people risen up to demand our freedom and today we remain as enslaved as ever our lives and destiny controlled still by the descendents of those who a century ago decided to free us this freedom upon close examination however turns out to be highly illusory for it is generally known that that which the master gives he also can take away perhaps more so than in any other period of history black people today under stand and accept the essentia truth of this statement throughout black america there is the growing realization that black liberation can only be effected through black initiative on this there is no disagreement but how is this to come about what is required by what means are we to gain our freedom black_power vote power dollar power gun power black capitalism black nationalism reform the system overthrow the system under whose leadership core naacp urban league black_panthers us black community development the republic of new africa black economic development committee to begin to answer this question we might first stop to consider what do we mean by freedom the term is at once both complex and simple it is used both in an absolute and a relative sense on the one hand it refers to an ideal state in which men are free to pursue their interests and live their lives maximally unencumbered by external forces and power and on the other to certain specific rights and privileges to which all men are said to be entitled by either measure the freedom of the black man in america has been severely circumscribed for well over years before black people possessed few if any rights and while the emancipation proclamation freed the blackman from physical bondage it left him politically socially economically and culturally enslaved consequently the struggle for freedom since that time has moved on many different fronts following a variety of strategies and tactics all ostensibly concerned with bringing about the ultimate liberation of black america under the leadership of such men as w e b du bois a philip randolph james farmer martin_luther_king jr and many others important political social and economic gains have been made unfortunately the great majority of black people have failed to benefit from these gains thus disillusionment in the civil_rights movement began to appear in the mids with an increasing call for newer more militant strategies for the liberation of the masses ol black people and responses have begun to take shape in the hearts and minds of the ghetto and campuses across the nation as more and more of our youth begin to hear and to understand the teaching of men such as malcolm i say that you and will never get our freedom nonviolently or patiently or lovingly we will never get it until we let the world know that as other human beimis have laid down their lives for freedomand also taken life for freedomthat you and are ready and willing and equipped and qualified to do the same there are many who believe that the black_power movement represents the final stage in the black mans centuriesold struggle to free himself of white domination and oppressiona struggle that began with the first african warrior who chose death over slavery and has continued up through the urban uprisings of the s as noted the struggle has been marked by a variety of different strategies and programs the bootstrapism of booker t washington legal persuasionism of the naacp emigrationism of marcus garvey moral persuasionism of martin_luther_king jr and the early followers of core and sncc and most recently the black nationalism of malcolm_x and his numerous followers and disciples what then is the black_power movement and how are its goals and strategies distinguishable from those of other movements since the summer of when the term was first given public currency by stokely carmichael of sncc black_power has come to mean a host of different things to different people and organizations as first projected it constituted a denunciation and rejection of white liberal leadership in the civil_rights movement and a break with the philosophy of nonviolence it also signaled the rejection of integration as a primary goal and the assertion of a new black pride and identity challenged to go beyond sweeping generalities and to identify its program black_power advocates in sncc and core began to talk in terms of black people controlling the politics and economics of their communities sncc set out to organize an allblack political party in lowndes county alabama core a series of farming and business coops in mississippi and other states in the south early confusion over the meaning of black_power developed because of the failure to distinguish between black_power as a philosophy and strategy on the one hand and as a particular set of social political economic and cultural programs on the other there was never any real doubt among early advocates as to the meaning of black powei as a broadly defined strategy for change the central concern was and still is black people acquiring and exercising power in behalf of theii own interests or to put it simply black selfdetermination as a strategy black_power is applicable at least theoretically to a full range of social economic and political objectives it is not inherently socialistic capitalistic nor welfaristic its true ideological base is neither socialism capitalism or liberal welfarism black_power as a strategy of blacl selfdetermination is philosophically rooted in the unique psychosocial condition of the black man or in short in the collective black com sciousness as such black_power is a call to black people to rediscovej the richness of their own possibilities to open themselves spiritually morally and psychologically to the true meaning of their lives as expressed in the black mans own unique historically evolving culture implicit within the philosophy of bjack power is the ultimate creation of a more humane and just society whether such a society can be best realized under the capitalist socialist or liberal welfarist system is the point around which the debate has been joined black social scientists intellectuals and students of society in general have an important role to play in this debate granted the primitive state of knowledge in the social sciences and the overriding importance of ideology in the movement the black social analyst still has a responsibility to help sharpen the issues and weigh alternatives and in so doing assist in the making of decisions that are consonant with the goals of the movement the remainder of this paper constitutes an effort in this direction in the three years since the proclamation of greenwood black_power strategy and philosophy has been aligned with three more or less distinct ideological frames of reference assimilationism pluralism and nationalism the first is delineated in black_power and urban unrest by nathan wright chairman of the national black_power conference formed in and may be characterized as the assimilationist view the second is set forth in stokely carmichael and charles v hamiltons book black_power tne politics of liberation and may be characterized as the pluralist view the third is described in the works of a number of writers including leroi jones ron karenga eldrldge cleaver and most importantly malcolm_x and is generally characterized as the nationalist view the assimilationlst view of blaok power dr wright describes black_power as a short tenn strategy for ultimate integiation into the mainstream ol american life the reason this has not occurred according to this theory rests in the black mans failure to develop the kind ol group solidarity thzat made it possible for the early italian jewish and irish immigrants to enter the melting pot racism is recognized as a fact of american life but this can be overcome dr wright argues by a more equitable distribution of power among whites and blacks a situation which whites will be willing to help bring about once they understand that it is wot only morally right but in their best interest to do so blacks should band togefner in their own organizations under their own leadershi p and initiative and developand implement programs that not only meet their immediate material needs but also contribute to their selfdevelopment and growth into maturity whites should help to encourage this by sharing more equitably their power and resources this accomplished blacks will then be able to take their rightful place in the mainstream of american life the pluralist view of black_power according to the pluralist view american society is composed of a variety of different ethnic and interest groups all competing for various goods and services these groups operate not in accordance with what is good for the society as a whole but according to what tends to maximize their own interests the black man has been at a severe disad vantage in this process historically because he has lacked a sense of ethnicity or group solidarity it is necessary then for black americans if they are to compete on an equal basis with others to come together and build a common power base from which they can more adequately represent their social political and economic interests black people are said to possess a culture that is distinct and separate from that of other ethnic groups wbite racism has resulted in the denial and destruction of that culture which black men must now undertake to revive and restore to its natural and proper place in their lives until black people do this tlbey will remain in effect an underdeveloped semicolonized people assimilation into white middle class america should not be the black qnans objective rather his goal should be an effective share in the totai power of the societyimprovement in the political and economic st atus of black men is dependent upon the complete revision of the economic and political institutions in this society the nationalist view of black_power the nationalist view holds that the position of the black man ini america is that of a colonized people in a fundamentally racist society that is unwilling fund unable to change the only salvation for t o black man therefore is to band together throw off white oppressioiji by whatever means are necessary and proceed with the building of hiu own society separate and apart from that of white america the new black society will be built on social economic and political values which are different from and superior to those of america and western civilization before proceeding with a closer look at the above interpretations of black_power it should be noted that there is little disagreement among the three on the core meaning of the concept that is that black people should develop a greater sense of group solidarity and racial pride that the achievements of the civil_rights movement have fallen short of benefiting the masses of black people that organizations and institutions in the black community should be controlled and directed by blacks that white racism constitutes the core of the black mans problem that the black freedom movement must be led by blacks that black people have the right and the responsibility to defend themselves against violent attack and that black_power is sought not as an end in itself but as a means to the liberation of black america differences revolve around the way in which the ultimate goal is defined and the tactics by which liberation will be achieved it is not altogether correct to refer to the above views just outlined as theories of black_power to do so would imply that a lot more serious effort has been devoted to the study and analysis of the movement than is actually the case in the three years since greenwood the most penetrating study and analysis has been attempted by carmichael and hamilton in their book black_power politics of liberation and even though this book falls short of articulating a truly comprehensive revolutionary concept of liberation it goes well beyond the nontheoretical somewhat preachy effort by nathan wright jr in black_power and urban unrest dr wright incidentally has turned out an even more disappointing statement in his latest book let us work together robert allen in a pamphlet published by the guardian press in dialectics of black_power identifies and discusses briefly what he detects as five approaches to black_power allen however makes the mistake as i have suggested above of confusing the philosophy of black_power with particular political and economic programs several white writers notably arnold berman christopher lasch g and arnold schuchter have attempted to deal with the subject but have only succeeded quite unexpectedly in demonstrating the thoroughness of the white mans ignorance of the true inner meaning of black liberation schuchter provides a brilliant analysis of the problems of contemporary america but arrives at the pitiful conclusion that black freedom depends on white power at any rate it should be clear that the black liberation movement if anything is concerned with social change of a very fundamental sort as such it becomes important for the move iment to define with some degree of precision what it intends to change to what and how or in other words to develop a theory or set of guidelines by which the black mans ultimate liberation in america will be accomplished the importance of this point has been urged by such writers as harold cruse james boggs and most recently by lerone bennett jr in a brilliant analysis of the movement in the august edition of ebony magazine a theory of social change should set forth at least three things the structure and dynamics of the situation in which change is sought or is occurring the nature and character of the change that is sought or is occurring and the process by which change is to be sought or is occurring the question now becomes to what extent do the three positions noted above begin to deal with such matters first of the three the assimilationist view espoused by nathan wright and others would appear to be least concerned with bringing about significant social change to the degree that social change implies basic institutional change the assimilationist is not concerned with changing the basic values of american society but with gaining greater participation in the existing social economic and political institutions on which these values are said to be based in this respect black_power assimilationists in actuality operate within the tradition and philosophy of the now moribund civil_rights movement the goals are essentially the same only the strategies have changed for this reason it is questionable whether the assimilationist view can be appropriately included in the confines of a philosophy that clearly seeks to transcend the integrationist reformist civil_rights movement of the s and s at first glance black_power politics of liberation might seem to argue a strictly pluralist point of view close reading of this book however does not support such a position christopher lasch in one of the earliest attempts at an analysis of the black_power movement takes carmichael and hamilton to task for failing to note and deal with the contradiction between the pluralist perspective and the colonized people analysis which lasch says the authors attempt to treat simultaneously in their book actually laschs criticism is based on a serious misreading of carmichael and hamilton true the authors discuss similarities between the black mans efforts to build a power base within the black community and those of earlier european immigrants along the same lines they also call attention to the pluralistic basis on which american political life is organized but nowhere do they suggest that the ultimate aim of the black_power movement is to gain black group integration into the existing pluralistic structure of american societ rather they seem to state very clearly that the organizing of a stroi black political and economic base is a necessary preparatory move towa the ultimate liberation of afroamericans from the control and domin tion of the mother country although not explicitly stated the unde lying tone and intent of carmichael and hamiltons analysis is clear nationalist for this reason it is perhaps more logical to include tl views advanced in their book within the larger framework of natio alism rather than in a separate and distinct category which as we find close analysis does not seem to be completely warranted we are le then with two rather than three organizing frames of reference assimil tionism and nationalism black nationalism far from constituting a single undifferentiate phenomenon encompasses a variety of meanings some of which m be stated as follows emigration back to africa establishment of a separate black nation within the geographic confines of the usa the position of the black muslims ac the republic of new africa the organization direction and control of all institutions in tl black community in accordance with the prescriptions and pe spectives of a separate and distinct black culture this is sa to be the main thrust of black_power politics of liberation constitutes the pluralistic position very often unstated of nume ous individuals and organizations the eventual creation of a federation of citystates politicalt controlled by blacks throughout the usa apparently the pos tion of national core s e anderson identifies what appeal to be two orientations in this group those who envision tl american politicoeconomic structure as legitimate and thus see to enter it by initially withdrawing and building the blackenir cities into politically and economically quasiautonomous cit states destined to vie for influence and control of white america capital and resources and the other group being those wfc believe black cities can be simultaneously independent of tl american politicoeconomic structure and also exist within it i as noncapitalist communal enclave the building of a sense of ethnicity and cultural unity amor black americans with little or no real concern for the remakir of the basic institutions and values of the society an essentially apolitical position attributed by some to the cultural nationalists as a group the overthrow of capitalism and the building of a socialist society those who hold this view seemingly fall into two groups the first see afroamericans as the revolutionary vanguard that will ignite the long predicted proletarian overthrow of capitalism with blacks assuming an equal part with white allies in building the new society this approximates the position of the black_panthers the second group envisions a new socialist society organized and controlled completely by blacks this view is set forth in the black economic development committees black manifesto announced earlier this year how then do black nationalists view the black mans situation today the following statements based on the thoughts and ideas of numerous proponents of black nationalism attempts to answer this question a black nationalists see america as an essentially racist society bent on pursuing a policy of systematic exploitation and oppression of its black population beginning with the introduction of slavery in the s and continuing virtually unchanged through the next years although occasionally modified under pressure at home and abroad eg emancipation fepc the supreme court desegregation decision etc racism still constitutes the chief defining characteristic of race relations in this country today its practice is not limited to any one area of social activity it is rooted systematically in the policies practices values norms and standards of american society its role in the shaping of americas economic political and cultural institutions has been of central importance in short racism far from being a marginal or isolated phenomenon is in fact endemic to the american way of life its removal therefore necessarily implies changes that go to the very heart of the countrys existence eg capitalism representative democracy etc the country however despite its growing public condemnation and disavowal of racism is adamant in its opposition to any attempt to effect fundamental changes in its basic economic and political institutions consequently black people as a group are left locked in a position of virtual peonage b up until recently black men have mistakenly relied on the gooc will and moral consciousness of white america in their fight for a bettei life in so doing they have found that the small amount of progress they have been permitted to make has been at the expense of their identity and sense of worth in order to move ahead and gain acceptance in the larger society black americans have been forced to deny and reject their own racial and cultural heritage and to accept the implied superiority of the white mans culture and ways of doing things the resultj ing pattern of selfhatred aided and abetted by white racism has served to destroy social cohesion in the black community and thereby to restrict its capacity for effective group action contrary to the generally held belief this is not a society of individuals but of separate ethnic and interest groups consequently the philosophy of individualism as promoted both by the liberals and conservatives in this country has had the effect of retarding the growth and development of the black population c the oppression of the black man in america is part of a longstanding pattern of oppression directed by whites against the nonwhite people throughout the world the same forces that operate to keep the black man in this country in a subjugated semicolonized state are also responsible for the subjugation of the oppressed people of africa asia and latin america the decolonization struggle in these countries and the black liberation struggle in america are part of a common effort to defeat a common enemy d the american class system supports and perpetuates racism which in turn constitutes a vital factor in the growth and development of that class system each supports and feeds on the other for example middle class suburbia is substantially the product of racist policies adopted and pursued by the american government and society the socalled american dilemma described by gunnar myrdal does not in fact exist it is not in the interest of america to extend complete freedom justice and equality to the blackman to do so would undermine or radically alter the fundamental basis on which the society is organized e the american philosophy of the pursuit of economic activity for selfish gain is destructive of the well being of society as a whole and the well being of black people in particular it operates to keep the masses of black people in a permanent state of impoverishment and to keep black people divided one from the other while the key to our liberation rests in unity f the accepted channels for inducing change are heavily biased toward the maintenance of the society as it exists these channels almost always operate in the interest of white america and seldom in the true interest of black america such changes have been brought about through established procedures and have produced little or no improvement in the position of the masses of black americans small gains registered during the last years have only come about because of internal and external pressure brought to bear against the american government contrary to what the country wants to believe of itself and what it would have others believe of it america is not and has never been motivated in the main in its dealings at home and abroad by moral or humane considerations public and private responses to the plight of the black american far from being humanitarian or beneficial have resulted in deepening the slavelike dependency blackmen have suffered since gaining their freedom in this in brief summarizes the black nationalist view of the social order in which the afroamerican finds himself today the social analyst presented with this description naturally wants to know what evidence exists to support its validity the most readily available evidence of course is written in the daytoday lives of this countrys million black citizens beyond this documented support exists in the work of numerous reputable students of american society the compilation and analysis of this material is a task that warrants the attention of black liberation theoreticians and i for one hope to deal with it in the near future to complete this paper however i would like to turn now to a description and discussion of the stated goals of black nationalism what are the goals of black nationalism what aspects of the present social order does it seek to change the answer to this and related questions of course may be found to some extent in the black nationalist analysis of american society from what has been said earlier about the variety of meanings attached to the philosophy of black nationalism it follows that no uniform agreement exists on the specific endgoals of the movement to reiterate some advocates see the establishment of a separate autonomous black nation within the confines of the u s as the ultimate goals of the nationalist movement others are thinking in terms of developing a federation of municipal governments that are expected to come under black political control during the next to years still others talk in terms of maximizing black control of the social political economic and cultural institutions in areas where blacks constitute a majority a fourth goal is said to be concerned with promoting cultural and ethnic unity among black people without primary regard at this time for the achievement of black political or economic autonomy with the possible exception of the last mentioned group all black nationalists reject americas economic and political instiutions as inimical to the interests and liberation of black americans some speak in terms of socialism as the alternative others of a still to be defined cor munalism no one has been able thus far to describe in detail ti operation of proposed alternative economic systems or how they mig coexist within americas present capitalist system the one exception this might be the black_panther political party which openly embrac the socialist philosophy preached and practiced by mao tse tung i china for the panthers the question is not one of coexisting wil capitalism but of replacing it altogether with socialism the saw can also be said about the goals of the black economic developme committee which as set forth in the black manifesto envision a blad takeover of the entire country and establishment of a socialist societl for the most part black nationalist economic alternatives have bed largely piecemeal shortrun reformist proposals designed to broada black participation in the existing economic system for example cor has developed a community development corporation proposal the in tent of which presumably is to establish black control over all fund coming into the black community it is far from clear however thj such a program is likely to do much in the way of establishing economl selfsufficiency in the ghetto or in a yet to be established separate blad nation perhaps in this idea we can begin to see the first move towarl the development of a new economic system that might be described a communal capitalism numerous other questions come to mind fq instance what kind of educational system will the new nation set ud how will it deal with the problems of juvenile delinquency drug addij tion illegitimacy alcoholism and broken homes in raising such quej tions the purpose is not to challenge the viability of the goal or to caj doubt on the possibility of building a viable new nation the purposl is rather to face boldly some of the difficult issues and problems thl movement must inevitably confront and deal with in the years ahead obviously detailed final answers can not be worked out a priori to sud gest as much would be unrealistic but now is the time to begin thinkin about such matters even as we prepare for the day of our ultimat liberation to repeat what are the goals of the black nationalist movement first let me suggest that it would be helpful to approach the subjec from the point of view of immediate intermediate and ultimate or end goals earlier i noted what may be described as six types of black na tionalist endgoals none of these common reason tells us are likely t be achieved overnight the question then becomes what are the im mediate and intermediate goals or objectives that must be achieved ii order to take the movement from where it is today to where it hope to be ultimately or to put it another way what are the necessary immediate and intermediate goals on which the achievement of the movements endgoals logically rest it is to this critical question that i would now like to turn first black nationalism in america no matter the specific form it takes is revolutionary in that it opposes and seeks to alter the basic values and institutions of the existing social order whether stated directly or not revolutionary intent is an integral part of the goals and philosophy of the black_panthers the republic of new africa the black student union movement and cultural nationalist groups such as those led by leroi jones and ron karenga without fail black nationalists are concerned with black political economic social and cultural selfdetermination a goal which is not likely to be peacefully granted by white america such is the case regardless of whether the aim is to establish a separate black nation or to take over control of the schools or businesses in the black community this is not to argue that the realization of black nationalism in this country necessarily implies the exercise of armed force or violent strategies in some cases armed conflict will be inevitable in others highly probable in either case black nationalism as a revolutionary movement demands if anything maximum unity and social cohesion rooted in a consciousness of common purpose and social need as defined by black nationalist philosophy this i submit is the central defining condition around which immediate and intermediate goals of the black nationalist movement must be developed the tragedy of the black man in america is that over the years he has come to identify with and to accept those aspects of american society that constitutes the prime source of his degradation and oppression selfcentered materialism colonial welfarism gradualistic reformism and cultural assimilationism to mention but a few the acceptance of these values has undermined and all but destroyed the blackmans capacity to see understand and act in behalf of his own best interests while at the same time it has kept him permanently immobilized outside the gates of affluence in a perpetual state of false hopefulness it is this condition that black nationalism must alter on its way toward creating the requisite degree of revolutionary black consciousness among the masses this means developing programs and activities that expose the falseness and exploitativeness of the countrys class system that encourages black people to go beyond the crippling strictures of liberal reformism and to challenge in radically new ways and forms the conditions in which they find themselves that promote a greater sense of ethnic cooperation and racial communalism these are offered not as concrete programs which clearly they are not but as standards by which to measure the value or utility of the shortrange program proposals and action plans if it hopes to gain and maintain a sense of relevancy the movement must speak to the concrete needs of the people as they are experienced today but the challenge is to do so in a way that is likely i to heighten and not retard the growth of revolutionary black consciousness among the masses of black people examined in this way programs such as those promoted under the label of black capitalism or those which directly or indirectly contribute to the growth of elitism in the black community clearly constitute a hinderance to the black nationalist liberation process whether programs such as model cities antipoverty community health or even cores community development corporation ultimately serve to hinder or to help the process depends largely on the revolutionary consciousness of the black leaders who are a part of such programs the potential is there what is required is the revolutionary will to capitalize on it thus citing colonial welfarism a category under which most of the above noted programs fall as destructive to the liberation process is not to suggest that all welfare programs are to be rejected automatically what must be rejected however is the underlying philosophy that encourages docile slavelike dependency among the people who are intended to benefit it would be tragic however if the movement had to depend on government funded welfare programs as its only or prime means of reaching the people fortunately there are others outstanding among which is that of political action organized and unorganized cultural activities represent another moving on to a third major question that any theory of social change must inevitably address itself to how or by what process will the black nationalist movement achieve its objectives here we must consider each of the forms of black nationalism separately as alluded to earlier organizations such as the black_panthers and the republic of new africa see armed revolution as a necessary and inevitable part of the liberation process the panthers envision a proletarian overthrow of the capitalist system the republic of new africa foresees widespread guerilla warfare initiated in the south and spreading to the populous cities of the north some who envision the creation of a federation of cities under black control stress political organization and political action others emphasize cultural regeneration and cultural revolution outstanding among the former group is core and among the latter such groups as those led by leroi jones and ron karenga revolution armed political and culturalis the principal means by which alternative forms of black nationalism hope to effectuate the goals of black liberation the success of each as already noted will depend substantially on the achievement of a condition of revolutionary readiness among the masses of black people or at least a significant minority thereof it is possible that this will come about through the organized efforts of activists in the nationalist movement or as a reaction to stepped up repression of the liberation movement in general or in response to unforeseen development on the international scene or all three the situation at the moment hangs in balance there are forces that seem to be pushing events more and more in the direction of revolution there are counter forces that tend to check and negate the drift toward revolution among the former i include the following continued ghettoization of blacks in the urban areas and selfsegregation of whites in surrounding suburbs the deepening economic plight of the masses of blacks i relative to the condition of the average white american increasing militarization of urban police forces accelerating thrust of the philosophy of black_power and the black cultural revolution the accelerating thrust of a white student movement sympathetic to the goals and objectives of black liberation among the countering forces i include continued growth and prosperity of the black middle class continued spread of i colonial welfarismimproved public assistance grants antipovertyl programs model cities programs black capitalism etc continued generalized commitment among black people to the capitalist ethic of the pursuit of economic activity for private gain selfcentered material ism nationwide encirclement and repression of liberation movement leadership and membership which of the above set of forces will prevail no one can truly say the apocalyptic predictions of marxist determinists have failed to maj terialize as a result the deterministic approach to history and social change has been largely discredited c w mills position on historical change is probably closer to the truth than that of the economic determinists when he says to be grounded in history is to expect of the future that which does not follow mechanically but flows from large decisions not yet made and to be sure it is the large decisions noj yet made that revolutionary black nationalism must seek to influence if it hopes to swing future events in the direction of its ultimate aims and purposes in summary black nationalists argue that significant change in the black mans position in this country can only be brought about througl revolutionary overthrow of the existing social economic and politic structure some hold that the chief instruments of change are necessari violent others political and still others cultural the most pressing issi at this point may not be which of the three is correct in a final or ultimai sense but rather given the situation that exists in america today an among black people in particular which of the three instruments change would appear to be most strategically viable at this point i history numerous observers in recent years have drawn a parallel betwee the oppressed black people of america and the colonized people of th third world they are quick to point out that the liberation struggle in the countries of the third world have been characteristically violen affairs and that the struggle for black liberation in this country must alsj proceed along the lines of armed revolution it should be clear howeven that the parallel between the blacks of america and the oppressed of thl third world is far from exact aside from certain obvious difference on the question of prior ownership of and the relative numerical strengtl of the colonized vs the colonizers other important differences exist witl respect to the predominant modes of control and oppression employed by the mother country although historically terroristic activity and arbitrary proscription of civil liberties have been systematically employed against blacks in this country these arc no longer the chief instrument of oppression that they have been in the past the black man in americi and in the newly emerging nations of the third world suffer not sc much from terroristic domination and control as from domination tha stems from enforced economic political and cultural dependency on the mother country the mechanisms of repression center less in the police and the military and more in the farreaching patterns of racial discrimination in housing employment and education colonial welfarism and cultural suppression the domination of afroamericans has been made complete by the destruction and removal of all possibility for the development of a black cultural base forcing blacks to rely on the cultural prescriptions and guidelines of the culture of the oppressor the road to the liberation of the blackman in america would seem to lead at this time not through armed revolution but through the assertion of black cultural autonomy or in other words a black cultural revolution to repeat the problem we presently face is not primarily one of widespread terrorism physical coercion or arbitrary denial of civil liberties these are no longer the chief means of oppression in this country the problem we now confront is one of domination by social economic and political institutions that have been organized and which operate in such a way as to keep black people in a permanent state of subjugation it is important to point out however that the source of oppression rests not only in the form or the structure of these institutions but also and perhaps most importantly in their very substance or content in the past liberation efforts have tended to focus on the former we have since come to understand that change must be brought about in both the form and the content for instance modifying or opening the capitalistic structure in the interest of promoting greater black participation does nothing to change the substance of capitalism yet it is the substance its essentially racist and exploitative core that serves to keep the masses of blacks subjugated and dominated at home and abroad the structural approach to change is based on the assumption that the black mans problem is essentially one of exclusion consequently the answer to the problem becomes one of structuring the black man into the prevailing system the problem however goes much further than that the problem exists because the core values goals and objectives of americas basic institutions are inimical to the interests of black people the first step toward changing such institutions must be the building of a black cultural base or frame of reference out of which new answers to the plight of the blackman can be fashioned the only frame of reference that the afroamerican now has is that of his oppressor new social political and economic forms and contents cannot be projected or realized in the absence of alternative cultural perspectives the aim of the black cultural revolution must be to furnish such alternatives there is ample evidence that the process is already well underway on the college campuses in the public schools and hundreds of cultural organizations throughout the country to reiterate the basic institutions and practices of a people are determined by its culture the projection and realization of alternative liberating social forms and institutions for afroamericans rests upon the development of a cultural matrix out of which the substance of these new forms will be shaped the liberation of the black man in america cannot go forward in the absence of a generalized cultural revolution in the black community finally the theory of black liberation through armed revolution at this point in the history of the afroamerican must be seriously questioned for several other reasons than those outlined above a black america presently lacks the material and military base for successfully carrying out a revolution on its own against the most powerful military and industrial country in the history of the world b there does not seem to be in the country today among the white population revolutionary allies with sufficient political economic or military resources at this time to make a difference in armed struggle and c for the immediate future armed revolution is only likely to produce catastrophic repression of black people and a severe setback to the ultimate triumph of the afroamerican liberation struggle let me be clear the above is not intended as an argument in favor of the single strategy approach to black liberation neither armed conflict nor political action can be summarily dismissed as unimportant the issue has to do with where our primary efforts should be concentrated at this time black people would be foolish not to take seriously j the threat of genocide and to prepare themselves accordingly just as it is unthinkable that we should not prepare ourselves to capitalize fully on the opportunity for political control of the many urban areas that will come our way during the next to years however unless we develop political social and economic forms that transcend those that have been the source of our oppression for centuries then in truth we will have gained a hollow victory should political or military victory come our way it is only through consciously disengaging ourselves from the cultural matrix out of which existing institutions are fashioned that we can begin to get into position to develop newer more humane social forms and institutions in this sense i agree wholeheartedly with harold cruse who holds that in america the key to the liberation of the blackman hinges on the development of a revolutionary movement that is social political economic and cultural and that there can be no revolution in the u s without cultural revolution this undoubtedly is a topic that deserves much more discussion in the near future i hope to go into it in greater depth in conclusion may i say that the above analysis of black_power and black nationalism in my opinion not only offers a more systematic approach to program development than has been evident in the movement to date it also serves to call attention to something that organizational differences within the movement have tended to obscure and that is the substantial amount of agreement that exists among black nationalists with respect to the analysis of the black mans position in america and the broadly defined strategies necessary for ultimate liberation where they differ and i have no desire to conceal or to cover up such differences is on the matter of the definition of endgoals there is no way in the final analysis of determining at this juncture which of the views are correct there seems to be little evidence quite frankly of any significant support for the newly revived backtoafrica movement but l between the black_panthers the republic of new africa black federationists and the cultural nationalists who is to say which if any history will prove to be correct the ultimate outcome as argued above will be determined by a variety of historical forces of which black nationalist organizations constitute but a part although a critically important part but whether black nationalism succeeds in winning over a majority of afroamericans to its philosophyor at least a significant minority will be determined to a very considerable degree by further developments at home and abroad here i have in mind such things on the domestic front as whether the country decides to undertake allout repression of the escalating liberation movement or whether it chooses to initiate quite unexpectedly a truly comprehensive national effort to elevate the economic social and political position of its million black citizens or to continue along its present gradualist course on the international scene the materialization of war in south africa or in other parts of the third world could have a profound influence on the afroamerican liberation movement these are matters of course which deserve much closer study than can be undertaken in this particular paper in the meantime and even while recognizing severe limitations on the predictability of the social sciences the search for a theoretical base for the liberation movement should certainly go forward to be sure ideology in the long run will play a more decisive role than the offings of science yet afroamerican students of human relations and society in general have a responsibility to apply whatever skills and knowledge they possess toward the ultimate triumph of the goals of black liberation this paper is offered as one step in that direction a sure thing about clarence majors first novel allnight visitors olympia is that a lot of us particularly the soul sisters do or will not like it and will not think too highly of clarence major for writing it this will be because eli bolton the central character in allnight visitors is an aimless cockhound whose scores are mostly with white chicks and he describes all of his sexbased relationships with vivid detail in the first pages understand ably the novel might not be finish by some who pick it up still i b lieve there are reasons why majc editor of the new black poetry h offered us what appears to be a sti novel i believe his reasons are erary and social eli an orphan is a veteran of tl nam he is a numbed soul broth but not because of the nam exp rience he observes the world car fully and is hip to whats happenii around him he can dig the muslithing and flavors his sexvocab with swahili his story a firstpersonpresent narrative is a wandering outwardwhirling vortex of flashbacks dreams smells and commentary on his own precocious sensibility the present tense brilliantly projects the authors poetic imagination as do the numerous metaphors whieh are skillfully handled eli hustles through his limo with intentions to hold an honest job he works one gig at the other side hotel of onenighters later he is a sodajerk at goldburgs drugcounter three white chicks and two soul sisters fall in and out of elis range of need and circumstance there is tammy the unsophisticated impulsive liar from the midwest the restless cathy a prolonged loveobject eunice elis willowy sophisticated new england angel anita a boss soul momma and loveobject and clara a daughter of elis foster parents the novel is constructed so that the two black women and what they mean to eli are described nearest the center at the end elis three white objectangels also spin away from his grasp as we weave through elis tangled story we find that the main plot involves jimmy sheraton a white excomic turned drunkard nuisance and his death the derelict who claims that a black momma raised him is booted out of goldburgs by brogan the stores bad black assistantmanager eventually he decided to follow eli home bugging him on the subway preferring to avoid letting his irritation get the best of him eli walks swiftly to his pad stopping the youth near his destination sheraton is attacked by three young soul brothers who assume the responsibility of protecting members of the black community sheratons death is a beefkill at heart eli is a hedonist motivated only by an unquenchable de sire to tcb he is ensnared by apathy and harassed by the proximity of circumstance he will not neglect or forsake his rod in fact in the presence of women it is truly a fetish eli possesses a clinical curiosity sheratons death the brutal killing of the wardens pup at the orphanage and the rapekilling of a vietnamese child find eli in a frontrow seat massaged by the medium by the end of his narrative he will have acted in such a manner that even he doesnt fully realize the degree to which his actions permit him to break out of his malaise first he offers a confession of being witness to the beefkill in order to save the three soul brothers from the chair gazing at the nape of one youths neck as he is led from the interrogation room eli muses the view of an early defeat or the beginning of a kind of human victory his second redemptive deed comes with the offering of his living accommodations to a nonenglish speaking pregnant puertorican mother of seven whose husband has ousted them from their own upstairs apartment this is effective dramatic irony we will realize immediately the significance of these actions before eli does allnight visitors as a novel of a young black mans psychic travels contain some very believable people besides the narrator himself whether the characters are objects of elis passion andor are structural props they hold our interest because elis keen eye brings out their personalities with candor even when in the novels structure they appear to come and go as phantoms they are adequately developed as a stylist major has been influenced by henry miller and anais nin his delivery is poetic and the finished product has his own earthy touch in the fashion of ishmael reed major exploits the possibilities of surreal comedy and the ludicrous for momentary effect in descriptive content the sex scenes are reminiscent of the writings of john cleland and desade though no writer today needs these people as models the orgiastic scene with the foxy anita is described with brilliant sibilance despite the fact that lengthy sex scenes seem a standard or a necessity for the acceptable contemporary american novel the success or failure of allnight visitors will ultimately lie with what it represents as a novel by a black american writer most of us agree that white americas current psychosexual fixation represents part of its demise the fact to consider is majors intent in starting out on this rubbish heap with his first novel if we give allnight visitors an absolute condemnation it would contradict a casually accepted image both in and outside of art of the walking black phallus an image eli doesnt mind fulfilling this image has been assumed at times because it is what white america thinks of the black man in the first place but in majors novel we do watch an apathetic black man take his first steps toward maturitysocial community responsibility eli bolton is a numbed individual sex is his only meaningful outlet eli too is not by himself allnight visitors depicts a libidinous urge but its character is headed in a worthwhile direction he begins to live up to his honorable name when he acts in a manner that will attest to his selfless responsibilit to reach out for others clarence major has the novelist talent but since he is contributing t contemporary afroamerican litera ture his craft should be highlighte by a central character who is able t carry the aesthetic motion of thl story on a more active social level major already shows signs of bein able to handle the psychologica drama the afro novel today mus project meaningful social concept and spiritual values into the blood stream of black america and thi can be done and done well with al the possibilities of style and messag taken into account in order to tel his story in order to get the message across major gives us both what we want and dont wanthis decisior to do so is the artists prerogative anc his energyvision is involved in the tell in a of truths what would have been the significance of john coltrane for example if he had giver the people the music they would have preferred to hear it is my guess that clarence major sees beyond this novel to the real needs of the black community as those needs can be expressed and illustrated through fiction soul brother eli bolton represents the living problem of apathy and as both a wanderer of the psyche and a sexual waystation his initial steps toward selftransformation were inevitable and justify his honesty ron welburn if leroi jones and other black artists hadnt already impressed me with the necessity of ignoring fire hydrants i could possibly be disturbed by mr john hicks novel the long whip david mckay fortunately jones admonition that black people should avoidthe ludicrous posture of attempting to communicate with fire hydrants ie people whites generally whose consciousness is equivalent to that of a fire hydrant conditioned my reaction to a book that blatantly utilizes the most hackneyed and offensive stereotypes of black people once you are convinced of the essential insanity of trying to converse with fire hydrants then it is impossible to be disturbed over a book written by one in fact the only possible reason i can see for reviewing this book at all is to document the fact that writers like hicks still exist that they are still being published and read and that white writers in america are still trying to market what they do not believe in and what they usually cannot understandthe complex humanity of the black man perhaps simply knowing the truth about american white literary traditions is in itself a form of liberation the story covers the short life of a black slave ridiculously named ben franklin from the time he is sold to a white master in new orleans until he dies fighting for his rights as a freedman during reconstruction one would have to look back to the novels of white southern unrealists like thomas dixon and thomas nelson page to find a more repugnant picture of black slaves than hicks has created in the long whip william styrons portrayal of nat turner another dehumanized myth from the decay of white fantasy seems by comparison positively innocent and wellintentioned because of its basic insincerity the book never rises to the level of art so there is no need to be sidetracked by such aesthetic considerations as technique or style or to be overly concerned with the artistic merits of this book it is first of all poorly constructed events follow one another with as little motivation and as little relationship as you are likely to find in items on a grocery list secondly the only theme the author remembers to develop with any consistency is the idea that bens freedom is somehow tied up with his subconscious desire for a white woman that he must conquer this inner repressed urge before he will be totally free since this theme crops up two or three times in the novel which is at least once more than any other idea i assume it must have some sort of importance what passes for characterization in the long whip is intentionally crude and vulgar every conceivable and banal black stereotype squatting in the degenerate imagination of mr hicks is displayed here there is odette the young beautiful mulatto slave girl whom ben falls in love with her sole purpose in life is to solicit a wealthy white patron to set her up in style in the french quarter from time to time from whichever white mans bedroom she is currently occupying she is permitted to mutter a few lines of coarse dialogue you like odette she purred that good huh you lie still odette show you more big man you good so good pp other than some lecherous remarks to ben about the size of his genitals and a series of barbaric nativestyle guttural laughs that is practically all that odette the major black female character is allowed to say or think or feel justine the faithful old slave woman who loves her master and his family too much to leave them is another favorite white myth that appears after she is given her freedom she makes the typical tearful and loyal pronouncement law mars legrand ifn ya jus let me stay right here ahll be the happies nigger live p now in all probability there were such sentiments voiced by some old slaves but judging from white writers attachment to and need for the faithful darky there were probably considerably fewer than we have been encouraged to believe besides whites have never been able to tell when a niggers pissed oftuntil after the riot etienne legrand or mars legrand as he is affectionately called by his niggers is a conspicuous mouthpiece for hicks himself a liberalsupposedly out of time and place in the slave southhe makes several noble and contrived speeches for example trying to explain the subtleties of freedom to ben he says i have never really approved of the institution of slavery ben i have slaves because it is an economic necessity but in any conflict i will be forced to take sides against the north because this is my home because i believe in another freedomthe right of each sovereign state to determine its own course do you understand me ben p aside from the most obvious obje tion that no one talks this way oul side of political treaties and seconj rate novels hicks use of legrarl as a straw man for his own prop gandu is a cheap trick that an un talented writer cannot carry off i as the mythical white souther hero legrand is as magnificent i death as in life to ben it seen impossible that there was no longj an etienne legrand and he castl gates himself for not being there tl save his master his final commenl he had been a good man i a good white man p i as one of the critics of styrons bool has pointed out the idea of a blacl slave an intelligent and tragic figurj differentiating among his oppressor as though he believes tyranny can bl rated on a scale from high to lovl is psychologically inconsistent likl dividing blacks into good niggers and bad niggers you have to juggll the whole apparatus to make the rig answer come out i but even hicks attempts at jugl gling are clumsy and obvious thl black manwhite woman theme il suddenly resurrected near the end o the novel and as expected ben il forced to deal with what hicks coni siders the big question in his lifei not land or power or equalitybu where the hells mah white womai tserew p the opportunity presents itself but ben is terrified of the woman blindingly white body a phenom enon completely beyond my compre hension and experience and is un able to score victory number one instead he bursts out of the room with the sound of her laughter following him falls against a lamppost outside and vomits which is what the reader is tempted to do at this point as if this scene were not the ultimate distortion of ben franklin hicks leaves him meditating in profound concern over his blackness she made him feel so damned what was the word black that was it black the new thought hit him with a physical force black hed never actually thought of himself as being black p hickss mama couldnt sound less like a black slave all of his life ben franklin has been a piece of property bought and sold at the highest price he is a soldier in the branch of the army called officially the nigger regiment and hicks has him discovering his blackness as though he were edward brooke trying to integrate hyannis port the idea is as patently absurd as the rest of the book the long whip is in a sense a testimony that such a book is possible in twentiethcentury america bearing as it does an identical resemblance to the racist fiction of the th and th centuries is a genuine testimony to the unchanging nature of this country this will come as no shock to anyone who has been listening carefully to black critics for the last years langston hughes j saunders redding william stanley braithwaiteto name only a fewhave been condemning the traditions in america literature which exploit and degrade the image of black people a writer like john hicks who presents the black man as an oversexed simpleminded bewildered victim of society hung up over the sexual threat of the white woman pronounces judgment upon himself and his own artistic integrity moronically he consigns himself to a level of inferiority and mediocrity where he can really do very little harm much of the history taught in our schools is false history a history of lies omissions and distortions in reading it you get the impression that there were almost no black men in america that they did not play an important part in its development that slavery was a benign institution that slaves were contented with their condition and that black people generally were satisfied with their status deceived by this false history people are astonished and bewildered when our cities are burned and attribute the burning to the agitation of communistinspired agents if watts newark detroit and chicago havent dispelled those delusions then perhaps this book will do so pioneers in protest johnson by lerone bennett jr senior editor of ebony magazine who is at the institute of the black world tells of fighters for black liberation both black and white from crispus attucks who led boston mobs against british soldiers to w e b du bois brilliant scholar who died in ghana in as a member of the communist party and a ghanaian citizen it is written for the layman with an index but with no footnotes and no bibliography beside wellknown leaders like du bois harriet tubman sojourner truth and frederick douglass lerone bennett writes of those not so well known and of those whom history has passed by or stamped with obloquy like marcus garvey father of african nationalism nat turner leader of a slave revolt and james monroe trotter an early black nationalist mr bennett points out that the american revolution was never finished and he tells of the efforts of black men to carry it to completion he tells how benjamin banneker wrote to thomas jefferson cooling from the revolutionary fire of his youth for help against growing discrimination against blacks this lack of completion led to nat turners revolt and mr benneit points out that what a nation sows it reaps he says that slavery was an original act of violence then its violence was internalized in the slaves who were violent toward each other then violent toward their masters who in turn reacted with violence to the slaves closing the circuit of violence mr bennett writes of white lead ers whom historians have maligned because of their sympathy for blacks john brown who some have called a fanatic saw clearly that slavery was an act of war and reacted to it with violence thaddeus stevens and charles sumner leaders of congress during reconstruction tried hard to construct a just and equal society in the south stevens said how can republican institutions free schools free churches free social intercourse exist in a mingled community of nabobs and serfs their efforts were defeated and we are reaping today what was sown when their plans were thwarted among the less wellknown blacks mr bennett includes are henry highland garnet who appealed to the slaves to start a general strike and to revolt and david walker whose appeal to the coloured citizens of the world anticipated frantz fanon mr bennetts portrait of nat turner is very different from that drawn by william styron he ascribes to turner strong and close family ties an identification with the blacks and a grim resolve to end slavery because of its inclusion of less wellknown persons this book will be a useful addition to schools and libraries lee effectively constructs extended runon phrases into a myriad of thought the total idea is expressed by letters that become words and contractions correspond tonally to the diction of black speakers these mark lees style in the graphic sense the technique is not an innovation of course the umbra poets leroi jones and norman pritchard have utilized it successfully since early in the decade lee is not doing his thing as imitation or emulation but to express his distinct voice as a poet of the black revolution the thrust of contemporary black poetry is both calvin herntons fist beating against the ear and lerois machine gun and while it is destroying images which are no longer useful it is creating new ones relative to the lives of oppressed peoples don lees poetry subscribes to this standard that life in america is already absurd is no secret to lee but the absurdity is of the grotesque inhumanity of the unpeople not the configuration of their existential limitations lee is thematically unpretentious straightforward and sarcastic he is not burdened by the kind of ironic vision that plagues white existentialist poets these poets carry an apathy across their backs like the weight of dead stone they think they see too much of the universe and that universe is incomprehensible to their sensibilities their confessional poetry reeks of death wishes simply because they had attempted to conquer something larger than themselves the poor devils cannot embrace it as to labor a point cited by miss brooks who indicated that don l lee would never subscribe to what jascha kessler mentioned as a longing for death which typifies american white poets it should be further made clear that lee has a rendezvous with life as dont cry scream is his third projection of the sounds of black lifelife sounds only the spiritually alienated cry and see death as the most meaningful escapehatch race toward it like it is their lover and crying leads to that feeling we have experienced known as the blues to this the young chicago poet would respond we aint blue we is black yet kessler who would be totally outside the poetic conceptions of the black aesthetic would insist which is a reflection on the spiritual emptiness which the black american found himself being sucked into hence black death is subjective but hardly private and quite unique the white academicians understanding of white deaths is shallow they are lonely all of them poems like lees nigerian unityor little niggers killing little niggers can only appeal to the loneliness of nonblacks meanwhile assassination speaks of the response to the shooting of rev king they came running as if the king was going to fire back this kind of dying for black men has been standard and unique all this is to say that lees poetry screams for us to the general editor of any publishing company should rightfully be expected to print a volume of his own writings such has dudley randall done on broadside press and quite unselfishly limiting himself to a book of twelve poems of an impressive quality cities burning is a first book by the detroit editorpoetlibrarian who has coauthored poem counterpoem with margaret danner and coedited the popular collection for malcolm with margaret burroughs randall possesses a firm sense of the lyric and cities burning is more appropriately a book of songs or psalms than a rugged razoredged batch of poetry that might correspond to the title of the collection itself the lyrical tone dominates throughout it is so strong that the poem ballad of birmingham is one example of the kind of randall piece that has been set to music randall is a contemporary of gwendolyn brooks and so not in the new school of black poets but all schools aside his is a keen functional awareness of what black poetry has been and remains and there is no hint of an alienation from the ethos being developed by the new stylists in theme and passion black poetry has always had its own thing going in sound sense imagery metaphor and content and there are many different styles or ways of doing the thingtry as he might any poet endowed with a sense of music cannot easily escape it for it is a natural asset no poets in america serve in such a priestly capacity as do black poets priests musicians deacons chanters hail dionysus analysands and augury for an infant are similar evocations each poem in this collection depicts some aspect of the terror the decay the pleasures and the hopes that affect life in cities the persona of dionysus watches with praise the work of the god of frenzy and release the melting pot and a different image offset each other with the selfacceptance after racial rejection to the more definite and enduring recognition of an artifact which defines and exemplifies heritage the final augury affirms a belief in the infants potential and in context to the rest of the book reaffirms a new conception of the moral fiber of cities randall has brought to this first volume a good heart ear and eye for sensitive observation all which enhance his lyricism young black poets who read him should be influenced by him to some degree for his voice alone is infectious moreso he is contributing something to black literature that has a lasting value cities burning unfortunately does not include most of the work he has done for a long period of years still it will endure as a piece of sculpture endures with a proud sereneand classic bronze of benin black readers will respect these

on a day in early august william o still of philadelphia was approached by a man who gave his name as peter freeman and said that he was looking for his long lost father and mother levin and sidney former slaves like himself still was an underground railroad operator and hence familiar with dramatic incidents but as peter unfolded his story he stood almost transfixed for it happened that levin and sidney were his own parents and therefore the man talking to him was an older brother he had never seen before such human interest stories about slaves who journeyed northward looking for relatives or in pursuit of freedom or both made effective propaganda for the abolitionist cause fugitive slaves on the wing tended to arouse sympathy and to stir the public conscience slavery was weakened far less by the economic loss of the absconding blacks than by the antislavery feeling they evoked by their flight and the attempts to reclaim them sympathy for the runaway slave was created and sustained by the fugitive slave act of heavily weighted in favor of the master this measure offended the popular sense of fair play without first obtaining a warrant a master had only to seize his slave bring him before any judge and prove to the courts satisfaction that the person in custody was guilty as charged the judge would then issue what was in essence a certificate of repossession the alleged slave was permitted no trial by jury and given no opportunity to present witnesses to give testimony on his behalf the abolitionists attacked the measure on the dual grounds that it was unconstitutional and that it legalized kidnapping the latter contention was the more readily provable as in the instance in which the churchman richard allen was seized as a fugitive and his claimant was spared a court punishment only through allens intercession the law was onesided but even had it been more fairly drafted there would still have remained a great reservoir of sympathy for those who made the dash for freedom a blend of the desperate and the heroic their actions could hardly fail to win the admiration even of the great mass of people who did not care for the abolitionists and to whom the free negro was someone to be tolerated rather than welcomed hence the work of assisting runaways was in popular favor in the north many whites being drawn into the work possibly the best known of these was the quaker levi coffin whose year record of slaves assisted ran to well over formerly from north carolina coffins success as a storekeeper in newport indiana and then in cincinnati afforded him the means for underground railroad activities two other abolitionists with long and almost as notable careers in helping fugitives were thomas garrett whose wilmington home was perhaps the best known station in the east and canadianborn alexander m ross who took time from his career as a physician to recruit escapeminded slaves in richmond nashville selma and new orleans any balanced analysis of underground railroad operations must include its negro workers in ohio for example black people were particularly active abolitionist leader james g birney noted in february that slaves were escaping in great numbers to canada by way of ohio and he added such matters are almost uniformly managed by the colored people i know nothing of them generally till they are past the fugitive slaves who made their way through sandusky were aided almost wholly by the towns negroes led by barbershop owner grant richie the state as a whole numbered not fewer than negro underground railroad workers in missouri the loose network included a cluster of allnegro associations in st louis which sped the fugitive to chicago and points north of the variety of ways to assist fugitives one in particular was suited to the negro operatorthat which entailed going into the south and making contact with those who were escapeminded the slave was more likely to place his trust initially in a black face moreover some negro conductors were former slaves who were familiar with the territory in which they operated some of these secret returnees were willing to run this special risk in order to rescue their wives and children the most renowned of these black conductors was harriet tubman who like nat turner the slave rebel of an earlier generation was given to dreams and to prayers herself an escapee from dorches ter county maryland in she made some excursions into slave territory and brought back more than fugitives short and spare she hardly looked like a person with a price on her head but she was as skillful in avoiding detection her coolness in a tight spot matching her courage to her abolitionist associates she became something of a legend thomas wentworth higginson calling her the greatest heroine of the age a less noted and less lucky conductor was leonard a grimes a free negro grimes became a hackman in washington dc eventually owning a number of horses and carriages all as available for rescuing slaves as for conveying paying passengers in one of his ventures in virginia his native state he was seized after spiriting a slave family away in a hack grimes spent two years in the state prison at richmond he then went to boston becoming the pastor of the twelfth baptist church but as in washington he neglected no opportunity to assist a runaway most of the conductors whose names are lodged in the record were based in the free states and hence were engaged in speeding the slave on his way rather than leading him out of the south these middlemen included george l burroughs of cairo illinois whose job as a sleepingcar porter between cairo and chicago gave him an unusual opportunity for smuggling slaves the most enterprising conductor in salem ohio was george w c lucas whose falsebottomed wagon conveyed fugitives to cleveland sandusky and toledo at elmira new york former slave john w jones secreted slaves in baggage cars bound for canada t for some black conductors the water was the freedom route slaves were carried across the ohio on skiffs from kentucky to indiana negro crewmen might bring slaves aboard as stowaways on vessels leaving southern ports and bound for the north elizabeth barnes who worked for a ship captain at portsmouth virginia hid slaves on vessels sailing for boston and new bedford new yorkers edward smith and isaac gansey of the schooner robert centre were charged by the virginia governor thomas w gilmer with having abducted slave isaac and was offered for their delivery to the jailer at norfolk a prominent feature of the ne gro underground was the providing of overnight accommodations for the escaping slave a white host might well be an object of suspicion to a newly fledged fugitive upon reaching philadelphia where they revealed their true identities william and ellen craft were placed with barkley ivens a nonnegro much to ellens alarm i have no confidence whatever in white people she told william they are only trying to get us back into slavery levi coffin noted that the fugitives who passed through newport indiana generally stopped among the colored people although the latter were not always as skillful in concealing them as they might have been but carelessness could hardly be charged to chapman harris of jefferson county and his associate elijah anderson despite the fact that their cabins were well known stopping places for fugitives coming to cincinnati in levi coffin found that there too most of the fugitives who landed in the city soon vanished into the colored quarter some of those who were taken to the negro section wound up at a place most unlikely to be suspected of harboring fugitivesthe wellappointed dumas house famous for its ornate saloon where one might find the biggest colored faro game in the country at ross ohio the reverend william m mitchell gave overnight housing to some fugitives over a span of years mitchells lodginghouse activities ceased in when the american baptist free mission society engaged his services as a missionary to the former slaves in toronto runaway slaves reaching detroit could find asylum at the residence of george debaptiste who had worn out his welcome in madison indiana because of his underground railroad activities a slave coming to chicago might be lodged with the welltodo tailor john jones at philadelphia the physicianclergyman james j g bias gave his bed freely to slaves directed to his house by the white abolitionist charles t torrey not stopping with his bed bias also gave to his overnight guests a quick medical checkup just outside philadelphia the byberry residence of robert purvis a wellknown station on the underground had a special room reached only by a trap door another wealthy black abolitionist william j whipper of columbia a port of entry for fugitives from maryland and virginia resided at the end of the bridge leading into the town he put up as many as slaves in one night the next day sending them west by boat to pittsburgh or by rail to philadelphia in the false end of a boxcar he owned in one instance whipper alerted jacob c white at philadelphia that the fugitive he was dispatching was in a perilous situation having seen his master that very day at west chester abraham d shadd fairly well off but not in a class with whipper or purvis entertained and forward ed black transients in new york city the home of charles b ray was a haven for journeying fugitives of them walking up the front steps one summer morning but ray was not the only black new yorker to be so blessed one hundred and fifty in a single year have lodged under my roof wrote henry highland garnett and i have never asked or received a penny for what gave them but divided with them my last crust negro abolitionist leaders in upstate new york knew that runaways would be directed to their doors jermain w loguen at syracuse fitted an apartment in his house for these unannounced visitors those who came to rochester made their way to the office of frederick douglass on buffalo street early morning arrivals sitting on the steps until opening time in albany the home of stephen myers was an overnight sanctuary for black dropins on the last leg of their northward journey the buffalo home of william wells brown was a station on the underground railroad brown himself conducting to canada over a period of seven months in in the northeast the best known rendezvous for runaways was the home of lewis hayden in downtown boston hayden himself was a fugitive from kentucky his rescuer calvin fairbank having been arrested and jailed for helping him escape hayden had turned down an earlier opportunity to escape because he could not bring his future wife along with him as if to prove himself worthy of fairbanks sacrifice hayden welcomed fugitives to stop under his roof when the owner of william and ellen craft dr robert collins of macon georgia sent two deputies to reclaim them william took lodging in the hayden dwelling temporarily barricaded for the occasion one day when harriet beecher stowe visited the haydens she was surrounded by escaped slaves upon settling in newport rhode island in george t downing quickly established himself as the friend of any fugitive alighting in that city o o o individual assistance to runaway slaves was supplemented by the work of vigilance committees and here too the black people in the north played a distinctive role a vigilance committee aided the fugitives in a variety of waysboarding and lodging them for a few days purchasing clothing and medicine for them providing them with small sums of money informing them as to their legal rights and giving them legal protection from kidnappers a primary function of the vigilance committee was to help a slave establish himself in a new location to furnish him with letters of introduction to help him find a job and to give him guidance and protection while he was thus engaged in getting started hence a vigilance committee was a combination underground and upperground railroad the latter comprising its efforts to help the slave locate within the united states the time has come to stop running announced jermain w loguen manager of the fugitive aid society of syracuse many of the vigilance committees had a totally or predominantly negro membership the greatest of these negrorun organizations was the new york committee of vigilance founded in november with david ruggles as its secretary and general agent at its monthly meetings the committee listened to speakers like james emerson a seaman who had almost been sold into slavery after accepting work on a ship running to petersburg virginia appearing at committee meetings were speakers like the wife of kidnapped peter john lee her fatherless sons at her side the committee listened to stories of colored children who had been hired as domestics and then carried into the south and sold the committee publicized descriptions of missing negroes and informed its members as to the arrival and departure dates of ships suspected of harboring slaves at one of its meetings three destitute africans were introduced with a t plea for funds to help them return to their native land on one occasion isaac wright told his story of being rescued by an agent of the committee after having been sold into slavery at new orleans by the captain of the newcastle j d wilson it was through the committee that wilson was arrested and detained for the illegal sale of wright and two other negro seamen to attend a meeting of the vigilance committee tended to tear at the heart strings at the annual meeting in at the zion church alvan steward founder in of the new york antislavery society was deeply moved by the strong emotions of gratitude expressed by the fugitives whom the committee had assisted i could submit to become a slave for the privilege of making such a friendship he said to the gathering during its first year the committee protected negroes from slavery and this figure was a sound approximation for each of the succeeding years the committee also won public acceptance of its contention that persons claimed as fugitives should have a trial by jury a measure they had sponsored from their opening meeting much of the success of the new york committee of vigilance could be credited to david ruggles he is a general marion sort of man wrote a contemporary editor for sleepless activity sagacity and talent ruggles personally gave assistance to hundreds of runaways frederick douglass being a typical case ruggles sheltered the young douglass for nearly two weeks made his marriage arrangements and sent the newlyweds to new bedford massachusetts with a fivedollar bill and a letter of introduction to a locally prominent negro nathan johnson ruggles boarded incoming ships to see whether slaves were being smuggled in he went from door to door in fashionable neighborhoods making inquiry as to the status of black domestics new york law freeing any imported slave after a residence of nine months in one instance ruggles went to the brooklyn home of daniel k dodge and brought away a domestic charity walker a former slave negroes in boston and detroit had allnegro vigilance groups although neither had as dramatic a figure as ruggles founded in boston in and lasting for five years the new england freedom association aimed to extend a helping hand to all who may bid adieu to whips and chains it solicited donations of money or clothing for the fugitives and places of residence temporary or permanent for them and advertised in the abolitionist press for persons who would give them jobs two of its seven directors were women founded in the same year as its boston counterpart the colored vigilance committee of detroit was headed first by william lambert and then by george debaptiste in the absence of competing white abolitionist organizations the detroit group maintained an independent existence until the civil war reaching its peak in the midfifties in one twoweek period in the committee gave assistance to freedombound blacks a figure which grew to for the period from may to january cleveland had an allcolored committee of nine of whom four were women which sped slaves to canada from april to january in boston and new york the allnegro vigilance groups were succeeded by racially mixed prototypes in boston in september a committee of vigilance was formed by samuel gridley howe following public indignation over the return of a slave who had secreted himself on a vessel bound from new orleans to boston the committee included robert morris and william c nell along with many prominent white reformers and literary figures ralph waldo emerson sending word that if the economic wellbeing of massachusetts depended upon making boston a slaveport he would willingly forego such prosperity and turn to the mountains to chop wood the boston committee of vigilance performed its most conspicuous services in the early s following the passage of the fugitive slave law new york city was the headquarters of another racially mixed group to assist the runaway slave the new york state vigilance committee founded in with the quaker isaac t hopper as president but with a membership over percent negro the committee assisted fugitives during its first six months in the committee was reorganized with white philanthropist gerritt smith as president and charles b ray as corresponding secretary one of the committees accomplishments during its first year was the instigation of action in the federal courts in nine cases in which a person was held as a slave in a slave state but who nonetheless was entitled to his freedom by the laws of the state from january to april the committee assisted former slaves many of whom received little more than periodic counseling but of whom were freed after being brought into new york city by their reputed masters upstate new york had two interracial slaveassisting organizations although the one in albany might well have been called the myers vigilance committee its guiding spirit stephen myers held few meetings although acting in the name of the committee but myers was able and honest thus muting any criticism at syracuse the abolitionists founded the fugitive aid society with jermain w loguen as its manager engaged in helping runaways since loguen devoted full time to the work beginning in he wrote letters to the local newspapers urging their readers to hire fugitives in their shops and on their farms how many jobs he found for the more than former slaves that passed through his hand each year cannot be known but it earned for syracuse the title of the canada of the united states loguens good work in syracuse was overshadowed only by that of william still in philadelphia the secretary of the general vigilance committee this organization had a predecessor the philadelphia vigilance committee which had a career of six years beginning in this parent group was interracial on paper whites comprising of the members of the first socalled standing committee but the president was robert purvis and the agent executive secretary was another negro jacob c white moreover after the monthly meetings were no longer attended by whites thus making the committee allnegro in its operations and increasingly so in its personnel this committee assisted some fugitives a year its high for one weekthe first week in september running to it dispatched the fugitives to canada or to david ruggles in new york the committee expired in although many of the former members purvis white j j g bias daniel payne and stephen h gloucester among them continued to assist slaves in an individual capacity the successor of this pioneer organization the general vigilance committee was more consistently interracial robert purvis was made chairman of the new organization seven of whose founders were negroes but most importantly black william still was made chairman of the fourmember acting committee thus becoming the executive secretary of the organization and its dominant figure a more resourceful and hardworking operator could hardly have been found the full scope of stills activities may be gleaned from his page work the underground railroad published in in this factcrammed semidocumentary work still produced scores of letters from workers in the field such as joseph c bustill from harrisburg describing the beginnings of the local fugitive aid society still exchanged fruitful letters with such white supporters and colleagues as thomas garrett in wilmington sidney howard gay in new york levi coffin in cincinnati and hiram wilson at st catherines in canada still received scores of letters from fugitives he had helped such as the one john j hill sent from toronto i am as free as your president pearce only i have not been free so long it is true that i have to work very hard for comfort but i am happy happy the general vigilance committee aided hundreds of black bondmen the number running to from december to february but the episode that still was least likely to forget was the delivery of henry brown shipped in a box from richmond to philadelphia by adams express when the shipment reached the antislavery office still one of the four receiving agents pried off the lid whereupon the marvellous resurrection of brown ensued wrote the author of the underground railroad raising up in his box he reached out his hand saying how do you do gentlemen figuratively speaking the concept of black_power and v black history are twins that were fathered by the same his h torical experience this concept was created to counteract jsl an ther concept that the people of african descent had no m history worthy of respect the europeans who started the slave trade and the colonial system that followed needed to propagate this concept in order to justify their action the presentday young black militants are asking in many ways why the word history is so limited when it is applied to their people they are beginning to learn belatedly that history depending on how it is manipulated can be either an instrument of oppression or of liberation in most cases what is called african history is only the history of africas contact with europe beginning with the slave trade what is called negro history is generally the history of american slavery and subsequent effects the europeans who started the slave trade in the fifteenth century had to forgetor pretend to forgetall they had previously known about africas contribution to the development of mankind the presentday black_power and black history advocates are trying to restore what the slave trade and the system of economic oppression took away their fight has long roots and it was not started by stokely carmichael or h rap brown in a formal sense the concept of black_power started in the nineteenth century concurrent with the many attempts to restore black men to an honorable place in history the concept of black_power confuses most people because they are looking for a complicated system black_power means no more or less than the right to determine your own destiny starting with the control of your own communities this is the same thing that every ethnic group in america hasor is trying to get black_power without a respect for black history is meaningless until the essential manhood of a people is respected no power in their hands is effective in a speech made in cuba last year stokely carmichael while addressing himself to the subject black_power and the third world said this since the cry of the rebellions has been black_power in this cry there was an ideology implied which the masses understood instinctively it is because we are powerless that we are oppressed and it is only with power that we can make the decisions governing our lives and our communities black_power is more than a slogan it is a way of looking at our problems and the beginning of a solution because our color has been used as a weapon to oppress us we must use our color as a weapon of liberation this is the same as other people using their nationality as a weapon for their liberation this coming together around our race was an inevitable part of our struggle we recognize however that this is not the totality only the necessary beginning then while emphasizing the need for the cultural restoration of a people he said black_power recognizes that while we are made to feel inferior this is only that we can be easily exploited color and culture were and are key in our oppression therefore our analysis of history and our economic analysis are rooted in these concepts with power we will take our birthjpght because it was with power that our birthright was taken from tis black_power not only addresses itself to exploitation but to the problem of cultural integrity the nineteenth century black militants and some before them were saying essentially the same thing in different ways the fight against the distortion and suppression of the true history of the africans and afroamericans was started long before the civil war by free negroes and escaped slaves who had learned to read and write the backtoafrica idea has been a recurring theme in the lives of black americans for more than a hundred years the thought was strong during the formative years of the colonization society and some of the most outstanding black men of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries came under its persuasion in the middle of the nineteenth century while the issue of slavery was being debated in most of the country the feeling for africa among american blacks was growing stronger publications like freedoms journal and douglass monthly edited by frederick douglass called attention to the plight of the people of africa as well as the black americans as far back as the renowned scholar and benefactor of west africa dr edward wilmot blyden speaking on the occasion of his inauguration as president of liberia college sounded the note for the organized teaching of the culture and civilization of africa and decried the fact that the worlds image of africa was not in keeping with africas true status in world history i quote from his address on this occasion the people generally are not yet prepared to understand their own interests in the great work to be done for themselves and their children we shall be obliged to work for some time to come not only without the popular sympathy we ought to have but with utterly inadequate resources in all englishspeaking countries the mind of the intelligent negro child revolts against the descriptions of the negro given in elementary books geographies travels histories having embraced or at least assented to these falsehoods about himself he concludes that his only hope of rising in the scale of respectable manhood is to strive for what is most unlike himself and most alien to his peculiar tastes and whatever his literary attainments or acquired ability he fancies that he must grind at the mill which is provided for him putting in material furnished by his hands bringing no contribution from his own field and of course nothing comes out but what is put in the great human drama now being called the black revolution in the usa has long historical roots and it cannot be fully understood until it is seen in this context in his book capitalism and slavery dr eric williams places the origin of this revolution in historical perspective and calls attention to its early development when in columbus representing the spanish monarchy discovered the new world he set in train the long and bitter international rivalry over colonial possessions for which after four and a half centuries no solution has yet been found portugal which had initiated the movement of international expansion claimed the new territories on the ground that they fell within the scope of a papal bull of authorizing her to reduce to servitude all infidel people the two powers spain and portugal to avoid controversy sought arbitration and as catholics turned to the pope a natural and logical step in an age when the universal claims of the papacy were still unchallenged by individuals and governments after carefully sifting the rival claims the pope issued in a series of papal bulls which established a line of demarcation bettween the colonial possessions of the states the east went to portugal and the west went to spain though the announcement of the fact came much later the european scramble for africa and subsequently asia and north america started with this act the labor and raw materials of africa asia south america and the west indies financed the european industrial revolution the africans who were brought to the new world against their will were dehumanized and in most cases deculturalized they were neither respected africans nor accepted new world americans they were renamed and became a marginal branch of the human family now referred to as negroes the europeans needed a rationale for their actions and a rationale was created with supporting concepts the crudest concept ever devised by the mind of man was created to support the slave trade and the colonial system that followedthe concept of race and the assumption that there are superior and inferior races the africans were depicted as a people without a history who had never properly handled power and who certainly had made no contribution to the development of human cultures and thus the seeds of the presentday conflict were planted the american federation of teachers conference on racism in education held in washington d c on december and set in motion much of the present action and the debate about black history and how it should be taught in the public schools the noted actor ossie davis addressed the conference on the first day his opening remarks were those of us who are concerned who are caught up who really want to be involved in the revolution must be prepared at this conference to tear aside our most private thoughts and prejudices the tone for the conference had been set for two days more than teachers and educators examined and indicated the american educational system they were told that a curtain of ignorance hangs over the school systems of this nation and that our children are not being i educated to face the realities of this nation and this world cases of deliberate distortion of the role that the black americans have played in the making of this country were pointed out and it was further stated that everyone from professional textbook writers to missionaries had participlated in this distortion ossie davis cited the english language as a basic transmitter of prejudice in his speech entitled the english language is my enemy he said that he counted synonyms for the term blackness in rogets thesaurus half of which were grossly unfavorable davis argued that right from the time a black child learns the english language he learns ways to despise himself and a white child learns ways to aid and abet the crime keith e baird a new york school teacher who followed ossie davis talked about the importance of ethnic identification for afroamericans mr baird who is a teacher of languages spoke of the respected place in history as celebrated in the jewish holiday of hanukkah of the maccabees of biblical times he also pointed out that in the process of ethnic identification not only a persons individual attributes are considered but the cultural identification of this group baird presented to the conference a resolution that he urged it to adopt the wording of which was to say that the slaveryconnected word negro should be abandoned and in its place the words afro or africanamerican be applied to persons of african descent in the united states in all places where such reference to ethnic descent is appropriate at a later conference session concerning resolutions this one was unanimously adopted in his presentation mr baird had defined what the cry for black history is aboutit is about the search for a peoples identity and their need for a new image of themselves the black americans are trying to locate themselves on the map of human geography this explains the growing preference for the words black african and afroamerican these words show how the black americans relate to a land a history and a culture in a number of other conferences sponsored by the local branches of the american federation of teachers and the uft the teachers agreed on plans to implement courses in black history the main conferences were held in detroit may and in chicago march and conferences in denver and st louis followed while many of the white teachers clearly admitted that racism is rampant in the american educational system very few of them had any basic plan concerning what to do about it their reluctance to commit themselves to the correction of this racism caused a lot of black teachers to form separate organizations some within the framework of the american federation of teachers and the uft the chicago black teachers caucus was one in new york city the afroamerican teachers association was another still another organization the conference of afroamerican educators which met in chicago in june shows the best potential of becoming a nationwide force to affect change in the educational system at this conference donald freeman who renamed himself baba lamumba defined education as it relates to black people what we understand by education is the application of all ones knowledge for the benefit of the collective which in turn will benefit each individual within the collective to this end what must constitute a basic part of ones education is the understanding of people rather than things we realize that once people understand themselves their knowledge of things is facilitated that the exclusive knowledge of things does not guarantee knowledge of people and in fact contributes to the erosion disintegration and destruction of the creativity of man therefore education must teach black people who they are teach black people what they are fighting for teach black people who they must identify with teach black people where their loyalty must lie teach black people what must be done teach black people how to do it and teach black people that the destinies of all black people are inseparably linked whether we are in north central or south america the west indies europe asia or africa broadening his explanation mr freeman continued m now there must be a complete unity of all aspects of ones life and in particular education must be indelibly linked with ones life processes for the benefit of each black man and woman and all black people those who have knowledge primarily from books must be linked with those who have knowledge from the streets and vice versa to confront and solve all the problems of black people education must assure that all of what one learns can be and will be applied to concrete practical problems and their solutions if our people can throw molotov cocktails in white stores we can certainly throw molotov cocktails in our minds mathematics physics electronics sociology religion and other sciences must not be viewed as abstractions but comprehended as the concentrated experiences of mans interrelationships with man nature and the universe to mold and control his own destiny it is obvious that the american educational establishment is not ready to correct itself and implement these suggestions that it would consider extreme this would not only be tantamount to correcting itself it would also be tantamount to repudiating itself at the base of the grievance of the black teachers and growing numbers of black people is the fact that they have been educated or miseducated in a system that has yet to acknowledge that they are an integral part of american or western civilization both the clamor for black_power and black history are the clamor of people to enter the mainstream of a society and to institute dynamic social reformor to replace that society the most farreaching reforms will be in the field of education control is the key word in the school situation because it implies power to act in ones best interest at a time and a place of ones choosing the educational establishment could digest or tolerate decentralization because the school system would still be run in the main by the educational establishment which is a force operating outside of the local community when community control is added to decentralization a whole new area of power is defined this means that the community will have the right to hire and fire teachers and to control the massive budget of the school system that is now a major american industry in an address in ann arbor michigan on may dr grace boggs said in effect that the question of black control of the schools has now become a question of survival for all black people urban school systems are disintegrating before their eyes to the point where their actual physical and mental safety are at stake black children and their parents have lost the traditional respect for the teachers and principals of their schools because of the growing alienation between the school and the community the mass media principally television have taught these children to become suspicious of most large establishments especially police forces and governmental agencies that make promises which they do not keep many of the white teachers in the large educational systems in cities like new york detroit philadelphia chicago and los angeles come to the system with preconceived notions about the ability of the black child to learn instead of teaching him they spend a lot of time convincing themselves that the children are unteachable they do not bring their best teaching ability to these communities because they do not respect the children or the community well enough to do so in addition to being poor teachers for the black community these teachers are not even good babysitters in a lot of cases they are arrogant unfulfilled and insecure people long overdue for analysis very often the black child and the black community become whippingboys for their neuroses community control would mean that these teachers can be transferred or fired once their lack of qualifications have been proven there is no attempt to drive all white teachers out of any black community however teachers who fall within the above description will not be secure under any form of community control keith e baird director of the afroamerican history and cultural unit of the board of education gave the following explanation of decentralization and community control at the summer forum at columbia university in august of on the black experience i am going to talk about decentralization in the public schools and its implications i use the term decentralization largely because it is the one that is generally used now most words that begin with this prefix de suggest a kind of fall from grace and i think that discussion about the changes that are being sought in the school system suffer somewhat from this semantic difficulty i rejoice however to see that in this booklet the decentralization means reforming the present school system in new york city into largely autonomous school districts joined with the central education agency into a citywide federation now this is a fairly decent and workable definition but what does it actually mean in terms of the black experience the context in which we have come together to discuss this matter we seem to have two separate questions before us decentralization and community control of course the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive you can have decentralization without having community control and you can have community control without having decentralization now there is no problem about white people controlling the schools because that of course is what has always happened the schools are run by white people the majority of the teachers are white and the people who administer the schools are in great part white thus we have what are essentially white schools reflecting white interests a white selfconcept and white culture the question of community control comes in because certain enclaves certain new ethnic enclaves will now be having greater control or at any rate be in a better position to exercise control over the schools their children go toprovided of course that the rules and regulations of the new york city board of education actually permit this to happen thus we come to what is really the crux of the situation namely the control of schools in afroamerican and puerto rican areas by the afroamerican and puerto rican communities particularly because these communities have not been significantly represented until now at the policymaking level in educational affairs what community control boils down to is simply this are we or are we not going to let black people and puerto rican people really tell teachers what to do especially tell white teachers what to do and so on that is really what this whole thing boils down to and we may as well face up to it because most of decentralization and community control talk in new york city is centered around i s in harlem and ocean hill brownsville in brooklyn it would be well to show the essence of the background of this conflict the crucial issue of the i s controversy is the poor quality of education in ghettos such as harlem from the first through the twelfth grade an increasingly larger proportion of ghetto youth perform below their grade level in reading and math eightyseven percent of the pupils in the harlem school district are below grade level better than twothirds of the pupils drop out before graduation from high school daniel schreiber the former assistant superintendent of district in which i s is located verified these figures the parents of school district were willing to accept the promise of the board of education that integration would help solve the problem of poor education for their children when was proposed as a junior high school as far back as parents objected on the grounds that construction of a school at the proposed site would create another segregated school as late as dr bernard donavan maintained that would be an integrated school he even alluded to having the school related to a university accompanied by special programs by february of daniel schreiber maintained that would be integrated but by this time integrated had come to mean representative groups of black and puerto rican children as early as march community representatives were demanding the establishment of a community group to which teachers would be responsible in addition to the demand for an integrated school parents opposition to the board of educations response or lack of response to these demands canceled the scheduled opening of for the spring term of the school district was gerrymandered without the consultation of the community to create a student body of puerto ricans and negroes integration gives way to quality education by the end of the summer the board of education had to admit that it had no plan for truly integrating i s the parents realizing that the board of education had no intention of integrating the schools of harlem focused attention on the basic problem of improving the quality of education in harlem with the realization that it would in reality have to be segregated there is agreement between the parents and the board of education that the board has failed to integrate the harlem schools there is also agreement between the parents and the board that the quality of education in harlem is low the disagreement lies in the means used to improve the quality of education the parents place the full responsibility of poor education in harlem upon the board of education whose present structure they feel is incapable of providing or administering a quality educational system to meet the needs of the ghetto community the composition of the board how its members are selected and its source of power indicate the distance that exists between the body that makes educational policy and the community for whom the policy is made the ocean hillbrownsville decentralization experiment in brooklyn new york was spoiled by success the local school board consisting mainly of parents from the community took their jobs seriously and asked that a number of teachers who they deemed incompetent be transferred this move seemed to have shocked and angered both the board of education and the head of the united federation of teachers this abrupt exercising of power by the local school board and their unit administrator came unexpectedly the two large black ghettos of brooklyn merge at ocean hill its inhabitants include a growing number of puerto ricans nothing of a dynamic nature was expected of these slumdwellers in september the controversy around i s in harlem had a profound effect on the ocean hillbrownsville school district that month a group of parents in harlem demanded that the board of education respect their right to select the principal for i s these parents were asking for the first time to have a voice in the administration of the schools in their community the contagious cry for community control was now spreading beyond harlem it did not bypass the ocean hillbrownsville school district in brooklyn after some protracted agitation the board of education allowed the people of ocean hill to form an administrative unit with the understanding that the board would relinquish some of its authority to this unit the administrative unit and the local governing board succeeded and began to exercise the authority that the board of education never thought it would use this is the basis of their trouble with the board of education and the united federation of teachers the dispute between the people of ocean hillbrownsville on one side and the board of education and united federation of teachers on the other side might well be a sad indication of what will soon be a national crisis in education the cry for black_power and black history has rekindled a long smoldering fire that will no doubt affect major changes in the educational political and economic structure of the united states late show addicts and the older generation know that hollywood deserves no thanks for its portrayals of black americans in the s what few people know is that the black community tried to produce movies that would make important statements about life in the black world low budgets inadequate distributing facilities lack of experience and low audience potential limited their success but the two decades between the world wars must be granted several achievements the black world revealed by its loyalty to the performers from its ranks that it would support honest depictions of black life the small independent film companies operating chiefly out of abandoned studios in fort lee new jersey and astoria long island gave experience to such laterfamous performers as lena horne and pigmeat markham the movies that they produced gave a number of credible and relevant selfimages to black folk at the same time that the larger white companies in hollywood ignored or demeaned them they gave honest work to actors who needed respite from the unrewarding grind of playing maids and butlers in california and they helped train a generation of independent black entrepeneurs who founded movie houses in southern and other provincial cities where it was all the more important to create positive role models the black filmmakers were not without some aid and comfort from white producers in the years before d w griffiths birth of a nation that infamous yet artistically significant racist view of postcivil war reconstruction negroes appeared in varied roles in american movies in that era when films were usually no more than visually stimulating newsreel items strung together like sausages negroes were photographed by early pioneers such as thomas edison and thomas ince true black people bore more than their share of the stereotyped roles but types were important because without sound there was no surer way to establish character than by exaggerating traits thus canny jews blustering irishmen inscrutable chinese and happy negroes all seemed larger than life yet blacks appeared as soldiers in the spanish american war the philippine campaign world war i and their march up fifth avenue after it ended even in comedy sometimes the black character emerged triumphant in a short onereeler a bucket of cream ale for example a black waitress irritated by her white customers nagging dumps a bucket of ale over his head even in the bad timethe three decades after the enthusiastic reception of birth of a nation black fortunes did not fall to absolute zero one of d w griffiths most successful films was one exciting night a mystery film in which a hero is a black african detective later in king vidor tried to capture the mood and temper of black religion in his artfully done hallelujah blacks also had important roles in s movies which attempted social comment such as frank capras sullivans travels and william wylers beggars of life and in the s the war against fascism provided a reason for black characters to enter the plots of white movies ben carter in crash dive rex ingram in sahara dooley wilson in casablanca canada lee in lifeboat and kenneth spencer in bataan each broke the old stereotype mold in obvious ways there were frequent interracial and even equalitarianroles cheaply made series movies in hal roachs our gang comedies farina and buckwheat the two black characters frequently shared the humor and plot lines with the white members of the gang for a brief while the dead end kids comedies enlisted a black gang member but generally forces combined to deny black folk access to white screens these forces in the white world consisted chiefly of the attitudes of hollywood producers and executives some of whom such as s a lynch and edward kuykendall were southerners they accepted uncritically the notion that there was a monolithic and powerful southern boxoffice that could ruin the revenues of films which broke racial taboos thus in producing films they sacrificed black characters on the altar of the southern mystique which formed the basis of such moneymaking pictures as gone with the wind in the black world also there were ironic forces that helped to deny blacks access to the screen the success of the naacp in throttling distribution of birth of a nation had a feedback effect on producers at the same time as the naacps insistent demands for the censorship of odious racial characterizations the filmmakers concluded that negro protagonists would not sell movies in the south thus they tended to exclude all but the most comic negro charactersthe first major attempt of black men to produce their own films emerged out of the conflict over birth of a nation in failing to prevent the showing of the film in most parts of the country naacp executives agonized over the decision to commit the organizations funds to a propaganda movie but decided to rely on legal actions against birth of a nation on the other hand emmett j scott personal secretary to booker t washington at tuskegee contrived to get a film project off the ground to counteract the ill effects of griffiths picture at first he and washington hoped to merely tack a prologue of negro attainments onto birth of a nation then they turned to a professional writer elaine sterne to write lincolns dream an optimistic prophesy of negro fortunes when universal of hollywood failed to buy the scenario scott decided to raise funds among the black bourgeoisie with whom he had hundreds of contacts through his administration of the national negro business league eventually it took scott over three years to finish a picture the birth of a race an artistic failure yet with striking implications for the future scotts promotion and stock selling campaigns fell on hard times although he tapped the negro community for thousands of dollars to finance the venture but the rigors of producing a lengthy reel film by a new black company shooting in florida and chicago rather than in hollywood proved too great a burden in midcareer the company needed new capital and turned to a white group which denied that the film would be exclusively about black achievement despite the promotional literature which proudly announced for the basis of our photoplay we have chosen a race which has become american through and through it has helped fight our battles clear our land build our cities and worked shoulder to shoulder with all other races ah you guessed it the first time the negro the new backers also denied that there were black owners of the company the checkered history could not help but produce grotesque results the movie that eventually opened at the blackstone in chicago the most fashionable theatre in america proved a flop there were beautiful sets next to shoddy backdrops pacifist themes interspersed with a few shots of blacks mass battle scenes set against cheap stock shots obviously the surviving company had the products of three years work and buried the original theme in a welter of unrelated shots if the movie failed it at least showed the way to succeeding black motion picture producers many of whom continued to be thwarted by lack of capital subsequent producers learned to stick with attainable goals and to maintain some control over white backers and technicians by the late s some estimates placed the number of available ghetto movie houses at as the number of houses increased new companies sprang up ebony film corporation in chicago with j luther pollard at the helm began producing onereel comedies that were parodies of popular stories the first film was a black sherlock holmes later walton the manager of the lafayette in harlem and drama editor of the new york age produced the first of an intended series the brute starring the boxer sam langford for his second feature he tried to get charles gilpin to repeat his stage success in emperor jones gate city film corporation opened in kansas city the first black company in its region madison corey and charles anderson earlier the federal internal revenue collector for the wall street district formed constellation films for the purpose of producing black cinema a year later in the actor leigh whipper formed the renaissance company to produce allnegro newsreels famous artists with white backers in attempted similar movies for showing along the black vaudeville circuits by late the colored players film corporation owned by a black washington impresario opened at tempo studios in philadelphia with an optimistic vision of creating a black hollywood just outside of the capital in dunbar pictures began shooting in the old vitagraph studios in brooklyn and roseland pictures and recording laboratories of new york both announced series of allblack tworeelers in by far the most famous and best of the black silent filmmakers was oscar micheaux who operated from th street his greatest coups was the signing of paul robeson to do body and soul robeson an allamerican football player at the beginning his career in singing and acting needed the work and did a creditable job body and soul was sophisticated for its day yet it went unnoticed outside of the ghetto theatres it was the first successful film with black performers made for a black audience robeson seemed to be playing a dissolute and venal black preacher for the plot line cut back and forth from the two sides of his double life on the one hand as an habitue of a seedy speakeasy with its petty gamblers and crooks and on the other as the preacher attempting to dupe a pious matron into allowing him to marry her daughter the two worlds are symbolized by two photographs hanging from the walls of the two sets in the former a worn cover from a police gazette and on the other a portrait of booker t washington gazing benignly upon the household the denouement comes when the viewer realizes that both roles are the nightmare ramblings of a young girl and robeson is really the opposite of his character strong powerful resolute and perhaps even a detective sent to close the speakeasy thus by the end of the movie black audiences have seen the symbolic emergence of a black character rising from the decadence presumed by whites to the autonomous masculinity demanded by negroes the success of such films and the growing awareness of the emerging ghetto box office receipts led a few whites into the same film market jack goldberg as early as had attempted a documentary on africa during world war i the creel committee performed its propaganda function by releasing our colored fighters and a full onereeler of the th black regiment our hell fighters return distributors raided the vaults of european producers who were less timid about doing themes of blacks and whites in conflict the white hope an english movie about blacks and whites fighting for a championship and a white barbarian which was a tale set amidst an east african tribe ruled by a carthaginian royal line were two such films the germans contributed dark alleys starring the african boxer battling siki josephine baker the coffeecolored rage of paris represented the french with siren of the tropics independent white producers missed the point of the movement through the s few valid black characters could be found in its products the producers assuming that the new market could be served by the old stereotypes octavus roy cohen for example formed birmingham pictures in order to produce movies of his own darkey stories while the ku klux klan muddled through a patriotic movie that was so poorly lighted from having been shot in someones garage that eventually it was abandoned the major hollywood producers despite their more calculated eye for box office receipts made some allblack films and spread rumors of others but they rarely departed from stereotypes many of them simply shot vaudeville acts movie men read in their weekly variety that deforest phonofilm would shoot the club alabam show in its entirety vitaphone did onereelers of noble sissle and eubie blake the three pullman porters the cabin kids ethel waters jules bledsoe singing spirituals and buck and bubbles as two northern blacks who ride south only to find not soul brothers but snobbish black servants who look down on them as crass yankee town negroes a few of the white companies made distinguished movies pool films with kenneth macpherson directing made borderline on location in switzerland with paul and eslanda robeson and the poet hilda doolittle as stars dudley murphy directed bessie smith in st louis blues a superb tworeel vignette and king vidor directed an inconsistent hallelujah with many sensitive portrayals of southern black life unfortunately interspersed with stereotyping so broad as to evoke unintended laughter from harlem audiences by the end of the silent film era the black community especially in new york had become conscious of its own box office potential and critical of both black and white movies in one year three new houses in chicago alone added new seats black managers and owners took over theaters in the ghettos from chicago to arkansas while a variety editorial speculated that black theaters would rush to wire for sound because they were the only market in america that could make profit with both black and white movies black vaudeville circuits had stabilized enough to provide regular bookings for movies even in the south and in the exciting time of flux critics such as theophilus lewis of the tatler demanded better acting from the black companies the first allblack sound film was oscar micheaux the exile financed by frank schiffman the white manager of the lafayette theatre in harlem it revealed both the virtues and the needs of black filmmaking even though no white man appeared on the screen the plot still moved on white terms a black girl comes into possession of a mansion which he turns into a cabaretbrothel her fiance learning of her decision abandons the city for a farm in south dakota where he meets a white girl who is the soul of puritan virtue at the end of the movie they can marry because the hero learns that the white girl is really a negro in varietys opinion only donald hey woods jazz combo livened the essentially dull picture everything seemed to be wrong the tedious story suggested that to be lightskinned was to be virtuous the sound track was only partically dialog the rest of it being synchronized music the harlem audiences giggled in the wrong places at the absurd plot variety analyzing the film from the point of view of box office returns concluded that the black companies should make only comedies for a while at least until budgets allowed them to use better equipment and to get out of the old studios such as metro in fort lee where the exile was shot probably another important factor was that the trained actors unwittingly made the patois of some of the amateurs seem out of place and awkward a year later in two other movies were more ambitious southland a black company in fort lee produced the black king a potentially important social drama about the leader of a backtoafrica movement led by a charlatan preacher it was ruined by the same weaknesses that undermined the exile so that the statements that might have been dealt with such as the division of black loyalties between america and africa the place of the church in the black world and the mean iqg of the stillremembered garvey s movement were lost in the laughter at a comic ending that sees the protagonists scampering back to mississippi dressed as hoboes however lincoln films harlem is heaven starring bill robinson with a budget of under m proved what could be done robinsons long experience helped the thin plot bridge the gaps between his songanddance numbers harlem is heaven made in its first week in harlem a striking figure for a neighborhood house despite the jagged editing which was inevitable in a quickie movie it was clearly so good that it got successful bookings in the ghettos of baltimore washington pittsburgh chicago and smaller towns in between such gems as robinsons harlem is heaven many other allblack pictures ran in the ghettos their sole virtue the power of being black drums ovoodoo a louis weiss allblack production suffered from the usual low budgets and inconsistent acting but it was one of the few movies of the s that depicted black voodoo and christianity as being on the same side against evil a popularization of a historically accurate syncretism of west v african religions and roman catholicism some of these movies simply depicted the old racial stereotypes which harlem and south side auj diences seemed able to enjoy without resentment in the privacy of a ghetto theater one such film was eddie rochester andersons comic eyerolling fear as expressed in jed buells lucky ghost another variant on criminal typing occurred in ralph coopers dark manhattan a gangster movie which acted out the ritual of good versus evil with the conflict centered on two rival mobs fightingm over control of the numbers game in harlem however without the presence of police in the allblack film the audience was left with the image of blacks as crooks but with no counter image of black cops the only documentary film of consequence came from lincoln productions although the whites alan bunce and robert rossen contributed narration and script the unknown soldier speaks was an intensely emotional film which strung together war newsreels showing the black mans contribution to the american effort in the world war the unifying device was the ethereal voice of the unknown soldier who describes the heroism of black soldiers despite the survival of ghetto movies by the mids variety began to report the end of the era all major studios are planning films to include colored performers predicted a story about green pastures former fears of southern box office losses began to disappear when some executives saw that the losses might be made up in the overseas market where paul robeson had carved out a career making borderline big fella solomons mines proud valley jericho and other movies the most striking instance of white awakening to the box office power of black themes was the emperor jones with robeson in the title role which did surprising business and helped persuade hollywood to reexamine its racial policies shot on a low budget in astoria long island the picture grossed an amazing in one harlem week but even more astonishing was the it made in washington dc where distributors had predicted failure because of white apathy and black resentment of the term nigger nevertheless despite the success of such s independent productions as the emperor jones and of major hollywood productions such as green pastures with its ambivalent combination of fineedged characterizations and stock types variety in its new yorks anniversary issue for summed up what seemed to be the most remarkable new phenomenon on the cinema scene with the headline story negro and yiddish film boom the story revealed how the major companies watched such trends by black independents as trial balloons before investing their own swollen overhead and budgets in what might have been merely a transitory fad thus the prosperity of independent black companies was often only the storm warning before being swamped by a wave of major company imitations despite such a shift in white attention the black independents managed one last wave of pictures in sackamuse contributed two gun man from harlem a quickie designed for distribution in the southwest while grand national released spirit of youth a boxing romance that could not overcome the wooden acting of joe louis despite the presence of clarence muse and mantan moreland jed buells associated pictures f contributed harlem on the prairie a low budget comic western which variety considered valuable to both white and black film markets lena horne made her movie debut with ralph cooper in million dollar pictures the duke is tops which failed to overcome its slow build toward a series of excellent vaudeville production numbers a year later louise beavers gave her professional touch to million dollars reform school an argument in favor of boys schools based on the honor system the harlem tuff kids lent comic touches to a social drama the early s witnessed jack goldbergs jubilee productions attempted allblack version of othello both the older and new companies kept up a stream of gangster pictures but other kinds of films continued to emerge the bryant company did a semidocumentary of george washington carver in which the old argronomist played himself surrounded by a cast of tuskegee students dixie national with jed buell directing finished mr washington goes to town a kind of black grand hotel which variety predicted would be a healthy grosser all american news released weekly topical newsreels about the black world and the war but the best of the last wave of black productions was million dollars one dark night directed by a sensitive white man leo c popkin variety as usual found the acting of the lesser players wanting and the techniques weak because of the low budget but more important mantan moreland turned in another performance which departed from his white movie typecasting the plot concerns the brown familya negro version of the andy hardy family whose eternally jobless father provides the motive for a matriarchal family unit but once one of many schemes pays out he assumes a patriarchal role and in the accepted middle class manner saves his daughters honor from the villain thus the film realistically suggests unemployment as a casual factor in black family structure the reviewer found it far more entertaining than many hollywood bs low budget pictures and with tighter editing a possible box office success in white houses but the small independent companies in the market of black movies were finally defeated by hollywoods drift toward their territory the s audiences saw such major hollywood productions as lena horne and bill robinson in stormy weather a musical treatment of the black soldier in world war i ethel waters in cabin in the sky and gjon milis evocative jammin the blues in addition importers continued to fill big city houses with robesons english movies such as michael balcons proud valley the story of a black miner who is accepted by and sacrifices his life for a village of welsh miners the united states department of agriculture contributed henry brown farmer with canada lee narrating a story of the negros

social problems rather than people there were four i of us children nori man thirdchild jy lory secondchild k davey firstchild and me and of course there was moma moma was a thin hardworking domestic worker with facial squints and frowns that made her seem forever pondering difficult questions her hair was windblown suggesting the woman of perpetual motion she was her hands were thick and severely chapped from long and persistent exposure to disinfectants and detergents and her palms were hard with calluses from having gripped too many electricirons and scrub buckets in the domestic service her grip was strong and while she was a gentle woman she sometimes held our hands too tight when she guided us across a street looking at moma now moving beneath the slogan twenty dollars and consideration which davey printed and hung in the dining room moma surrounded with platters of pigsfeet chitterlings chicken heaped a mountainhigh with potato salad coleslaw ready for sale the proceeds to be donated for the betterment of the lot of general maids and chambermaids so overwhelmingly represented here moma weaving around them greeting them her hair combed severely from her face and pinned at the back of her head in a modest bun severity being required to control it looking at moma now i am a child again looking at moma now and thinking of moma as she was i again see the four of us wideeyed children on holiday running to keep abreast of her quick direct steps she turning now and then to see if we were following and calling hurry children and stepping into the race again the wind lifting her hair sometimes laying it down again sometimes not and moma not minding either way we began our journey imagining the mountains and rivers we would crossalthough we never saw any mountains and the only river we crossed was the schuylkilland we expressed so much enthusiasm that moma had to restrain us almost we ran ahead of her and back again and ahead until we met the crosswalk felt the gnawing urge to race across the street exerting our urge with leaps and yells until moma stood beside us and guided us across the street her large warm hand engulfed ours and our hands explored the warm hard roughness with insatiable curiosity sometimes we giggled we said her hands tickled she said ours would tickle too if we worked as hard as she did the best recreation moma could afford was a train or bus ride into the shopping center where we looked in the store windows or savored frankfurters with mustard and root beer in the fiveanddime then home again w sunday was another special day moma polished our shoes dressed us in our sunday clothes and sent norman and davey next door so that mr cunningham our neigh w w bor could tie their ties then moma dressed herself and asked us girls if she looked presentable and we went to church old and young women smiled at us and at moma and remarked to her that we were wellbehaved some of them said moma looked as young as we and of course moma was proud to hear that moma confided that she was thirtyfive and we children began to notice how long moma remained thirtyfive the neighbors said that moma took excellent care of us and that she had taught us good manners moma replying that she did the best she could moma was proud of us and proud that she was managing to care for us after popa died now and then we could see a moment of sadness pass over momas face when she sat alone in the living room where she and popa used to sit where popa died of a heart attack the living room was filled with apprehension the day moma called us together in the urgent way she had when she had something important to tell us or when she was going to reprimand us the insurance money she received after popa died was almost gone she had to find a jobperhaps housecleaning because it was the only way she knew to earn a living her finding a job meant that we would not see her as much as we used to that we should not feel abandoned or neglected she would make us her little helpers maryellen could do the errands at the neighboring stores norman could scrape the dishes and discard the scraps lory would wash the dishes and prepare our breakfast of cereal and milk and davey would take his wagon to the supermarket and earn money by carrying the ladies groceries home things would be difficult for a while but if grandmoma was able to manage a houseful of children moma could manage a house of four moma worked long hours scrubbing floors washing and ironing clothes she even washed walls and windows evenings she returned from work tired and cross scolded us for having used too much milk or too much sugar or for burning too many lights we were not allowed to have lights in any part of the house other than where we were at the time we could not watch more than two television shows an evening she scolded us for running too much water letting water run down the drain when no one was using it was a waste moma said we watched moma with bewilderment and sometimes tears in the backs of our eyes as she changed to a person we no longer knew one evening after having discovered that each of us had eaten an apple reserved for the next days lunch moma scolded us so severely that suddenly the four of us at once began to cry all the tears we had restrained so long moma was taken aback children she said children and we buried our heads in the folds of her clothing children look at moma let her see those big pretty eyes she pried our hands from her body and embraced us sit down children moma wants to explain something to you you want to hear it don you we nodded and slid rthe sofa and listened to her explain that she worked hard that sometimes bad things happened at work that made her cross she said that she loved us and tucked us happy into bed nights when she thought we were asleep moma sat telling mr cunningham how humiliated some of the women made her feel they planted silver dollars and quarters around the floors moma said to see if she would steal them one woman planted so many quarters around the floors that moma left a note describing the places where the quarters lay and said she hadnt dared to move them and that since she couldnt move them she wasnt able to clean sufficiently she told mr cunningham that the women should have been more daring with their moneyplanting and dropped some dollar bills something that would have done poor folks some real good had they been tempted they seldom gave moma enough to eat one of the women used to fill her refrigerator with steaks hams and every kind of meat poor folks forgot existed moma said but all she could give moma was a cheese sandwich and a cup of tea moma said that at the weeks end the woman had meat left over and spoiling the woman didnt want to throw it away so she wrapped it up and gave it to moma moma said she thanked her for it and when she left the house she threw it away being rich should make vou feel good moma said but she wasnt going to get sick from rich folks bad meat moma took some chitterlings the next time she went to work there whats that olivia the woman asked chitterlings chitterlings for my lunch but i give you lunch its not like im used to eating whats this chitterlings oh its the part of the pig nobody else will eat so they sell it to the poor folks moma said the woman didnt say another word but stared at her with a strange smile on her face like she was paralyzed then there was the woman who reserved a set of cracked plates for moma to eat from moma ate in the kitchen while the family ate together in the dining room moma said the deepest hurt came when she saw the dog eating from the same plate reserved for her we whispered among ourselves the hope that moma would stop working altogether and come home forever but we knew that there would be no money even though davey earned as much as twenty dollars a week carrying groceries at the supermarket moma worked for a woman who was sick with an incurable disease she didnt know what it was but she tolerated the womans ill temper because of her condition and because she felt sorry for her but she cursed moma one day and moma said her throat became so filled up that she couldnt say a word but stared at the woman hot tears running down her face and she must have looked pitiful because the woman apologizedthe first time moma said that she had acted humanly towards her but it was too late moma finished the days work and never returned miss olivia we heard mr cunningham say you can put an end to all of this you knowyou wouldnt have to work if youd marry me and the children would have a father but moma said mr cunninghammr cunningham and we imagined moma patting mr cunningham on the hand in a gesture of appreciation which she could not otherwise express mr cunningham was a nice man he repaired leaking pipes unclogged the plumbing tended the cracked plaster replaced electric fuses or cut norman and daveys hair and refused to accept money so moma invited him to sunday dinner mr cunningham was a big conscientious goodlooking bachelor he had white hair that he said he poured white shoe polish on he smoked lots of cigarettes and had a foggy laugh that sounded as if the smoke had collected in his throat and he had laugh wrinkles he coughed a lot and moma said he smoked too much moma spoke of mr cunningham with pride and respect and wondered why he never married she guessed he never married because he spent half of his life in the united states army i loved to stand and look at mr cunninghams white hair and to watch the wrinkles around his eyes deepen and spread when he laughed he laughed all of the time as if he enjoyed laughing moma admonished me for staring but mr cunningham laughed and took me onto his knee pressed my cheeks to his so that i heard the rattles of laughter in his throat and giggled that girls got a funnybone lets shake it up and he lifted me into the air shook me gently and put me down maryellen im going to marry you when you get just a little older when will i be older lets seetomorrow nooo the next day hmm i giggled and ran into the kitchen to tell moma what mr cunningham said davey he yelled come here man to man he flexed his arms and sent a mock blow to daveys jaw davey aimed for his stomach good man mr cunninghams light aim to daveys stomach caught him by surprise aw davey i praised you for a good defense so what did you do you dropped your guard spare the rug called moma its got to last a while yet wheres that scholarly younger brother of yours norman where you hiding out im here mr cunningham well come out of there and lets see those fists with spirit man now see if you can hit me hard man boys moma said the rug there was new excitement in our house when the doctor suggested that davey and norman be circumcised moma made arrangements to send them to the hospital mr cunningham cut their hair and put sweetsmelling lotion on it moma dressed them in their best clothes and packed a suitcase of pajamas and clothes and funny books lory and i were envious because of the fun and ice cream and cake davey and norman would be eating moma always gave us ice cream when we had to stay in bed and they didnt try to make us any less jealous we asked moma why we could not be circumcised too of course the reason being that we wanted ice cream and cake too she said nothing for a moment then she said it was a long story that took a lot of time to tell and promised us that our brothers would be home in a few days mr cunningham carried the suitcases and davey and norman followed like two boys going on holiday christmas time arrived wearing an unbuttoned winter coat over a cotton house dress moma set out against the wind and frost often forgetting to powder her face and neglecting her hair she never protected her head against the weather not even against the march wind which she said thinned the hair and her face was a taut expression of perplexity where has the time gone she sighed revealing large hands reddened by the stinging wind as she wearily set a large bag on the table only a few months ago it was summer time flies she sat upon the sofa and slowly pulled off her coat bring moma a basin of hot waterand the salt these feet have done some walking today davey went to get the water while lory norman and i stood watching moma pull off her stockings and rub her feet with her hands moma had the funniest looking toes they were thick short and arched and looked as if she had been in the habit of wearing shoes too tight for her feet tonight is christmas eve moma i said obeying a compulsion to touch one of her toes yes children tonight is christmas eve mr cunningham will be along with the tree soon and before momas children go to bed they can hang a ball or two on the tree we jumped up and down each of us shouting something children momas ears moma davey said setting the basin of water beneath momas feet why dont you and mr cunningham get married married moma said startled what do you know about married where did you hear that just marrieddavey mumbled ashamed of having suggested it dont be ashamed son mr cunningham is a nice man hes good to the children but it wouldnt be fair it would be taking advantage if the children were oldermarried my boys got a new word in his vocabulary moma said easing her feet into the warm water christmas morning we scampered downstairs to open presents mr cunningham stood hands in his pockets smiling as we eagerly ripped the wrappings from our gifts of model airplanes and guns and sewing kits and bingo sets from mr cunningham and we ripped the ribbons from corduroy pants and wool sweaters wool jumpers blouses socks candy from moma i hope you children will take good care of your new clothes moma worked hard with the help of the good lord well manage if we take care she held up a package and squinted an eye i dont remember wrapping this one she turned the label over until she saw to moma printed on the label by lorys hand she opened the package and made such contortions of her face that we were frightened she looked from one to the other of us tears racing down her face the childrens first christmas present to their moma a pair of rubber gloves and sweetsmelling hand cream come here children sniffing away her tears she put her arms around all of us at once dont cry moma davey begged and nearly cried too momas not crying children momas just happy put some on your hands moma not now children lets save it to put under the tree until after christmas all right children we nodded our heads and replacing the bottle and rubber gloves under the tree she embraced us again while mr cunningham stood watching and chuckling with the same pride our father would have shown we had moma all to ourselves most sundays she shopped for food saturday evenings and davey brought it home in the wagon she lengthened the hems of lorys and my dresses and lengthened norman and daveys pants cuffs exclaiming that we grew taller every week when lory outgrew her clothing they were passed to me and davey passed his to norman once moma could not afford to buy a pair of shoes for me so she let me wear a pair of lorys to school until she could do better they were too large and too wide for me and it was obvious to anyone looking at them that they were not mine i remember children stared at me as i stood in the line outside a class room they whispered i tried to tuck my feet under me so that they could not see but i knew that it was impossible to hide i wanted to die right there or to disappear through the floor a girl stepped out of the opposite line whose shoes you got theyre too big for you oh no i said my feet are just large for my size she stared at me and at my shoes for a while without saying anything i wished she would laugh and get it over with but she said my sisters feet are large too mother said she thinks she stopped growing so that her feet could grow and her shoes are so expensive are your shoes expensive too then the line she was in started moving and i didnt have to answer to help moma i began collecting empty perfume bottles and hiding them among my playthings when i thought i had enough i began filling them with water and a drop of momas perfume i was going to earn lots of money for moma so that she could afford to buy things and stay home i put the bottles into normans wagon and transported them to the corner drugstore where i lined them on a ledge outside the window and hung a sign with the price of five cents written on it hold out your wrist i said to the first lady i saw what you selling little girl hold out your wrist oh perfume she said and raised her eyebrows whats the name of your perfume no name its brandnew i rubbed the liquid on her wrist smells awfully good she said it costs five cents ill tell you what little girl ill pay you a nickel now and if you have any perfume left when i come back ill take one home she patted me on the head and continued her walk a neighbor stopped does your mother know youre out here trying to sell that maryellen what is it perfume i said timidly perfume sniffing it it has no scent where did you get it i made it come along your mother wouldnt allow this she said leading me home maryellen moma said in a horrified voice your moma never taught you to do anything like that why did you do it i dont know you dont know momas going to have to punish you maybe then shell get some reason out of you dont moma teach you not to beg yes moma then why on this earth did you do it stop wringing your hands and talk to moma i dont know i said crying you should have cried before you did it now ill have to send you to bed without your dinner i did it for you i cried and threw my arms around her burying my face in her apron moma lifted my head and stared at me go dry your eyes you wouldnt want mr cunningham to see his big girl with wet eyes would you and she held me so tight that it frightened me now go she said it was our daily game to see which one of us would be the first to recognize momas footsteps upon the pavement outside when she climbed the stairs her footsteps sounded like the labored footsteps of a person bearing a heavy burden we rushed to the door happy to have her home each of us trying to be the first to take hold of her carryall and to pick up her discarded shoes her hair was ruffled and her breathing quick she gave us the usual startled look children she said as if she was seeing us for the first time and barefooted she walked to the sofa sat heavily upon it sighed looked around the room and back to us how are the children finish your school work and before we could answer she said lory fix momas salt water so she can soak her feet hurry momas feet are about to kill her its a sure sign that were in for some rainy weather moma got all kinds of signs she knew when we were going to have a visitor and whether it would be a man or a woman depending upon whether the left or right side of her nose itched she had even gotten a sign that papa was going to die the picture of him that hung on the wall just fell one night moma said the nail was still securely in the wall and the wire was not broken from the frame she rehung it and it fell again moma said i was born with a veil over my face and that i used to see things she couldnt see that grandmoma and grandpopa had special vision too grandpopa could neither read nor write but he could open the newspaper and turn to the horse betting section and predict the winner and he could drive a car anywhere and never had had an accident and grandmoma could tell when we did something wrong she didnt have to see us do it shed just get the belt and of course she had to catch us first we stood near moma and stared wondering how she could tell that it was going to rain lory looped an arm through momas while davey norman and i sought to touch an equal part of her did you work hard today moma we asked and waited for her to reveal strange tales no harder than usual children davey give momas back a little rub my my my boy is getting stronger and stronger every minute thats too strong now son youll rub the skin from momas backgentle gentle thats the boy bring moma a cup of coffee norman that new woman i worked for today is as stingy as a cipher you would think coffee was rationed lory set down the basin of salt and water and moma eased her feet into the water children does that feel good she wiggled her toes in the water we laughed and she wiggled them again just to make us laugh what did the children do today nothing we answered more interested in what had happened to her during the day well you must have done something ill start with you maryellen give moma a full account of what she missed today we were watching television one evening when norman rushed into the living room and told us that moma had come to stealing you never saw so much toothpaste it tastes like thousands of flavors where asked davey in the medicine closetall kinds of sweetsmelling soap too we ran upstairs to taste the toothpaste lory opened the jar and we stuck a finger into it it tastes good enough to eat we vigorously brushed our teeth stopping only to plunge our brushes into the jar or toothpaste and to marvel at its abundance it tasted delicious and we were glad that we would not have to use bak ing soda to wash our teeth any more we smelled the fragments of soap rubbed them together in our hands and let the water run into our hands and vigorously rubbed our hands together to the most exciting bubbles where do you think moma got this i asked oh from those rich people they use a different piece of soap every day every day thats wasting so moma didnt steal it cant you see these are left overs it would only be wasted they never use all of the toothpaste from the tube they use it two or three times and they throw it away wow we wont have to brush our teeth with baking soda its so scratchyand we wont have to bathe with that brown soap any more its not good for the complexion moma said its more economical lets take a bath davey suggested we got into a tub nearly overflowing with water and had the most delicious bath in a tub filled with miraculous bubbles like wed never seen moma came home in the evening and shouted to us to turn off the television and come upstairs each of us reluctant to be the first to mount where are you moma one of us called knowing full well that she was standing in the bathroom door her hair stood wildly over her head and her face was stern here whats the matter moma stand tall she said staring at the guilt on our faces what ducks have been splashing in here pointing to the puddles on the floor and the mirror streaked with toothpaste and water is this the way you behave when momas away we stood like criminals in a lineup our chins practically in our chests now i want all of you to get busy and clean this room in record time she commanded and left the room time pushed on bringing many changes moma worked sundays serving dinners little by little she was able to get things for the house she had not been able to get before davey norman and mr cunningham laid new tile in the kitchen and painted the interior of the house norman and davey had grown very tall and muscular and moma did not go into the bathroom when they were bathing any more and lory was acting strange one day she called moma into our room with what seemed like hysteria and moma didnt ask her what the matter was but embraced her and in a comforting voice whispered that it was all right and told me to go downstairs for a few days afterward moma treated lory in a special way as if there was something between them that the rest of us could not share often during the day she called lory upstairs or questioned her in a manner that we could not understand and then the day came when i awoke started to get out of bed sat rigidly on the side and said lory my voice quivering and she said dont tell me tell moma with knowing indifference and i yelled for moma with all my strength i baffled that woman i worked for today moma said one day not long ago easing her feet into the basin of salt and water she was chuckling and in the best spirits we had seen in a long time she even looked younger the woman gave me the upstairs to clean and i finished before noon i told her i was finished before she expected me to be finished and she just gaped at me you finished the whole upstairsthe baseboard beds everything she asked me i said yes and she asked me if that included the windows i said i didnt wash windows any more that that was a mans job but i said i could do it this time if she was pressed for labor for twentydollars and carfare i didnt know i was going to say it children but you know i felt so good afterwards if they cant stand cleaning their own houses they ought to be willing to pay the price for somebody else to clean it a woman should keep her own housewell children she brought out a big bundle of ironingclothes from last year and the year before she didnt want to pay twentydollars for washing the windows but she was going to keep me busy for the rest of the daywhether id finished what i came to do or not did she really give you clothes from last years wash moma almost that much children almost moma smiled rocking her body back and forth because of the throbbing in her toes i finished the ironing by three oclock and she was beside herself she said i was supposed to work until six she found some silver and told me to fill the salt and pepper shakers until she could find something else for me to do she came back with a defeated look and said she guessed that was all and fumbled with the zipper on her purse you ever noticed that rich people have zippers on their purses and the poor people have snaps on theirs moma said laughing moma davey said laughing its mostly true moma said well she counted out twentydollars and handed them to me as if i was a poor relative asking for charity youre getting so independent she said so i said my children are growing up ones going to be a doctor and the others going to be a nurse really she said and children i dont think she believed that it would be possible she told her neighbors that i was charging twenty dollars and carfare and that i refused to wash windows before i knew anything maizie was congratulating me for my gumption and saying we ought to organize soon you wont have to work at all moma davey said my children grown up already right out of momas sight and theyre working good jobs ive got an accountant a secretary and im going to have a doctor and a nurse they dont have to scrub floors moma made certain of that where have the years gone children its a sure sign you and your signs moma she looked from one to the other of us smiling and nodding momas never wrong rub momas back will you baby moma sniffing the aroma of chitterlings flowing through the house smells good dont it children its going to be some benefit dinner moma let me style your hair and manicure your nails make you a glamorous maid theres nothing glamorous about being a maid but very soon children were going to give it a little dignity just look a little glamorous never mind id just as soon remain moma let me do it please moma let her moma tonights a special night itll be like introducing you to society if society asks why you are so late arriving you can explain you had a lot of making up to do brilliant davey thank you lory this is only a sample of my brilliance how about printing a sign that says twenty dollars and consideration thatll be good children the girls will like that moma lifted a foot out of the basin and began drying it with a towel momas got some bad feet but theyre the only ones i have so i shouldnt complain too much remembering moma then and looking at moma now gallantly pressing those feet into action stopping of a sudden to rearrange her toes in her shoes i can still hear her asking does moma look presentable is the hair combed too severely from my face and looking into the mirror and patting her hair and smoothing her dress baby i dont like this red on my lipstoo gaudy moma now darting here and there replenishing paper plates with chitterlings pigsfeet potato salad dont be bashful buy two and three plates and help the cause twenty dollars and consideration were poor and we have to work but we want to be treated human moma is saying and she never stops scooping up the chitterlings twenty dollars and consideration from someone in the room with a side order of chitterlings mr cunningham as handsome as ever and never letting moma out of his sight pushing a forkful of chitterlings into his mouth moma now and the four of us children looking back in our concerted memories looking on with concerted hope everything south of canada malcolm_x once said is prison and knowing what we do about canada we may even include canada however the physical reality of prison as opposed to the mental detention we all suffer from has not been totally negative to black people beginning with malcolm_x we find a number of negroes who graduated from that institution of black artists among them etheridge knight eldridge cleaverand now we are blessed with calvin c heard author of howard street dial in reading black rage the section on education gave us an insight into the meaning of time school is pitting black time against the white time we all must face sooner or later drs william grier and price cobb say our black men purchase black women time by sending us to school and putting themselves on the firing line prison is a black mans school it is the time he has nothing more to worry about than the guards and poor facilities which can easily be compared with the police and poor facilities of the outsidewith the added component that in prison he is completely dependent which is not speaking on the need for imprisonment or to indicate in any way that it is a desirable state but only to relate to the fact that in a state of complete dependence ie having no responsibility for physical well being the black man can relax and deal with his mental and emotional needs in this context we would not think it at all unfair to compare four years at fisk with two at the new jersey state prison and though we took different trails we all have ended at the same state and this time a main stop and not some little way station howard street nathan heards first novel is a masterpiece for a single work we would compare it to the flagellants which we compared to many thousands gone which we link to invisible man and on into classic black literature for just the sheer technical skill and black understanding he brings us in the book nathan heard not only knows but also loves every one of his characters and he doesnt waste himself or our time trying to justify it perhaps we mention this because our middleclass approximations require that he indeed should judge them and justify his love but through howard street we find that all black people are beyond judgment heard simply says we aretake it or leave it and he isnt belligerent about it angry yes who could help but be able to place responsibility for there can be no blame without a judgment most definitely but it doesnt matter what the white man thinks or what we think or even what nathan heard thinks about hip gypsy pearl or franchot because the only reality is how they feel and how they relate to that feelingand we can look or not like or not it has essentially nothing to do with their lives anyway amoral we would simply think a new morality how can any of us dare to judge hip franchots junkie brother on the old terms as hip so ably defends himself from rosemary i aint bothering nobody i aint no cop and i aint no soldier i dont build no bombs and i dont fly no planes to drop none i aint no redblooded american trying my damnedest to spill the red blood of other countries and i aint responsible for none of the mess in the world sure i make an illegal dollar here and there and i dont follow no christian ethic but then i dont claim none yall hypocrites cant say as much can you no we cant we all play a gross game that they at least hip and gypsy pearl the best prostitute on howard street have moved beyond take it or not theyre real we run around trying to win fame and fortune while decrying other folks for achieving some degree of it we largely suspect some lean hungry young people are coming to lunch whenever the counter is openedwearing brooks brothers danshikis carrying the latest pronouncements from an intellectual who probably thought w e b du bois was french and decided not to deal with him we all hope for a star that we may be the ones to shoot it down we hate our mothers for being strong and our fathers for being weak we sit in graduate school hating undergraduates for having faith and envying professors for their degrees we are discontented because we have not allowed ourselves to be who we are and as close to what we want to be as we can we are more afraid of being laughed at and losing our cool than we are of innovating and discovering our warmth we are afraid to love because we are afraid to hate we are loathe to hope because our fear may consume us we shout no war cries because we sing no love songs we sit in the shadows in our sunglasses firmly convinced that black is beautiful but how will we know unless we come naked into the sun we are afraid to feel because to feel is life and to live is to kill we dont want to kill but to kill is love and to love is our national manhood and our natural birthright when hip breaks the capsule and shoots up he is killing for all times or at least until he comes down the worldmost especially the hypocrites when gypsy pearl goes out for hip shes doing what every school teacher or social worker does for her husbandmanworking to help them both meet another day its so easy to condemn a prostitute for selling her body but who doesnt what is it but prostitution when we sit somewhere for eight hours a day and make the proper responses to people and things that have no meaning for us we are placing ourselves at the hands of the same whoremonger as she only she has the whoremongers disdain while we have his praise and of the two we are the most likely to contract his social diseases hip and franchot had a beautiful relationship hip accepted franchot holding a straight job while franchot accepted hips illegalism each offered the other what he hadto be accepted or not sartre or one of those people would call that existentialism we call it love rosemary franchots girl was the only one unwilling to give and take in that manner rosemary didnt want gypsy pearls in franchots house because she thought the competition would be too stiff rosemary attempts to make hip jealous but hip only offers rosemary the same position in his life as gypsy pearl now occupies rosemary got insulted and complained to franchot that hip propositioned her did you accept it he asked no well then dont worry about it rosemary thinks franchot doesnt understand but he understands all too well that after a certain point we are responsible for what we are no man as he points out can put a woman on the block if she doesnt want to turn out and howard street is peopled with memorable characters who have turned out many times jackie the one who almost made it off the street gets philosophical and explains you cant make it on the street until you learn to say i dont want to hear that st and little jimmie who adores jackiebut in his adoration never saw jackie but only the glory then the degradation never the strength never the love miss it and miss thing were delightful if transvestites can be delightful cowboy mcnair emma dee and all the people who are in the final analysis just people trying to fill as many of their needs as possible wed like to say it but in light of how it affected us we ask instead please read it nathan heard has given us another look at the whole scene lets take it now so that we can be ready nikki giovanni the major difficulty with the negro almanac published more than a year ago by bellwether publishing company in new york is the price the big plus page book retails for which puts it out of the hands of most potential consumers and even of some community libraries it is a pity the book is very nearly what its jacket blurb claims an indispensable reference work for home school office the market is being deluged just now with books dealing with various aspects of black life and history and many of them are very much worthwhile but few of them manage to bring together within the covers of a single volume so much useful information much of this information is backed up with maps and charts there is an extensive selected bibliography and there is a rather comprehensive index nevertheless there also are many glaring errors of omission some misinformation and misplaced emphasis the two gentlemen responsible for compiling and editing the negro almanac are dr harry a ploski and dr roscoe c brown jr both of the faculty of new york university on the evidence of the book drs ploski and brown need considerable exposure to what has been happening in the past decade their selections of who and what is of significance suggests that they dwell in an era other than the revolutionary age of the sixties for example neither kristin hunter nor ronald fair is listed among the negroes in literature although both authors had produced two important novels at the time the book went to press and leroi jones and william melvin kelley are the only two under authors in the ploskibrown list excepting a supplementary list of other negro literary figures which does include such younger poets as julia fields and clarence major the lists of national negro organizations and famous negro personalities also are highly selective with emphasis on the donetodeath people lou rawls is not even mentioned among the performing artists in the entertainment department the editors chose photographs as though they were doing a special issue of fan magazine too much gloss and space in the section on the negro press the editors somehow managed even to omit negro digest from the list of commercial magazines and journals although such obscure publications as ivy leaf and on the ball magazine were noted of course they also ignored liberator one of the few important black journals about there is in short much to quarrel with in the negro almanac but to quarrel is to miss the point the book represents a valuable contribution to the literature of black people and as was stated at the beginning it simply is a pity that it costs so much perhaps the publishers will consider in the near future bringing out a paperback edition of the negro almanac selling for a dollar or so by that time the editors will have been able to bring their material more up to date and to arrange to fill some of the important omissionshwf who is esteban montejo well he is a yearoid cuban he is black he is proud and he is an extraordinary man this autobiography the autobiography of a runaway slave by esteban montejo is a unique item for it is doubtful that we shall ever again hear such an authentic voice from the past his editor miguel barnet is a cuban poet and anthropologist and he has captured with considerable skill the flavor of this man and his time the book is divided into three parts slavery abolition and the war of independence in the first part montejo tells of the bleak misery of his childhood he never knew his parents negroes were sold like pigs he states and they sold me at once he refuses to accept sympathy for this fact since it is not sad because it is true his description of life in the barracoons slave quarters is a recital of torture and deprivation and even humor life was based on watchfulness and the whip but there were also games and drinking bouts and lovemaking in the cane fields any student of anthropology would find the vivid descriptions of life in nineteenth century cuba invaluable for montejo treats us to a feast of festivals african rituals medicine and superstitions this is a carnival without real gaiety in which slaves cuban born blacks whites and mulattoes chinese servants the odd gypsy filipinos and spanish overlords play their particular scenes montejo rebelled against slavery and escaped into the thick forests of cuba he lived there for years without any human contact until he heard the shouts of freedom then he left his hideaway and reentered the world he had left but he never gave up that reserve that independence lots of negroes wanted to be friends with me and they used to ask me what i had done as a runaway i told them nothing i have always been one for my independence idle gossip never helped anyone i went for years and years without talking to anyone at all life after emancipation was really the same litany of woe as it had been during slavery it was the pretense of liberation without freedom the same backbreaking work with little hope of advancement the real joys then were listening to the old ma lucias stories of an africa he did not know of hearing the elders talk about the land africa animals and apparitions of participating in the festivals of remedios and ariosa of learning about spirits and witchcraft this was what he knew until the cry for independence sounded throughoul cuba until he knew that this war against spain was also his war the fact is the war was necessary the dead would have died anyway and this way they were dying for a purpose the war was needed it was wrong that so many jobs and privileges should fall into spanish hands or that women should have to sleep with spaniards to get work none of this was right you never saw a negro lawyer because they said negroes werent good for anything except the forest you never saw a negro schoolmaster it was all kept for white spaniards even the white creoles were pushed aside i saw this happen a watchman with nothing to do except walk up and down call the hour and put out the lights had to be a spaniard it was the same everywhere there was no freedom i realized this when the leaders explained it all to us this was why we had to go to war the cuban war for independence from spain lasted from and when it ended the americans were firmly in control of the country in this historically fascinating section montejo speaks movingly about his hero the black general maceo who was killed during the war he thinks that the cuban patriot general maximo gomez has been given too noble a place in history he suggests that gomez might have collaborated with the americans in the sinking of the mainean act that brought the americans to cuba above all he enunciates the contempt americans had for blacks their disregard of cuban customs their abuse of cuban women and their spread of racist venom among the cubans he remains convinced however that truth will always triumph for now he sees that cubans have become masters of their country it is irrelevant to say that one system of slavery was more humanethan the other when people are deprived of their freedom when they become goods that are geared to the machinery of production it makes no sense to compare systems yet there is one striking difference in the panoply of slavery in cuba and in this country african culture remained deeply entrenched in cuba during slavery montejo emphatically states that the strongest gods are african and so he cannot understand why they permitted slavery he further observes that no person is one thing pure and simple in this country because all the religions have got mixed together the african brought his which is the stronger one and the spaniard brought his which isnt so strong but you should respect them all that is my way of thinking he has great respect for the old men of his youth who were born in africa and were therefore special people who had to be treated differently because they knew all about religious matters he notes that they were called the muzzled ones by the creoles because of their inability to speak spanish but for him they were the essence of gentility fortitude and good manners they taught me many things without being able to read or writecustoms which are more important than knowledge to be polite not to meddle in other peoples affairs to speak softly to be respectful and religious to work hard esteban montejo knew from whence he came he had the myths the superstitions and the festivals of a strong culture and these were enough to sustain him to tell him that the symbols of inferiority heaped upon his race were a travesty of the past his ancestors knew it was this knowledge that enabled him to live like a hermit in the siguanea forests to say of slavery it was repugnant to me it was shameful it was like a plagueit still seems like that today it was his confidence in that past that made him deride the whites who believed that the blacks were created for locks and bolts and whips and with whom he refused to truck since they believed they were the lords of creation and it is precisely his belief in that noble past that enables him to say today at that even if i had to die tomorrow i would not give up my pride he throws down the gauntlet to those who would limit human freedom who would dare to set limits on a mans aspirations thats why i say i dont want to die so i can fight in all the battles to come and im not going into the trenches or using any of those modern weapons a machete will do for me this is the voice of a man and it is the resonance of this voice that must reverberate on our psyches for black men must be proud again they must reach out to grab the world by its balls and fashion it to suit them it is this stubbornness this refusal to admit defeat in the teeth of a racist system designed to destroy them that should be the rallying call of american blacks for the black mans history in this western world is nothing if it is not one of indestructibility of his tenacious belief that he would not die but would confirm his humanity until his children were strong enough to proclaim it from every rooftop and that belief has not been in vain for there are now loud echoes resounding from the voices of the last poets
in the souls of black folk web du bois observes that black americans must so to speak look at the world through two separate lenses one lens scanning the scene as it is on the surface while the other refocuses according to the adjusted meaning for the black individuals lifechances consequently the black ego consists of two selfimages one black the other white between these two selves there looms a continual lifedeath struggle in which the white self is an object to the subjective black self the black self is spontaneous and natural restrained and restrictive for the black individual the drama of thinking conceiving judging believing reasoning deciding reacting expecting in short existing is to resist the tyrannical impositions of the exterior white self on the stage of existence today the mirror of the black persons looking glass self is white contradicting and negating the black ego this dooms the fainthearted black individual to think in a white framework confusing and contradictory contending on the pushpull scale of color prejudice pushed from the security of what otherwise would be his blackness into the grasping abyss of an alien and destructive whiteness yet unlike other animals man while influenced by phenomena external to himself is not a slave to his circumstances past or present where lower animals rely on instinct and the nature of the habitat man is capable of resorting to strategy and reasonthough many do not indeed mans scientific name homo sapiens is translated thinking man although scientists also toyed with then discarded the label homo loquens or talking man which admittedly characterizes the major ity of us accurately but in a fundamental sense man is distinguished from other animals by his ability to thinkwhich is in the ideal sense an important prelude to thinkingand is capable of choosing between two or more ideas or alternatives rejecting one or both of them cicero was aware of this in his treatise on friendship when he stated wise men are instructed by reason men of less understanding by experience the most ignorant by necessity beasts by nature history let alone the biographies of individuals is a testimony to mans ability to rise above the surface of his circumstances as black men are now beginning to do said cicero further vivere est cogitore to think is to live it is not merely to contemplate the dictionary lists connotations of thinking we have chosen one of them to keep continually in mind be obsessed with as he thinks model airplanes all day long in other words to think is to live to think black is to live black to think black is to feel black look black so far as we can and be black to think black is to question whiteness and its values and the contradictions and irrationalities of white society however thinking black does not addict oneself alone to combating whiteness to do so would place the black individual all over again in a neosubordinate role reacting instead of initiating action to react to whiteness exclusively is to fall victim to a kind of reactionformation this in a roundabout way itself acknowledges the supremacy of whiteness it gives rise to symbolic behavior enslaved by the dictates of white decrees it is like a fighter always on the defensive seldom or never putting forth an offensive thrust absolute negativism is rigidly defensive a good contestant needs both a good defense and a good offense but most of all a good offense thinking black far from getting bogged down in dogmatic nihilism is based on a philosophy of pragmatic positivism more about that later we may divide the processes of thinking black for the purposes of discussion into a sixpronged attack the plasma of black thinking the plasma of black thinking may be categorized as follows pphysiognomy llanguage aartifacts ssickness mmathematics and aaudaciousness physiognomy this refers to the system of defining white characteristics as desirable black as undesirable which must be reversed in order to think black the motivations behind the negative physiognomy of blackness have a long history from the beginning blacks subjugated in slavery were subjected to a system of whitewashing this included control over their minds bodies and souls even down to the present day black individuals are brought up on a diet of diddies such as the black race was lured to america with stories of tanks of molasses and flapjacks growing on trees one of the rhymes which may be heard asserts that you can tell a chinaman you can tell a dutch you can tell a nigger but you cant tell him much now a white man was born with a veil over his face he can tell you things years before they ever take place but a nigger was born with a sack over his ass he cant tell you a damned thing until its done passed this defines the black race called negroes ie niggers as inferior another goes like this if youre white youre all right yellow youre mellow brown stick around black stand back they also may talk of wanting nothing black but a cadillac many parents contrarily avoid references to color or race within earshot of their children some touch the backs of their hands to indicate a black person rub the palms to refer to a white individual many black children accordingly grow up thinking of themselves coneludes princeton psychologist bertram karon the negro personality as inferior defining impressive attributes of the black race as undesirable for instance the sensuality of full hips and full lips become in a turnabout way degrading the thin lips and flat hips of white women alternatively are held out to black women as models for emulation many black women will starve themselves puny in the effort to lose the major attributes they possess while coveting for example the horselike legs of white women many black women are impelled to fry their hair to imitate the stringy texture of white womens tresses when anybody knows who has ever chanced to see that there is nothing so beautiful as a black womans freshly washed hair the intricacies of the curls are impressive indeed to behold a work of art it is almost enough to make a man believe in god while whites bake themselves all day to get rid of their whiteness blacks disdain the sun and hug the shade in search of whiteness as children we were laughed at when suntanned and deterred from drinking coffee with the warning that to drink coffee would make us blacker the preferential physiognomy of whiteness is apparent when black men and women grown and gray after the freedom of barefoot days as children purchase shoes too small in order to restrict the sufficiency of their pedal foundations language the language of white america has exhibited a builtin force destructive of the black individuals selfconcept white is the color symbolizing purity while black is a color loaded with derogatory connotations in addition blacks are taught to worship a god who is always painted white then to sing that they want to be more and more like jesus who will be riding six white horses when he comes i myself accepted these white myths at the early age of eight joining the church inopportunely during the lords supper a cannibalistic white rite in which the lord eats nothing but christians actually proceed symbolically to eat the lord then i grew up to learn that god is dead only to read later that they found him alive in the white house i therefore proposed that they move the white house to howard university and call it the black house but the suggestion didnt take too well with those on high the language of prejudice is apparent to the person thinking black when an intelligent individual is labeled bright as over against stupid professors are said to reside in the ivory tower including those at socalled negro colleges or ebony towers whetherwe are regarded as the black sheep of our families may not correlate with skin color we are nonwhites even when we are in the majority but the dictionary carries no such word as nonblack even mulattoes are curiously halfwhite instead of halfblack recently i sat listening to a verbose fellows discussion of the dark famine of ireland finally i told him if it was that bad it had to be white artifacts artifacts include the objects made by man and used in everyday life for instance children must pass through sunday schools with lesson cards picturing a white jesus and his disciples surrounded by church walls and decorative windows portraying the same in school they are exposed to textbooks peopled by middle class white urban children talking the doubletalk of looksee primary readers this same condition pervades most other areas of american life and is compounded by a number of other contradictions visavis black people sickness too much already has been written on the schizoid nature of white society and the bland emptiness of white culture to merit detailed discussion here in all areas of lifesex religion race crime and commercethere is a tendency sometimes socially approved to profess one thing and practice another this stems in part from the practice of holding out progress as an ideal in the technical and scientific spheres while clinging to tradition and convention in the social sphere obsolescent social institutions and norms developed by primitive whites to fit their own social conditions have been handed down to us and cemented by the cake of custom the discrepancy between the mushrooming technological development and our social stagnation grows greater not surprisingly with each day sociologists call this a cultural lag i think that by now it has become a cultural drag yet many black persons cling gullibly to these norms while whites may frequently disdain the alleged ideals in preference to more customary real practices thinking blacks are not obliged to merely adjust to a schizoid society which itself is maladjusted to be adjusted to a maladjusted society is in effect to be maladjusted black persons thinking black quite naturally will reject a society which rejects black people to accept a society which rejects you is in a roundabout way to reject yourself mathematics the numerical basis of the system which oppresses black people is apparent in the word minority group which implies that blacks are oppressed because they represent a numerical minority actually they are a majority in the world as a whole and all over the world wherever there are white people are oppressed regardless of their proportionate representation yet whites a minority in the world as a whole have developed and disseminated techniques of majorityrule which stymie black efforts toward selfdetermination we are told that we are a minority whenever retaliatory violence flares in the black community but simultaneously urged to engage in the majority dominated politics of voting our way to freedom even population statistics and birth controlthe essence of the numbers and distribution of people take on a tinge of white racism we are led to believe to think that our predicament is a product of our high procreative powers that we may soon cause the population to outstrip the food supply actually it would appear to represent a discrepancy between the distribution of resources and people the land surface of the earth my third grade geography teacher told me is only about twothirds of the globe an eminent graduate school professor in turn proclaimed that twothirds of the people have crowded themselves into only about onetenth of the land area we have not learned to eat much of the edible material for example dozens of specimens of fish swimming wild in the ocean i can conceive of a gigantic raftvillage afloat at sea instead the white man proceeds to disseminate books such as standing room only wherein it would appear that should the situation ever reach that point the problem will just about take care of itself one illustration will indicate the condition in which we already find ourselves dr bentley glass famous new york biologist recently predicted in the press that by the turn of the century the practice will emerge in response to population explosion of issuing coupons when couples are wed two coupons one child per coupon we already have acquired the coupon of marriage a marriage license couples whose children can obtain a genetic certificate tantamount to the current blood test certificate prerequisite to marriage will be able to exceed the twochild allotment the method of certifying couples genetically will according to dr glass be based on a test of physical and mental normalcy of the two allotted offspring the offspring will be examined of course by tests made out on the white folks up at princeton black children for reasons now wellknown will be less likely to pass the tests then rev ralph abernathy jr v will have to stage a march on washington in order to get a fertility rights act passed audaciousness the black race and its struggle today is in need of individuals who can dare to be problack as well as antiwhite to think blackwe have already concludedis to be black to be black in turn is to do black the latter is a rather neglected phenomenon many black militants unconsciously overplay the process of being black in order to avoid doing black they lose themselves in dogmatic nihilism and mystic militancy their militancy their blackness becomes a religion so to speak in which strategy is enslaved by their symbolism africa for example a land most never truly expect to visit may take the place of the christians heaven as it were african garb replacing the priestly frock although this is not to deride such practices as a means of cementing ones identity as a black individual so long as they do not become ends instead of means frantz fanon maotsetung and che guevara may be parroted like a bible without apparent concern for transforming their conclusions to fit the demography culture and social organization of this country sometimes i feel that the white folk gave us such works for some good reason many mystic militants mistakenly measure militancy on a scale of whiterejection those who reject whites percent though conservative economically and politically are regarded as more militant than those who reject only per cent and so on i who reject only and of them am occasionally regarded as a moderate that may be so but those who would think black must now prepare to move out of this expressive bag and take on the pragmatic duties of true revolutionary innovation on january a group of middleranking military officers attempted to take over the civilian government of nigeria this attempt was foiled by the higher military officers under the leadership of the late majorgeneral ironsi the attempted take over led to the death of the federal prime minister two regional premiers and the federal minister of finance following the attempt the civilian government handed over powers to the nigerian army after the military take over the future of nigeria as a single political unit became highly uncertain the army mutiny of july and the mass massacre of civilians of eastern nigerian origin particularly in northern nigeria led to the secession of the former eastern nigeria now called biafra the nigerian military government attempt to end what it termed a rebellion led to what jet magazine of july called the war between blacks nobody cares about in that same july eugene walton writing in negro digest pointed out the often overlooked fact that the colonial powers in their scramble for africa created countries without regard to the tribal and cultural differences of african people mr walton noted m under the circumstances it may be better to let them come apart and regroup along lines of their own choosing forming new nations with more workable economic and cultural combinationsand certainly with more harmonious tribal groupings this article will attempt to analyze the cultural content of the former federation of nigeria and the part cultural differences played in the countrys disintegration we may remind our readers that nigeria had million people from about different ethnic tribal groups the land area was about four times that of the united kingdom or the size of the states of oklahoma and texas the country was made up of four regions states each region was autonomous and in fact each had different diplomatic representation at the court of st james london the federal and regional governments had bicameral legislaturesthe second chamber called the senate on the federal level and house of chiefs on the regional level cases for and against the continuation of nigeria as a political unit nigeria was seen by many non nigerians as an example of political stability in black africa her leadership was noted for its political sportsmanship compromise was the foundation stone of the political stability the first case for the continuation of nigeria as a political unit is the psychic movement towards unity that is common among many liberals and intellectuals such unity is said to be essential for the human race as a whole particularly if economic and other values are to be maximized second africa now has more countries than any other continent in the world and further increase from existing countries would lead to mushroom countries too small to be viable this is the balkanization thesis third economists and others drawing from adam smith point out that division of labor is limited by the extent of the market and in the case of nigeria disintegration would essentially lead to economic suicide such disintegration would hamper factor mobility fourth nigeria had been a laboratory of human relations and its disintegration would suggest the failure of black people to interact in a meaningful way for their own common good the cases for allowing nigeria to disintegrate start first with the artificial nature of nigeria lord hailey one of the most enlightened british colonial experts had remarked that in creating nigeria britain created perhaps the most artificial of the many administrative units created in the course of european occupation of africa the continuation of this artificial entity would be a major source of instability and would for all practical purposes retard the process of development second nigeria by its size is too big to be handled by a single political authority particularly when one takes into consideration primacy of the various modern institutions in the new states third any modem government must have the confidence of its citizens this confidence must be built on trust and a feeling of belonging in the case of nigeria events in the past two years have shown that fear mistrust and resentment have been the order of the day and that a section of the country felt that their security life and property were no longer protected in the nigerian federation events in the past two years seem to justify this feeling fourth the economic case for nigerian existence tends to overlook the fact that more than politics economic relations transcend national boundaries the european economic community the east african common market and the central american economic area are examples where economics go wider than politics exterminating people as now done in nigeria limits the market since potential manpower is destroyed and property damaged fifth it might be better to have small but stable countries than to have large and unstable ones finally by its very nature federalism is a bond which may be broken when parties fail to live up to their obligations many federations in the british colonial and commonwealth history did not last for long these include the malaysian federation india and pakistan and the west indies federation britain did not succeed in her efforts to incorporate ireland and quite recently there were talks about the establishment of a scottish national assembly it might therefore be asking too much to expect the federation of nigeria to continue to exist no matter the cost human and otherwise the cultures of nigeria one of the simplest definitions of culture is that culture is ways of doing things culture is classified into material and nonmaterial material culture consists of physical objects the tools weapons accouterments charms fetishes ikons and all physical apparatus of life nonmaterial culture includes the entire system of practices customs or folkways by which the life of a community seems to be organized material culture is embodied in technology and nonmaterial culture embodied in ceremonies both aspects of culture are present in all societies at all times ethnologists have evolved methods of observing how personalities are formed and organized in the context of a culture human attitudes aspirations actions and reactions views on life and the world in general are all conditioned by cultural background political culture pye and verba tell us suggests that the traditions of a society the spirit of its public institutions the passions and the collective reasoning of its citizenry and the style and operating codes of its leaders are not just random products of historical experience but fit together as part of the meaningful whole the former nigerian republic was made up of many ethnic groups arid contained heterogenous cultures the three largest ethnic groups the hausafulani the ibos and the yorubas were located in the northern eastern and western regions of nigeria respectively the ibos and other ethnic groups in the eastern region are all located within the boundaries of the federation the yorubas are divided between nigeria and dahomey while the hausafulanis are divided between nigeria niger and chad republics this makes it possible for the divided tribes to feel at home in these other countries while the tribes of the eastern region have no where else to go we will argue that despite minor local differences the tribes of former eastern region biafra belong to a common cultural pool this pool is not shared by other tribes in nigeria ottenberg writing on the ibo receptivity to change made the following observation the ibo are a sedentary agricultural people dwelling mainly in the tropical forest areas of southeastern nigeria members of this cultural and linguistic grouping consisting of about five million persons live slightly inland from the coast and are separated from it by the efiks ibibio ogoni eastern i jaw and other peoples who share with them many similarities in culture and in contact experience forde and jones also observed major cultural similarities among the ethnic groups in biafra which include elaborate new yam rituals when first fruits are ceremonially presented to sacred images the ivory trumpet kept by the senior linage head to summon the group for defense etc methods of fighting weapons and war drums many births marriage and burial customs folk tales with the tortoise as hero political culture the biafran tribes belong to what experts call stateless or acephalous societies the hausafulani and the yorubas on the other hand belong to state or kingdom societies in the acephalous societies of nigeria oneman rule is totally unknown and people aspire to political office on the basis of their abilities this contrasts with the kingdom societies where oneman rule or a modification of it is the rule rather than the exception and where people aspire to political office by birth this difference accounts for the existence of emirs among the hausafulani and obas among the yorubas attempts to introduce the one man rule in the form of warrant chiefs in former eastern nigeria biafra led to series of riots and disturbances in the area in the late twenties and early thirties although some few powerful chieftains flourished along the coastal areas in the region their existence was more a function of european trade than of indigenous tradition political power among the ibos and allied tribes sklar and whitaker tell us t exemplifys the pattern of dispersed tribal authority as a rule authority extending to matters of land tenure is based on patrilineal kinship groups typically the ibo village chief is the head of a special lineage the chief of a senior village in a group may preside at meetings of the village group in some cases villagegroup heads enjoy great prestige but their authority never reaches beyond the village group indeed there are parts of iboland where chieftancy is virtually unknown and tribal government is thought of as the collective rule of the senior age grades ft this political structure requires the ibos and other tribes in biafra to have a popular participation in the community political decision making these tribes are said to be ultrarepublican or parademocratic the kingdom societies of the yorubas and the hausafulani do not allow for popular decisionmaking in politics and other social matters the yoruba political system has a resemblance to the english constitutional monarch when the lords checked the activities of their sovereign lloyd noted on the yoruba political system there has always been a delicate balance of power between the chiefs who make policy and the oba whose sacred status commands such authority as will ensure obedience if the oba misused his powers he might be deposed by his chiefs who would ask him to die this form of constitutional monarch extended to other areas of midwestern nigeria particularly in benin the hausafulani societies are ruled by the emirs who embody both religious social and political powers the islamic jihad of the early nineteenth century gave rise to the emirate kingdoms of northern nigeria and the political culture of that area is rooted in islamic religion sklar and whitaker observed each of the political systems of the emirates has distinctive features but certain principles of emirate rule are general in their application first emirate rule is theocratic in the sense that an emir is thought to personify the islamic fusion of political and religious authority second it is dynastic emirs are chosen from the membership of royal dynasties by traditional electors subject to the special customary procedures of particular states third emirs govern their domains through ranks of titled officials some traditional offices are restricted to men of royal birth and some men of noble birth others are within the emirs unrestricted power of appointment among those eligible for office competition is keen and its intensity is reinforced by the participation of those who stand to gain by the advancement of a prospectively more powerful patron this implies a fourth important principle of emirate rule namely clientage defined by m g smith as an exclusive relation of mutual benefit which holds between two persons defined as socially and politically unequal which stresses their solidarity the concentration of dejure power and authority in the hands of the emir tended to inhibit any opposition to him even from within the ranks of the ruling stratum from the standpoint of the commoner emirate rule was despotic in form his personal security depended wholly upon the uncertain benevolence of his overlords the fusion of the theocratic or despotic system with the limited monarchical and the parademocratic systems was bound to run into difficulties this we submit was one of the painful ills of nigeria this fusion of stateless and state societies in nigeria made interaction between their members very difficult and led to the existence of continued misunderstanding this interaction difficulty was noted by coleman the ibo as well as the ibibio had strong personal economic reasons for wanting nigeria to be a nation with freedom of movement and enterprise the existence of this sentiment was well demonstrated by a minority report submitted by representatives from eastern region six ibos four ibibios efiks one cameronian and one ijaw as part of the recommendation whereby southerners resident in the north would be rendered ineligible for election to the northern house of assembly it is in our view invidious that a nigerian could under a nigerian constitution be deprived of the right of election to the house of assembly in any region in which he for the time beingor permanently has his abode merely by reason of the accident of birth or ancestry in the last analysis the unity of nigeria is the unity of individual in it the individuals are bound together by political ties of nationality identical nationality of any country must surely carry with it identical political rights it is significant to note that of the twelve eastern signatories to this report only three were supporters of azikiwe indeed the remaining nine opposed azikiwe in varying degrees and some were definitely probritish it is equally important to emphasize that the discriminatory provision opposed by easterners was supported by all representatives from the northern and western regions colemans observations are consistent with our thesis on cultural homogeneity of easterners biafrans and our broad division of nigeria into state and stateless societies religious culture religious differences in nigeria are the best known to people outside nigeria while biafrans have the same religious systemschristianity and animism the yorubas and the hausafulani have a mixture of christianity and islam the hausafulani are predominantly moslems in general the ibos ibibios efiks and ijaws who occupy biafra are secular societies this contrasts with the sacred societies of the yorubas and the hausafulani sacred societies are characterized by emphatic resistance to cultural change and when they do change their changes tend to be imitative secular societies on the other hand are highly receptive to change and their changes tend to be innovative it is interesting to note that among biafrans religious fanaticism is rare and the people tend to exhibit rationality in their religious observance these characteristics contrast with the rather slavish and religious fanaticism that prevails in the northern and western regions yorubas have always had someone who claims to be a christ the difference in religion accounts for the different rates of social change in nigeria where christian churches operate they establish schools of various types and teach not only religion but skills as well the moslem schools teach only the koran and do little or nothing in the area of modem education economic culture many people in the former federation of nigeria live in about villages urban centers are fast growing but still have less than percent of the population agriculture is the mainstay of the countrys economy land therefore is an important factor in the economy and the systems of land tenure indicate the degree of diversity in the economic system in the acephalous societies as in biafra land belongs to the dead the living and the generation yet to be born ownership of land is not a function of price but rather a function of membership in the community there is therefore no landless person or landless people in the state societies of the yorubas land belongs to the kingdom and heads of various families act as custodians among the hausafulani land belongs to the emirs and the use of land is dictated by the various district heads who act as the emirs representative the state societies may have landless people the biafrans have a strong linkage with their land and where ones ancestors are buried is regarded as sacred tribes in this area remind their children of their ownership of land and this makes it easy to trace people back home in biafra among the tribes of the state societies to trace one back home can seldom be done trade systems and market operations differ among various ethnic groups in the stateless societies the intermediary between the producer and the consumer is hardly rigid that is to say mobility is seldom impaired either by regulation or by custom in the state societies markets are administered by various titled officials each in charge of such things as butchery the grain marketing and the cloth marketing market intermediaries tend to be rigid smith made the following remarks on hausa markets since the hausa merchants and officials are the main links between the rural markets in which the peasants trade and the larger city markets which handle the intranigerian and overseas commerce and since neither of these markets is ever static for long the hausa peasants are subject to changing economic pressures mediated by officials and tradersthe friction that arises when traders accustomed to different types of salesmanship interact continued to be one of the major sources of tension among the various tribal groups labor mobility in the geographical sense differed among the ethnic groups traditionally the yorubas of western nigeria have been urban and quasiurban dwellers the hausafulani developed administrative centers that had some urban characteristics the ethnic groups in biafra wereand arestill predominantly rural urban centers in the area grew out of the british colonial experience in there were nine cities in western nigeria yoruba with a population of and over there were two such cities in northern nigeria hausafulani and no city of that size in eastern nigeria biafra by there were such cities in western nigeria seven in northern nigeria and five in eastern nigeria the urban areas both new and old experienced a high degree of ibo ibibio efik biafrans immigrants coleman had remarked yet this rapid and intensive urbanization of the ibo peoples since the british occupation is a phenomenon not only of the eastern region their homeland ibos also constitute more than onethird of the nonindigenous population of the urban centers in the northern and western regions k o dike attributed this mass movement of ibos to landhunger w a lewis blamed the palm produce marketing board price policies for the migration phenomenon in eastern nigeria biafra these two reasons are weak because few migrants became farmers but rather took to petty trading and nonfarm activities the friction of urban socialization and the competition for urban employment are some of the factors which created tribal hatred which was the crucial element in the series of massacres that led to biafran secession conclusion nigerian disintegration is a function of her cultural heterogeneity it is also a function of the high expectation of many people outside nigeria who not only saw the country as a model of democracy for black africa but also got more nigeriaconscious and oriented than nigerians themselves in lord lugard amalgamated the protectorates of northern and southern nigeria and the crown colony of lagos the amalgamation worked only on paper and it was not until that the representatives from these areas met and started interacting and shaping the framework of what is now known as nigeria one might say that there is only a generation of nigerians and that to call someone a nigerian is to call him a british colonial subject the newness of the nigerian political framework coupled with the countrys large ethnic composition led to what professor deutsch called incomplete social mobilization and as deutsch pointed out elsewhere ceteris paribus the stage of rapid social mobilization may be expected therefore to promote the consolidation of states whose peoples already share the same language culture and major social institutions while the same process may tend to strain or destroy the unity of states whose population is already divided into several groups with different languages or cultures or basic ways of life the nigerian experience is a living example of the failure of the westminister model when transferred to other cultures this model evolved from the british experience of class is inappropriate to africa where the key element is community given the diversity of african or nigerian ethnic groups the competition inherent in the westminister model becomes rather divisive and tends to create deep wounds despite its cultural link with england the united states did not import the westminister system lock stock and barrel the united states presidency senate and judiciary are not carbon copies of the british monarchy lords and judiciary the american model was structured to suit the american situation african leaders scholars and statesmen will do africa and africans justice if they realize the diversity of their peoples and advocate and pursue policies that will allow for peaceful evolution of african institutions to cope with africa in transition indiscriminate institutional importation and pseudo international and diplomatic maturity might prove very expensive in human terms as the nigerian disintegration exemplifies so god created man in his own image this is the essential f christian message which gets so mixed up in the minds of jj people god created us in his own image we intend to live e as beings created in the image of god and everything we do c m in the church should be designed to help us live that way something has happened to black people in these united states we are not as we were a few years ago a few months ago a few weeks ago something has happened to us not to america but to us to the way we think the way we fight the way we work together this is the most important thing that has ever happened in americawhat is that something it is that fear is gone just a few weeks ago we were so different down south we were afraid up north we were afraid the fear was a very elementary fear it was not the fear of being brutalized of being humiliated essentially it was the fear of dying when the white man in the south said get off the sidewalk why did we get off because we were afraid of dying we are not afraid any more so the white man has stopped saying it now he is afraid now he must redefine his relationship with us why is fear gone fear is gone essentially because we are in the process of becoming a black nation a nation that is as real as if it had a capital a congress and a president we as a people are now dedicated to one purpose freedom for black people it is this which makes the difference we didnt understand what this was before because each of us functioned as an individual we were afraid to fight because we felt that if we fought we would fight alone and we would die alone it is hard to stand up and be a man when you are all by yourself that is the way we were the difference now is that we are coming together we are no longer just individuals we are becoming a nation you know that the rest of us are going to support you in every way we can if you fight back against oppression we are not going to turn our backs and run away when you know that you feel different no matter how much uncle tom still remains in you now you are part of a nation so fear is gone everything that is going on in america today stems from this basic fact once we were alone now we are together we have changed we are a black nation in a white mans world increasingly the white mans world has become an enemy world recognized as such an enemy world from which we have been systematically excluded and which we now despise and reject they cant exclude us any more because we dont want to be in their world now we are in our own world our own nation so much so that sometimes we feel uncomfortable because we have to go out into their enemy world to work and to shop we wish that we could stay with our own people all the time when you get on the bus and you have an afro or a natural hairdo and the man stares you think to yourself i dont like the way he looks any more than he likes the way i look and the way i look is just as beautiful to me as the way he looks is beautiful to him you cant exclude a man when he doesnt want to come in you cant tell a man that he cant marry your daughter when he doesnt even want to spit in your face it is a strange new world that we have created it keeps the white man confused he doesnt know what to make of it so he tries to concentrate upon the tangible a burnedout building for example he figures that if he can do something about this physical blight other things will go back to normal but there is nothing he can do with bricks and steel and stone that can make us act like he wants us to act because bricks and steel and stone have nothing to do with it it is not something physical we are different unless they deal with us as we are now they can put up all the bricks and steel and stone that they want to and it wont stay too long we have become a black nation you can see it everywhere the white press doesnt know what to make of it white journalists are the most confused people in the world sometimes when you read the things they write you think you are reading a fairy tale hans christian anderson is much closer to reality than they are because they dont have any key to understand whats happening that is because in their minds we are inferior we cant hate like they hate we cant believe like they believe we cant fight like they fight so they have to make up some kind of story to explain why we do the things we do yet the answer is so simple all they have to accept is the simple fact black people are black but in every other way there is no difference if they could just accept this simple fact they would realize why we cannot accept any more than they could the brutalization the degradation the indignities and the criminalities to which we have been subjected but they cant see that and so they cant understand our black revolution so they write fairy tales to amuse themselves when you look at what is happening you see how we have changed the national student association recently held a national convention the same student organization that the cia financed for years some black students went to that convention and said we dont care who is paying your bills if you want us in the student movement you are going to endorse black_power here and now and the national student association voted to endorse black_power then the teachers we have been looking down on black teachers for a long time we have said that all they cared about was their own individual selves their clothes their cars their social life but recently the american federation of teachers had a convention and the black teachers got together and said what amounted to we dont like anything that is going on and if you dont endorse black_power we are walking out you see how a nation comes into being a year ago they wouldnt have even opened their mouths at the convention the white folks would have picked one of them to speak for the negroes and that would have been that but now at every convention black folks put up a sign saying black caucus whitey stay out this is the beginning of a black nation there was a time when we didnt even want to sit together if we came into a room and saw a negro there we would walk over to the other side of the room and sit down we didnt want to segregate ourselves but now the first thing we do is separate ourselves and get together with all the brothers and sisters to find out what it is that we all want to do that has been the pattern at every convention that has been held this summer and the white man doesnt know what to do the left had a convention in chicago new left old left all kinds of lefts black folks went to that convention the white folks had set up a convention just like white people always set up ghetto day buses from detroit newark and cleveland would bring in black folks to put on a show for the white folks but black folks would have nothing to do with the planning nothing to do with the organization of convention procedure nothing to do with the assessment of political realities white folks have been having ghetto days like this for more than years only this time black folks werent interested in any ghetto day so they got together and they drew up a beautiful statement even when the newspapers got through with the statement they drew up it was still a beautiful thing listen to the preamble we as black people believe that a united states system that is committed to the practice of genocide social degradation the denial of political and cultural selfdetermination of black people cannot reform itself there must be revolutionary change then they made specific black_power demands and there wasnt anything that those white leftists could do but accept those demands because without black people there isnt any revolutionary movement in america there are some white people who are poor who are exploited but they are white there are some white people who are liberal but they are white there are some white people who are radical but they are white and in the final analysis all these white people stand together we know this to be true so we black people are now demanding the things that we want for ourselves no white man whatever he represents himself to be is going to tell us what to do this is the message of the conventions of all the rebellions it is the message from coast to coast of the burnedout buildings black people are going to be free and we are going to do it ourselves what is fear when i was going to school i remember studying the psychology of fear and the debate over whether the emotional reaction preceded or followed the visceral reaction even then i knew it to be nonsense what does it mean when we say fear is gone it doesnt mean that when you get into a situation you dont have an emotional or a visceral reaction but that is not fear the emotion the adrenalin m that is pumped into your body can lead you to either fight or ight the body is ready for either one fear is determined by what you do with that energy dont be ashamed if you react if your pressure goes up if your heart starts pumping just be sure you do the right thing at work when they begin to talk about niggers and you are supposed to be invisible dont worry if your heart begins to pump what matters is do you speak up do you just sit there and pretend not to hear we had a peoples tribunal to try the officers charged with the massacre of three black youths in the algiers motel during the july rebellion right here beneath the beautiful black madonna witnesses testified everything possible had been done by the police to intimidate these black people and yet they testified and told the truth does that mean that as they sat here their hearts were not pounding of course not they knew that the man was going to brutalize them at the first opportunity but that wasnt fear because they did what had to be done a whole lot of you have guiity feelings about being afraid you neednt have it is not fear as long as you do what has to be done america is set on a disaster course of conflict and violence the black man cannot accept america as it is the white man refuses to make the changes necessary for the black man to live in america with dignity and justice these are two facts we will not accept conditions as they are and the white man will not accept the changes which we demand there is no solution except open conflict and violence you dont have to feel guilty about that either it is his fault not ours we say that we are created in the image of god he refuses to accept that it is his fault not ours when there is justice there can be love peace and brotherhood only the oppressor can afford to talk about the preservation of law and order without justice for the oppressed that is for us for all black people to talk about law and order peace and brotherhood is either insanity or it is craven cowardice we have no choice to make we cant be concerned with law and order peace and brotherhood until we first get justice securing justice is our basic concern there are black people who dont understand that we dont have justice but they are becoming fewer and fewer everything about the elections in mississippi was crooked there wasnt any law and order there because there was injustice they were determined that black people would not be elected in american cities during the recent rebellion every constitutional right guaranteed citizens was denied to black people the courts became kangaroo courts the judges functioned as though they were part of the police department the news papers were part of the police department all the white community came together to protect order that is to protect white supremacy to protect and to preserve injustice even as they talked about law and order they were the perpetrators of injustice and the destroyers of law and order the police talked about looters in the street and they themselves were doing more looting every day than the looters in the street but injustice had to be preserved white supremacy had to be maintained the white man was willing to sacrifice the constitution the courts and the law to preserve what he held sacred the status quo to preserve his injustice he was willing to go to any lengths and he did some of you were arrested you know what they did in the jails the prisons and the concentration camps you remember the wanton brutality against men women and children and all the time they were talking about law and order america is headed for increased racial conflict and violence there is no escape because the white man is determined to preserve injustice and we are determined that justice is ours by right and that we shall have it we have decided that we are willing to die rather than continue to suffer the injustice that we have suffered for years we have the strength necessary for this kind of struggle because we have come together and we are a black nation but it is going to take every bit of our united strength to withstand the kind of persecution that is being prepared for us i dont care how nice you feel inside how much you would like to go along how much you wish you could live out your lifetime without so much conflict and violence i am sorry you were just born at the wrong time there is no way that that kind of injustice can be preserved even when you long for the good old days when you could be a comfortable uncle tom you realize that the good old days are gone forever we are living in the midst of a revolution and in a time of revolution the old values are no long valid when they draft you into the army they take you to camp and teach you how to kill that is against the values of society but the society has declared that in this emergency it is necessary that you forget what you have been taught so you learn how to kill and how to kill well the old values are no longer valid we have got to understand this we have got to understand that in a time of revolution the old values must also be rescinded when america revolted against england they looted a ship in boston harbor they took the cargo of tea and threw it overboard they burned everything that they needed to burn because they said we are engaged in a revolution and in revolution the old values must be cast aside they knew it then because they were engaged in a revolution they were fighting against injustice and oppression now we know it an old lady called me up the other day she said that she lived on west warren avenue and she talked about the way those people were acting during the rebellion how they ran up and down the streets with the things they had taken and told her to get off her front porch or they would burn down her house they probably saw her writing down license numbers to give the police she said that everything we black people do is wrong and that i should stop fussing with white people and start fussing with black people to get them to do right she said that she had tried so hard to keep her little house neat and clean to plant a little grass to organize a block club but the black people in her block wouldnt cooperate they said this aint our community the man owns it and she was hurt because she had wanted to make her block a little grosse pointe she was so happy because a white lady she worked for called her up during the rebellion and asked her how she was doing and sent her some canned food i tried to explain to her that in a time of revolution the old values are no longer valid the old virtues she had cherished so long of saving up to buy a little house and putting a fence around it wont work it is time for all of us to build a community together and if you are still thinking of protecting your little thing trying to make your fence high enough to keep us out you are wrong you ought to love the looters because they are part of the black nation if you were too old to participate then the least you could do was not talk about those who did it is one struggle and we are in it together we have got to love one another we have got to remember that even if at the end of the struggle down the road a piece we end up in concentration camps together we are still brothers and sisters and we must love one another white people in america dont understand this a white daily had an editorial the other day the us dailies are undoubtedly among the most biased newspapers in the world but this was a new low even for an establishment newspaper the editorial said that h rap brown and the ku kluxers who voted times in mississippi are equally wrong and if it is accepted that brown is privileged to foment violence then the kkk is also so privileged this is the hitler technique tell a big lie and tell it over and over until the whole world believes it to be true the press knows that there is a basic difference between h rap brown and the kkk brown says one simple thing that black people must fight for justice by all means necessary while the kkk says that white people have got to preserve injustice by all means necessary do you see the difference it doesnt become the same thing because the white mans press pretends to believe that it is the same we have got to fight injustice by all means necessary if that is sedition then we are all guilty white people in organizations all over the country are joining together in support of one basic philosophic position we have got to use all means necessary to preserve injustice against black people that is why conflict and violence are inevitable the white man could change his position but he is not changing it the sale of guns to white people has increased by leaps and bounds even as they write long articles in newspapers and magazines against black violence in the streets they have special flights bringing in guns every day to white people in detroit they are dedicated to the preservation of injustice without injustice they wouldnt need guns we dont even want to live in their communities or go to their schools all we want is control over our own communities they would have nothing to fear except for the simple fact that they are unwilling to give up their control over our community they want to live in dearborn and grosse pointe and still control our schools and teach our children and they are not going to do it that is why they are buying guns because we are demanding a change that is why there is going to be conflict and violence conflict is inevitable unless the white man agrees to transfer power we say that to him and he looks the other way he sets up a new detroit committee to rebuild detroit he gives it all kinds of money but the committee refuses to realize that its one function is to preside at the transference of power it could say black people wont accept injustice any longer lets make some changes but it wont do that instead it reassembles the same old hackneyed negro leadership gives it a new name and tries to deal with it as though it speaks for the black community in order to preserve the same old injustice but it wont work conflict is inevitable because the white man wont face reality oppression does not destroy a people it is the acceptance of oppression that destroys that is why we were sick until we started fighting just trying to hold in our indignation made us sick messed up our minds that is why a girl who gets a natural feels like a whole new world has opened up to her we have begun to throw off oppression we dont know whether we are going to win or lose all black people in america could be killed within the next five years but we would be better off dead than accepting oppression fear is gone the white man has got to understand that in this period of becoming a nation the black church conscious of its african roots becomes increasingly significant many black people have given up the church but the church can become the basis for a new unity in the black community we ask people to join the church so that they will know that they are brothers and sisters that they belong to a black nation this church is dedicated to a black messiah this church believes that the purpose of christianity is to free black people to rid black people of injustice this is what we believe this is why we are so important to the black revolution this is why we need more churches like ours from coast to coast the church must free our minds strengthen our bodies and unite our people this is the task of the church because god created us in his own image and as a child of god we must walk with pride and dignity we are going to be free by any means necessary brothers and sisters remember that we have agents every sunday if someone comes up to you talking about firebombs and guerilla warfare dont let him make a fool out of you one group of private investigators is in the city trying to earn a purse of by proving a conspiracy there was no conspiracy except the conspiracy to maintain injustice perpetrated by the white man for the past years let them expose that conspiracy heavenly father we thank thee for the opportunity of worshipping in this house we thank thee that we have this house to come together in be with us and help us to do those things that must be done let your spirit be in our midst and lead our brothers and sisters to feel the call to join together with us in this task of uniting our people this we ask in the name of the black messiah jesus christ amen image is a term which we are using more and more in the black community because we are discovering that the image we have of ourselves controls what we are capable of doing image in this sense has the meaning of selfconcept we are giving cause and effect the same name but the word image is properly speaking a concrete term meaning the projection or representation of an object the image is the mirror of some aspect of reality at this point we should draw a distinction between real and created images both are projections of reality but the created image is projected by the imagination of man and by the recall and associative power of his five senses for instance i can hold out a rose before you the image of that rose is mirrored in your eye it is a real image or i can describe a rose to you and my words will create an image which you can visualize mentally perhaps you will even imagine the smell and the feel the words i choose and the way i build them into the image will determine this usually a whole complex of associations builds up around an image secondary images are evoked until welldefined patterns of associations based upon sensory perceptions pervade in a very vague way the whole area of a mans experience why is image so central to a mans selfdefinition because all images and especially created images represent a certain way of focusing on the world outside and therefore they represent a certain point of view now if we hold a certain point of view we have automatically emphasized some aspects of reality blocked out others and glossed over the rest and the image which we project or which we perceive is not objective reality but our ownor someone elsesreshaping of reality if it is someone elses reshaping of reality which we perceive then we are within that other persons sphere of influence and can be led to believe whatever he wishes us to believe that a rosebush is pleasant because it has a fragrant smell or that it is unpleasant because it has thorns if these two images of the rosebush are combined into a metaphor we have created images which lead us to make an association between the reality of the rosebush and another level of reality and we can be influenced for instance on a moral level pleasantsmelling roses have unpleasant thorns therefore beware the sweet fragrance of pleasure for underneath it lie hidden the thorns of destruction in this way the association made in the mind of the hearer or reader is controlled by guiding by controlling our associations the imagemaker can and usually does shape our view of reality because the images the words conjure up when they are put together artistically provoke an immediate emotional response in us and dim out of our consciousness all the untold other points of view at our disposal imagemaking is part of all human experience however we are speaking here of the image created by the magic of words we are considering image not so much as life but as literary art art reshapes the raw materials of nature and of human interaction and in so doing interprets reality in a nonanalytical nonintellectual way art thus makes a direct appeal to the senses and calls forth a spontaneous emotional identification with other men and with the universe therefore the effects of the literary image are most often intuitive deep beyond the threshold of reason and common sense when we spoke of the sweet fragrance of pleasure and the thorns of destruction we made an appeal not to reason but to the emotional attractiveness of the images in this way we develop quite aside from our rational perception an intuitive view of nature and of the cosmos and our own relation to it the rose is an old familiar example of how our attitude toward the surrounding environment takes form and grows the body of imagery surrounding the rose is rooted historically deep in western cultural patterns of looking at the world the rose symbolize beauty on the physical level and purity and freshness on the moral level because this imagery is traditional the associations are unquestioned and because they are unquestioned they take on the quality of myth in the case of the rose the imagery may seem harmless but we will see in a moment how such mythbuilding images can be the very death of selfconcept notice too in the case of the rose that man has projected himself into his imagery the purity beauty and freshness of the rose are usually compared to an idealized womankind this is because the natural impetus of man is to impart to the whole cosmos the qualities which he possesses mans imagery is thus anthropomorphic he sees himself or his behavior in every projection he makes thus a flower dances in the breeze the thunder rushes angrily through the skies the sun smiles down on the sleepy noontime village mother earth provides for us it follows that mans selfconcept must inevitably be tied to his view of the universe since he sees his own reflec tion in it at every moment and a reflection of ourselves cannot be neutral it cannot be objective it is either positive or negative how we regard the phenomena of nature is an indication of what we think of ourselves the howling wind for example is not the same image as the whining wind if our literary tradition stresses the howling wind then we feel emotively that a mysterious prowling creature stalks through our universe if the whining wind is stressed we feel the presence of a weak but persistent creature following us constantly around weve said that man projects his image upon the universe but man does not exist in isolation it is far more accurate to say that man projects his cultural and racial images upon the universe and he derives a sense of personal worth from the reflection he sees gazing back at him for he defines himself and the world in terms of others like him he discovers his identity within a group and now we come to the heart of the matter for we cannot judge ourselves unless we see a continuity of ourselves in other people and in things and concepts we question our very right to exist without other existences like our own this is why image is so important to african americans we are black people living in a white world when we consider that the black man sees white cultural and racial images projected upon the whole extent of his universe we cannot help but realize that a very great deal of the time the black man sees a zero image of himself the black child growing into adulthood through a series of weekend movies seeing white protagonists constantly before him projecting the whole gamut of human experience is in extreme cases persuaded that he too must be white or what is more likely he experiences manhood by proxy and in someone elses image he sees in other words a zero image of himself if there are black people on the screen they are subservient to uncomfortably different from or busy emulating the larger allinclusive white culture in that case our young person sees a negative image of himself nor are the images which control personal worth always so direct or obvious the very same imagemyth process which we discovered through the example of the rose is present in the extensive body of color imagery in western culture those associations with black and white have conditioned us to accept white as the symbol of goodness and purity black as the symbol of evil and impurity this did not just happen it is the result of white racial projection of its own best image upon the universe concomitant with that projection for several hundred yearsever since the black man has come within the sphere of influence of the whitethe moral and esthetic associations of black and white have been mixed up with race thus the negative reflection of ourselves is in the white mans system the reverse side of his positive projection of himself the white man has developed a myth of superiority based on images which compare him symbolically with the black man the very fact of this interconnection is at once a holdover from previous bondage and the most effective means of perpetuating that bondage we realize now that we are involved in a blackwhite war over the control of image for to manipulate an image is to control a peoplehood zero image has for a long time meant the repression of our peoplehood of course the black american has not relied totally on the image projected by white culture he has developed a literature and that literature gives him a certain sense of self we have however in spite of ourselves not been successful in destroying zero image for we have not been able to convince ourselves that our image is projected on any but a small and segregated strip of the universe when a selfdefinition has proceeded spontaneously the literature will reflect not only a group consciousness shared points of view common ancestry common destiny and aspirations but it reflects these in spiritual oneness with whatever natural andor supernatural powers preside over and guide that destiny for the black writer the only possibility for spiritual oneness has been nonrace or religious literature but nonrace or religious literature takes on insidiously the image projected by what is called the larger culture and so takes on a white image black writers have also attempted to reflect spiritual oneness by writing within a totally black framework but white images are implanted at the core of black life the most obvious example being that of the church where god is white moreover the black community is not selfsustaining and a literature which would circumvent this essential feature of peoplehood cannot cope with the forces that shape us for the most part though black writers have avoided these two pitfalls and our literature has been as we have slowly painfully coming out of bondage and has been contributing to our growing sense of peoplehood if black writers have historically concentrated on whiteblack animosity it is because that animosity is an everyday fact of life and functional part of our universe the artist then is the guardian of image the writer is the mythmaker of his people we still at times are not sure as to how much of our image is us to what extent we are the sole authors of our myth our peoplehood there are those white people who would nullify any argument we advance on the basis that it is advanced in a white language and it is true that languages project a specific cultural image but i believe that we have arrived at a stage of selfawareness in our writing which sees this type of argument as irrelevant our very plain answer to this sophisticated argument is simply that we will not let white men define our peoplehood by telling us were still using white tools to create it similarly we must reject white attempts at portraying black reality they are valid only in terms of the white mans projection of himself they have no place in the definition of blackness for they reveal the white writers attempt to work through his own cultural guilt fascination with blackness or sense of spiritual emptiness this includes all latterday harriet beecher stowes no one can hand us a peoplehood complete with prefabricated images even the word black is a translation from the portuguese slave term negro gone into the english language as negro but black is also the generalized term which we use to symbolize unity of origin whether we are called anglophone francophone coloured mulatto west indian or american negro by the white imagemakers black is the highly imagistic term we use to do away with all such division ary euphemisms it is the term we use to destroy the myth based on the complex of images which polarize black and white these images must be mythically torn down ritually destroyed we cannot bury our heads before the existing body of myth nor before our own europeanization therefore we cannot return nostalgically to a past heritage and pretend that historical continuity exists in anything but fragmentary form we cannot block out the blackwhite struggle for control of image and create a utopianized world of allblack reflections our work at this stage is clearly to destroy the zero and the negative imagemyths of ourselves by turning them inside out to do this we reverse the symbolism and we use that reverse symbolism as the tool for projecting our own image upon the universe zero image and the need to work through it is not a new concept many black writers have understood the importance of image and ralph ellison in the early fifties stated the same intent metaphorically in the title and outer structure of his novel invisible man what is new i believe is the deliberate desecration and smashing of idols the turning insideout of symbols to which black writers are now proceeding with a vengeance bitterness which runs through the whole of black literature is being replaced by wrath a sense of frustration is giving way before a sense of power it is the sense of power which proceeds from a mythic consciousness based on a peoples positive view of themselves and their destiny perhaps we can best conclude with an illustration of the processes weve been discussing the following poem attempts to desecrate the mythical and beautiful figure of the muse entrenched in white culture since the time of its earliest flowering grecoroman antiquity dorothy sterling the author of the captain of the planter has penned another delightful book for our childrentear down these walls doubleday whether that is a plea or a command her treatment of the civil_rights movement is one of the more understanding ones for youngsters miss sterling opens with the tired feet theory of rosa parks which we suspect is being a bit overplayed we hope some promising young novelist visits mrs parks before she fades from us and some honkie does his confessions that is not however the tone of the book from montgomery we move to africa from which we were forcibly abducted miss sterling quite correctly points out that millions were murdered so that thousands could be brought to these shores as slaves included in the book is a diagram of a slave ship the most efficient slave ship in fact which is itself worth the price of the book she doesnt bother our children with any unproven tales of africans selling each other for a few white women who were never worth a good black man or a couple bottles of coke nor does she fill that section with such horrors that our children would be loathe to continue reading though she speaks of the forced marches to the coast of up to miles in some cases and of the greed of the western nations that often caused them to attempt to leave a pregnant woman about to deliver on the road alone and then to kill her husband when he asks to be left with her she does a commendable job of describing the horrors the africans must surely have felt without instilling fear into the reader she doesnt go beyond her subject or the possible knowledge of her young readers with tales of the hebrew nation suffering almost as much as we but she tells our story with such compassion and understanding that it is difficult to believe she is nonblack if suffering is indeed a virtue then we are perhaps the most virtuous people of all we leave the slave ships and return to montgomery where dr martin_luther_kings home is bombed he counsels love for our enemy nonviolence turn the other cheek many of us regret that dr_king was not able to turn his other cheek in memphis we move from montgomery to greensboro and the start of the largest mass movement since garveythe in movement sit stand walk wade pray die in the united states as she describes the busburning in anniston which moved the john f kennedy administration to consider the freedom rides a moral issue her concise analytical mind helps prevent her from maligning the late president his late brother and from negating some very brave acts by our people though miss sterling is too shy to say it only a fool or a god would walk into a jungle with only his love to keep him the outstanding chapters deal with immigrants as has been pointed out many times before the white people and italians came to america for freedomwe came to be enslaved they came to own propertywe came to be property they came to claim their manhood we came to lose ours they came for religious freedomwe came to lose our gods some came running as james jones once said to love and be lovedwe came fighting back to hate and be hated she doesnt try to clean up slavery with the theyareheathens wearechristians nonsense she fairly presents our side of the question that as was pointed out in ten black writers respond to the south couldnt afford fire insurance because the slaves were burning them out that armed organized resistance was great and the fear of it greater that we never accepted an attitude of slavery in this context watts is fully in line with black history detroit is comparable to charleston newark but a reiteration of southampton we would like to have seen some holes punched into the theory that old tom gave vesey away if denmark vesey could organize men into an army while under the closest scrutiny any men have been under then no single one of them could upset the plans or as big mabel used to sing so sweetly one monkey doesnt stop the show and im here to tell him so just as the british captured jomo kenyatta the french murdered frantz fanon the cia poisoned richard wright the honkie period has murdered and imprisoned every freedom fighter they could the fight goes on just as malcolm was murdered rap and stokely sprang up and as they were being silenced somebody the honkie hadnt even heard of started killing policemen in cleveland the fight goes on that old theory that a tom broke up our biggest army just does not hold water because any man or group of men who could organize that well would have had the sense to organize around any possible slipups of that nature but white people want us to think we are our worst enemies that the only reason we havent wiped them out is that we dont trust each other maybe we dont but we havent been telling him either if the slaves were so loquacious how was it that harriet tubman was able to return again and again for the underground railroad even those afraid to make the break were not going to tell on those who were ready to go even the term we have for traitor uncle tom is not an adequate description for our reaction to it uncle tom died rather than tell we ought to keep these things in mind just because he wasnt able he didnt turn his people in you have to go to gunga din as john killens points out before you find a traitor and hes truly a white mans fantasy tear down these walls is a good concise history the logical progression of truths and the welcomed absence of confusing words makes it a valuable addition to any youngsters library so often in histories especially about black people those writing history or what pretends to be history are just not logical we can well imagine the day when someone will write of this period the murderous sixties as a time when black people rebelled and were killed at the approximate rate of to which will be as illogical as some of the writings weve endured on the previously preconstructed centuries how could it be my grandchild the next group of poems beginning with negritude and ending with a view from the white helmet reveal the perceptions and sensibilities of a poet who conducts his thought and expression very much in the manner of an apparently unassuming gadflywhich is to say that in emanuel we are to encounter yet another kind of ellison whose individuality of viewpoint and smoothness of expression is bound to offend the more tribalminded among the black conscious indeed a poet is revealed whose singular toughness and keenness of mind and fancy is almost hidden by an apparent absence of any interest in the current fondness for and preoccupation with stunning spatial innovations that stress uniqueness in form and word arrangement indeed in emanuel we encounter a poet who leans in the very unfashionable direction of not so verylongago traditional devices such as rhymed quatrains and regularity of line and stanza length yet for all of this we are faced with a formidable deadly serious and technically assured and even mischievous talent there is here a verbal dexterity and tightness not unworthy of a brooks and an emotional steadiness and resiliency underneath the light humorous gentle unassuming surface that will grip your fondest notions and make them scream out as they are carried unceremoniously under tq repeat the ideas the subjects dealt with and the very strikingly bold and personal handling they all receive will hardly make this poet popular with those super blacks and super biggers whose common notion of revolutionary relevance and sense of urgency lead them to view with simple hostility any writing by any black man that is good by virtue of precision and subtlety of phrase rather than simpleness and consciously unantiliterary directness there is to be no stretching out with words that makes the least uncommon demand on the peoples imagination allah forbid thus jones first two volumes of poetry preface and the dead lecturer are largely viewed as dangerously preblack to pursue these brothers and sisters further these are the people who find no difficulty in neatly distinguishing blacks from negroes universalists from nittygritty soul experts the lost wouldsowantto be whites from properly dedicated and pure liberated militants and afros ask them what is blackness and you would never get the mercifully optional though very elaborate and lengthy list that brother poet emanuel offers in the first piece of this group nor would many of the individual things itemized escape the blackstarched indignation of the secure and very black whether statements contained in the following rearranged series of couplets might or might not stand a brothers chance of passing depends on the degree of presumption and blackerthan thouness one is willing to exercise there we have it a list as thoroughgoing as it is incomplete but then is not the elaborate catalogue structure of the poem a sufficient commentary in itself on the inadequacy of all definitions especially those that must depend on enumerating individual items such as those found here even the element of surprise which challenges the readers personal notion of what is true of blackness is used by brother emanuel and very effectively to reenforce just that very point all definitions are inadequate and especially those that rely on enumeration general head countingthat is taking general survey or pollis a process of enumerating another bristling example from this same group of poems the negro takes us by a more direct route deeper into the question of defining blackness deeper into the thicket where blackmaneating fleshstripping bloodgulping uniquefeatureliquidating creatures roamcreatures hitherto the exclusive pets of white criticreviewers called universals the poem leads us deeper into an awareness of the pitfalls of definition by leaving us with the weird impression that some black writers are as white as their critics meaning that they use the white critics trick of denying a human shape to black experience by setting a hostile pack of preconceived notions upon it or viewed another way black experience is forced before a mirror that reflects nothing actual or concrete about what is placed before it the least tendency to depart from the blankness of such a mirror of such an arbitrary and preconceived standard is labeled insignificant if not altogether nonexistent the blankness itself is labeled universal man or just man in the abstract it once appeared that black minds were calling the white minds bluff when they would say universal man is just an abstraction sweetheart now it would seem that instead of calling the white critics bluff these words were simply intended to swipe his thunder for abstractions in a black mouth are just as sweet to some is not every black mans black man an abstraction too emanuel seems to be clearly suggesting as much in his poem the negro so formal definition itself it would seemat least the scientific dictionary way of arriving at and conveying meaningis a process of excluding the fullblooded uniqueness and significance of people and things definitions are a very strict rigid spiritkilling fleshdismissing way of regarding life the fate of being defined by them is much like the fate of a living language in the grip of a school grammar the threat of being defined justifies all of the apprehensive restlessness that these lines from gwendolyn brooks a lovely love leaves vibrating in the ear do i see any hands questions comments wolf tickets a very good question indeed sister even an improvement on the brothers silence over there this poem is indeed a very sound place for getting down with it to the matter of a black aesthetic we need only reflect on leaves of a color hard to name and we have begun in earnest to be deeply black deeply involved in the mystery of memories and time and placea place such as the title poem invites us to to every man his treehouse what has this poets fondness of things vital and green and alive turning and changing in peril and pregnancywhat has all this to do with fondling a black aesthetic why have we been backed into this irritationarea of trees part of the not so simple answer is given in emanuels more vernacular get up blues just promised someone not to go on telling more and moreespecially about fishermen or even try conveying the delightful humor of pieces like the voyage of jimmy poo the darker more matteroffact teasing to which brother emanuel subjects the colonialist oppressors in a view from the white helmet nor the strong fun and substance of freedom rider washout i will admit though and by way of conclusion that this would have been a mercifully shorter pieceand a far more incisive one toohad i simply enlisted brother lerois swift twilight touch to pay even passing tribute to what brother emanuel has achieved and said so well and masterfully here in the treehouse and other poems for instance jones style would have conveyed swiftly and simply both emanuels own style and content what is arbitrarily labelled black revolutionary theatre in the summer issue of the drama review is actually a catchall phrase to describe the political philosophy and aesthetic attitude of many young black rebellious playwrights the editors of tdr were largely influenced by the above factor in their decision to give ed bullins resident playwright at the new lafayette theatre unprecedented freedom to edit this issue at his discretion for it is a reasonable assumption that only a negro writer can express the thoughts and feelings of other negroes in a nation that often ignores the black presence in the midst of american culture an important and unique aspect of black awareness is present in this collection of essays and oneact plays leroi jones is undoubtedly the prophet behind this black arts movement whose converts believe that the contradictions between ethics and aesthetics in western society are symptomatic of a dying society these ideas expressed by the poetessayist larry neal are greatly expanded in the opening article of this issue black writers represented here have attempted collectively to expose and destroy the repressive degrading drama of white america through an ethical political and cultural revolution no more will they engage in the falsification of actuality as advocated by the ideas and actions of whites especially as they relate to the black man and his cultural heritage a manifesto for a black aesthetic is echoed throughout this issue questions are raised concerning ultimates such as truth ethics and morals the ideology behind the movement is clearer however than the artistic form used to express it an attempt to convey the content of black experience prior to the creation of a unique theatrical form has resulted in the recreation of naturalism perhaps this traditional form is most suitable to the sociopolitical context of black revolutionary drama bullins has collected a group of new plays to express black consciousness rather than essays and articles because drama has the potential to evoke immediate action most of the oneacters represented here are unable structurally to support the weight of characters and ideas too often the playwright is bellowing at the white beast who denies his voice papas daughter by dorothy ahmad take care of business by marvin x and claras ole man by ed bullins are the few plays that speak directly to black america a particular kind of human experience is spoken of through these plays in a few cases the authors have found a suitable dramatic form through which to explore elements of black expression what is important is whether the theatrical experience images the truth of human action and the beauty of the human spirit and absence of dramatic form in most of these plays is replaced by content that speaks to all mankind either directly or indirectlyfloyd gaffney i would like to take some issue with your editorial on chauncey warrington hildreth iii esq which appeared in the november edition first it is quite childish and shallow at a time when we truly need depth and perception second it speaks in broad generalities and stereotypes much like those of the segregationist reactionary press which portray all negroes in an all too familiar insulting vein third it is silly and offers nothing positive or constructive it is criticism of the immature type and i think we have enough shallow thinking and behavior from those who oppose racial progress and as a group striving for improvement we cannot indulge in that luxury but apart from those rather general criticisms let us try to analyze the picture portrayed so critically with innuendo and invective let us try to add a bit of intelligence to a very trite and contrived portrayal cwh iii is supposed to have a good job the only of his group with some ficticious firm this must mean that he is in the salary bracket which in most cases is a junior executive of between and years of age cwh iii was born between and if as is indicated he went through schools that were integrated in the s and s he was indeed quite rare also in the s and s the days of depression of amos and andy stepin fetchit etc if he went to integrated schools he certainly took much abuse was poked fun at ignored and discouraged by his teachers denied all participation in the ordinary social activities of his school probably given grades lower than he deserved may have been barred from participation in athletics and was certainly barred from such things as restaurants plays and other forms of public convenience if as the article indicates he got through this difficult period and still had what it takes to go on to college he was probably quite a guy being in the age group it is likely he served in segregated armed forcesquartermasters in the army cook in the navyduring world war ii he had none of the advantages of the training and opportunity for advancement now found in the services if he went to an integrated college then he had to compete on better than equal terms with his white counterparts he probably worked at odd jobs to help pay his way through school even if his parents were professionals few made very much during the depression years and not until some time after the war was there real prosperity among negro professionals but the point here is that cwh iii had to compete with the cards stacked against him on the basis of his individual abilitieswith little or no help from faculty or teachers if he went to an integrated schooland probably a great deal of downright hostility and discouragement again he would have been effectively barredif as you indicate he attended an integrated university from all the normal activities of university life you state his parents were professional people do you have any conception of what it meant to obtain professional status in the s if cwh iii is in his s his parents must be in their s that means they were in college in the s to get a professionalor any other degree in the s was rare and required the utmost perseverance fortitude and luck cwh ills father certainly must have worked as a waiter or probably ran the road as a pullman porter he must have worked extremely hard to attain professional statuspass licensing exams that were rigged to prevent negroes from entering professionsif a physician all medical schools were closed except howard or meharry the article completely ignores the atmosphere of the s and s when the klan was a respectable organization lynchings were common and all doors were closed to negroes of ability further if his parents had the courage to live in an integrated neighborhood then they are to be admired in fact it is likely that one or both died prematurely as the strain imposed on the negro with ability and ambition in the s and s generally took its toll in a reduced life span now we have chauncey iii in a good job what does this mean is all now peaches and cream the article would so imply nothing further is needed simply collect the fat pay check and be arrogant well if cwh iii is in fact the only negro in a white firm he has a hard hard way to go the brief case in the picture had better be filled with plenty of work to do at home and on weekends for if he does not produce and produce better than his white counterparts he is out there is likely some bright young caucasian fresh out of harvard or yale dating the vice presidents daughter breathing down his neck and envying his job cwh iii is still barred from the places that really count in the power structurethat is the private clubs golf courses etc where real decisions are made he had better work hard and produce on ability or he will go to work one day and find someone else at his desk in other words cwh iii is in the real world now with its infighting and struggles for power which the average negro especially it seems negro digest has absolutely no comprehension he must fight every day and must fight with one arm tied behind his back and one eye closed as he can never be where the real decisions are made or be on the social terms which in todays world insure success and mobility thus in a time when the group is desperately striving to raise itself the virtues of chauncey iiidiscipline ability fortitude neatness and the courage to face the majority group alone on its own termsshould be virtues for admiration no other minority group decries its own who have succeeded or demands a rigid standard of conformity to patterns which debase achievement and equate success with rejection no program for involvement of the socalled black middle class is advocated in the article what precisely is it negro digest wants what program is laid out what goals what objectiveswhere is there anything but the most trite of commonplace generalities when cwh iii comes home after a hour day worried about the bright young fellow after his job and out of the inner circle at the office what is he supposed to do the things required of cwh iii on a daytoday basis are the things that must be achieved by black people as a whole if they are to progress these are not western virtues or the socalled alien culture of the majority group but the disciplines that are required in every modern society whether it be in the us europe asia or elsewhere and without regard to racein other words the disciplines of the modern world without these effort is a waste of time which i suspect chauncey iii must feel about some of the childish unrealistic ravings of socalled negro leaders what the modern world requires is discipline organization ability which is not instant but takes a long long time self criticism personal neatness and good personal conduct especially the ability to be quiet and in the modern technological world these can only be obtained by facing the power structure on its own terms in other words the skills and insights chauncey is obtaining must be obtained by the group as a whole if we are to succeed not because they are the mores of an alien culture forced upon unwilling black people but because this is the way the world operates and its either get in or stay out that we have no concept of this is evident from the printing of the chauncey iii article whether we like it or not the world of chauncey iii is the world and we had better develop a cadre of people who have been exposed to it and its pressures you certainly do not gain this type of experience by pretending you dont need it for your magazine to decry in a childish superficial way these necessities is simply evidence of what a long long way we have to go and how pathetic are some of thoseie negro digestwho seek to show the way does the negro digest advocate that cwh iii quit his job and go to work in the ghetto would this really help all trained negroes cant give up their professions to work in the ghetto this is pure folly it would be counter productive and severely limit the types of training contacts and insights that must be acquired if we are to move forward despite his appearance of luxury if cwh iii is a junior executive his salary is not large enough to permit much financial help if he is to keep up appearances that are as much required by his job as is coming to work on time perhaps he could do moreand probably would if properly approachedbut he is a long way from the affluence that permits large donations to causesregardless of their merit and if he is perceptive he is not going to give to groups that show a lack of responsibility discipline and objective programs if he is sophisticated enough to have come through the trials and tribulations of your indicated integrated background then he can surely see through those leaders who approach every problem with an open mouth and whose real motivation is ego in any case to limit and find worth in any one sphere of activity is counterproductive negroes must advance on all fronts acquire as many skills as possible or otherwise you have a self imposed prison that is easily surrounded handledand since the leadership is inbred and unsophisticatedeasily dismissed riots or not riots the black mans place in this society is at the bottom and he is controllable his thrashing about apart from being a good way for tv news media to increase its ratings are really little more than pinpricks in the power structure the worst possible thing is to overestimate your power and importance now back to chauncey iii what can he do in his job first negroes generally being unsophisticated as is so evident from reading negro di gest have no conception of how things are really done chauncey iii is in the scheme in which he operates at a very low level he cannot waive a wand and bring in more negroes at the earliest with all the obstacles he faces in years he might be at high enough position to make some impact the socalled big jobs that the johnson pubications harp about are really quite little and insignificant in the real scheme of things and even when a negro obtains a really powerful jobie a cabinet memberhe still must play according to the rules or he will not have his job long in other words he must play exactly the same game that every one else in the power structure operates underthat is discipline planning and above all no rash or emotional acts therefore there is only a limited number of things he can do that will show immediate assistance to the negro masses but this is the way things are played have been played and will be played in this country and in all other countries in the modern world for you cannot run away and find any road to instant success and there is nothing anyone least of all the socalled negro leaders can do about itviolently or otherwise up is a long term hard job and we had better prepare our youth for discipline training selfsacrifice and good conduct if they are to make it now supposing other minorities say the jewish grouphad imposed the silly selfdefeating rule that every one had to subvert his own personal progress for group service without any real monetary reward jews would still be running little corner stores and helping each other to speak english instead they made individual achievement the hallmark and excellence and personal selfsacrifice to attain personal achievement as the method of progress their group responsibilities were great and demanding but they were done quietly there were no open mouth jewish leadersand with good organization their most competent sophisticated provide the leadership and the contacts to move the group as a whole there was no either or approach does negro digest think for one moment that jews would decry one of their group who attained financial success and all its attributes rather he would be the hero and the model for others to emulatewhich is exactly what has occurred only the negro foolishly decries his own achievements if all the chaunceys in the country gave up their jobs and went to work in the ghetto the only thing that would be accomplished is more confusion in fact working in the ghetto is probably the last thing the socalled instant negro leaders really want as their positionsbased largely on egotistical emotional charismatic appeals and simple solutions the same techniques used by george wallace et alwould be threatened therefore whether negro digest or socalled instant negro leaders like it or not chauncey iii will probably make it and make it in a very substantial way if his virtues are imitatedas other groups have imitated the virtues of its successfulthen many will make progress for despite all difficulties and frustrations there is some progress if they are ignored and deprecated and instead slovenliness loudness lack of organization lack of discipline and lack of working hard to take advantage of training opportunities are passed off as maintaining our cultural heritage then the children of these people will and will forever be the maids and dishwashers of chauncey iv let us see negro digest make some intelligent sophisticated proposals which after reading the digest i doubt is possiblealthough it would be refreshing to see and honest if bungled try for involving chauncey or try asking chauncey for his ideas and dont react with customary immature emotion and ravings of uncle tom instead try listening to his suggestions but whatever is done do it quietly dont advertise your lack of sophistication ive always known that i was a second class citizen in my beloved country america but somewhere along the way this made me try harder to earn my share of it and enjoy it i think i enjoy it more and am prouder because i did have to prove myself i know i shouldnt have had to do this but since i did im glad i had the determination not to bask in defeat every time i talked to other people who were always finding excuses for not trying blaming their failure on everyone but themselves reminded me that even though my parents were professionals who brought me up in a stable middle class neighborhood i knew that they were probably not always middle class and had worked hard and stuck to it to become socalled middle class you know when you become a middle class negro you pay taxes property taxes the land that go to help our less fortunate black brothers and sisters and you hope with all your might that they will use it to benefit themselves and not give up because you see that just about all socalled middle class negroes got theirs the hard way against odds that their donations to the naacp and the urban league have helped to eliminate during these protest years they might have been working on two jobs to pay the everrising property tax now they didnt really have to look for a job they were already there waiting for them and looking for someone to do them no one should envy the middle class negro because if things are as bad as they are supposed to be he must have a pretty hard time getting to be middle class as you call it now i know that with a lot of cooperation from all thinking people white and black working with a lot of white employers all of a sudden there are a lot of jobs going begging stop look and listen things are better stop bristling and march with us to a better world not perfect but if we all help it will be better this is the only country we have we dont know what another country would be like we cannot fight until we get every narrow minded person to admit that they wronged a people years ago but we dont need them instead of us wallowing in the defeats of the past leave them behind and come with the middle class negro that is if a middle class negro is a property tax payer look at the blocks and blocks of black taxpayers this means that we have a concern for our school windows and other destruction that our poor misguided children have been led to believe that only whitey has to pay for i can see what youll say if you ever read this but i feel that we dont have to ask if we can control our neighborhood i will contribute towards this i feel like i would like to stop begging now and do please dont take my freedom of speech away if i do not agree with the extremists please dont take away my freedom to say it i can not say that the middle class negro has not helped in the struggle but if you want more help you will have to meet us half way im willing to give a little if you are and maybe we can have a meeting of the minds come out from under and expose some of the good negroes we have teachers lawyers doctors newspapers and a lot of people who are willing to help we cannot fight individuals or well fight the longest war of history come black brothers i havent the time to wait for you but i am hoping that you join me and do your share to build a better world
riding on the ebony wings of black pride and black sel fdetermination has been the burgeoning interest in all things appurtenant to the black americans traditional heritage not the least of which has been an assiduity to discover a black language apart from gullah one that would uplift unify inspire and glorify the black man to fill this need a few years ago some people gravitated to kiswahili swahili perhaps because it was the only african language they had heard about almost to the point of cliche gee dont all africans speak swahili and of course swahili was the source of that great word uhuru symbolizing the elusive concept of freedom somewhere along the line it turned out that swahili s bright image got tarnished for one thing soon afterwards a horde of denigrating whites started ridiculing the very idea of black folk wasting their time learning an uncivilized jungle language and how these whites questioned could swahili be a symbol of the new black man when it had once been employed by rapacious slave traders it didnt seem to bother these critics that a lot of white people have wasted their time in studying swahili as evidenced by the curious fact that percent of all swahili grammar books are whiteauthored in america nor did they seem unnerved by the fact that the usedbyslave traders charge could be equally cast against english spanish french german portuguese and a lot of other languages deemed more appropriate for black folk to be concerned with for example some of these instant swahili experts suggested that swahili was spoiled because of the influence of arabic upon its vocabulary great slavers those arabs and proceeded to urge upon blacks the study of the west african language hausa they were ignorant to the truth that most flausas are muslims by religion and that their language has also been influenced by arabic so much so that the very hausa word for god is allah a veritable linguistic war broke out in the district of columbia recently when some high schoolers had the audacity to demand use of the taxpayers money to introduce swahili as a regular foreign language in the high school curriculum exacerbating matters was the knowledge that d cs school system had for years turned out scores of functional illiterates who could not speak good english a demand for swahili was looked upon by many as a sure disaster and as a dangerous obstruction to preparing alreadydeprived children to enter the mainstream of respectable responsible american life at worst such a demand was considered an act of sabotage against the educational system and at best an irrelevant diversion over the years my interest in language and communication has led me to learn several languages in high school my eagerness made me borrow with permission a spanish grammar a full year before was scheduled to take the schools spanish course and in college bowie state of spiro agnew fame due to my entering in the second semester i was a whole semester behind everyone else in the french class but in my zeal i wound up by achieving one of the few as given in class at another time in high school i once greatly irritated my civics teacher by writing the first paragraph of an essay on communism sovyershit vid kommunist na narodye in russian while during a few lean months some years past when i was out of work i kept out of trouble by studying the bible in hebrew bereshith barn elohim et hashamayyim wa et haaretz i began to learn swahili when concern for my african heritage bloomed in the blood of martvr dr martin_luther_king jr the trauma produced by his brutal murder turned me inward toward blackness away from honky america and her honky institutions values and language not being content merely with textbook study i contacted the tanzanian embassy in d cwriting in swahili naturally since it is tanzanias national languageand arranged to receive a swahili newspaper i also scouted around for some black swahilispeaking penpals i now have ten then after about six months of study i decided to move closer to africas west coast and added hausa and yoruba to my continuing study of swahili acquiring in the process two yoruba penpals and getting wrapped up in the politics of the nigerian civil war but thats another story finally i ran across the white swahili scholar and author basic structure of swahili jim brain who is currently an associate professor of anthropology at the state university college in new york and we began exchanging correspondence in swahili the purpose of all this background is to separate what i am about to conclude from the senseless inaccurate assertions of the myriad of swahili detractors who abound today who try to substitute bias for knowledge in the first place the objections to a few black people learning swahili are utterly ridiculous swahili is no more nor any less than any other foreign language it is neither magic nor poison knowing how to speak it is no panacea for the black americans ills but neither will its study retard him in arty way if it is not entirely the very quintessence of uhuru neither is it the very embodiment of colonialism kiswahili is a bantu african language native to africas east coast about or ad arab settlers and merchandise traders in that area intermarried with bantu natives and thus introduced some arabic terms into the lanuage and still later the islamic religion among the africans there subsequent commerce slavery and colonialism caused the inclusion into swahili of some indian and english terms but the grammatical structure of swahili has remained bantu african throughout all this activity none of these borrowed foreign words changes the fact that swahili is an african language any more than the large quantity of borrowed latin and french words changes english from a germanic to a romance language knowing how to speak swahili wont conjure up miracles for the hardpressed black american the mental disciplining derived from its study might enliven the mind and promote good study habits in other areas but merely intoning uhuru unlike the mythical shazzam wont turn anyone into a captain marvel nor will it put money in the pocket or food on the table in honky america it is a serious fact of life that learning honky english kimombo is a swahili term for english mumbojumbo to africans is of much more immediate benefit than learning how to speak swahilior french or spanish for that matter none of this is meant to suggest that studying swahili is conversely a waste of time if a black child is interested and advanced enough to undertake the study of a foreign language swahili is definitely as useful as any european language with the advantage of being distinctively african even though swahili words are easier to pronounce than those of tone languages like yoruba swahili grammar presents a mental challenge it is very involved and very precise similar to latin in these respects a student who has real trouble learning english had better forget about swahili learning correct swahili actually requires a great amount of skill and concentration but at the same time such study can be made very interesting and relevant if tied in with a study of african life and heritage after all africa not just west africa is the home of the black man and swahili and swahilispeakers are not foreign to our heritage a common blackness and a common experience with slavery and colonialism and neocolonialism makes us all kinsmen in fact and experience using swahili or some other african language can open up a wealth of doors to interesting and fruitful friendships sure most educated africans can speak english or french but many of them would prefer to use their own languages several tanzanians have impressed this fact upon me and it was a point effectively made by members of kenyas olympic track team the danger inherent in the putdown of swahili by most people is that it implies also that the validity relevance and usefulness of all other african languages is doubtful for the purists who pursue a banal sectionalism by asserting that afroamericans have little in common with east africans because our ancestors were primarily west africans suggest that they agitate for more recognition and instruction of ede yoruba bakin hausa ibo ashanti or mandingo in the educational systems of this land however for those who want knowledge of a black african language that is beautiful logical wellconstructed challenging and abounding in written material swahili has few equals in short swahili has the usual assets and liabilities of any other foreign language except that the black highschooler of the aware generation might be more interested in whats going on in the congo angola kenya or tanzania than in the action in some obscure village in peru or france while language of itself cannot teach culture it certainly need not be divorced from culture and can be excellently employed as a springboard for the study of culture and heritage kwa haya kiswahili huweza kuwa samani ya manufaa katika makolokolo ya kujifahamu ya mweusi pia baada ya kufikiri dhana za kiswahili mintarafu uhuru kujitegemea ljjamaa na upinduzi kwa muda kidogo ajuaye ni nani my any black youth are becoming involved in the process which they term revolution revolution black revolution we hear these cries echoing from the campuses to the ghettos across the face of america today but many of these youth i find alarmingly in much of their basic outlook perhaps unconsciously imitate the western newleft whites much of the same sterile marxist jargon of these whites with the usual references to lenin trotsky castro etc comes to mind even some of our most fiery young spokesmen are constantly quoting albert camus as a reference i propose that these youth are deeply misguided and in their references are still operating within the trance of the whiteeyes the west they are still under western controlthe radical wing of the western establishments captive negroes many of these youth when questioned closely after breaking through the mystique of the gunfetish guns baby guns the gun as extended penis an adolescent manhood symbol really seek an integrated marxistsocialist america revolutionary integration so to speak which has always been within western radical tradition as an ultimate solution for american social development in this essay i speak of a concept of black revolution totally different from the sterile western forms and concepts i speak of a spiritual internal revolution which will create new people new men a revolution which will follow in el hajj malik el shabazzs malcolm_xs footsteps to relink afroamerica with the afroasian east a revolution which will restore the mind and soul of the black man to his ancestral rhythms and ancient spirituality while many of these undisciplined youth shout of guns which will eventually become necessary for survival i agree and getting whitey how many of them would be able to begin the most basic internal revolution to uplift their moral and spiritual natures and uproot the decadence and spiritual and moral diseases that haunt the psyches of all who fall victim to the western way of life ill wager that many cannot even admit that we are and have been a mentally and morally sick people it is my belief that the end result of this revolution will be new forms political cultural spiritualwhich will crystalize into a new black civilization here in the west which will ultimately change the moral spiritual and political outlook of the entire planet earth what our youth must realize is that one cannot defeat the west by using western formsbeat the devil at his own game so to speak and marxist materialism is the most dangerous form the west has used to ensnare the minds of black people we have the writings of harold cruse to attest to this fact i would add that were not against socialism or communalism as leroi jones says this is the natural way for men to live what we are against however is the western atheistic denial of godallah moulder and shaper of the universe which is totally against our spiritual nature as black people and actually reflects the white western intellectuals estrangement from his religion western christianitywhich is whiteys internal problem not ours in a great sense this fundamental nonwestern revolution has already begun and has been in progress for the last few years one has only to observe the dress images and changing lifestyles of a growing number of black youth outside of the marxist movement to discern this phenomenon it is as though an african nation were rising here in the west to quote a black spiritual leader el hajj ameer hassan my brothers and sisters are returning to themselves donning their ancestral robes once again returning to their true religion philosophies and lifestyles this process this easternization or reafricanization is coming to them from the vibrations of allah in the atmosphere the air they breathe the water they drink nothing is more startling than to see the robes of africa in the subways and the gray ghettos of this land which robbed us of our heritage and seemingly turned us into frankensteinnegroes a people without past or future it is this process which again is the true revolution that our people are making and this is the path which should be explored selfconsciously by our leading young minds in this credo essay i attempt to move in this direction the black magi i have at last found the kind of personal identity that i desire as a black man i know that when first turned from the westernized revolutionary intellectual path into an eastern direction i became worried about my new role my personal identity if i wasnt a revolutionary intellectual if this was a white thinga leftist white thingthen what was i how to define to the inner self this eastern orientation i had always in my revolutionary intellectual days shunned the poet in me in those days i saw the poet through western radical eyes as a feeble little versifier only content to put rhymes on paper talking hard but really out of it in terms of guns revolutionary politics community organization etc but now thanks to my continued striving jihad and growth i have returned to myself i no longer shun the poet in me for i now see a greater deeper definition of poet and artist in the eastern sense returning to the book muntu and correspondingly the writings of poetphilosopher aime cesaire and the philosophers of both african eastern culture i began to discover the poet as priest as sorcerer a black magician from magi hence imagnation whose sole duty is to raise the collective consciousness of his black people the black nation and prepare them for revolution and the seizure of their collective destinies by creating an inner revolution of the soul transmuting them from negroes into an eastern people once again this role of poet as priest seer holyman and finally prophet has given me a muchneeded dignity and added a new dimension to my life i now choose as my models the great priests of ancient egypt ethiopia the black magi of ancient persia elam and the learned shiekhs of timbuctu my sole duty in life now is the elevation of my race and the shaping of black people here into a great new nation rising upon the ruins of a crumbling decadent america doomed to go down hard screaming and blubbering in the flames of her filthy murders and spiritual doom i now see myself and my brothers as the embodiment of the soul of my nation the living vessel of its myths rituals aspirations and future world view we the new black artists and thinkers are evolving into its conscience voice and living archetypes in the age of the third world the coming world order we the new black artists and thinkers are the harbingers of a new spiritual dawn when the wretched billions of humanity will arise from the degradation of this evil barbaristic white age and reclaim their lost heritage by returning to their original selves and uniting with the evolving cosmos of god to restore civilization to our planet we the new holymen and shiekhs of the black nation must serve as the living mind and holy soul of the coming black nation the guardians the warriorprophets the lovers of man everywhere we are we must put down roots and sacrifice our time in service to black people the nation by teaching them new ways and helping them to elevate their minds magi spreading the healing light of black consciousness and national being there must not be any great contradictions in our own lives for we must serve as living examples to our peopleas brother malcolm peace be upon him didin order for them to advance with confidence and unity they must come to feel that the new brothers and sisters are above reproach in their actions would never under any circumstances let them down or sell them out this will be a difficult task at first for we are all filled with white western contradictions in our minds but we must strive greatly jihad to remove this cancer from our spirits and establish eastern models and forms to live by for the eastern world africa included is the originator of human civilization and of all things godlike and spiritual upon our planet identity and nationhood our thrust then would be to rtstore the spiritual links with our racial ancestors we are west africans in captivity we must rekindle the energies and tap the root sources that gave rise to ghana mali songhai and the moorish empire we must link these redis covered roots to our africanamerican soul culture in order to become a whole people once again we must strive to restore what chattel slavery destroyed a the black national identity b religion and cosmology c communal family structure we must transform our imitation white lifestyle into a positive black cultural form we must restore the ancient rhythms that raised the race once we change from imitation or carboncopy white forms into truly black eastern forms we will purify our psyches so that the wisdom of our illustrious ancestors will return to usintuitively one cannot expect spiritual light to shine through a corrupted vessel such spiritual ways as islam african cultural teachings and yoga its philosophy spiritual training and physical therapy will prove helpful in restoring our harmony with the cosmosalong with the eastern martial arts evolution will be our slogan evolution evolution change the forms change the images of selfour selves change into the new that is old the ancient that is here again african and eastern dress wearing the long dress or west african wraps for our sisters black woman give beastina back her whorish miniskirts bellbottoms dykesuits evolve eastwards into your african princess self the dashikis and burnooses for our brothers give the ivyleague back its togs black man the buttondown world is crumbling along with the furnishing and decoration of our homes in an african and eastern manner all of these revolutionary changes in our lifestyles forms will help free our black souls from the stranglehold of the dying west dietary changes you are the food you eat oink oink oink many brothers and sisters have not only given up reactionary food the filthy hog but have gone further eastwards by becoming vegetarians and adding to their mental and physical health by using herb teas to cleanse their systems and other health foods speech how we speak what we say languagelanguage helps shape thought identity being we must releam rediscover the history and languages of our ancestors arabic yoruba swahili hausa etcin order to become a whole people once again we must become nationbuilders think nation be nation in our minds in our hearts be be be become the new emerging from the ashes of the old identity will spirit strivinginmotion jihad there is only one identity and one direction that history will allow us black nationhood as many of our leaders and thinkers from marcus garvey and w e b du bois to harold cruse and elijah muhammad have pointed out we are already a separate peoplehave been since we were brought here in chains what we must strive to do is to organize this separateness and make it work for us by forging our to million souls never believe your enemys statistics into the highest modern form of human organization the nationstate for only a sovereign national state will solve our centuriesold identitycrisis and land question our slave ancestors worked the fertile lands of the deep south for centuries and it was promised us in the form of forty acres and a mule by the union government which later withdrew its promise along with its armies and left our defenseless ancestors at the mercy of the southern terror forty acres and a mule to millions of black peasants wouldve created a black nationwithinanation in the deep south only then will we have the living room or space to fully evolve and develop our national potential as dictated by the dynamism inherent in our black spirit and will to power timid souls will ask what about the white man i would answer by saying that we have this task to perform because it represents the final workingout of our collective destiny whether the white man is living or dead living and creating evil and suffering or burned to destruction by the fires of divinity i say that if the white man gets in our way or tries to interfere then he is tampering with our godgiven rights to selfdetermination as human beings and we must deal with him as any other sovereign people or nation would deal with their foreign enemies in a highly organized disciplined fashion by any means we deem necessary scientifically intellectually rationally remember the oppressors are only a highly organized hierarchy of corrupt men they are not god and only god controls our planet and the universe including the white man there fore fear a llah not the white man the complete man in returning to the subject of the roles of the new black artists and thinkers we must strive to become complete men in the eastern sense of the term a complete man is a person who is fully developed physically mentally and spiritually the eastern man could write a beautiful poem or carve an ancestral figure or mask then don his armour and lead a thundering horde into battle in defense of his nation and culture he could hold discourses with learned sages and organize and handle the administrative and diplomatic affairs of his nation or empire while taking time to lecture to students or to design beautiful parks and flowergardens for the people i speak of such men as askia the great the soldierstatesmanemperor of the songhai empire muhammad ahmed the mahdi scholar spiritualleader and revolutionary warrior of the sudan yakub al mansur soldierstatesman cultural leader and emperor of the moorish empire of northern africa and spain and in modern times the two poets philosophers and revolutionary statesmen of the east ho chi minh and mao tse tung who while admittedly using marxism have absorbed all of the ancient philosophies of their cultures and shaped and moulded that marxism to fit the psyches and psychologies of their ancient peoples these are examples of the complete or eastern man that we must become if we wish to be truly free by developing fully in this sense we would rule out the socalled western intellectual who would live a contradiction between his life and his work a person who would write beautiful revolutionary essays plays etc but who might actually be a weakling or coward when it comes to basic manhood protecting his family picking up the gun to defend his community or nation or setting a living example of courageous virtue for his people in my humble opinion this is the path we must take if we desire a full and complete existence for our race here in the west and if we expect to survive the fall of the west only history will know if well find success here within the grey walls of harlem among the myriad masses of my people i work out my destiny evolving in the soul upwards towards my higher self moving to reestablish the broken links with my racial ancestors while maintaining a revolutionary black awareness of the modern world moving eastwards towards mother africa and holy meccain these young years of black awareness heeding the call of the world spirit l come come striding forward striving in a great jihad of collective being we all come evolving towards a new spiritual a ge a iways the nation always the black nation rising with the great dawn breaking in the east flooding the planet with a new world age come brothers and sisters take my thrilling hands as we march forward together a singing army of new men to raise the race raise the race raise the ra most of those who object to the teaching of black literature j if d s n aesthetic grounds they suggest that the black lvj k writer does not present a realistic view of his society that his version of america and the world is shameful fantasy that his art is slanted by racism and wellmeaning sentimentalism arguing that a valuable aesthetic experience must be primary to the teaching of literature they go on to suggest that all black literature is aesthetically inferior they imply in their artforartssake thesis that all aesthetically valuable literature with only a few exceptions is white no one should disagree with the notion that literature should afford one a valuable aesthetic experience an elementary test of the aesthetically valuable however is concerned with the relative beauty of art the art that is literature is concerned with the relative beauty of the lives of people how they stand on top of a western mountain and die how they live their short happy lives in search of success of course there is universality in all human experience but when teachers present experiences to a class of black and white children they should present experiences which compliment the humanity and dignity of a black and white class surely no sane teacher will defend presenting literary experiences to any student which implies denial of that students humanity his human beauty literature should facilitate a persons search through the mirrored past of human experience for reflections of his own life worth his own humanity if every image in the aesthetically valuable is white and if in contrast the only black image presented is one concerning a black child chased by a childeating tiger is this not a cruel denial of the childs human beauty and worth is it not building a social dynamite which must some day explode in black summer rage history gives men a panoramic view of life experience in the universe literature isolates experiences and men gives them spirit aesthetic structure the literature that is history is created so that men may have a record of their past if that record is honest it should aid in shaping the future deciding about even the next moments the literature that is literature that is aesthetically valuable is governed by integrity it is according to professor andrew pawley an essential institution created to serve common human needs and aspirations an honest literary experience should serve the needs and aspirations of all of the peopled hills of a nation a city or a school it is common knowledge that every american city has its various ethnic and racial groups cleveland has its hough its mount pleasant and its glenville each populated mainly by black americans murray hill is predominantly italianamerican numerous slavic families in habit the lower southeast side beechwood is a predominantly jewish community parma is second and third generation polishamerican in every urban area such ethnic and racial communities exist my purpose is not to justify these racial and ethnic lines in urban living patterns it is rather to prove that our society is pluralistic a reflection of the many parts of our societal whole and that as a result the teaching of literature ought to be pluralistic a reflection of the peopled hills in our cities in our classrooms the demand for the teaching of black literature is a demand for a more human definition of the aesthetically valuable it is more specifically a demand for a literature that serves the specific human needs and aspirations of black life black humanity the literature that is presently called american literature is complimentary to white images it is in short what may be called white literature i do not mean to suggest that what is presently called american literature is not good literature much of it however lacks the basic ingredient of literary integrity and is indeed slanted by racism and wellmeaning sentimentalism since black life experiences are normally different in america from white life experiences constantly in aesthetic and actual conflict there is no reason why a clearthinking teacher should expect one valuable aesthetic experience from honest literature what is reasonable is that there should be at least two aesthetically valuable experiences and there should be beauties in between the solution it seems to me lies in the acceptance of all of our american selveswhite yellow red black gwendolyn brooks is a pulitzer prize winning poet her in the mecca was nominated for a national book award her beverly hills chicago is a splendid example of poetic excellence but in spite of awards and nominations gwendolyn brooks poet laureate of illinois is edited out of books of american verse the prose of richard wright is as clear and clean as that of ernest hemingway the dominant most admirable image in the fiction of hemingway is white the nigger that cooks is in the kitchen in hemingways fiction and he seems to want to stay there the nigger may be in the kitchen in the fiction of richard wright but he does not want to stay there he does not wish to remain a nigger either implied in the fiction of richard wright are the hopes and aspirations of black life in america implicit in the fiction of this black writer is what the civil_rights movement isor wasall about black students as i understand them are saying that if they must read hemingways the short happy life of francis macomber then white students ought to read richard wrights big boy leaves home that if they must read emily dickinsons as imperceptibly as grief then white students ought to read gwendolyn brookss beverly hills chicago to thine own self be true was the last admonition polonious gave his son laertes when laertes left home for school in france the proper study of mankind is man alexander pope wrote in his essay on man an elementary lesson in modern social problems reveals that thousands of people are institutionalized each year because they do not know themselves thousands of lives are lost each year as they are washed down ghetto drains in search of other selves through drugs alcohol lsd when laertes left home for school he had been taught well the ways of other men but more important than that he had been taught to know himself if we teach on the green grounds of universality a black child the life experience of a white child we are saying to that black child that there is no american difference between him and the white child we may desire that dream to be true but it is not true today a white child may go to mississippi from his home in cleveland and find that only the weather is different and perhaps the people walk and talk a little slower than they do in cleveland but a black child having been taught that there is no american difference between him and the white child may go to mississippi and die in the bloated belly of the mississippi pearl where emmett till far from chicago floated to a deathly adolescent truth black child truth is not the same as white child truth in mississippi there is a deadly difference between the two kinds of childish truths surely most educators would like to equalize the two truths recognizing and teaching them may be one way of equalizing them meanwhile however the child must know the truth of the world he lives in that truth may not set him free in mississippi but it may well save his life those who contend that the black writer cannotor does not present a realistic view of society are obviously not black they do not know the reality of black american experience often they do not even sympathize with the needs and aspirations of black humanity and a writer ought to sympathize he really ought to empathize he ought at least to sympathize with the denial of black feminine narcissism illuminated in black rage what robert herrick does for white womanhood in his to electra is denied black womanhood barred from the classrooms by traditional professors who apparently know nothing about human needs and aspirations and their relations to literature of course there are black writers who have not presented a realistic view of their society most of these writers however had their brains washed in the stagnant waters of slavery or selfhate sometimes success in the white world drove them to copy the stereotypes of their humanity phillis wheatley an outstanding example of a black woman who was denied feminine worth most probably hated herself looking at phillis wheatleys poem through contemporary blackpower and emergingafrica eyes one must conclude that miss wheatley was ashamed of her native land ultimately of herself but phillis wheatley was a slave and so it is easy to forgive her for her mask jupiter hammon a contemporary of miss wheatley was a slave who was encouraged by his kind master to write and it is easy to forgive that dutiful slave paul laurence dunbar in his poem we wear the mask suggests that there have been many black lies told to white america jupiter hammon and phillis wheatley wore the mask so have dozens of white american authors worn white puritan masks but there are black writers who have grown up who have taken off the mask there are black writers who have never worn a literary mask they paid a painful price for their integrity it is they who can take the slogan blackisbeautiful and develop it lovingly in all of its american shades it is they who can most vividly portray the racial glory and dark beauty of black life most white writers in america have not described honestly the human beauty of the black american perhaps these writers are too near in their imagery herricks to electra perhaps unconsciously they distort the humanity of black life perhaps they do so because it isit certainly wasin vogue it was the literary thing to do at any rate if they cannot treat that humanity vividly and lovinglynot as vividly and as lovingly as the black writer can for you see if he loves himself his treatment of other black lives will be reflected through his loving eyes most white writers do not bring sympathetic or empathetic hearts with them when they endeavor to portray black life they bring creative hearts creative hearts may create new lives distort old ones they cannot however measure the extent of rejection the black man takes to his youcanmakeitifyoutry brainwashed home if they have not felt the electric cattleprod stabbing afroamerican dignity they cannot measure not truly the aesthetic value of blacklife dignity because they have not felt the electrocution of it if they have not been black like me for one day they cannot begin to know the realism of my uncle johnnys separate but equal louisiana sawmill years while black students may seem to be saying that the proper study of black man is black life i understand them to mean that they want to be told the american truth of themselves i understand them to mean that the proper study of any man is honest life they know that jim of huckleberry finn is a compromise of man in them they know that little black sambo is a classic black lie they know that virtually every story about black life in american literature is a story that presents a questionable humanity black life is portrayed as primitive savage life or saintly romantic life neither is honest earthly american life this is not meant as an argument against the teaching of literature by white writers to black children our national goal at least at this writing is still an open society still one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all to teach any one kind of literature however in an integrated classroom is a tragic denial of value for another kind of life beauty life experience perhaps an honest solution lies in teaching world literaturenot just the white world but all the world a meltingpot world the american worldthe unmelted ethnic world the image of the black american in american literature has been to say the least dishonest black humanity as represented by most white writers has been capsulized categorized and disintegratized the happy slave is a literary hoax the tragic mulatto was tragic because he was a social slave trapped in the iron grip of class the wretched freedman was not free and the local color negro is a romantic creation like the exotic primitive if there was ever such a man as the local color negro he is dead now if he is not dead then he has moved to the city if there was ever such a wretch as a wretched freedman he lives solely in the territory of american fiction the tragic mulatto has integrated now and the exotic primitive has lost his exoticism as well as his primeval loveliness in urban ghetto reproduction we teach by what we teach as well as by what we do not teach for too long aesthetic reality in american literature has said that the humanity of black americans is ridiculous with stepin fetchit amusing with amos and andy entertaining with white blackfaced minstrelsy and human only in exceptional cases like uncle toms cabin up from slavery the jackie robinson story and yes l can what we have said as a nation about and to black humanity is this basically your humanity is questionable however if you are fantastic like uncle tom booker t washington jackie robinson and sammie davis jr we will concede your exceptional ability now those are not kind words to utter to a human being they are not kind words to speak to any child regardless of the color of his humanity they are unkind and they erect a stone wall between the human needs and aspirations of people something there is that doesnt love a wall robert frost wrote in mending wall frost went on to say that that something nature black students want to send a frozengroundswell under the aesthetic wall which bars them from their own human needs and aspirations they want to unmend that wall to spill the upper boulders before a black sun and make gaps that even two can pass abreast that even they and white students can pass abreast much of the fault for the communication gap between people in america today is due in part to three centuries of classic lies and not to teach in the context of american literature that literature which treats honestly the humanity of black americans is to continue to be to black and white americans academically dishonest humanistically cruel and psychologically destructive not to teach black literature at all is to continue to build with scholarly arrogancy a summer bomb that must explode over the traditional september walls of academic paranoia onto the green canvas of american liberty thomas jefferson might have written that while all men are created equal literature keeps them equal literature can build a fortress of human dignity in a childs heart thomas jefferson did not write that however he wrote all men are created equal it is up to education to write the rest it is up to education to build the fortress of human dignity in black and white american hearts we communicate by what we say as well as by what we do not say and we have not yet said as teachers administrators and educators that black life is beautiful life we have not even said that black life is human life we have stood on the white brink of artforartssake and denied the humanity of most of the world is it not now time that we move our concern across the wall toward a sane oasis of universal life if we do move toward the sane center land we may witness the dark reality of alexander popes wisdom when he declared in essay on man david littlejohn is the author of a white paper black on white which should be appropriately entitled the effects of the vast body of black literature on the little blind bigoted white mind this proves to be a clinical analysis of the effect of the american dilemma on the mind of what should be a disciplined scholarly white intellectual and educationist rather than a critical survey of black writing as it is supposed to be this then is essentially a black paper by a black writer on the white paper by a white writer who describes black literature in terms of its effects on the white readers already burdened and confused mind perhaps if three years before the publication of the before mentioned book in era bell thompson and herbert nipson editors of ebony magazine had not published white on blackthe views oj twentytwo white americans on the negro or had even asked mr littlejohn to give the definitive twentythird view we would have been spared this occasion for certainly the impulse begins here browsing through success book store in san francisco i found a copy from this source spring platitudinous statements which have since become cliches as an integral part of black humor eleanor roosevelt begins with the essay some of my best friends are negro honest injun and what follows are period pieces in americas attempt to bridge the racial gulf and to integrate the negro into the fabric of the democratic society although mrs roosevelt admitted that one of the odd things about my negro friends is their consistent failure to invite me to their social gatherings she claims never to have lost a negro friend she also admits that she could have done so had she known paul robeson she assesses him and his talents thusly he should be using his talents to help rather than to destroy his country despite his intelligence feel that he has not demonstrated any analytical qualities surely he has not examined the soviet system because it does not permit for real democratic freedom the kindest thing that i can say about him perhaps that he believes that communism will give all people equality this everyone should have but mr robeson and all of us have a greater chance of getting it here in the united states than anywhere else in the world she goes on to describe a crude drawing she encountered in georgia during a political campaign showing her dancing with a negro and entitled niggerlover eleanor and as a result how she had franklin d call in the secret service and the fbi to investigate the rumored eleanor clubs where negro members of those clubs were supposed to push white people on thursdays or something really strange the second essay the plight of southern white women by a husbandandwife team wilma dykeman and james stokely who are authors of a book on the race problems neither black nor white is one which lauds the moral courage of the women born and bred southemers who met on november to form the association of southern women for the prevention of lynching this came after a preliminary study of the violent practices of their men this study included the revealing statistics that of lynchings occurring from to only per cent of the victims had even been accused of crimes against white women this fact convinced them that economic exploitation had hidden too long and too comfortably behind their skirts following these two essays is a string of confessionals by an array of white people sophie tucker the last of the red hot mamas told how she launched her entertainment career in by thinking black billy graham evangelist warned no color line in heaven lillian smith in strange fruit in harlem admitted that bounded on the south by visible signs on the north by invisible signs filled with its heaven and its hells there is no way for a white person to walk away from harlem frank sinatra in the way i look at race informs us that people who hate dont live wholesome lives and that i believe that bigotry is a national disease but that it can be cured we are curing it slowly and are on the road to the solution of our no domestic problem segregation bishop g bromley oxnam in the sin of silence begins with once again the ku klux klan burns crosses and masquerades in white it proclaims its message of vicious racialism antisemitism and religious bigotry many church members who proudly declare they are saved belong to this unamerican and unchristian body ralph mcgill in the south looks ahead states matteroffactly that the south has sacrificed its children colored and white to inferior education and has across a hundred years discriminated in one degree or another against all its people a free south will be in fact a new south the human being or condition always has had at least three yearnings to be treated as a human being to have an equal fair chance to win respect and advancement as an individual in the economic environment and freely to seek spiritual and cultural happiness and finally william faulkner the mississippi writer who won the nobel prize for literature in gives advice in a sevenpage essay if i were a negro in answer to the question surrounded by antagonistic white people would you find it hard not to hate them his answer was i would repeat to myself booker t washingtons words when he said i will let no man no matter what his color ever make me hate him so if i were a negro i would say to my people let us be always unflaggingly and inflexibly flexible but always decently quietly courteous with dignity and without violence and above all with patience the white man has devoted three hundred years to teaching us to be patient that is one thing at least in which we are his superiors let us turn it into a weapon against him let us use this patience not as a passive quality but as an active weapon if you will pardon the seeming digression i cite these numerous references from the book white on black in order to pose the question can a white american from a society diseased in institutionalized racism ever talk about the black man without it being a projection of his own racist fantasies which colors his logic and i would answer that with seldom certainly the few white revisionist historians have found a way in the somewhat newer field of english literature scholars like professor richard m dorson author of american negro folktales and abraham chapman who in september edited the page anthology of afroamerican literature black voices show that it can be done chapman ends his page introduction thusly i close this anthology reluctantly with the feeling that so much is happening and being born that it would be good to keep the book open and bring it still more of the new but the end of this anthology is not conclusion i hope but further beginnings greater appreciation of what black writers have contributed and are contributing to the diversity of american literature and movement towards greater inclusion of works by negro writers in our american literature courses in the high schools and colleges and from the january issue of negro digest he includes a quote from the fine black writer margaret walker author of the novel jubilee the black aesthetic has a rich if undiscovered past this goes back in time to the beginning of civilization in egypt babylonia india china persia and all the islamic world that preceded the renaissance of the europeans we have lived too long excluded by the anglosaxon aesthetic where else should the journey lead the black writer is the black experience how can the human experience transcend humanity its the same thing yes thank god it can be done unfortunately however mr littlejohn failed in his critical analysis of black writing to be equal to this mammoth task to use his image he was not the gulliver he imagined himself to be nor are the yearold voices which resound from the wealth of afroamerican literaure those of the lilliputians which could be easily dismissed as the product of small minds that happento be negro or a literary output which if a bright white mind immerses itself for long is pained dispirited by dwelling in the dull dark prison yard that is so often the negro writers world and the responding spirit is dulled and bored by the sordid limitation of the soul in the tight closet of the black imagination this man is so square that he doesnt even know that black people have more soul than anyone ask james brown aretha franklin or even time magazine or esquire where has this man been where is he coming from mr littlejohn does not have to study the background the history the social milieu which produces black writers he already has his mind made up in the first pages of his introduction of the quality the nature and the occasion of this vexing material the occasion and the substance of most negro writing in america is still the undeclared race war in which all americans are by definition involved this writing often becomes a weapon in the race war and from the view of white readers an enemy weapon some of it is meant to give pain to disconcert and unbalance the pain in most negro literature of the american race war however remains solid and undigestible it juts up it rankles it rubs raw like an ulcer as it is meant to sometimes the design is quite conscious writing is one way of getting back at the enemy the negros satisfaction will be doubled of course if his foolish white reader can be made to pay for and to praise the materials of his own discomfort p and even when the scholar in him nags at him to consider the history of a racially oppressed minority he dismisses this impulse the wounded white reader may even try to reduce out the color content and claim that there are simply the histories of any oppressed minority regardless of race and then confront that accusations as he will such attempts to deflect the pain of negro writing are like the evasion interpretations the explainingaway of book iv of gullivers travels horses really arent houyhnms you know people really arent yahoos gulliver has obviously gone mad swift was psychologically misanthropic and so on well who wants to top that what was that the great white father william faulkner advised his good colored people in his sevenpage essay if i were a negro first i must repeat the magic words from booker t washington will let no man no matter what his color ever make me hate him and then according to faulkner i must use patience as an active war weapon frankly i never expected to find in faulkner a true adversary but perhaps just perhaps can communicate what i must say from this vantage point having exhumed the ghost of the great white father of american literature even his voice comes back to haunt mr littlejohn with the truth that not only is what he has to say about the black writers so much nonsense but even what he says about white writers proves him to be a sloppy scholar and critic i quote mr littlejohn william faulkner who of all people might have had an idea could not imagine himself a negro for two minutes p in this book on the black writing checking the reference pages in the index i found that jonathan swift has three references while sterling brown dean of black literature and black scholarship has only two sterling brown respected poet and longtime professor of english literature at howard university did the definitive scholarship on negro writing in the s leading to the valuable book the negro caravan continuing this disproportionate cataloguing we find the naacp with one page reference claude mckay with eight jean genet with five arna bontemps with five dr strangelove with one marcys garvey with one charles dickens with three and william faulkner with mr littlejohn continues frankly must admit that the other side of the coin may also be true certainly as a black literary critic on the subject of a whites attempt at criticizing black writing i at least blush it becomes rather obvious then that this book should be viewed as a companion piece to the confessions of william styron via nat turner therefore i will view it with patience ijowever even now since faulkners advice i must run the risk of bringing new pains to this brave warriorcritic of the race war literature of black people as mr littlejohn cautions p the literature of the race war polarizes american it forces them to take sides they would rarely take in life it pains me to be so argumentative but mr littlejohn even here is in error because he does not know himself in real life his stances are the same contradictory to his philosophy that of a gulliversized fairhaired bigoted pedant you see using this scholarly work as a shield mr littlejohn is waging a war in reallife drama this one is pitting him and i as generals on either side of the camp the war is over a simple idea is the history and culture and society reflected in black writing worthy of serious study to even those blacks who must know themselves to open the floodgate of all other knowledge the university of california berkeley was the wartorn battleground where this open and declared war was to be staged we were both members of the faculty of this worldrenowned institution of higher learning for the year i was teaching a subjecta course in remedial composition where the bulk of third world people particularly entering black students are placed as a result of discriminatory criminally inaccurate whiteoriented achievement and placement tests as a black teacher i was teaching this course primarily for blacksalthough of my original students were nonblacks it was taught from a black perspective it recognizes the black mothertongue as a possible effective poetic language which is a very natural outgrowth of the black experience and i used black literature as models of form for expository writing subjecta is not an integrated part of the english department as is the case on some campuses it stand alone it is for the student who is deemed deficient in language enough to justify barring him from participation in more meaningful courses from a white standpoint within the hallowed ivy walls of the academic department of english on the berkeley campus i had students who elected to take my course from a black perspective one black graduate student was auditing this remedial class of my nonblacks one was an orientalamerican one a mexicanamerican at least one was jewishamerican and there were six other white nonestablishmenttypes and then of course there were my black students trying to determine to what extent they shared in the american tradition mr littlejohn whom i have not had the pleasure of meeting facetoface because of my outhouse status on campus is a respected member of the english department he is most vociferous in denouncing the merits of afroamerican literature and he is accepted by his colleagues as an expert critic in this field which is my expertise by birthright by godgiven and academically developed talent and scholarship so far he has been successful in convincing his department the university the educational community of the san francisco bay area of the meanness of this unliterary body of work by illiterates who have small minds and who dwell in a small dark world somewhere on the periphery of his great white vision he has convinced all that am an outlaw practicing an outlaw trade and that to lower the floodgates to let in either the monster known as a black writer or the writing which is the product of such a monstrously dwarfed world would be a disaster and so the afroamerican studies department waits the afroamerican students wait the body of afroamerican literature waits and least of all ian upcoming black poetmust wait while a hand is on the gate which has locked us out when did this real war for me begin with this intensity it was almost a year ago at that time while developing creating courses in this field for the english department and the newly envisioned afroamerican studies departmentthe first one in actuality in northern californiai became a target of intellectual abuse in the educational community this happened while i was serving my time as an outcast in the miserably segregated and unequal facility known as merritt junior college a feeder junior college of urban vintage as over against the suburban disneylands for which california is so well known in its attempt to give free education for every worthy white student regardless of mental ability and human worth it began in my overcrowded first class in one of the many portables crammed together for the most part in a onecityblock concentrationcamp type institution which proved often to be the logjam of aspiration for urban youthas well as academic death for the black students who had been systematically confined there regardless of mental aptitude and social position in my class were auditors from the university of california graduate english departmentmostly whiteand jim nabors a thirdworld activist who is also an afroamerican he explained that the u c students were desirous of starting such a course on the berkeley campus he was attending my class to determine the focus of such a course and the desirability of initiating a similar one on january shortly after the beginning of the winter term for the daily californian announced that jim nabors had proposed a potential course in an article entitled afroamerican literature class this was on monday mr nabors was beaming when he arrived at our early morning wednesday class the students were exuberant even i was pleased momentarily at the anticipated reception of the new course i had not only spent my entire life as a student of afroamerican literature and had my vows as a black writer to champion its cause but more immediately i had burned the midnight oil well into the night since the beginning of the school year also i had spent a small fortune in acquiring books on this topic which were systematically excluded from the public schools libraries and higher educational institutions in the western tradition i spent my christmas holiday much to the dismay of my dentisthusband and my five offsprings delving into these books in my private collecton purchasing others that would be essential in the new field that was about to open surveying libraries book stores in the end being really disheartened by the mammoth void i noted the storehouse of ignorance that existed in this field in this educational center of western culture the high motivation of angry black students this was only a part of their great beauty many of them followers of black_panther leaders bobby seale huey newton eldridge cleaver gave me the impetus i needed to keep going on in the face of so much pain and persecution i beamed by thursday the uc establishment with mr littlejohn as one of the academic warring generals declared through the press its open war on me here i feel compelled to inject that the chairman of the english department james d hart remarked in the january article entitled conflict over proposed course that such a course was perfectly feasible however this lone white sane voice was lost in the shrill air of the louder voices which were raised as follows david littlejohn assistant professor of english and author of black on white a critical survey of writing by american negroes asserted to invent the course before a substantial literature came along would be pandering to the needs of race pride such a course would be educational therapy for blacks who need to invent a heritage by grasping at such things as jazz african sculpture or afroamerican literature littlejohn said mr littlejohn was not alone his colleague jackson burgess an associate professor of english who spent a year in africa as a smithmundt lecturer in american literature at the university of capetown according to the article stated that the bulk of negro literature is of great value in the fields of history sociology and political science mr burgess stated there isnt a great deal of negro american literature of much value written before the second world war over the last years negro writing has been more emphasized partly because it is becoming better known and partly because much of the better literature has only been written in the last years by the next week an afroamerican student norman wilkerson senior in the english department wrote a letter to the ice box he asserted that black students were black and proud and that we have learned it most prudent not to address ourselves to every perverted inane ejaculation that dribbles from the universitys several malignant orifices however he felt that he must answer mr littlejohn and did so as follows mr littlejohn manages to be both thoroughly insulting and distressingly illogical by this imagery we are characterized as diseased black students seeking rehabilitation through the benevolence of educational therapy while at the same time we are striving to invent a heritage just as littlejohn explained the harlem renaissance into nonexistence so he has reduced us to nonentities if these arguments fail to convince one of littlejohns racism we recommend his low pathetic endeavor to appraise black literature we submit that littlejohn considering his manifest ignorance of black literature should argue for rather than against the creation of such a course on friday january a front page article stated that petition demonstrates interest in black literature course and the afroamerican student union president lenneal henderson called the study of afroamerican literature an absolute necessity i was asked to come to the campus for an interview with the daily californian staff writer debbie heintz and the result of this interview was boldly headlined in the wednesday january paper black literature course offered at merritt college in this article i was asked to describe the contents of my course and in a sweeping generality i mentioned that it starts with the ancient folktales of west africa goes to uncle remus and ends with a survey of todays black drama and poetry by thursday february raymond kent assistant professor of african history had raised his voice in the letters to the ice box column his letter was entiled african black american link rejected although at the time two very pleased african students were students of mine and later took the course for two quarters stating over and over again that because of colonial conditions they had learned more about their african selves in my course than was ever possible in their own homelands mr kent suspected that african students in this country would not welcome links of this kind he further argued that curiously enough the course at merritt is not called black literature but rather afroamerican folklore poetry and drama this conveys that the instructor is teaching certain forms of literary expression which emanate from black americans whether literate or not it is limited to a single culture and language familiar both to the instructor and her students it hence is not predicated on pigment alone as in the case of black literature the term afro is intended to replace black again your readers should know that africa is far from being either uniformly or consistently black it is also meant to connect the black american with africa as a single cultural entity which corresponds to the black subculture in this country etc etc etc ad nauseum to retain my sanity at this point i asked that my class turn inward on itself to get the most from our unique experience with a verboten subject area and instructed that if no one kept such a ridiculous circular illogical argument alive that it would in time die of natural cause and it did more or less die for the remainder of the year it was james baldwin who said people are trapped in history and history is trapped in them how true today i am still entrapped in the cold war being fought in the english department to keep from legitimatizing my expertise in the field of afroamerican literature i must implore you dear reader to have the patience with me that i must have with my adversaries i promise no more digressions i will be direct about a critical analysis of mr littlejohns black on white mr littlejohn feels that novels in the richard wright tradition depend on sadism and brutality which cause the reader to respond with the imaginative equivalent of nausea p he theorizes why this is so behind the sadism and brutality secondly are the sadists and brutes the legions of bitches and boors of near subhuman moral monsters who throng the pages of negro writing detached from its specific nationalracial setting the literature of american negroes may be read as one giant case against man at his worst even the white reader philosophic enough not to identify himself in guilt with these disgusting white human specimens not to read them as personal indictments will see in the genuineness of their portraits a dispiriting swiftian reminder that man at his low point is incredibly vicious and foul it is not a pleasant reminder and negro literature hammers it in p works of richard wright james o killens he must mean the respected novelist john o killens margaret walker introduced in the forties as a poet in the yale series of younger poets and robert hayden winner of the literature award at the first world festival of negro art in dakar senegal were passed off as mere catalogues of white oppression littlejohn says they use the technique of the unrolling of the white mans abuse of the negro in america from the inhuman slave ships and plantations of antebellum days through the lynchings and beatings and brutalization and the stunting economic imprisonment of yesterday and today he blames this literature of the race war with polarizing americans of the warring racesblack and white and he adds this polarization with the implicit assumption of all the suffering by one side and all the guilt by the other is enforced by the frequent and usually unnoticed use of wethey rhetoric in negro writing a usage that presumes the myth and fosters the fact of racial war of we versus they he criticizes james baldwins mixing of the pronouns until even the emotional truth of his rhetoric is corrupted he then states in any case the dogmatic use by negro writers of the warringcamp pronouns helps to enforce in white readers the disturbingly irrational sensation that their hands are on every whip and every touch the habit is not confined to negroes police chief parker of los angeles declared when victory over the watts rioters seemed to be near were on the top now and theyre on the bottom p mr littlejohns historical frame of reference is as confused illogical and inexact as his power of critical analysisat least in the area of what he calls literature of the race war to refresh his memory on the use of war camp pronouns police chief parker is far more american in his usage of the warring camp pronouns than is our ivory tower professor wasnt it abraham lincoln that great emancipator of the black race who at the time advocated expatriation and colonization of the newly freed slaves that made the historical statement which follows you and we are different races we have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races whether it is right or wrong need not discuss but this physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both as i think your race suffers very greatly many of them by living among us while ours suffer from your presence in a word we suffer on each side if this is admitted it affords a reason why we should be separated for the record this statement was made following an altercation by factions of the american society known as the civil war in the polarization of northerners and southerners over the practice of slavery each side solicited black men to engage in battle with each other over their freedom a contemporary of president abraham lincoln usa was one of the giants of black literature that great abolitionist and statesman frederick douglass in narrative of the life o f frederick douglass an american slave published in he eloquently expressed the psychology of master and slave and the effects which such a psychicas well as physicalcondition might have on an individual and a society his writing of well over a century ago created a sensation in its day and spurred on his career as a militant uncompromising leader of his people he rose from bondage to become secretary of the santo domingo commission recorder of deeds in the district of columbia and united states minister to haiti he led a minor rebellion escaped from slavery became a selftaught man contrary to mr littlejohns fact that blacks were illiterate before world war ii all that blacks needed to become publishers of newspapers essayist poets was to have lived the harrowing black experience in america and then live to tell it checking out mr douglasss poem called a parody which is the conclusion of the book one finds that it has a whole lotsa soul much insight about reality and truth again please note that in a book about negro writing mr douglass has a onepage reference as opposed to william faulkners understandably i have a difference of opinion with respect to mr douglasss works which mr littlejohn dismissesone fell sweepalong with the works of james weldon johnson and booker t washingtonas follows i would make no claim for any of these as literature the douglass and johnson works are fat detailed episodic memoirs of the usual unliterary sort mr douglass would not be perturbed by this he anticipates the littlejohns who fathered him enslaved him tortured him who surrounded him and would keep coming on down through the centuries menacingly using the diction of the bible the only book a slave could learn to read from under threat of death his words are no less true today the christianity of america is a christianity of whose votaries it may be as truly said as it was of the ancient scribes and pharisees they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on mens shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers all their works they do for to be seen of menthey love the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues woe unto you scribes and phari sees hypocrites for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness dark and terrible as is this picture i hold it to be strictly true of the overwhelming mass of professed christians in america they strain at a gnat and swallow a camel it will not be necessary for me to attempt to establish a name for mr douglass his life is his glory even an innocuous and generally irrelevant magazine like life had his wise black visage on the november cover in an attempt at revisionist recording of the true american experiencethat is for those americans who are ready for this the truth i mean glimpse of truth is completely overshadowed by its surrounding diatribe in such a critical analysis the titles of the chapters are before native son the dark ages before native son the renaissance and after negro writers today the novelist i negro writers today the novelist ii conclusion and index the conclusions and index comprise an additional pages i have discussed the illogical and dishonest nature of the index which outlines the geography of the totally irrelevant body of the work as it relates to understanding black literature the value in a book of this sort is the revelation of the nature of the psychopathic pseudointellectual mind which has dominated the thinking in the western world even the simplemindedness of the titles of chapters tells the truly informed much more than a small mind could envision of one of the giants in black literatureand american literature also if it were knownrichard wright who by the way authored the landmark novel native son which served as a chronological pivot for mr littlejohn mr littlejohn says in what he must assume to be a poetical idiom an infant crying in the night an infant crying for the light and with no language but a cry p julian mayfields the hit is called a small strangely airy family tragedy it is about a little negro building superintendent his little dream is deferred p of pulitzer prize winner and poet laureate of illinois gwendolyn brooks work maud martha referred to as one of the handsomest small novels by american negroes mr littlejohn says in tiny fragments vignettes tiny moments in passage the reader skims into the life of maud martha it is a powerful beautiful dagger of a book a womanly book as generous as it can possibly be it teaches more more quickly more lastingly than a thousand pages of protest pp of langston hughes mr littlejohn says that he is as skillful and durable a storyteller as he is poet a master at the ironic little social comedies of negro life he is lesser than ellison or baldwin only because his scope is so much smaller not because his work is cheaper or less complete pp of willard motley and others in the school of wright he dismisses their work of the forties as material james baldwin the dramatist mr littlejohn feels wrote blues for mister charlie as an attempt to give white people an inferiority problem he calls it an essay in artless bullying not a play and since a play is about words and actions which underscore and dramatize these words mr littlejohn lowers the big boom by saying the play betrays serious imaginative disability and the dialogue for the most part is hopeless faked banter faked poetry doctrinaire racism dated slang all conflated with artificial violence and obscenity p this in spite of the fact that it was based on a real life lynching of a black young man taking place in the present day among socalled civilized christianized democratic citizens of the usa where law and order is violently and unjustly dispensed to the victims of an oppressive racist society mr baldwin in his notes for blues explains his impetus and concerns about writing protest drama admitting that at first he was unwilling to risk my morale and my talentmy lifein endeavors which could only increase a level of frustration already dangerously high however in fully explaining the impetus for writing this essential drama he said lorraine hansberrys a raisin in the sun new york drama critics award as a conventional socialrealist drama the short story of an embattled negro family in chicagos black belt and their small unsatisfied dreams p is mr littlejohn having pronoun trouble shouldnt that be familyits and not their as opposed to our great american dream i suppose mr littlejohn in his little way approves in some small way the talent of mr davis he makes the following comments mr davis composed the worddrunken part of reverend purlie to suit his own exuberant talents godfrey cambridge one of the best new negro comedians took the part of a classic twofaced uncle tom who sings slavery songs to his master the fact that so healthfully doubleedged a takeoff on racial oppression and the civil_rights struggle could be written and produced in one of the surest signs of the maturity of negro art every sugary deep south lie every hoary delusion and institution is deftly mocked in the play its white folks are all patent fools this is clearly a negroes show for negroes to laugh at the jokes are all theirs he says but white viewers too if they are ready for it can relish its sanity p gosh mr littlejohns pronoun confusion which is clearly racewar oriented really is about to confuse my good clear sane black mind leroi jones the dutchman obieoff broadwayaward for was described thusly it may be the most important imaginative literary document of the american race war since native son and it works the dialogue is almost perfect of mr jones the toilet which takes place in the little john of a city high school he says the plays major strength lies in its sense of menace of the slave he says it is a blatant unmodulated scream of racial abuse its primary purpose one assumes was authorial selfgratification pp of the author of black mans burden and the screen play odds against tomorrow he says james oliver killens has written two long detailed humorless artless almost documentary race novels youngblood and and then we heard the thunder the first is a sort of negro family epic the expected tale of two generations of longsuffering blacks and their sadistic white masters in a georgia town the second tells the interminable story of negroes and whites in wartime where the ordeal of world war ii seems less harrowing in the long run than the race war inside it p killens who is generously placed in the school of wright described as the most celebrated of the second rank heads the list of writers of the angry novels which are described as symptoms rather than examinations of the race war mr littlejohn says of these they are weapons like rockfilled mudballs they are aimed from the negro fort into the white fort in the hope of wounding or at least splattering some of its inhabitants p yes we are detecting a circular motion that brings us back where we started as ellison has said of invisible man in the end is my beginning and in the beginning my end perhaps we should end with mr littlejohns appraisal of ellisons talents he lauds ellison for having the most closely focused review of the negros story in america he calls it a shorthand history and sociology of the american negro among the couples tattered scrambled effects cast out on the street are artefacts and mementoes from every stage of the american negro past minstrel show bones voodoonuggets an ethiopian flag a tintype of lincoln a picture of a banjostrumming blackfaced white man a yellowing headline of garveys deportation a hollywood pinup a st louis fair plate and a set of manumission papers dated august p as testimonials to ellisons art mr littlejohn mentions the fine texture of his style his manipulative skill in handling language character event design and to move to items of slightly larger focus the fullest sense of drama he says his rhetorical skill is prodigious and he is not reticent about displaying its range not only does he indulge himself in perfect mimicry of the tall tale the emotioncharged address word display and makes his heros hold on history a way with words a gift of tongues an awesome and dangerous eloquence like his own p in describing a chapter entitled out of the hospital and under the bar which was excluded from the novel but published in soon one morning mr littlejohns description sounds almost appropos for ed bullins inspiration for the electronic nigger here the hero after his disastrous explosion at liberty paints is imprisoned in an antiseptic glass case and operated on by voices and white hands which rearrange his brain and identity with electric devices a negro maid a wonderful woman helps him to escape into underground passages as psychological as they are architectural p after much quibbling mr littlejohn assigns ellison a place in the tradition of great american novelists like hawthorne and faulkner rather than among the new negroes he says he is not up there of course but i see no reason not to assign him a placeeven for one unbalanced bookat least in the high second rank p woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites frederick douglass shook his head in patience humility disbelief they strain at the gnat and swallow a camel as you might suspect i feel that any conclusions reached by mr littlejohn in the field of afroamerican or black literature are inconclusive to say the least even for the white reader they are totally irrelevant and ridiculous for the black reader i would like to call attention to his criticism misplaced again as cause rather than effect that most negroes are too unhappy about their racial identity to be able to celebrate the life of their people he lowrates black people in general and black writers in particular for wanting to deny their people wanting to become white in face to adopt white values to assimilate he instructs black readers and writers it is one thing to want to be free it is quite another and sick to want to be a different color it makes for neurosis not for art but america all of it goes on hating blackness fosters the neurosis and holds off the day of a true negro art this of course is a halftruth but he obviously does not realize the heads or tails of the turth also how can he believe this then protest the black students militant demand to be able to study black literature by stating as he did last winter in the daily californian that such courses as black literature african sculpture and other courses which attempt to establish or rather invent a heritage for black students would be pandering to the needs of the students a great truth is evidenced in mr littlejohns critical analysis and fortunately it is addressedeven then in a wrongheaded wayto the white reader he warns that a proper reading an honest evaluation will be the hardest task of alland the most liberating he remarks that it is all too morally easy to grovel to cringe beneath the lash not all the history of racial oppression in america should be allowed to paralyze the moral sensibility the critical faculty the ability even of white men to discriminate or the war has indeed been lost to read with a sharp gidean conscience ever awake monitoring regulating correcting to resist the unfair imposition the bullying intimidation but to acknowledge too to accept and heed the insults that are deserved this is the way to read the literature of war and it is the better works one finds that require the most total selfexaminations the most radical selfsurgery pp afroamerica has a culture afroamerica has a language afroamerica has a literature karl shapiro currently teaching at the university of california at davis wrote a few years ago an article entitled the decolonization of american literature he argued for a broad inclusion of literatures and visionsblacks whites inbetweenswhich more nearly tell us the shape of the world in which we live mr shapiro reminds us that literature is an accurate transcription of the quality of thought and feeling of the writer and his people a great literature leaves nothing outthat is its greatness but to leave nothing out means to go against the grain it means to dissent afroamerican literature is a great literature just as afroamerican music is great american music and literature are greatly enriched by the creative talents of black americans black awareness black love black pride black protest black_power black revolution demand of the american conscience the most total selfexaminations the most radical selfsurgery and is the only way to heal our history and overcome the problem of the color line which w e b du bois recognized at the turn of the century as the problem of the twentieth century and which many decades later the social scientist gunnar myrdal described as the american dilemma the university of california at berkeleywhere ironically mr littlejohn and i were serving as instructors and where angry black students and angry whites are clamoring for reforms in our educational systems and are demanding an end to institutionalized racism which has crippled the american dreamcan serve as a laboratory and a forum whereby the race war the problem the dilemma can be truly critically examined and remediedor it can continue to be the battle ground the expected opposition to the concept of a black aesthetic was not long in coming in separate reviews of black fire an anthology edited by leroi jones and larry neal critics from the saturday review and the new york review of books presented the expected rebuttal agreeing with ralph ellison that sociology and art are incompatible mates these critics nevertheless invoked the cliches of the social ideology of the we shall overcome years in their attempt to steer blacks from the path of literary fantasy and folly their major thesis is simple there is no black aesthetic because there is no white aesthetic the kerner commission report to the contrary america is not two societies but one therefore americans of all races colors and creeds share a common cultural heredity this is to say that there is one predominant culturethe american culturewith tributary national and ethnic streams flowing into ture the duct of the larger river literamost important byprothis cultural moonolith knows no parochial boundaries to speak of a black literature a black aesthetic or a black state is to engage in racial chauvinism separatist bias and black fantasy the question of a white aesthetic however is academic one has neither to talk about it nor define it most americans white accept the existence white aesthetic as naturally as they accept april th as the deadline for paying their income tax with far less animosity towards the former than the latter the white aesthetic despite the academic critics has always been with us for long before diotima pointed out the way to heavenly beauty to socrates the poets of biblical times were discussing beauty in terms of light and darkthe essential characteristics of a white and black aestheticand establishing the dichotomy of superior vs inferior which would assume body and form in the th century therefore more serious than a definition is the problem of tracing the white aesthetic from its early origins and afterwards outlining the various changes in the basic formula from culture to culture and from nation to nation such an undertaking would be more germane to a book than an essay nevertheless one may take a certain starting point and using selective nations and cultures make the critical point while calling attention to the necessity of a more comprehensive study encompassing all of the nations and cultures of the world let us propose greece as the logical starting point bearing in mind will durants observation that all of western civilization is but a footnote to plato and take plato as the first writer to attempt a systematic aesthetic two documents by plato the symposium and the republic reveal the twin components of platos aesthetic system in the symposium plato divides the universe into spheres in one sphere the lower one finds the forms of beauty in the other the higher beauty as diotima tells socrates is absolute and supreme in the republic plato defines the poet as an imitator a thirdrate imitatora point which modern critics have long since forgotten who reflects the heavenly beauty in the earthly mirror in other words the poet recreates beauty as it exists in heaven thus the poet as neoplatonists from aquinas to coleridge have told us is the custodian of beauty on earth however plato defines beauty only in ambiguous mystical terms leaving the problem of a more circumscribed secular definition to philosophers poets and critics during most of the history of the western world these aestheticians have been white therefore it is not surprising that symbolically and literally they have defined beauty in terms of whiteness an early contradiction to this tendency is the marquis desade who inverted the symbols making black beautiful but demonic and white pure but sterilethe marquis is considered by modern criticism to have been mentally deranged the distinction between whiteness as beautiful good and blackness as ugly evil appears early in the literature of the middle agesin the morality plays of england heavily influenced by both platonism and christianity these plays set forth the distinctions which exist today to be white was to be pure good universal and beautiful to be black was to be impure evil parochial and ugly the characters and the plots of these plays followed this basic format the villain is always evil in most cases the devil the protagonist or hero is always good in most cases angels or disciples the plot then is simple good light triumphs over the forces of evil dark as english literature became more sophisticated the symbols were made to cover wider areas of the human and literary experience to love was divine to hate evil the fancied mistress of petrarch was the purest of the pure grendels mother a creature from the lower regions and marshes is like her son a monster the bad characters in chaucers canterbury tales tell dark stories and the satan of paradise lost must be vanquished by gabriel the angel of purity these ancients as swift might have called them established their dichotomies as a result of the influences of neoplatonism and christianity later the symbols became internationalized robert burton in the anatomy of melancholy writes of dark despair in the seventeenth century and james boswell describes melancholia that state of mind common to intellectuals of the th and th centuries as a dark dreaded affliction which robbed men of their creative energies this conditiondark despair or melancholiawas later popularized in what is referred to in english literature as its dark periodthe period of the grave yard school of poets and the gothic novels the symbols thus far were largely applied to conditions although characters who symbolized evil influences were also dark in the early stages of english literature these characters were mythological and fictitious and not representative of people of specific racial or ethnic groups in the th century english novel however the symbolism becomes ethnic and racial there were forerunners as early as shakespeare has lago refer to othello as that old black ewe attaching the mystical sexual characteristic to blackness which would become the motive for centuries of oppressive acts by white americans in the tempest shakespeares last play caliban though not ostensibly black is nevertheless a distant cousin of the colonial friday in daniel defoes robinson crusoe robinson crusoe was published at a historically significant time in the year the english had all but completed their colonization of africa the slave trade in america was on its way to becoming a booming industry in africa black people were enslaved men tally as well as physically by such strange bedfellows as criminals businessmen and christians in the social and political spheres a rationale was needed and help came from the artistin this case the novelistin the form of robinson crusoe in the novel defoe brings together both christian and platonic symbolism sharpening the dichotomy between light and dark on the one hand while on the other establishing a criterion for the inferiority of black people as opposed to the superiority of white one need only compare crusoe with friday to validate both of these statements crusoe is majestic wise white and a colonialist friday is savage ignorant black and a colonial therefore crusoe the colonialist has a double task on the one hand he must transform the island africaunproductive barren dead into a little england prosperous lifegiving fertile and he must recreate friday in his own image thus bringing him close to being an englishman as possible at the end of the novel crusoe has accomplished both undertakings the island is a replica of mother england and friday has been transformed into a white man now capable of immigrating to the land of the gods from such mystical artifacts has the literature and criticism of the western world sprung and based upon such narrow prejudices as those of defoe the art of black people throughout the world has been described as parochial and in ferior friday was parochial and inferior until having denounced his own culture he assimilated another once this was done symbolically friday underwent a change to deal with him after the conversion was to deal with him in terms of a character who had been civilized and therefore had moved beyond racial parochialism however defoe was merely a hack novelist not a thinker it was left to shrewder minds than his to apply the rules of the white aesthetic to the practical areas of the black literary and social worlds and no shrewder minds were at work on this problem than those of writers and critics in america in america the rationale for both slavery and the inferiority of black art and culture was supplied boldly without the trappings of th century symbolism in in a book entiled nojoque a question for a continent hinton helper provided the vehicle for the cultural and social symbols of inferiority under which blacks have labored in this country helper intended as he states frankly in his preface to write the negro out of america in the headings of the two major chapters of the book the whole symbolic apparatus of the white aesthetic handed down from plato to america is graphically revealed the heading of one chapter reads black a thing of ugliness disease another heading reads white a thing of life health and beauty under the first heading helper argues that the color black has always been associated with sinister things such as mourning the devil the darkness of night under the second white has always been associated with the light of day divine transfiguration the beneficent moon and stars the fair complexion of romantic ladies the costumes of romans and angels and the white of the american flag so beautifuly combined with blue and red without ever a touch of the black that has been for the flag of pirates such is the american critical ethic based upon centuries of distortion of the platonic ideal by not adequately defining beauty and implying at least that this was the job of the poet plato laid the foundation for the white aesthetic as defined by daniel defoe and hinton helper however the uses of that aesthetic to stifle and strangle the cultures of other nations is not to be attributed to plato but instead to his hereditary brothers far from the aegean for plato knew his poets they were not he surmised a very trusting lot and therefore by adopting an ambiguous position on symbols he limited their power in the realm of aesthetics for plato there were two kinds of symbols natural and proscriptive natural symbols corresponded to absolute beauty as created by god proscriptive symbols on the other hand were symbols of beauty as proscribed by man which is to say that certain symbols are said to mean such and such by man himself the irony of the trap in which the black artist has found himself throughout history is apparent those symbols which govern his life and art are proscriptive ones set down by minds as diseased as hinton helpers in other words beauty has been in the eyes of an earthly beholder who has stipulated that beauty conforms to such and such a definition to return to friday defoe stipulated that civilized man was what friday had to become proscribed certain characteristics to the term civilized and presto friday in order not to be regarded as a savage under western eyes was forced to conform to this ideal how well have the same stipulative definitions worked in the artistic sphere masterpieces are made at will by each new critic who argues that the subject of his doctoral dissertation is immortal at one period of history john donne according to the critic samuel johnson is a second rate poet at another period according to the critic t s eliot he is one of the finest poets in the language dickens argues professor ada nisbet is one of englands most representative novelists while for f r leavis dickens work does not warrant him a place in the great tradition when black literature is the subject the verbiage reaches the height of the ridiculous the good negro novel we are told by robert bone and herbert hill is that novel in which the subject matter moves beyond the limitations of narrow parochialism form is the most important criterion of the work of art when black literature is evaluated whereas form almost nonexistent in dostoyevskys crime and punishment and totally chaotic in kafkas the trial must take second place to the supremacy of thought and message richard wright says theodore gross is not a major american novelist while ralph ellison on the strength of one novel is leroi jones is not a major poet ed bullins not a major playwright baldwin incapable of handling the novel formall because white critics have said so behind the symbol is the object or vehicle and behind the vehicle is the definition it is the definition with which we are concerned for the extent of the cultural strangulation of black literature by white critics has been the extent to which they have been allowed to define the terms in which the black artist will deal with his own experience the career of paul laurence dunbar is the most striking example having internalized the definitions handed him by the american society dunbar would rather not have written about the black ex perience at all and three of his novels and most of his poetry support this argument however when forced to do so by his white liberal mentors among them was the powerful critic william dean howells dunbar deals with blacks in terms of buffoonery idiocy and comedy like so many black writers past and present dunbar was trapped by the definitions of other men never capable of realizing until near the end of his life that those definitions were not godgiven but mangiven and so circumscribed by tradition and culture that they were irrelevant to an evaluation of either his life or his art in a literary conflict involving christianity zarathustra friedrich nietzsches iconoclast calls for a new table of the laws in similar iconoclastic fashion the proponents of a black aesthetic the idol smashers of america call for a set of rules by which black literature and art is to be judged and evaluated for the historic practice of bowing to other mens gods and definitions has produced a crisis of the highest magnitude and brought us culturally to the limits of racial armegeddon the trend must be reversed the acceptance of the phrase black is beautiful is the first step in the destruction of the old table of the laws and the construction of new ones for the phrase flies in the face of the whole ethos of the white aesthetic this step must be followed by serious scholarship and hard work and black critics must black experienceregions where dig beneath the phrase and unearth others due to historical conditionthe treasure of beauty lying deep ing and cultural deprivation canin the untoured regions of the not go then we intellectually its consider the idea of a vv black aesthetics we v rm need not look to aris xqnnsh totean academes or white western artistic qualifiers we need not be preoccupied with classical dramatic unities or traditional plot and character development we need not submit ourselves to the arbitrary classes of absurdist impressionist surrealist naturalist or other available labels m t which have absorbed new dimensions in american dramaturgy we need not in search of a black aesthetics we need only to look to ourselves we must probe the depths of the black soul and unleash the wild wings of the black spirit its flight will lead us forever onward and upward to a greater aesthetic appreciation of the free black spirit the aesthetics of black art come from within it is the internal made external for within the creative psyche of the black artist who must be deep into the reality of his own existence is born the essence of black aesthetics from its union with community it is thus the internal consciousness of the black artist from whence come the sole standard if you will of his art black artists must not look for absolute external aesthetic criteria for selfexpression for that forced objectivity negates a fundamental aspect of creativitythe self instead he must view his art from within the total spirituality of his blackness and create new forms and new standards which offer a truer reflection of himself and his art in theater the thrust of aesthetics is the drama of the black experience it derives its energy from black lifestyles and exerts a positive force toward the dramatic perpetuation of that life it redefines the theater process into an arena of selfawareness selfdirection selfcriticism in relation to the entire black community it is a marriage of the self and the community whose child is art as such black theater fosters a great festival of blackness where new doors are opened new directions forgedand new aesthetics developed from the dark continent of the progressive black being it is indeed intellectually satisfying to expound upon the ideologies of a black aesthetics but the total grasp of such knowledge is missed if the intellectual aesthetics renders itself impotent in practical application the viability then of a black aesthetics or the art of black life can only be appreciated in the truest sense by its function it must live it must live on the streets as well as reside in secluded ivycovered minds the viability or the living of a black aesthetics in theater rests in a total liberation from a white or negro mentality to an artistic awareness of the beauty of black activity it is functional active alivefor a true black aesthetics lives in every black man it walks talks eats and sleeps with every black man it is the essence of black existence it is the soul a black aesthetics can never function in theater unless there is a conscious living black we as black artists in theater must explore every speech pattern every physical movement every psychological crisis of a black existence in white america we must know the indigenous art of black life completely so as to be able to use that uninhibited style as the artistic impetus to a dramatic presentation of the black experience otherwise there can never be a black theater reflective of black life or black people we must combine all phases of theater divisions into a communal direction towards the development of an afroamerican theater tradition its product is a merger of the black actor playwright director and audience in a common quest for a total liberation to a cultural and political identity free at last from the rusty chains of western aesthetics the castrated black actor in what is conveniently referred to today as american theater must regain his artistic masculinity he must emancipate himself from the auction block of commercial theater and hollywood glamour once free physically and most important mentally he then can utilize in a new theater perspective aspects of black life eg movement speech character these new techniques that are characteristic of black people become one important foundation for the building of a black aesthetics in theater the black actor no longer acts or imitates he lives he lives blackly his mind and body are stripped of the facade of broadway professionalism and left naked to discover the mysterious essence of his stark black existence he is free from current theatrical restrictions to think black and thus give birth to a true black art which is an essential and a living part of his existence as a black man the black actor is liberated from an artistic colonial mentality to that of an independent creator once liberated he serves primarily as a liberator he is a messenger to the community he then in turn liberates the community to a significant cultural and political awareness essential to the freedom of all black people the messenger communicates the message which is the revolutionary philosophy of the playwright his literature is the prophecy that heralds the creation of a black artistic medium as the only form which fully expresses the aesthetic truth of black life the playwright is a sculptor who com bines various aspects of black life into a soft fertile clay and molds the spiritual essence of the black experience into a solid living structure impervious to the intrusion of white exploiters the playwright has created now he must communicate as a black artist he directs himself to the black community to which he is both educator and student as educator the playwright teaches his people the glory of black heroes the resolution of social problems and the art of community politics he exposes the flaws of black society to foster internal reform he praises black accomplishments to instill hope and ambition he proclaims black beauty to show forth pride in being black he teaches his people about themselves in order that they may appreciate their blackness as a unique blessing the theater then becomes a great ritual of ethnic identity and ethnic worth as student the black playwright looks to his community as a source of material he must learn about himself in relation to his people in order to provide a true representation of black life the playwright learns from the people he chooses to portray thus the black community dictates the technique he must use to effectively relate to that community black people as a collective body will dictate the form and content of black drama and in r the end they will judge the artistic merit of the playwright as his art speaks for the people and himself the black community at large is both the source and the critic of the black playwright it is clear that the community as a collective society is the center of black aesthetics in our quest for a functional application of a black aesthetics in theater and the devejr opment of an afroamerican theater tradition we must look first to the black community therein lie the souls of black folk therein lies the beauty of black life as reflected by black people therein lies the black aesthetics a functional viable black aes thetics grows from an alliance of the artist with the community the artist and his audience become one in search of the spiritual truth of blackness in a righteous effort to create an indigenous black art a living theater a living aesthetics though we may al come from god where n we decide to take ourselves is what we eventually become though we change at the moment of decision thereby making if one talks of america morality a matter of strengthand distortion of the natural world sin at its vilest the lie with which we whip others in line and with which we kidnap our senses that is why the blues is the most important art form ever produced in america ever possibly in the west because it has the big feeling as john lee hooker says it broke past the lie became rudely vulgar in its exposition of w truth spit in the face of venus de milo the armless bitch incapable of the embrace stumbled through the flung lye of loneliness so often scalded walking barefoot in the glassstrewn alleys of anguish maimed by memories suffering the treason against the self which is called sentimentality but at the end with its tongue hanging out in love dunt you want to rock or got a good rocking mama and the way she rock is all right that is the final specificity of feeling and of life the woman reached or wished forand say babe dont you remember me that is the blues to me means no one is crushed if he or she can summon the strength to understand what has happened which is identity therefore b b king need not be threatened by white musicians he knows who he is and knows as we all must as long as youve got black people youll have the blues the truth that nothing is easier to carry than the lie for the moment we diminish our adversaries we diminish ourselves there is no other way to look at it and neither black artists nor black people can afford purely in the arena of personal growth to do this for that the turning of other lives to ideas that perpetuate fantasy is where the white man has been as long as we can read or remember backward r f the heaviest growls the biggest truths always come together to make the strongest art forms and i believe that the blues or rhythm and blues as popular art forms amongst black people have kept us sane as a mass as opposed to the maudlin weeping of a white folk form like country and western musicthough both musics the folk black and the folk white deal with the same areas of challenge death natural disaster and anguish but white men crumble and end up shooting people from bell towers because their arts have not prepared them for the pressurecooker of living which burns or purifies but to get way down in it the fantasy which america suckles like a synthetic breast is created by the fact that the country is controlled by faggots and dykes from ymca toilets in washington to hollywood to broadway to fashion circles they who must reorder the world because they are not and can never be that which they would want to be hence the abstractions the trail pulled from struggle to the salivating desire for instant change as lsd not too long ago made for instant spirituality as though god could so easily be hidden in a chemical lsd and indians anything other than what one is which leads to whowhom you are we as black people need none of this for most often we seek not instant life change nor insulation but merely a vessel from which to express that which we know to be true bullshit notwithstanding all men come forward with equal internal chances but the fags and dykes would have us believe otherwise that human reality is subjective and freedom but a state of mind those ideas oh so useful because they themselves are some place else their minds are perpetually in pursuit of the alteration the reordering of what is naturally placed forward hence aggression vietnam dead jack and bobby kennedy slaughters on the wholesale of black people as the most natural must be done away with and controlled first or fashions wherein women are made to look like men which cools out the faggotsand we know the dykes dig it we should want total truth and realize ourselves as fools if we wish otherwise we must seek to understand all levels of living must be strong as nothing black people have ever created in this country or elsewhere has ever been easy the only instants ever were fear and death creation always took time and understanding even more than that which is why black artists must seek the inner workings of every possible thing their eyes ears and senses can find for the redeeming qualities are those which a personor a peoplewould have whether or not the place was america africa or alaska that is say black women are not beautiful because other women are not but simply because they are things must be seen that way or one ends up having something by default which is there can be no doubt the rankest way to look at the world all possibilities of heroism and growth are eliminated because the measure against which one compares his legs are ricketturned and eaten with sores from the start and one can thereby just walk on to the finish line very cool let us say then this man would be good whether all other men were rotten or all other men were good false gods called ourselves are not necessary are never necessary as clear vision for it is only the insecure who need to shout down all other voices to be heard since the strongest thing will stand up anyway and i will never say that the white man is responsible for my possibilities my strengths prowess or ideas me no ill never give him that much credit i would be whatever i am if i were a south american indian whod never heard of america can you dig that now to get down to further business the thing at hand there may though may is almost idealistic come the time when we will have to kill people and it must always be understood that its people were killing not ideas fantasy abstractions nor even our wishes that part of ourselves we would like to be but destroy so that we will not more fully pursue that illusion as long as we know those policemen those mayors and even presidents we may have to do away with in selfdefense long as we know they are men and yes have wives families lovers as long as we know those things murder in defense of whatever possible vision is humane for it is when men become abstractions that the land of the soul is inflamed and any evil is possible and even the most cursory thumbing through of the white mans history will show that his greatest failing has been his inability to accept the humanity of those whom he murdered to accept that responsibility which is where all those funny names come from polacks niggers jerries chinks japs redskins etc and the tools the ideas the mentalities and responsibilities or fear of them which are involved in the overthrowing of a system are the building blocks of that which will follow the smoke so we must be very much together internally to truly come up with something different we must be on the move for as leroi jones says love not bloodhounds sniffing the tracks of a misshapen world whose tenets and buildings are but caricatures of our real power the presence of self of spirit nowadays when attention is so sharply turned on the black creative writer as prophet and analyst of the black soul and psyche the recent book black expression weybright and talley edited by addison gayle jr provides a kind of counterbalance which helps to bring the whole matter into better perspective it is becoming harder and harder to live in isolation from our own literature black literature has of course been going on all the time but there was a time when black people werent encouraged to be particularly aware of it perhaps in the james baldwin of the fifties in the leroi jones of the sixties we can trace the current movement of affirmation in which more and more black writers seem bent on making the black reader aware that his life through art is captured in all its fullness and preserved so that he may savor it and be shocked by it even so the contemporary reader is frequently unaware that that whole other body of writingthe critical apparatus which must accompany artistic endeavorexists and exists from the pens of black men this is exactly the point black expression makes addison gayle jr has collected in this work a very large number of essays from various sources and fashioned them into a neat comprehensive volume the essays represent work published as early as web du bois and langston hughes five of the essays were written especially for black expression the established recognized men of black letters are to be found here web du bois alain locke sterling a brown arna bontemps j saunders redding the writers themselves are included langston hughes margaret walker richard wright james baldwin ralph ellison leroi jones black scholars who will be active in the shape of things to come are here john henrik clarke james a emanuel addison gayle jr there are others writers critics popularizers whose names are not so well known but who have or had a sincere commitment to the fortunes of black literature in america the book contains a preface and an index the preface examines at length the peculiar position of the black critic and what his role should be and puts forth the thesis that understanding black poets depends not only on knowledge of american literature as some white critics may presumptuously declare but also on a critical perspective conditioned by the manyfaceted experiences of the negro in the turbulent american society the essays themselves there are forty of them are divided into four categories folk culture poetry drama and fiction the inclusion of a section on folk culture can be perhaps justified on the basis that the oral tradition constitutes literature as well as the written however the reader will probably find that this section stands somewhat apart from the rest the section on poetry is quite complete the entire history of black poetry is there dudley randalls essay black poetry rounds out the picture by speaking at length of the revolutionary black poets of today the section on drama is perhaps the most exciting gyrating as it does between commerciallyoriented theater and black revolutionary theater the reader must conjure up in his imagination on the one hand the large whiterun whitepatronized whiteoriented movie houses and broadway musicals the minstrel shows which preceded them and on the other work in the black communities by and for black people traditionally harlem but also more recently watts and san francisco california and newark new jersey compare for instance this passage from jessie fausets article that laughter for which we are so justly famed has had in late years its overtones of pain now for some time past it has been used by colored men who have gained a precarious footing on the stage to conceal the very real dolar raging in their breasts to be by force of circumstances the most dramatic figure in a country to be possessed of the wells of feeling of the most spontaneous instinct for effective action and to be shunted no less always into the role of the ridiculous and funnythat is enough to create the quality of bitterness for which we are ever so often rebuked with the following from k william kgositsiles towards our theater a definitive act we will finally be coming to grips with where we are really at historically we will be destroying the symbols which have facilitated our captivity we will be creating and establishing symbols to facilitate our necessary constant beginning old decadent wouldbe black woman this theater will straighten out your mind instead of your hair the last and largest section on fiction deals with various things the novel the essay and the intangibles of attitude aesthetics and destiny the amount of research and organization necessary in putting together such a volume should not be underestimated however one would have hoped for better editorship in one or two areas the most perturbing aspect is the absence of publication dates for a significant number of the essays a chronological ordering is especially important in the field of black letters due to the accelerated character of its development in the twentieth century when one comes across these words by langston hughes but to my mind it is the duty of the younger negro artist if he accepts any duties at all from outsiders to change through the force of his art that old whispering i want to be white hidden in the aspirations of his people to why should i want to be white i am a negroand beautiful if one realizes that they were first published in then one understands that the younger artist is hughes himself and not his younger brothers of the sixties who may indeed express the same sentiments though in more militant style and one would understand instantly if one had not up till then why dudley randall can state elsewhere in the volume that hughes in the midsixties was still holding his finger to the pulse of the times there is it is true at the beginning of the book copyright information on most of the essays and by referring constantly to these pages the reader can most of the time determine when an essay was first published however as if by some ghoulish prank it is precisely in those essays lacking copyright information that we come across such phrases as for some time now recently in late years currently wallace thurman and jessie fauset are especially frustrating in this respect there is here and there the need for clarification in the form of an editors footnote we need to know something about the amsac writers conference to which julian mayfield refers in his article this is important as the conference apparently provided the impetus for the article the preface makes much of the fact that black critics are the invisible men of black letters the whole reason for the books existence is presumably to remedy this it is not clear from the books subtitle essays by and about black americans in the creative arts that we are dealing exclusively with a collection of black writers this is something the reader will probably ascertain by prior knowledge and inference as he gets further into the book but confusion however momentary could be avoided by a very short footnote at the beginning of each essay giving the date of publication and some information about the author and would greatly enhance the books handiness and tighten its organization admittedly some of these men need no introduction but there are others here who are not necessarily familiar to the general reader these weaknesses are more than compensated for by the richness variety and scope of the essays themselves one of the beauties of the volume is that it will immerse the conscientious reader in the world of black literary criticism and will do it not within the rigid confines of the programmed syllabus but gradually and leisurely it must be admitted that some of the essays will sting and irk some readers because some of them are bound to reflect an attitude about blackness which is odious to him therefore if you like james baldwin you must prepare yourself for eldridge cleavers essay which decimates him if you feel that acceptance into the mainstream or the negros contribution to american letters is of no relevance then several essays including margaret walkers new poets may vex you if you pride yourself on your deep reverence for black american literature then leroi jones essay which probably should be more specific in its charges will exasperate you writers themselves may understandably take offense at nick aaron fords blueprint for negro authors writers presumably know how to make their own blueprints all of the essays are not of the same quality and there are some contradictions for instance arthur huff fauset and sterling a brown will instruct you differently as to the existence of the rabbit in african folklore and addison gayle jr in his preface gives a picture of frank yerby very much different from the one given by nick aaron ford all these different opinions and the reactions they may provoke in the reader do no more than point to a strong feature of the book it is not slanted toward any one school or period of black criticism there is every shape of article here the richly informative reportage of ernest kaiser the literature of harlem the reminiscing tone in arna bontemps negro poets then and now one cannot help but be aware of the scholarships behind james a emanuels interesting comments in the future of negro poetry a challenge for critics as opposed to the downright antischolarly and negative attitude of wallace thurman in negro poets and their poetry there is also the sensitive perception beautifully expressed of the artist himself as in the case of ralph ellisons richard wrights blues certain essays are enjoyable not only for what they bring to our understanding of literaturenathan a scott jrs essay on richard wright contains a wealth of allusions to the american and european traditions in generalbut also the light they throw directly or indirectly on other aspects of the black experience addison gayles own essay perhaps not so soon one morning will be of special interest to teachers for it deals with one black instructors attempt to introduce black literature to students for the most part black and puerto rican and the reader cannot help but be encouraged by the rewarding experience his perseverance brought to those students the reader venturing into black expression penetrates into a world where black literary expression can be studied but more importantly where it can be experienced through all its manifestations and in the entire length of its american history the reader is invited into this world by men and women who have that kind of relaxed acquaintance the writers they deal with if you are at all interested in black literaavailable only to those who share the heritage and the experiences of ture you must read this bookcarolyn gerald anita followed her a movements in the bu j reau mirror as she deftly applied pink lipstick to the full cupids bow of her mouth then pausing she gazed critically back at her reflection the offshoulder black cocktail dress fitted snugly over her round curved hips while the white pearl necklace and earrings set off the creamy tan of her skin she decided that she looked very chic and smart im sorry you wont go with me claude she said turning now to the man seated at a makeshift card table desk in the comer of the bedroom i got more important things to do he grumbled sullenly bent over the mound of papers a frown wrinkled tiny delicate lines between her widespaced eyes as she stared long at him sometimeslike nowhe looked so forbidding to her with all that fierce black hair worn stiff and high and long bushy hair growing down his dark brown face into sideburns which ended in an entangled brush of beard with all that hair covering his face and arching above the thick full lips he looked like a black samson a black samson who needed hair to give him his manstrength she sighed reaching to struggle her fingers one by one into the white linen gloves you never go anyplace with me anymore not since he had gotten so wrapped up in the movement the movement almost an obsession with him now he lit a cigarette from the crumpled pack of larks on the table flicking the match into the already overflowing ash tray i got better things to do right now the movement the movement she almost shouted at him thats all you think about hell i believe in the movement too but christ i cant live the movement im also an individualist a person not just a negro person i cant eat sleep and go to the toilet with civil_rights and hating the white man with each breath i take i cant submerge the fact that i also like to have fun once in a while i like to enjoy a good book not soused with racism listen to pretty music valk in the park and admire the natural green of the grass and blue of the sky i like to look up at the strength of the trees growing high and i like to look down and gaze into the coolness of a spring brook i like to see and do those things as a person without their being marred all the time by hating and thinking about the white man she stopped feeling out of breath like the words had drained her slowly she went over to him caressing his haid broad back outlined in the colorful summer african shirt with geometric patterns of spears and masks surrounding a lion cant you relaxsometimes it was a plea he tensed beneath her touch not turning to her not looking hell no thats the trouble now we been relaxing too long your daddy and my daddyrelaxing uncle toming all those years letting things get tougher and tougher claude thats not true you know how our parents yeah

and back to the suburbs i work with those people i cant refuse their invitations all the time besides in my line of work it gives me an opportunity to meet others and make significant contacts significant contacts he sneered excusesexcusesexcuses you just want to be with them and act like them and wish you were like them you cant forget your little black bourgeois upbringing about how great it is being in with white people like a status symbol she stepped back as if struck you had the same socalled black bourgeois background as i yeah baby but got out that second year in that middleclass snooty college i got out and joined the movement i left my doctor daddy and my social sprinting mother beeehind there are times when i think youre jealous because at least i did finish his hands tightened on the chair the knuckles showing like taut knobs through his skin she knew the lance had pierced always between them now were angry hatefilled words making them no longer one but two divided into sharp brittle separate pieces blown by different winds and guided by different stars go on where you going he muttered thickly i got work to do work she repeated bitterly watching him shut himself away from her over the desk her eyes swept the papers before him the array of pencils and the oldfashioned battered typewriter what kind of work work keep us going and i work because my black skin still doesnt deter me from liking good scotch good steaks living in a decent neighborhood and seeing a good play and its my work thats doing it she watched him puff heavily on the cigarette knowing she had wounded this timestruck where the sore was like a cancer eating him finally he laughed shortly some work the only nigger in a government job placement center a showpiece to prove nobodys prejudice a nigger behind a desk whos pretty and looks white with a forever florida suntan big deal meim out in the streets working with the brothers out there where the nitty gritty is fighting mister charlie im going to make whitey realize im a man i want to be treated as a man and baby i am going to be treated like a man takes a lot to make a man she scoffed slamming the door hard behind her the doors slam was like a slap a burning sting pierced the tips of his forefinger and thumb the cigarette had burned down to a pinpoint heat he dropped it in the burial ground of others a sharp recurring pain streaked across his forehead blurring his vision and the words on the paper she had caused him to lose his thought just when his pencil had moved and written a wonderful spring of free flowing words he was certain this one was the onethe essay that the atlantic monthly or new yorker would publish he was sure because he knew it was good it was just as good as any of baldwins or jones or cleavers wasnt he socking it to whitey spilling out his seething hatred and venom and frustrations making whitey feel guilt making whitey want to feel punished by the hot word lava flung at him by a black writer now was the time for the black writer to emerge because whitey was a masochist who wanted to be verbally whipped by the black man for his guilt whitey wanted the negro to tell him like it is tell him that he wasnt shit never was shit and never would be shit but the black man was some shit and even if blood had to flow the black man would prove he was some good shit he stared down at the papers and rejection slip that had come in the mornings mailthe telltale slip he had tried to hide from her the stock words swam before him thank you for your submittal which we are returning to you please dont consider this a reflection on the quality of your work he crumpled up the letter damn them whitey wouldnt even give him a chance to tell it like it is he got up stiffly noticing the soft summer evening rapidly fading into night a mauve twilight streaked pink and lilac ridges across the blue sky what he needed was a drink he went to the kitchen where a bottle of cutty sark was on the sink he got a glass from the cabinet and half filled it with the clear brown liquid raising the glass to his lips he savored the rich expensive odor of the scotch then suddenly in revenge he flung the glass across the room it made a dull thud against the wall before crashing into pieces on the floor the ache in his head flared anew he closed his eyes thinking he had to get out away from hereif only for a while he had to walk a block down the neat wellkept residential street with rows of modern onestory box houses and green carpets of manicured lawns before he could board the bus he felt the eyes upon him as he took a seat midway by the window the people on the bus stared furtively at him because they were used to seeing cleanshaven negro men in wellpressed suits dress shirts and carefully matching ties in this neighborhood this amused him so he always played a game with the passengers first he would glare at the white women gazing boldly to frighten them through his boring eyes with all those stories about the black mans sex powers some of the women would look away nervously averting the blackeyed spotlight beaming upon them while others would squirm uneasily on their seats as if what his gaze was divulging made them want to masturbate then tiring of this he would turn his fierce threatening look to the palefaced washedout cleanly scrubbed dickless white men and watch them wither as they wondered if he were there to start a riot or rob them or rape their women it was a tough hard funny wellplayed game that he enjoyed very much but tonight he didnt feel like playing instead of staring at them he simply ignored them by looking out the window and down at the cars appearing like miniature bugs darting in and out of the traffic soon the white people began to empty the bus and after a while he was left alone to travel into the belly of the ghetto where the seats would then be taken by others like himself he felt a surge of exhilaration when the first sister got on a large black perspiring woman grunting up the steps flopping down tiredly on the seat in front of him her hair was short and shot straight up as beads of sweat sprinkled the bare crinkled kitchen of her neck he smelled her sweat felt her tiredness wallowed in her big black brassiness and felt suddenly hilariously drunk you wont be tired long we black men are going to take up for you he thought he had said to himself but when the woman turned stared at him and back he wondered if he had said it aloud the ghetto noises began to drift in and rock with the rhythm of the bus flashing neon signs shattered kaleidoscopic shock waves of pawn shops bars furniture outlets and allnight grocery stores soul music spilled from the sleazy bars and shabby mountainous hollow eyed tenements into the streets bouncing off the hot pavements with its loud soaring beat home he wished anita would move here where his work was his heart lay and where his pain could be borne with a little more ease but no she wanted to stay where they were because it was closer to her work and she liked it there the streets were taking on the evenings life men lounged on the corners cracking jokes and making passes at the pliant flashing swell of brown yellow black feminine pulchritude floating by in gales of teasing laughter he breathed deeply soaking in the fetid air and the sounds and sights he liked it here he got off the bus and walked back to the movements office a few people who knew him waved he waved back bracing his shoulders in a swagger making the lion on his shirt stretch as he smiled broadly at them the office was locked he stood at the door for a moment then decided to go to tubbys black bar across the street the place was deserted except for two men in dingy tshirts and faded pants at the bar drinking beer an old man halfslept in a corner by the jukebox blaring james browns wailing blues shout the mans muddy face sank heavily in deep valley folds he was dressed in overalls that fell over and hid his shoes from time to time he would awaken sip from a glass of beer gone flat and nod again hi claude the shiny dark baldheaded man behind the bar greeted him hey tubby whiskey he perched on the bar stool glancing around at the shabby booths and worn wooden floor which had held and showed the weight and scuffle of many souls long gone friday and saturday there was hardly room to get in the whiskey was set before him it was cheap and raw and burned like a blaze going down his throat but it warmed him and he began to feel mellow inside he reached in his pocket and pulled out a crumpled bill the weeks pay from the movement slow night he commented picking up the change yeah too hot to stir anyway i got no air conditioner tubbys head jerked back to a lone fan in the window whirling a bee sound to make a faint breeze suddenly a police siren screamed outside reaching high above the wailing of james brown the two men further down the bar turned quickly trying to peer out the dirt streaked plate glass window a quick visible chill of fear iced their eyes the loud whine ceased but from the proximity of its subsidence they could tell it had stopped somewhere near claude kept his eyes on the glass he had to drink slowly to make the liquor and the money and companionship last james browns bellow ended in a crying moan leaving the room silent and each mans thoughts naked to the other trouble tubby said frowning too hot a night for trouble the police cars siren squealed again and faded away the old mans eyes opened as if on signal and he reached for the beer glass that was encircled with skimmed foam well tubby smiled relief flooding his face gone probly nothing much next round on the house brothers then the polices warning song shrilled again coming closer and louder like a screaming angry hyena the scream stopped in front of the bar the door swung back and two uniform policemen entered everybody up and over against the wall the big stout one ordered standing spraddlelegged with gun drawn in the middle of the room search em ed he said to the tall thin young one who looked and acted like a rookie the two men at the bar resembling welltrained robots moved simultaneously to stand against the pock marked wall scribbled with countless names and addresses and epithets the old man half stood obediently in his corner then through no volition of his own swayed back down in his chair too drunk to stand you too pops the big officer snapped pushing the bill of his cap back to unmask small narrow eyes then moving uncannily fast across the room he jerked the old man to his feet and shoved his dead weight against the wall the man bent his will to blend into the scars of the walls legacy of past histories whats wrong officer tubby asked quickly i aint had no trouble in here but weve had trouble white man was mugged down the street were looking for the nigger who done it it was then his eyes discovered claude still sitting firmly on the bar stool their eyes met the white mans cold grey steel of a winters sky and the angry black mans storm of inbred hate goddamnit you get over there to that wall like the rest claude steeled himself against the bar planting his feet solidly on the rungs of the stool who the hell did they think they were bursting in here like this they had no right that white man who got mugged had no rightbeing here in their world words came out revealing his thoughts what was that white man doing down here anyway looking for black pussy the policemans mouth opened in surprise his thin lips folding like a tent against the flabbiness of his face for a stilled deathlike moment he was too shocked to say anything then giving an angry bellow his meaty hands seized claude by his shirt ripping the african symbols and tearing the lion into shreds furiously he slammed him against the wall the hardness struck his head stunning him for a moment he knew he had fallen because he felt the floor and grit under the palms of his hands dazed he saw the big black shoes of the policeman shift and before he could roll out of the way felt the hard weight of the lawmans foot plunging into his side pain gripped him as his body was left as breathless as a deflated balloon black bastard i believe you the one done it get the goddam hell up get up he got up slowly the hurt bursting through him the room swirled in a circular motion reminding him of the ferris wheel he rode on when he was a boy that went around and around and when he closed his eyes he could yet feel the revolving sensation in the blackness he felt numbed and on another planet where there was nothing and even the nothing would not keep still the cheap rotgut whiskey rose to his throat he wanted to vomit but he swallowed and swallowed the bile to keep it down he couldnt do that not before him dont this one look like the one he described ed naw bull the young cop replied shaking his head eyes nervously skirting claude he said the guy was little and yellow with he looks like him to me bull growled spittle making bubbles at the corners of his mouth his tone became wheedling now dont he to you the young one looked down and away as if studying the thought but said nothing the men against the wall stood motionless like a shadow of silent ghosts claude guardedly watched the cop called bull thinking if that white sonofabitch hit him again hed kill him so help him hed kill that white motherfucker im goin to take this nigger in bull said pointing to claude comon lets go claude worked his lips they felt cracked and he could taste the salt of blood around them the movement of his mouth to speak hurt but the words came out strong not betraying the inward pain how you going to take me in he just said i didnt fit shut up nigger i can take you in for anything i goddam got a mind to we ought to take all you black coons in and kill ever last one of you pow pow like that he waved his pistol menacingly shoving it into claudes face suddenly upon seeing the beefy face and the wild grey eyes so near the old familiar ache crossed his forehead as a rushing tide of black ancient fires of loathing seared through him his black fist clenched doubled hard and drew back the white target wavered like a leering pendulum before him it seemed like a time without beginning or end but it was only a second before his right fist raised ladened with the weight of his rage suddenly there was a weakness in his arm like a pressure was holding it back subconsciously restraining it making his arm not a part of him but a separate entity the fist shot out lightly grazing the fleshy white chin goddam black bastard the policeman roared he saw the cops gun handle raise in the air and pause for a blinding moment before he closed his eyes and waited to go down in darkness he awakened in the back room of tubbys on a hard dirty cot a cold towel was over his forehead and he felt the bandage behind his ear the pallid yellow naked bulb shone above him making him aware that he had entered the now you goin to be all right man tubby said soothingly standing above him face anxious that other cop grabbed his arm just in time to keep him from really knockin your brains out they didnt take me innaw they too scared i guess the skinny one said sumpin bout the chief wanting em to lay off crackin niggers heads for a while guess they scared we might start a riot he laughed a dim sound can you make it home by yourself ill call a cab gently he removed the towel i can make it he shifted his legs over the side of the bed and with effort stood up groggily im ok aside from a pain in his head and the blood caking his lips making them heavy and swollen only thingonly thing i sure wished i had knocked the goddam pure white shit out of that motherfucker but he hadnt he hadnt or was it that he couldnt a chilling helplessness invaded him blown by the winds of past ancient black futility he suddenly wanted to go home at home he didnt bother to wash he simply stepped out of his tattered clothes and got between the clean white sheets in his shorts it was early but seemed late to him it was early when she came home yet seemed late to him he closed his eyes when he heard her key pretending to be asleep his ears followed her movements from the living room to the bathroom where he heard the running water the flushing of the toilet then her foot sounds in the soft mules coming into the room the bed dipped slightly as she slid in beside him he could smell the peppermint toothpaste and the avon cream she applied to her face at night as well as the faint odor of her perfume still clinging to her he wondered why it hadnt taken her as long as usual to go through her nightly rituals without opening his eyes he knew it was because she hadnt put her curlers onshe hadnt planted the garden rows of wires to make her hair bloom round soft ringlets in the morning he heard her turn over on her side and sigh soon she would be asleep listening to her steady breathing he thought she hadnt spoken to him or even tried to awaken him and talk with him she hadnt noticed the bloody bandage behind his ear or the cakey brown crust on his mouth it was as though he wasnt therewasnt there like the white policeman had actedlike he was nothing a nameless phantom to be pushed and cursed and ignored he was nothing at all absolutely nothing suddenly he opened his eyes to shout at her as the white policeman had at him make her notice him see himrealize he was there the darkness met his eyes first upon seeing it he felt inept frustrated in the mire of his thoughts somehow he knew she hadnt even bothered to turn on the light in the room at all simply undressed in the bathroom and followed her instinct around the darkened bedroom to the bed she hadnt wanted to see him anita he shouted sitting up angrily anita she stirred moving a little what is it claude the words were even estranged from him coming sleepy and muffled in her pillow he swallowed hard what was it what did he want to tell her about the eveninghis failure a failure because of a yet alive ageold fear of the white man still ghosting his black mind and making him ineffectual was that what had caused his abortive effort to strike back the way he really wanted to hard strong like a mannot a feeble man how were the nice white people he finally asked the question meaningless to him but it was an attempt a start for wasnt she there eating and drinking and laughing with them while others of them were beating him up oh god claude not tonight again im sleepy he moved closer to where she was lying with her back to him a perverse anger made him want to continue did you sneak out in the car with any of those faggot blonde boys whore always trying to get you in bed behind my back she did not answer her back and her silence a barrier to him they almost killed a white sonofabitch downtown tonight for that thingafter black women is that so and the police thought was the one who did it now hear that he thought gleefully the police thought someone like him could do thatwas capable of defending his black women welldid you had he detected a note of sarcasm in her words the derision dipped over him like smoldering hot honey was it her cool contempt that made him feel she knew him too well i could have hummm with your black_power i suppose damnit anita look at me the words spewed out a belch of fire before he realized she couldnt look at him because of the darkness even if she did look there would only be the dark outline of him that was a man all right claude she murmured in exasperation turning towards him so a white man was half killed and i was involved the police beat me up in a bar the words were hesitantthe story not coherent puzzle pieces which he couldnt put together for her snatches of thoughts and actions left hanging in the air so whats so new about that the white mans been beating nigger heads since slave time and will still do it whenever they can get a chance it just happened that you were there at that time in that particular situation suddenly her voice softened claude im sorry are you hurt bad she reached for the light on the bedstand but he stopped her he didnt want the light the light and its harshness would destroy the mood and the moment and turn his feelings inside out the sudden concern of her began to anger him but wasnt that what he had wanted her sympathy kindness the protective shelter of his black woman as all black men had wanted and gotten at some time whats there to be sorry about he snapped defensively were all going to get bloody fighting the system in the movement we expect those things welcome them roll with the punches and give out some too you dig me baby unhuh she yawned shifting back to her side of the bed to him the disdain was there in the mocking aloofness the ache in his head began again slowly intensifying the pain from the cut on his head he had been a buffoon all nighta black travesty beaten by what he was trying to beat destroyed by what he was trying to destroy and now he was being buked and scorned by what he imagined her to be all in one a black tribe of amazons towering in statuesque dominance over the black male pygmies stunted by the white mans nurturing the ache increased as pain and heated resentment flowed hotly through his loins the boiling blood caused his manhood to rise stiff and long the throbbing elongated maleness of him made him passionately aware again of what he was and of what he could do he could make babies like the white man he could and should make hundreds of babies to create an army to fight the white man hundreds of black babies to make the white mans milk black he could he was a man wasnt he uttering a harsh desperate cry his arms reached out to grab her to pull her savagely against him he wanted her to feel and know the strength of him the depth the height the power and the glory his bruised sore lips smashed against hers then tearing the flimsy material of her gown he covered her with his stink and beard anger and wretchedness he entered her before she was ready and was hardly conscious of what he was doing he heard and didnt hear her cries to cease for him to stop get up get off he had caught her by surprise she stiffened beneath him trying to close the entrance to her against him but he swelled and gloried in the battle that he fought now without gun or fistonly with the spear of him stabbing again and again into her until finally he felt her weaken and grow pliant under his warriorlike strokes to make her submissive to his will and strength and manhood he fought and fought marvelling at his staying power pridefully thinking he could go on and on like this all night but when he felt the moistness of her beginning to receive him bringing him into the hot deep well of her that claimed him now and made him feel caught and obliviously lost he realized the battle was over and in the end he cried out in triumphin defeat after a quivering moment that froze him he rolled off her breathing heavily expelling the last of his strength before he closed his eyes to give up to the tiredness he heard her say in a voice that made him know she knew it takes more than that to be a man then he thought he never wanted to awaken again in a mirror a soul a twopart volume of poems richardson sister fabio has written two books of poetryboth of which are sarah webster fabio meaning a blkpoet and both about what is relative to blkpeople meaning the blkexperience of blkpeople the distinction sister fabio draws between the mirror and the soul is both heavy and finea combination of the visual and of the aural visually the book is in two parts with one part reversed no matter which side of the book is up aurally sister fabio has done a thing with the written languagewrites it to sound like we sound in her foreword she presents her whythe existence of a black mother tongue born out of necessity from a period where not only were blkpeoples bodies shackled their minds enslaved but their tongues were tied and then proclaims that this then is a bilingual if not trilingual volume but back to the distinctionthe fine onethe distinction blurs somewhat for two reasons first there are poems in both sections which could comprise an intermediate section languagewise poems such as a downhome recipe from a black soul mothers workshop my own thing artifacts from home free by any means necessary and formula for liberation second and perhaps primarily though sister fabio has done a thing she hasnt completely done a thanga direction in which our blkenglishteachers should move and i say this is primary because in coming short of a thang sister fabio defeats some of her purpose in having the book in two sections what actually happens is that where she writes the language so that it sounds like we sound for the most part there are a few exceptions she has not written it to look like we sound then we deal with the fact that most blkpeople reading from a written page tend to pronounce read english words using the english pronunciation patterns they have been taught likewhen we look at whipping we more often see and read whip ing rather than whippin which is more often what we actually say or like the difference in your behind and yo behine or the actual difference in capturing and not capturing our blkspeech patterns in sightsound but for the poetry itself some of the poems are beautifully worked through the

white incubus by ottilie markholt white liberal sits fnrl like a giant incubus on the black freedom movement it has devoured the interracial civil_rights organizations and waves their empty husks at the black people trying to cajole them into fleshing out the dead organizations with their presence probably it is futile to belabor the white liberal for his blind arrogance he is so clearly incapable of understanding his present role in the civil_rights movement that he professes to believe in and cherish he is after all whitesharing the views of his white culture and by choice preserving his place in the white community at best he was an innocent dogooder whose presence in civil_rights activities could be tolerated by the black community at worst he has become the pawn of the white power structure in its desperate attempt to avoid facing and dealing with the emerging black strength in america alone among white americans the white liberal has a conscience of a sort he believes that he is a moral man and america is a moral nation this is essentially what separates the white paternalist from the white bigot but the white liberals conscience and his morality are inseparable from his white superiority during the last decade as the black revolt gained momentum the white liberal discovered that the hitherto nonexistent black people were being outrageously treated in america he became indignant over their wrongs and he began to march he picketed to integrate schools jobs neighborhoods he crossed arms locked hands and sang black and white together we shall overcome some day he gave time energy money and occasionally his life for years he was theredoing the right things for the wrong reasons the white liberal worked from several basic premises that it was tragic to be bom black that black people should wish to be and should be exactly like white people and that he knew at least as well asprobably better than black people what they should want and how to get it his morality his social justice consisted of deciding that people with dark complexions should share his white america on his terms live in his neighborhoods attend his schools and work beside him what more could they want he did not question the basic values of white america for they were his values and therefore absolute he argued with complete sincerity they are just like us the only difference is the color of their skin to himself he might add if some of them are culturally deprived they are not to be blamed they have been segregated so long integration will help them advance to black people he said im completely color blind i dont even think about it and he tried earnestly to practice this enlightened outlook when he socialized with black people he relished his own broadmindedness in offering himself as a true apostle of integration and giving his negro friends the opportunity to associate with a white person his utopia was a completely integrated america peopled by lightskinned white men and darkskinned white men the black ghetto was alien while he might fraternize in the civil_rights movement with individual blacks in the black community their numbers and strange closed faces frightened him he ventured into the ghetto as a civil_rights crusader but at night he went home thankfully to his white neighbor hood this was the white man who marched and sang in washington dc and selma sincere dedicated paternalistic and completely white he performed his good deeds with the blind arrogance of a white man dealing with black men the white liberal failed to ask the hard question he does not know they are there to be asked how can i know what black people want what place in white america do they really seek am i bound to respect their right to make their own decisions or respect them as equals there is a watershed of identity from which values arise almost all white americans are glad they were born white and they accept without question the superiority of their white western culture they feel sorry for people who were born black and who do not share freely in that culture to them the black man must automatically wish above all else to lose his black identity and be completely assimilated in their america when black people do not welcome this they are thought to be ignorant backward or prejudiced they think the black community and black institutions should dissolve as rapidly as opportunities for integration will permit for example the persistence of the black church puzzles them now that many white churches profess to welcome black communicants when the central conference of the methodist church chose to retain its identity white liberals smiled knowingly and said it was because negroes liked to flourish their bishops titles that the black methodists were too selfimportant to give up their little empires for integration they believe black clergymen are trying to keep their flocks out of white churches because the black preachers would surely lose their pulpits because white is right they assume that white churches could serve black people better than black churches they do not doubt that when black people have progressed sufficiently they will turn to the white churches they have not the least understanding of the great and living strength of the black church the actions of black and white demonstrators were the same their motives were not the black man picketed a segregated school because he knew his child would have a better opportunity to learn in a predominantly white school where it was assumed the pupils could and would learn and the school was oriented toward that end he knew that no matter how intelligent or gifted his child might be the child would learn little in a segregated northern school th where the staff considered black pupils culturally deprived and unteachable and many of the children responded to this rejection with equal hostility he was not seeking to thrust his child among white children because they were white but because education was available in their classrooms the white man picketed because he thought black children would be improved by attending wfiite schools and mingling with white children he knew his schools were better and he was willing to be generous and dilute them with a few disadvantaged black children the black child could only benefit from assimilating the cultural values of his white schoolmates the relative merits of bach and rhythm and blues were certainly not debatable the black man demonstrated for open housing because he wanted the opportunity to live wherever he chosebecause the ghetto walls permitted landlords to charge him more for poor housing than he would have to pay in an open city he did not wish to destroy the black community but to breach the walls that surround it the white man picketed because the very existence of the ghetto which he equated with both a slum and the black community was the ultimate mark of humiliation and shame he was trying so hard to help his darkskinned compatriots forget they were not just like himtrying so hard to forget it himself during the late summer of i was associated with a core chapter in a large eastern city it was the second chapter to be organized there almost entirely black national core had revoked the charter of the previous affiliate organized and dominated by white university students this black chapter had the confidence of many of the militants in the black community a white social worker director cf a large settlement house in a black neighborhood worked with the chapter he was a small intelligent energetic man who loved power he had been active in organizing the march on washington in another city he gloried in what he thought was his successful manipulation of this core chapter and its supporting groups he told me as much the black leaders watched this supposed exercise of power utilizing the mans energy and talent completely aware that they must retain control of policy decisions they did the glimpse i had of national core was different and distressing that fall i attended as an observer a regional core conference in new york city it was dominated by three white experts on the national staff two of them particularly were assured white men i could not imagine them pausing to doubt their competence to tell the black freedom movement what to do the black staff members had minor roles in the conference i do not know what the black delegates thought of these white experts this was two years before the blackwhite struggle in core became public i first saw seattle core during the school boycott the spring of the morning of the boycott in response to a lastminute call for additional help i reported to the core office the second floor of a vacant store building in the black community i had been receiving the core bulletin and was impressed by the chapters activity a white woman was minding the office coordinating activity for the freedom schools under cores direction she sent me immediately to a large catholic community center overflowing with children her daughter a college student bubm bling with excitement drove me over arent they just adorable those little deprived black children she cooed i grunted we reached the center before i could reply that the little black children were not deprived the principal of the freedom school was a strong black man most of the teachers were white liberal intellectual types some of the special features of the curriculum reflected white values the white woman playing a gavotte on the harp was obviously a brief exposure to the better things for the deprived black children a white man played southern racist songs on a violin for each class black music was ignored there was no proud statement that black is beautiful one learned black scholar lectured on the history of black people in america concluding with langston hughes rivers otherwise black culture was not recognized the white students almost a fifth of the enrollment were largely the children of the white liberals who supported the boycott they tended to be mouthy and selfassured seeking to monopolize the class discussions they probably duplicated their public school roles outwardly the boycott was successful in numbers of students who participated but im not sure what it did for the black community it appeared that whites dominated the planning and certainly the teaching staff had the freedom schools grown from within the black community i should think there would have been black sunday school teachers to staff them as it was many of the white teachers showed little understanding of their black pupils and the pupils had the experience of another white teacher rejecting them the dominant mood among the white staff members was we are noble and benevolent in fighting for the right of these deprived black children to attend our schools and mingle with our children i wonder how clearly the black children and their parents got the message a few months later i was appointed to our local naacp executive board protesting that i didnt think white folks should be making policy i was told by friends who privately agreed with me that so many white faces were necessary on the board and if i declined some other white person would be appointed so i began to attend meetings resolved to say little shortly after that another white board member concerned over the naacps lack of support in the black community proposed we send representatives to various organizations to explain our program and invite them to discuss their problems all board members white and black were expected to speak for the naacp in the black community i objected to the idea of sending white members into the black community to tell black people what to do this was arrogant and paternalistic i tried to explain white peoples limitations their place in the civil_rights movement as helpers and not leaders the members present black and white were either firmly disapproving of or outraged by my statements that the black community would not and should not be expected to accept white naacp spokesmen some denied angrily the black racism they thought i was implying the black community contained a black woman warmly defended the white paternalists citing mary white ovington and her spiritual descendants in the naacp through the years the two black board members who would have agreed with me were not present that night the consensus was resolutely color blind but the project of speakers before black organizations was not mentioned again i can only guess how the black civil_rights activists felt during those years about their white liberal allies the white liberal was talking about freedomjustice equality but it was freedomjusticeequality on his terms as he chose to grant and administer them this may not have been apparent at first possibly the black activists credited white liberals with more understanding and less arrogance than the whites possessed possibly they believed the whites would lose their paternalism as they came to know and understand the black community i have often found black people more charitable in their assessments of whites than i thought was warranted judging by their own humane culture they seem unable at times to believe that white folks can be so mean the deep cleavage between white liberals and the black community was dramatized when the concept of black_power became an angry slogan hurled at white america the white folks illusion of allowing darkskinned white people to share their white western culture on their terms was threatened white liberals had approved the humble and prayerfully supplicant posture of the nonviolent black demonstrators to them it was right and natural that powerless black people should beg and powerful white people should decide to grant they had accepted black people on the assumption they were trying to become white now they were forced to look at black men who did not beg and did not wish to be white their treatment of adam clayton powell revealed their inability to accept a proud black man socialists and other hitherto staunch civil_rights supporters joined the white establishment in attacking and reviling powell they could not understand black peoples loyalty to him then stokely carmichael shouted black_power and the sorting out began many white liberals who had marched and sung in and retreated to silence those who remained by their own definition dedicated workers in the civil_rights movement joined the establishment to denounce this frightening new idea or searched desperately for negro leaders who would say the things they wanted to hear no wonder the white liberal was horrified and alarmed by the black_power slogan and its attendant concepts his paternalistic role was challenged with all his blindness and disdain for the ghetto and for blackness he had claimed the ancient white prerogative of knowing what was best for the negro now he was being told he could merely help it was a deep affront to his white superiority he could not accept a subordinate place so he defended his paternalism by attacking black_power assuming that black nationalism was indefensible he attempted to destroy blackness with it how did this white man suppose black people had lived for the last three hundred years in america in complete negation and selfrejection in limbo waiting for the final day of integration when they could forget they were considered black first and american second the white liberal was shocked that black people were not sorry to have been born blackthat they considered themselves beautiful most of all his ego was shattered by black peoples defense of the fearsome and alien ghetto to him it was a slum to be wiped out bulldozed as soon as possible it was the supreme gesture of arrogance to question the precious gift of integration the white liberal was working so hard to bestow not to want complete and immediate integration on his terms was separatism racism prejudiceinreverse anything less than his kind of integration was antiwhite he saw nothing valuable in the black community he saw black culture only as a willful and misguided failure to become white in the name of his mythical integrated negro he would destroy the black community and its culture he was unaware of his double standard for a black man to criticize white culture and defend black culture was antiwhite and biased for him a white man to criticize black culture and defend white culture was not antiblack but objective those white liberals who remained in the civil_rights organizations fought the black militants for control black militants in the naacp have charged that the united auto workers faction in the last two conventions used every tactic from bribery to threats of physical violence to retain control of the organization its declining membership nationally reflects the black communitys growing lack of confidence in it last fall a group of leaders in the black community here tacoma wash organized a strategy committee to press for certain goals among them were officers and members of the naacp their first target was the personnel of a newly created human relations commission and particularly its executive director a prejudiced white man in whom they had no confidence they called for nonrecognition of the commission as constituted and appointment of a black director the commission was characterized as an instrument of appeasement controlled by the white power structure this program was presented to the naacp executive board with a request for naacp support and implementation led by the white liberals the board recommended rejection of the program i reported the boards action in our monthly newsletter and wrote a signed letter to the editor that began it is time for a white member to speak plainly after reviewing the presentation to the board meeting i said the merits of the proposal are basically not at issue clearly the program was being brought to the naacp by the leaders of the negro community the opposition was led by three white board members for all their lip service to the idea of respect for negroes and recognition of their rights these white members were displaying their superiority and paternalism in not recognizing the right of negro leaders to make basic civil_rights policy in this or any city anything less than our recognition as whites of the absolute necessity of negro leadership is to bring our white paternalism with us right into the naacp we whites are not equal to negroes in our understanding of and ability to communicate with the negro community how could we be we have not walked the earth one day of our lives as negroes granted that these white members have worked hard in the branch that they mean well this isnt enough unless they support loyally the negro leadership they are doing more harm than good to civil_rights if they really respect negroes let them accept this leadership and work to carry out the will of the negro community if the naacp does not support the committee it will certainly alienate itself from the negroes struggle for human dignity i appeal to white naacp members to move beyond their paternalism and join the struggle as loyal followers just before the branch meeting the newly appointed director of the human relations commission hastily joined the naacp he showed up at the meeting with a lengthy appeal for fair play and another chance before being condemned he had already bungled his first case the white liberals were there in numbers indignant at my attack completely unmoved by my appeal they voted down the proposals of the black leaders the arrogance of the white liberals in this branch and their insistence on compromise and appeasement have tended to discredit it in the black community in the seattle core election the end of the whitesupported moderate black candidate for chairman defeated the militant black candidate the defeated faction withdrew and formed an aggressive black community organization the whites may have saved core from the black militants but they seem to have silenced it in the black community in san franciscos fillmore district this spring i passed a vacant core office i saw no evidence of its activity in the community maybe it too was saved from the blacks recently a friend of mine a black woman related how impossible it was for a white man with whom she was associated in an interracial cultural organization to get along with his black peers he seemed unable to avoid the appearance of patronizing them and his feelings were hurt because they did not welcome him as a soul brother he was aggressive in the affairs of the organization the black men universally disliked him what can i tell him she asked me to make him understand tell him that he is a white paternalist i replied he probably is incapable of understanding this or he wouldnt behave as he does white men are the lords of creation and it is virtually impossible for them to be otherwise dont let the white paternalists dominate the organization or they will drive the black people away they already are she replied sadly this last year the civil_rights movement has seemed to make some progress local white power structures are beginning to make concessions to the moderate civil_rights organizations to avoid dealing with the black militants they are engaging in sham battles with these organizations rather than rec ognize the growing power of the black communities for years the seattle school system resisted integration by changing boundaries or busing while de facto segregation steadily increased under its open enrollment plan the school board ignored appeals picketing and the school boycott then the fall of at is the new junior high in harlem black parents demonstrated for a black principal and community control of the school the summer of seattle community organizations moved toward a similar program for their black schools this spring the seattle school board announced plans to close a black elementary and a black junior high school to reduce the ratio of black students in the high school by transfers out and to bus the children from the closed black schools to white schoolsthe naacp and white liberals applauded the progress the black community protested vigorously against busing its children out and demanding a black principal for the high school and community voice in its schools the naacp denounced this program as irresponsible it is true that the state board of education had finally established requirements for racial balance in school districts receiving state funds but to me the real reason for the seattle program is the changed options for the school boards for years the alternative to the civil_rights movements demand for dispersal of black students throughout the white schools was to do nothing and keep the black children penned up in their black schools now the white community has realized that those black schools are the breeding ground for a continuing crop of young black militants and the focal point around which the black community is uniting to demand community control and black administrators now the dispersal of these black students has suddenly become desirableto stifle their rising black consciousness the school boards program was not a victory gained by a strong civil_rights movement but an attempt to thwart the growing strength of the black community the same changed options were operating before and after the assassination of dr martin_luther_king jr for years the white community had been opposing his demands and demonstrations then early in as the nation began to look forward to another violent summer his nonviolent philosophy became a viable alternative to that of the black militants just before his death the saturday evening post featured an article in which he said that the poor peoples march on washington would be the last chance for nonviolence to prove its usefulness he implied that one of the purposes of demonstrations was busy work to allow black anger and white guilt to be vented in harmless channels malcolm_x told us years ago the march on washington was busy work dr_king still believed white america had a conscience that could be awakened and he preached love for all men for these reasons he became the acceptable alternative to the black militants the appeal to conscience could be ignored as it had been for hundreds of years the lavish public mourning after his death by the same white power structure that had fought him during his life was a cheap attempt to buy time and appease black anger that great opinion manipulator the readers digest for june featured two great sermons by martin_luther_king and a lead article plain talk about hatred and violence by a white liberal to me passage of the civil_rights act of was not a tribute to dr_king but a comment on the flames in the sky over washington dc white paternalism is inherently as racist as white bigotry it stems from the same concept of white superiority and the same lack of respect for black people and black culture the white paternalist embodied in the white liberal demonstrates his abhorrence for blackness by seeking to wipe out the black communities and assimilate blackskinned white men in his white western culture with increasing urgency the white liberal is being used against the black community he is truly the last best hope of white supremacy lawyer his sibility crisis by judge raymond pace alexander t was years ago when i then only a few years out of law school accepted an invitation from a distinblack lawyer in des moines iowa george h woodson and an equally brilliant lawyer of chicago a much younger gentleman c francis stradford to address the proceedings of the national bar association at its third annual convention i had never known either of those gentlemen before that convention george woodson then in his middle fifties was the founder of the national bar association organized in des moines iowa in c francis stradford then in his middle thirties was its president in neither of these revered barristers is any longer with us but each of them left his monumental contribution to the glorious history of this great association for a long number of years the national bar association truly was the lone voice crying in the wilderness as it were among all the organized law associations in americawith one exceptioncrying for justice and equality for the american negro the lone exception to which i pay loyal and respectful tribute was the national lawyers guild do you remember those years forty years is a long time ago and it might be well to recall some of the events of those years briefly and what the negro lawyer faced in his convention city detroit what he talked about his then problems before the american courts and indeed before america itself they were bleak and dismal years his future the future of the american negro was uncertain the full history of those near three decades to is an intensely absorbing and in many aspects a heartbreaking story which is well worth telling because it is an important part of the history of the american negro and of the american negro lawyer and his contribution to the ongoing and difficult struggle for better race relations in america time obviously prevents a detailed discussion of this subject what were our problems at that timein what were the subjects on the agenda for the negro lawyers assembled in detroit at the outset you must be reminded that we had no detroithilton or any other firstclass hotel white or black in which we could meet the white hotels just would not have us and we had no recourse to any court of law we met as did all negro organizations at that time in the ymcas and in the negro ymcas at that the total number of negro lawyers in america in barely totalled and half of that number were concentrated in three cities washington d c had about but were working in government offices there were approximately in the new yorkbrooklyn area and about in chicago as an illustration of their few numbers there were only lawyers in philadelphia as contrasted to todays less than in pittsburgh the remainder scattered principally in the large industrial cities of the north such as cleveland detroit indianapolis st louis and los angeles and san francisco there were perhaps less than in the entire south where they were most definitely needed where a mass of million black americans lived and labored in the farming cottongrowing states these people were crying for help but the law gave them no protection and their white overlords cotton plantation owners farm labor bosses sheriffs kkk night riders and other race baitors and terrorizesgave only the whip and the lash the torch and the rope if they made any organized effort to assert even the barest minimum of their constitutional rights to register to vote to serve on jury to be free from beatings to obtain forced confessions or to demand abolition of segregated rail and bus transportation in fact any organized and entirely peaceful protest against intolerable working conditions would cause the most cruel and inhuman abuse of those who protested to recite all the crimes and injustices committed against innocent black people of the rural south from to when we lawyers took up the defense of these people would cause your blood to chill in your body there was a crying need at that time for bright dedicated and courageous black lawyers there still is such a need today there was an equally crying need for a national organization of negro lawyers in those days there still is a great need for the national bar association today and let no one try to convince you that you have done a good job your mission has been accomplished and now since the american bar association has dropped its racial bar the national bar association is no longer necessary i would like to tell you my own personal experience in trying to become a member of the aba from to and of their refusal to admit me because of race but that is not a pleasant story and i prefer to let it rest to be told in detail in my memoirs the national bar association is needed more today than ever before in its historyand in a few moments i hope to tell you why let me remind those of you present tonight especially those who were too young to know the events of those years that at our annual conventions where cases of the character just alluded to came to our attention by our members we would discuss the legal points involved and assist the lawyers who were handling these cases from the hearings in the police court through the trial and state appellate courts and thence on appeal before the united states supreme court it was the negro lawyer who gave hope to the defenseless masses of black people of the south and sustain them in the belief that america offered a future for black people free from torture and despair and to the everlasting glory of the negro lawyer he was victorious in the overwhelming number of civil_rights and human rights cases argued before the supreme court during the last years including the greatest in the field of education in all its history the brown vs board of education case in to those who are interested in further research on this subject i prepared an article for the association for the study of negro life and history entitled the upgrading of the negros status by supreme court decisions which is published in bound volume xxx no a later and more complete study in book form appeared in entitled the petitioners the story of the supreme court of the united states and the negro loren miller a great lawyer and later a distinguished judge of the municipal court of los angeles who died quite unexpectedly in july commend these works to those who want to know more about the legal status of the negro who was in every respect a ward of the united states supreme court for more than years as loren miller aptly put it as befits a dependent a ward the negro has had to solicit the intercession of his guardian when he has sought to exercise rights and privileges enjoyed by grown up white citizens as a matter of course that negroes have had to secure supreme court decrees in order to do what white americans can do without question such as buy or rent homes vote in primary elections ride in pullman cars read daily newspapers in city libraries loll around in public parks eat in bus stations or swim in the ocean most of these cases were argued and won by negro lawyers many by loren miller himself who was eminently successful especially in the field of restrictive covenants barring blacks from open housing the names of these negro lawyerheroes as i like to describe those brilliant barristers who have been so successful before the highest court of our land are many and long and the list of heroes is increasing annually it is perhaps improper to mention a few without naming all but i must pay deep and solemn respect to two successful advocates in a number of unusual cases one was the architect and planner of scores of landmark decisions favorable to blacks a profound scholar in the field of law with whom i was associated as an underclassman while he was a senior at harvard law school i refer to the late father of civil_rights charles h houston i also pay deep and profound tribute to dean houstons protege who became one of the most successful advocates at the bar of the supreme court now mr justice thurgood marshall a member of the supreme court he was a student of charles houston while houston was dean of the law school at howard i also pay tribute to the law faculty of one of americas great law schools the law school of howard university it was the faculty of this law school that inspired and sharpened the minds of the bright young men of our race encouraging many of their graduates to follow the leadership of houston and marshall to countless victories in the state and federal courts throughout this nation i cannot leave this part of my subject without adding that a score of howard university college and law graduates now grace the benches in at least state and federal courtsa great step forward from the year years ago when we could count at that time and for twelve years thereafteruntil only one negro judge in all america the late judge james a cobb of the municipal court of the district of columbia in an america which spends mounting billions of dollars for defense and additional billions in the frenetic and chauvinistic race in the search of outer space we as negro lawyers guardians of the increasing millions of our people who are still wards of an affluent society living in the ghettos the cesspool inner core of great wealthy cities must challenge our government to retrieve and cultivate the inner space values of the negro of america we must challenge the government to find the true soul and heart and meaning of the negro what it means to be a negro and what he as a man and his family as a unit and his people as a race means to america and the future of this country the black lawyers of america the same professionals who with consummate skill and advocacy mastered the lawyers highest art the art of the relevantalways focusing their argument on the principal problems germane to the case at hand must now become the leaders of their people and fill the vacuum created by the death of one of the worlds most treasured souls dr martin_luther_king jr black lawyers must make relevant to america that today the need for new unselfish dynamic and talented leaders among the negro people is greater than at any time in the last years in no other way can the death of this great and most holy of the worlds modern men be vindicated in this way alone can the mortal wound to america be healed the black lawyer can fill this void he is among the best trained professionals of his race he has had years of study of the history of mankind the social ethical psychological and socioeconomic problems of masses of people of diverse background living together in great urban centers etc he also has had additional years of study of the increasingly large number of subjects and areas of investigation making him the ideal person to assume the leadership role in finding and proclaiming to america and to the world the relevant issues the relevant values and objectives which american negroes seek and demand from america above all we as lawyers must always demand equal opportunity equal treatment and full justice for the negro in every matter necessary for his total participation in the life of his country to be able to do this he must have three things that go hand in hand to make him a functional literate and healthy citizen he must have good quality education in the finest schools with a large percentage of male teachers to restore the father image so long removed from the lives of the young because of the sick society that surrounds the negro family in the ghetto an education free from the defeating handicaps of segregation in both the north and south so that the child will be able to get and hold a job to fit his skills or to further his education in the sciences or the professions the doors of commerce and industry must be opened widely to provide jobs at every level this may mean we lawyers must take some harsh measures against labor unions that deny negroes apprentice training and others that bar negroes from membership these cruel and repressive practices have for many long years deprived the negro worker both the skilled and the able apprentice of his manhood and of the ability to provide for his family racism has denied him the needed skills to work in industry in effect denied him his right to work and therefore his right to earn a living third in our list of objectives is the all important one of a decent place to live all these goals go hand in hand education jobs and nonsegregated housing either one education or two jobs without the third nonsegregated housing will weaken and ultimately destroy the new structure that must be built for a free negro in a just america we must select from the great black talent at the american bar now numbering negro lawyers a very encouraging increase from the lawyers in one man orif need be a committee of three one of whom i suggest be a womanwho will reject all ideas of separation of the negro from the mainstream of american life and of setting aside a negro state this is an utterly stupid and ridiculous suggestion completely devoid of any sense or reason it is sheer fantasy we have fought separation of the races in america all our lives many of our great lawyers some no longer living and many in our audience here tonight have literally sacrificed our lives our homes and subjected ourselves and our loved ones to assaults abuse and insults too degrading to mention to save our country from the shame and world stigma of an apartheid america how can we support the claims of those who say integration is irrelevant to the aims of the negro what we have fought for described in brief detail earlier resulting in countless victories in the highest court of our land is a documented story that speaks louder than my feeble words that america itself accents integration as the sensible goal to seek in the continuing struggle to make one family of all americans an equally important goal to seek is to commit america to the eradication literally the complete elimination of the hardcore ugly ghetto areas in the cities which is the real crime in the streets the disorders that flow from these disgraceful blots on the landscape are seeded nurtured and allowed to grow to full bloom by the willful neglect of the heartless the apathy of the disinterested and the failure of those who know better to become involved in americas problems the census if taken today would show the black population of america to be close to of whom nearly live in the inner cities the five largest centers of black population are washington d c per cent newark percent baltimore percent chicago percent and philadelphia percent there is a very forceful human problem underlying this whole question clearly if for no reason other than an economic one though the human social problems to my mind are the greatest the country must see that if it is to survive there must be radical and monumental efforts made to eliminate this cancerous sore in the midcities but we as lawyers who live in or near these communities from which so many of our clients come must know how destructive these conditions are it is our duty to see that the black members of congress by appropriate legislation urge our government to provide billions of dollars to remove the poverty families from the lifedestroying ghettos and provide healthy suburban or outercity areas so that these people may have some hope for the future and perhaps for the first time in their lives a sense of selfrespect faith in their fellowman and pride of race we as lawyers know from our travels in the backwoods and muddy swamps of the south where we have often gone in the dark days of southern justice to save the defenseless poor among our people from the curse of irrational intemperate and degrading racist justice in southern court houses that those people and now their descendants in the north who live in these ghettos have been confined to a life of voicelessness and powerlessness we have seen the breakdown of our families the absence of a father so long denied the right to a decent job hopeless emasculated in spirit we the lawyers must in a sense invade the ghetto and help to create for the people faith in themselves and faith in their fellow blacks and restore their faith in america which is greatly needed to do all of the above we must have help it is not too much to ask america to unlock its store of treasures and give to the poor and disadvantaged in the richest country in the world some of its wealth this is the only industrial democracy in the world that does not have a family or childrens allowance and as has been pointed out by so many scientists not only is this the wealthiest country in the world but it also is the only one whose streets are filled with rioters each summer canada as does several scandinavian countries has model family allowance laws which if enacted in america would effectively eliminate poverty and the ghettos these laws would give to the people a new psyche new faith in themselves and restore the status the strength of and the respect for the family as a social structure as an alternative to this the black lawyer should urge the guaranteed income plan to congress as a very real and scientific way of creating a base upon which the povertylevel family would be provided the means of becoming an integral and productive part of the american community this is a time to dareand the black lawyer must always do the daring if we could dare to take on the cruel and entrenched establishment and the courts of the old south and win we can dare to go forward against the counterparts of those barbaric institutions now infesting the north there are thousands of northern segregationists equally as dedicated to negro inferiority and secondclass status we can make america a healthy society for all its people the job will not be easy but we have as partners in our efforts millions of fairminded honest and sincere whites what is more important to us as lawyers there are thousands of members of the white bar throughout america who have offered their help both financial and physical and their resources to destroy racism wherever they see its ugly head and to create an america free from all restrictions or barriers free from every economic social or political restraint only the lawyer with his special training and experience to cope with the most difficult legal situation and the most extreme legal emergencies can bring quiet and order out of the overwhelming problem that face the poor within our group we would be able to define the lines of action between what is lawful and permitted within the framework of state and federal laws and acts which inevitably lead to destruction of life and property which are totally against the law and which defeat our purpose while serving to inflame the hatred of those too willing to perpetuate a racist america the call is clear the time is now the need for intelligent unselfish dedicated and courageous leadership awaits your answer is the black lawyer listening a middleaged negro tells it as it is by lloyd l brown am going to talk back to the young black militant talkers who have been doing all the talking lately talk talk talk or to use their expression rap rap rap if all the talk was put together you would have a storm that would really blow the man down but then what would there be to rap about i have been listening intently to all the talkat meetings and conferences and seminars and workshops and on radio and tv discussion panelslistening to everybody tell it like it is and reading all the books and articles and interviews that tell it like it is until i feel impelled to stand up and talk back and tell it as it is its a lot of stuff thats what it is just a lot of stuff i use that word defiantly with no apology for not using one of the fourletter words that every young black militant talker must use in every sentence in order to keep in good standing as a ybmt let us start on that subject why fourletter anglosaxon words arent there any fourletter words in swahili the fact is my young brothers your bold bad use of obscenities from the speakers platform is definitely not in the black cultural pattern it is merely a steal from the revolutionary white kids especially the uppermiddleclass white kids who now that you wont let them play with your revolution are doing their own thing by painting fourletters words on their foreheads because they dont have any old board fences in their fancy suburban neighborhoods on which to chalk dirty words if you call me a brainwashed negro i will argue back but if you call me a mouthwashed negro well you are so right around the age of seven when i first verbalized my own young black militant mood we matured earlier in those days one of the old folks grabbed my neck with one hand and a hunk of brown soap in the other and reamed out my mouth clean down to the tonsils more than years later i can still feel that hellfire of homemade lyesoap and hear the accompanying flow of words that burned into my soul enjoining me henceforth and forever to respect my elders and mind my manners and act decent and not like some poor white trash that dont know how to act the old folks are gone and so is the brown power of their soap and the black_power of their monumental dignity and selfrespect now we have packaged detergents from the a p and young black militant talkers who aint going to respect nobody man and who act just like some rich white trash that dont know how to act according to the ybmts there are of course some words that nobody is allowed to usefor example the word negro at one black_power seminar i heard the chairman interrupt a speaker with the warning that no black person who respected his blackness would ever refer to himself as a negro of course the chairman said we know there are some negroesunfortunately but they got to go laughter and applause anybody really wants black_power calls himself black thats our own word for ourselves nobody who ever considered himself a man ever called himself a negro like most of their white fellow students the ybmts know little or nothing about the history of our people call us what you will five minutes in the library would show that the greatest heroes of our freedom struggle have through the years referred to themselves by various designationscolored people afroamericans blacks negroes another five minutes would show that our worst traitors have also called themselves by those varied terms one of the earliest documentary records of our history in this land is a letter informing the governor of south carolina in about a planned slave rebellion the judas signed himself a black most of the black nationalist ideas of our ybmts were formulated by marcus garvey who insisted that no selfrespecting black man would ever call himself anything but a negro regardless of white efforts to term him something else in his essay who and what is a negro garvey wrote let us not be flattered by white anthropologists and statesmen who from time to time because of our success here there or anywhere try to make out that we are no longer members of the negro race if we were negroes when we were down under the hell of oppression then we will be negroes when we are up and liberated from such thraldom black is a good solid word but it is just as white a term as any you can find in the dictionary webster traces the origin of black all the way back to indoeuropean and that is as aryan as you can get and unless mr webster was a soulbrother black is not our own designation for ourselves it is his colored afroamerican negro blackyou still cant judge a book by its title and every ybmt will have more to talk about if he reads walkers appeal to the colored citizens of the world as well as black reconstruction in america the negro as capitalist as well as black bourgeoisie the negro mood as well as the souls of black folks i say take your pick of the names for our group and please dont call a brother a bad name if he picks one you dont like someday and all too soon you young ones will be old black militants and you wont like it if the next generation calls itself young colored militants and gives you a hard time for designating yourselves with the white word black as for me i still want to call myself a negro which is short for the way the old folks taught me to answer whenever the white kids called me something else im a negroandproudofit i still am another thing you might think about is this negroes and even colored people knew about guns long before the first ymbt hollered get your guns men for the benefit of tv cameramen my boyhood chum chester had several older brothers who owned hunting rifles whenever we had his house to ourselves chester and would take down a couple of the gleaming winchesters not having permission was an added thrill to use in our favorite gamethe kluxers are coming we began by taking our positions at the parlor front window chester covered the street from one direction and i from the other our rifle barrels poking under the starched lace curtains sometimes we waited grimly silent and alert for as long as half an hour before chester would shout that they were coming it was his house and his brothers guns so naturally he had the right to be first to yell bangbang at the imaginary invaders our armed defense of the house was no doubt inspired by the reports we read each week in the negro newspaper about the ossian sweet trial in detroit when a white mob in that city stormed the newly purchased home of dr o h sweet a negro physician one of the attackers was killed by a rifle shot from the beleagured house the physician his family and several friendsabout a dozen persons in allwere charged with murder the naacp took up the case employed as defense counsel the famous lawyer clarence darrow and after several trials all of the accused were acquitted chester and i were only eighth graders thennot college students like so many ybmts of today and so we didnt know a lot of things that seem to have been discovered lately for instance we did not know that our winchesters could achieve a whole lot more than homedefense with them we could have taken power man we could have captured the whole city putting chester in as prime minister with me as his no gunbearer and second shot we also did not know that our playshooting was directed at the wrong kind of people chester and i it now seems should have been banging away not at the attacking klansmen but at the main enemies of our race the majority of negroes both in and out of the naacp who believe in selfdefense but not selfdestruction and also white liberals like clarence darrow who defend them i have saved my most serious complaint about the young black militant talkers till last some of them are preaching white racism those preachments are sometimes called black racism or racism in reverse but you cant turn white into black by a switch in names racismthe idea that there are superior and inferior races of humankindis a modern idea originating from western europeans who happened to be white after the rape of africa and other lands where the populations happened to be nonwhite the most antihuman ideology ever to afflict mankind racism reached its depth of depravity in hitlerism which preached and practiced genocide the extermination of socalled nonaryans the nonpure whites according to the nazis who were a ku klux klan in power nothing they did in carrying out their racial policy was inhumane because the nonaryans were classified as untermenschen subhumans well heres how a socalled black militant leader recently expressed himself black people cannot commit any crimes against white people anything we do to the dog cannot be wrong the only crimes we can commit are crimes against humanity and white people arent part of humanity the name of the speaker isnt important our debate should stick to ideas not to personalities and i would like to hope that this man might think it over and change his mind his statement is racism it is precisely the idea that has branded and burned millions and millions of people most of them black people through the years if racism is in every respect a total evil opposite to the idea of the brotherhood of man does it change its nature when preached by a black person instead of a white race hate and black pride do not go together they are opposites in his famous credo written more than years ago i used to see it framed in our peoples homes w e b du bois after asserting his belief that all men black and brown and white are brothers went on to avow his special belief in the negro race in the beauty of its genius the sweetness of its soul and dr du bois added this profound thought i believe in pride of self so deep as to scorn injustice to other selves dig malcolm_x came to see that our struggle is not a matter of race against race but as he put it is part of the rebellion against the oppression and colonialism which has characterized this era in his last formal speech malcolm stressed that point the negro revolution is not a racial revolt we are interested in practicing brotherhood with anyone really interested in living according to it racism is not a weapon that we can snatch from the hands of our enemy for use against him since racism has no foundation in fact is a total lie and a fraud it has no use except to justify and maintain an existing oppression because racism can serve only an oppressor it is of no use at all to anyone fighting for freedom what we have to do is not embrace racism we have to destroy it the old folks who wiped away my tears of pain and rage when i came home battered by my first encounters with the monster never called it race hatred they did not call it prejudice they called it ignorance though they themselves could not read or write the old folks had a withering contempt for what they saw as ignorance anybody call you that is ignorant anybody believe color makes him better is ignorant plumb ignorant come to think of it nowthe old folks did do more than mouthwash me for life somehow they pounded into my seat of learning and into my head as well most of the fundamentals you are as good as anybody and dont ever forget it carry yourself like a man respect everybody god dont love ugly you come from a wonderful people you young black militants that soul you are always talking about didnt grow in a jukebox it was a long time agrowing and like the old folks songs that so richly expressed it that soul is warm and vibrant with humanity with compassion with love you did not invent the concepts of selfrespect and race pride you did not start the struggle for liberation and survival but those concepts and that struggle are your heritagea heritage to be cherished and to be fulfilled black poems poseurs and power by nikki giovanni like all the milii i tant poems that tell jj how we gonna kick the honkies backside and purge our new system of all honkie things like white women tv voting and all the ugly bad things that have been oppressing us so long i mean i wrote a poem asking nigger can you kill cause to want to live under presidentelect nodick nixon is certainly to become a killer yet in listening to smokey and the miracles sing their greatest hits recently i became aware again of the revolutionary quality of you can depend on me and if you ask whos loving you just because i say hes not a honkie you should still want to know if im well laid there is a tendency to look at the black experience too narrowly the maulana has pointed out rather accurately that the blues is counterrevolutionary but aretha is a voice of the new black experience its rather obvious that while think was primarily directed toward white america ted white could have taken a hint from it we must be aware of speaking on all levels what we help to create we will not necessarily be able to control the rape of newark in the past election was criminal if revolutionaries are going to involve themselves in politics they should be successful and while im sure poems are being written to explain the success of the newark campaign and essays and future speeches are being ground out on brand new scott tissues in living color blaming the black community for not supporting the united brothers i would imagine the first problem the united brothers encountered that they were unable to overcome is that they were not united leroi jones for whatever reason had no business appearing on a show with anthony imperiale issuing joint statements about anything at all because he leroi did not have equal power in his half of the joint joint statements and meetings with the governor did not encourage the black people of newark to support the united brothers because of the prestige of leroi no newark voice is being lifted to analyze what went wrong in the allblack central ward of the people who turned out to vote only percent of them voted for councilmen period they did not vote against the united brothers but they would not vote for them either in a year when black people showed little to no interest in national politics the stage was set for massive involvement in black_power there was no oppositionthe people were not involved in another camp so what went wrong militarismfor one thing to enter the main headquarters of the united brothers one had to sign in this turned most people off then you were asked quite tersely what do you want and if you couldnt answer concisely and accuratelyyou were dismissed the height of this attitude at headquarters was reached when a man carrying to give to the campaign was requested to sign in then engaged in conversation by one of the keepers of headquarters the man turned from the conversation to speak with someone else and was told by a second headquarterskeeper the brother wasnt finished with you when the mans response wasnt satisfactory they pushed him up against the wall and the brothers guarding him were told do anything necessary to keep him in line the man with the money finally made his way upstairs and complained to karenga and leroi and was told his treatment was an honest mistake it was a disaster if that kind of treatment was accorded a man with as much prestige as he had we shudder to think what happened to those who just drifted in to see they offered an apology to the offended brother but that missed the point entirely the people of newark became more afraid of the black candidates and their organization than they were of the present scandal ridden blackhating administration and at this writing not a single black candidate was elected leon ewing has contested the election and asked for a recount this is too badto put it mildly the contradictions are too great revolutionary politics has nothing to do with voting anyway but if we enter electoral politics we should follow the simple formula that every black person is a potential vote and must be welcomed and treated as such with or without dashiki with or without natural i the latent militarism of the artistic community is even more despicableart and the military have always been traditionally opposed we saw the epitome of the new alliance at the recent black_power conference at philadelphia every artist worth his salt had a military wing attached to him the conference had guards the artists had guards the guards had guards even one of the highlights of the conference to me was karengas guards complaining about stanfords guards this is foolish because it has already been proven beyond a reasonable doubtwith the murders of martin_luther_king jr and robert kennedythat anybody the honkie wants to take off he not only can but will whenever and however he wants to stage it the artistguard syndrome seems to center around the impression we can make with the various communities the artist impresses the white community with his militancy and the guards impress the black community with their power its a sick syndrome with again the black community being the loser there is no cause for wonder that the black community is withdrawing from involvement with the black artist watching soul which appears on educational tv in new york the same simplistic crap was taking place soul is funded by the rockefeller foundation and the negro ensemble company is funded by the ford foundation yet the people on soul after giving barbara ann teer credit for founding nec put it down as not being black enough and the last poets which is probably a truer title than they know performed die nigga its just not the same concept as kill it would seem to me that the most important and valid aspect of cultural nationalism would be the support of other black cultural ventures especially since one cultural function is funded by the same white folks who fund the group being put down since black people are going to look at tv they should look at julia diahann carroll is prettier ie more valid than doris day any day of the year and while the idea of cops is bad to me period and extralegal black cops are even worse if black people are going to watch cops shows on tv then mod squad beats the other white vigilante shows and if spy is indeed as ive been told the new lone ranger then bill cosby by becoming the new tonto should help make us aware that we are the indians of this decade the parallel institutions that we hear so much about must certainly have reached their apex with spy for love of ivy is as fine a movie as weve had since nothing but a man and its certainly more valid to us than planet of the apes space oddessy and those other white things we are forced to watch it would sometimes appear some elements of the black artistic community are against popular success unless its theirs sidney poitier has moved into the area where we have said we want actors to goonly we didnt mean and make money i guess everybody knows guess whos coming to dinner is a bad movie but it is neither the beginning nor the end of poitiers career and the righteous indignation we spout is really quite out of place black people will soon quit listening to us if we cant get in tune with them i would imagine its a question of wigs everybody has done his wig poem and wig play you know where we put black people down for not having taken care of business but what we so easily forget is our own wig while we put down commercially successful artists we scramble to the east side to work we fight for spots on tv we move our plays downtown at the first chance we getwe do the very things we say are not to be done just because our hair is natural doesnt mean we dont have a wig we are niggersinresidence at white universities and talk about voting as a means to take over a city then put james brown down for supporting hubert humphrey its all a wig we obviously have no concept of power because if we did wed recognize that the power of black people forced james brown to go natural everybody cant come up through the civil_rights movement cause it just doesnt exist any more when black boys and girls from mississippi to massachusetts write jb letters complaining about this is my country too or was that a john a williams book then we ought to rejoice that brown changes his position the people we purport to speak for have spoken for themselves we should be glad and its not as thoughif we just like to complainthere isnt an abundance of issues to complain about what was john coltrane doing with music that make some people murder him why isnt otis reddings plane brought up from the lake what about the obvious tieups in the murders of john and robert kennedy with martin_luther_kings death what elements in this country conspired to murder both richard wright and ben bella what did malcolm and nkrumah say to each other that caused one to die and the other to be overthrown why have so many arabs and people of arab descent been recently arrested for murder or conspiracy to commit murder and id like to know what the cultural nationalists think about james forman living with a white woman who has borne his children controlling and directing sncc while stokely married to a black woman was kicked out these are cultural questionsrelating to survival but it sometimes seems that the only thing that culturalists care about is assuring themselves and the various communities that they are the vanguard of the black revolution they have made black women the new jews while they remain the same old nigeers we c w have got to do better than this our enemy is the new york times not the amsterdam news its look and life not ebony and we ought to keep our enemv in sight if were going to talk about parallel institutions then we have to recognize the parallel institutions we have it is just not possible to have a crisis of negro intellectualism unless we recognize that negro intellectualism exists young writers ought to recognize that an old writer cant put down other old writers to our benefit a nonswimmer flailing around in a turbulent lake is sometimes better left to drown than that swimmers in trying to save him should go under also this may however be a personal decision one of the main points id like the culturalists to remember is that the jews had over art festivals while in concentration camps the warsaw ghetto itself became the cultural placetoplay until the germans carted them off and while it pleases me to know that we are making cultural strides it also worries me that we are failing to make political connections poems are nice but as don l lee points out they dont shoot no bullets we must as marvin x says read our own poems as a group we appear to be vying with each other for the title brother and sister black that will not get us our freedom poor people have always known they are black as rap brown pointed out just as poor honkies have always known they are white these are facts we need to know where our community is going and to give voice to that the onyx conference recently showed just how far from the community we had strayed we didnt even want people there who werent artists and while onyx will probably come out with an issue now that they have properly impressed the proper people we are in grave danger of slipping away from our roots the new hustle starting with claude brown and brought to its finest point by eldridge cleaver and bobby seale with their hustle of huey newton in hueys biography serialized by that great known black militant magazine ramparts seems to be who can get the ear of the enemv for enough money andor prestige to float on a pink damn cloud to the concentration camps everyone who is breathing easy now that wallace wasnt elected ought to check againthats gas youre smelling artistand it will take more than a black poem or your black seed in me to rid this country of it organizational development in the black community by clifford e darden urban ghettos have often been comjm pared to underdeveloped countries in that widespread poverty poor housing inadequate educational opportunities low health standards and general powerlessness of the inhabitants tend to characterize both to varying degrees in underdeveloped countries much thought and effort has gone into tracking the vital role which institutions and organizations of all kinds have in the development process there has been little comparable examination of the organization of the ghetto in most of the studies being debated the focus has been on individual ghetto residents aggregated into the percentage that are unemployed poorly housed poorly educated etc while this approach is useful for some purposes it completely ignores the organizational life of the ghetto were it not for the fact that black people must for the most part organize themselves collectively in order to achieve the degree of political economic and communal power desired this lack of attention to ghetto organizations would not be very distressing in real it v however the collective energies of black people have played and will continue to play the major role in the economic political and social transformation of black americans in the united states in a time of great uncertainty and confusion one observation seems only too valid progress in all important spheres will necessitate increasing organizational abilitv and skill on the part of the black people it behooves us then to take a more critical look at the current status of organizational development in the ghetto this paper will focus on the basic problems which tend to impede the efficient and effective operation of organizations which are created to deliver collective responses to collective needs and problems the current status of organizational development in the black community could best be characterized as being in the takeoff stage the crucial element of determination to do something about the many ills that afflict black people is now evident in every ghetto across the nation we now see scores of organizations moving on and off the local scene as more or less conscious and purposeful responses to perceived community needs nearly all of these organizations are encountering problems some of which should be briefly discussed historically the most stable and influential organization that affected the largest portion of the black community was the black church this is not to say that the black church was the only organization of any significance in the black community certainly there were others however the black church was unquestionably the most universal of black organizations it existed in nearly every community where there were sufficient numbers of blacks with religious leanings and in those days before the development of intensive black consciousness the number of blacks without religious leanings was insignificant this was before blacks cared about the typical portrayal of christ as a white anglosaxon the black church focused mainly on the nonmaterial aspects of the lives of black people and attempted to soothe and sing away the very real and mundane problems of being poor and black in america it wasnt that the black church wasnt cognizant of the misery and poverty that permeated black ghettos on the contrary these facts were dramatized each sunday when people had to shout and afterwards when collection was taken shouting was a way for blacks to release some of the tensions and burdens which cropped up during the first six days of the week it was a way of giving behavorial vent to the frustrations caused by daily misery except in the larger and wealthier parishes the sizes of the sunday collections were sufficient evidence in themselves that the parishioners were already living in hell the black church as an organization was aware of black peoples misery but tended to either minimize or ignore it in many churches black people were told not to worry too much about living decently here on earth heaven would be the reward of those who toiled and suffered throughout their earthly existence so effective was the church in disseminating this emphasis on the afterlife and future rewards in the celestial kingdom that even today we find a large segment of the black populaceespecially the older peoplestill hung up on not attempting to build treasures here on earth but in heaven this type of religious nonsense has reinforced a lifestyle that can be characterized as essentially fatalistic it is difficult to convey to some blacks the idea that one does not have to leave this world in just as wretched a condition as one came into it all too often many blacks act as if god himself prescribed the pattern and perimeters of their lives and that to attempt to alter these prescriptions would be futile not to mention contrary to his will now the black community finds itself in a transition stage which came on the heels of the great civil_rights movement we are caught between the moribund ethos of fatalism and the nascent ideology of black_poweror progressivism if you wish but old lifestyles which were so deeply ingrained do not die quickly and new ones do not take root overnight consequently we find ghetto organizations in which members have varying degrees of both lifestyles these organizations are somewhat schizophrenicexisting in more than one world and reflecting to a great extent the uncertainties and transitional states of the members but there are other factors which must be discussed before the current state of organizational development can be described and accounted for the reasons for the lack of trust and lack of group cohesiveness within black communities are historical various individuals have presented compelling arguments that much of the historical basis for these phenomena lie in the slavemaster relationships which forced blacks to relate to white superiors and to shun close association with black peers for whatever reasons the concepts of trust and group cohesion are not fully operative in most black communities the lack of trust is evident in different ways it shows in the recurring situations in which several leaders have to be on the board of directors of every organization of any import in the community of course other motivessuch as power status and influenceare present also it would seem that many leaders feel that unless they personally oversee every activity in the ghetto things will surely go awry the inability or unwillingness of various leaders to cooperate as equals has dire implications for the form that organizations take and more important for the pace of development march and simon and other social scientists have shown that the limited cognitive abilities of an individual necessitates a differentiation of tasks and a decentralization of decisionmaking authority without such differentiation and decentralization development depends very substantially upon the finite energy and limited skills of a black elite the lack of group cohesion while not as pronounced as it was or years ago is yet another factor which has reverberations in ghetto organizations conflicting ideologies and the lack of trust combine to reinforce the american ideal of individualisman ideal which some blacks have taken far too seriously forgetting that man establishes and sanctifies ideals but seldom behaves in a manner which is consistent with those ideals some blacksfar too manyhave developed the ideology of individualism into a fine art this serves to obscure or negate the need for collective action and commitment to group goals this adherence to the philosophy of me first and everybody else second leads to the interesting and saddening situation in which a black professional to take just one example declines to assist a community organization because he has prior obligationsto his wife his friends and the standards of his professional association it also leads to the disgusting even nauseating spectacle of certain prominent negroes being paraded around the nation by a houndstoothclad richard nixon as living proof that hardwork and individual effort are still the keys to success this lack of group cohesion is also at least partly responsible for the large number of violent crimes which black people perpetrate against other blacks one would be naive indeed to suppose that salutations of brother and sister have had an appreciable effect on the numbers of heinous offenses which occur each day in ghettos across the nation it would appear that the same system which bred the ghetto has set in motion forces which threaten to make a mockery of all the external shows of unity and brotherhood it is not so much that most black people do not recognize the mutuality of their interests and the commonness of their destiny rather it is that no one person or organization seems capable of sustaining for long periods of time the group effect which is the logical answer to group problems to turn to the influences exerted by ideologies we could if it were necessary classify them along several different dimensions but it is most useful for our purposes to note simply different ideologies do exist and then go on to show how these ideologies affect the performance of organizations the national convention of the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp provides a ready example at that convention a heated debate arose at one point as to whether the organization had been and was still effective in fomenting change and ushering in progress for black people there were those who argued that much had been done and that black people were too close to their goals to turn aside an opposing faction retorted quite sincerely that black people were just as far away as ever from their goals and not a few individuals declared that the naacp had actually moved blacks backwards from where they were several years earlier implicit in the arguments of each faction were different sets of goals and priorities based upon different ideological perspectives this example merely points out the organizational difficulties that arise when several conflicting ideologies are operative in one organization such ideological debates are not peculiar to the naacp recent months have witnessed an increasing number of fiery confrontations between various groups of ideologists within the same organization those community organizations which have thus far escaped the heat of such debates should not feel that they are beyond the danger zone ideological confrontations have a way of rudely imposing themselves upon organizational pacificity ideologies can be useful to the extent that they give purpose direction and even feelings of moral excellence to an organization but like a person an organizaiton cannot go in two or three different directions simultaneously when the ideologies of its constituents become so divergent that the performance of the whole unit is impaired one of several things will occur the organization will become ineffective until the strongest of the ideologies subdues the others or the organization will suffer a defection andor expulsion of those who cannot implant their ideology upon the total unit especially the decisionmaking center or the adherents to all contesting ideologies will continue to battle until the whole organization is reduced to but a caricature of that which existed initially one has but to look around to observe these three processes in action within any number of black organizations it is on the subject of ideology that we wish to proceed into a discussion of organizational development in the economic realm of black communities a word of caution is appropriate here the reader is asked to remember that these characterizationslike all such generalizationsare necessarily but rough approximations to reality and are not presented as the ultimate truth about ghetto organizational development this is but one way of ordering our understanding of how black organizations are faring in the initiation and implementation of change and progress one of the most intriguing developments in the black community is the dilemma over whether to push for progress via community development corporations and the like or via individual entrepreneurs there are several issues involved in this choice the dilemma revolves around the issues of widespread participation by the black community in its own development the psychological and sometimes economic needs of the entrepreneur to do his own thing without the bother of seeking the approval of the community the peculiar criteria by which the white financial source decides to extend or withhold credit and the often critical tradeoff between shortterm purely economic gain and longerterm investment in human resources which ensures future successes or both economic and noneconomic natures the black entrepreneur is a new breed of aggressive energetic black capitalist in his struggle to build a successful enterprise he is both helped and hindered by a wide spread belief within the black community that black capitalism which has been called a contradiction of termsshould not be allowed to replace the oppressive system of white capitalism this belief forces the typical black entrepreneur to modify his operations to provide broad social service eg training for the unskilled daycare centers for working mothers etcfor his employees and others in the community the black entrepreneur is helped to the extent that his provision of or his statement of his intentions to provide social services enables him to obtain loans and even equity capital which would not normally be available to him the tendency of white bankers and other capital suppliers to base loan decisions to black entrepreneurs on criteria such as how much social development will accrue to the community as a result of the operations make it expedient for the shrewd black entrepreneur to devise paper schemes for social services in order to obtain needed capital there are obvious dangers inherent in this situation first a community which is already suspicious of this new phenomenon of black capitalism and of the intentions of black entrepreneurs is likely to monitor very closely the progress of these persons in providing promised social services failures of black entrepreneurs to deliver is already creating increased disaffection for capitalism and entrepreneurship as vehicles for black development second the management talents of black entrepreneurs are already being severely taxed to create and sustain efficient and profitable operations black entrepreneurs see themselves as businessmen not as social workers and they resent efforts by white financiers and black community leaders to force them to assume social service obligations they have had enough contact with bankers and sources of capital to realize that white businessmen obtain their loans throueh sound economic policies which appear on the financial statements and not through their willingness and ability to provide social services most black entrepreneurs have neither the time nor the personnel to fulfill social service promises any time and resources devoted to running a nursery center are resources unavailable for use in the economic sphere of the operations hence black entrepreneurs are involved in a very complex game of trying to operate like any other businessman in a community and financial environment in which they must appear to be more than just businessmen third white financiers through their strange insistence upon seeing a proposal for social services before they lend to black entrepreneurs are burdening the entrepreneur with the problems previously mentioned perahps it is to the white establishments advantage to do so in a very real sense they are encouraging a dangerous con game only the black entrepreneur and the black community can lose it is not the financing source that has to walk that delicate line which separates in the communitys mind exploitation from development all of this is not to say that black entrepreneurs are insensitive to the need for social services in the ghetto nor is this to say that they are not in agreement with the longrun goals of the community black entrepreneurs are as concerned as anyone else about the lack of social services in the ghetto but they question whether they as fledgling businessmen are the ones upon whom the responsibility falls for providing such services they rightly ask why it is that the black community does not put more pressure on city and state and other governmental units to provide for the welfare of community residents black capitalists voice fears that the black community will never build a solid business structure if wouldbe businessmen are shackled by noneconomic burdens so far we have dealt with only the environmental factors which constrain the black entrepreneur looking now at the internal operations of entrepreneurdominated organizations we can see that he faces the problems in a different sort first the entrepreneur dominates the organizationbeing at once its guiding spirit its designer its key man and its primary politician he usually moves at such a rapid pace that his ideas outstrip the ability of his skeletal organization to structure itself to absorb the new undertakings thus the typical entrepreneurdominated organization is likely to be undermanned illdefined and crisisprone because of the lack of sufficient numbers of trained black managers in the ghetto and elsewhere the entrepreneur finds it difficult to hire the persons he needs to develop his organization this is one of his chief organizational problems entrepreneurs are not noted for their ability to develop the organizations necessary to manage the new enterprises that they pull together usually their time is fully occupied in just negotiating the acquisition or development of new operations and not infrequently this is the activity they enjoy most can the entrepreneurs organization survive let alone grow in the absence of trained managers to supervise the operations if it does it will do so mainly because of its adeptness in riding out crises many entrepreneurs lack even the staff necessary to maintain efficient accounting systems hence they seldom know what their profitability cash positions etc are at any point in time perhaps the greatest difficulty the black entrepreneur faces is conflict with representatives of the community over the issue of com munity participation in the development process this conflict is of course ideological in nature briefly many community leaders want to involve as large a portion of the ghetto as possible in the planning and implementation of change and developmentpolitical economic and social they argue that black people have for too long sat and let others do for and to them and that a community which helps draw the blueprints for its own development will be committed to the execution of that blueprint going beyond the participationcommitment argument community leaders argue that the low level of selfconfidence and skills among ghetto residents necessitates a development program which actually trains and educates the residents as an integral part of the process in short it is an argument for total development with the emphasis on human resources a fast pace of economic development is not the primary goal of most community leaders because they realize that such a fast pace may outdistance the participation of the majority of the community residents against the model for economic development which the black capitalist represents many community leaders offer the community development corporation as a more desirable model the community development corporation cdc is held to be the organizational mechanism by which blacks can develop a sense of mastery over their immediate environment both physical and human and over their destiny as a people the sense of mastery which a strong cdc is deemed capable of developing is important because it facilitates constructive participation from all community residents the cdc can and does take many different organizational forms nevertheless there is a common theme which distinguishes the cdc from other organizations in the economic realm it is the theme of broad ownership of the organizations enterprises and of course participation in the decisionmaking processes of the cdc accompanies the theme of broad ownership the cdc allows community residents more than just a fraction of the ownership and a voice in the direction of development under this form of economic organization it is also possible for residents to acquire new job skills and to upgrade existing skills because the community at large has more decisionmaking authority in the cdc than in the private black corporation the community is more effective in forcing the cdc to be more responsive to the noneconomic needs of the people frequently the cdc is involved in economic ventures solely because of the noneconomic objectives that are made possible thereby thus the cdc promotes the development of skills and confidence throughout the community against these advantages there are several problems of the cdc first the recruitment and motivation of topnotch administrators and staff personnel is not easy because of the many attractive jobs which private corporations offer it takes a person with a real sense of dedication to the cdc approach to forego attractive opportunities elsewhere second the cdc official has to be able to deal with that sometimes nebulous usually contradictory and always changing entity called the community it is sometimes quite distressing to discover that the communityor the body of persons interested in wielding influencevaries from issue to issue and from decision to decision the cdc official must accept his role as a servant of the community yet he has to relate to a variety of governmental and private organizations in order to accomplish the cdcs objectives his job is not an easy one because he is highly visible and often subject to the sometimes whimsical will of the community to complicate matters even more the community usually contains strong factions of nearly every ideology that the combined civil_rights and black_power movements have produced the cdc official has to be agile and thickskinned in order to ward off the poison darts that are occasionally hurled by the various factions another serious problem that the cdc official has is that of trying to balance community education and training with economic objectives the cdc loosely defined is a school a social service agency and a business the administrator has to be astute in directing the organizations energies among these several tasks he has to make the decision whether to call in experts or let the community do it through trial and error for example he has to know when to contract with outside firms to build a needed shopping center and when to create a subsidiary which will train blacks to build it this is the type of tradeoff between shortterm and longterm advantages which must be made in organizations with multifaceted objectives finally cdcs face financial problems not only is the government sometimes a rather capricious source of capital and operating funds but it is also an entity which responds most readily to strong political pressures and it is still true that the strongest political pressuresthose that make public bodies actexist outside the black community in most instances administrators of cdcs are not infrequently caught between the mandate of the community and the restrictions imposed by governmental funding sources at the crux of such binds is the determination of black communities to control their own destiny and the reluctance of public bodies to accede control however as it becomes increasingly difficult for political bodies to control the actions of the black community this bind will become less problematical and cdc administrators will devote less time to complex political battles with outside agencies will the cdc form of development work community leaders argue that it will work because black people have faith in it and because the people will demand an ever increasing role in the whole development process many assert that unless the peoples voices are heard in the development process increased alienation and bitterness will result the people ultimately have ways of eliminating that which is unacceptable and alienating it remains to be seen whether economic development in the black community will take the organizational form of black capitalism or community capitalism in either case it behooves us to be clear about the organizational choices and consequences of those choices it appears certain that the black community years hence will reflect greatly the types of organizational decisions being made by black people today a short storu by walter myers t had taken two minl i utes at the most he standing at the regis ter with the woman as she stuffed the money into a brown paper bag and jeff turner standing with a gun on the man something had happened maybe the man moved a little too quickly and jeff shot him down the old man fell his silver rimmed glasses dangling from his face by one ear his hands crossed in front of him the woman screamed and fell down on her knees next to her husband and began to moan quickly began to moan as if she had been waiting for something to happen and had been saving the moan moses looked over the counter and saw the man lying there the blood creeping across his white apron front his face trying to hold a twist of agony and even then it was slipping away then he was still one knee still up and one hand pointed towards the beer freezer they used to ask down where he came from in biloxi how long forever was and they used to answer two to foteen years for a nigger two to foteen years the first time that moses had come up for parole after seven years the other guys had said that he might as well forget it it was an automatic turndown maybe if he had just killed a nigger it would have been different but not a white man when moses walked in they were sitting around the big dark mahogany table laughing and joking among themselves and he had thought they might be in a good mood he said that he was sorry about the guy that was killed and that he hadnt actually done it that jeff turner had actually done the shooting and that he had given evidence for the state it didnt matter they said no and it all seemed so fast after waiting for seven years and the next time he had asked them please to give him another chance and even got down on his knees making the guard nervous and begged them as hard as he could but they said no again he had to stay somebody said it wasnt as much time to go as had already past that night sitting in the corner on the stool was as long as he remembered his whole life being all the guys said that they might give him a chance the next time around if he kept himself straight he intended to do just that he had to get out he was beginning to forget how things were on the outside what mornings felt like and what just running loose was like and how good food used to taste on sundays and he didnt know whether he remembered how a woman really felt or just remembered himself remembering a few years back he thought of himself in the country in mississippi near biloxi or laurel getting his high tops wet in the morning before the air cleared from the dampness his mother was still in biloxi waiting come on home she wrote before death gets here and take me moses wanted to see his mama again that was for sure he hadnt seen her since then and that was a long time he was nearly now a long piece gone from being a boy well it was going to come up again his chance for being free and everyone told him that he would be let go this time for sure even when he had done some work for the warden the warden m had said for him to keep clean because he had a chance to be free this time when the warden said that he went back to his cell and looked at himself deep in the mirror he was still black and walleyed but he was going to be free bbs hey nigger i hear you going home in a few months what made the guard jenkins so sinister was his eyes almost colorless in his pale face dont call me no nigger man moses kept his head down what should i call you whitey i got a name moses hated working under jenkins it seemed that every time he did jenkins pushed him a little harder he finished putting the last of the old library books in the carton to be taken to the incinerator what kind of man did you kill nigger i didnt kill nobody you in for murder aint you moses didnt answer i said you in for murder aint you jenkins raised his voice and edged forward you want this box tied or should i just carry it like this tie it moses turned to tie the box he had just looped the rope around the box once when he felt the pain in his crotch a wave of nausea swept over him as he sank to the ground in a second he was up turned and faced jenkins he crouched low hands spread apart come on nigger hit me youll have about years to think about it so make it a good one come on shine im gonna tell on you jenkins moses breathed deeply his chest heaving his eyes glued to jenkins im gonna tell the warden on you what the other guards gonna think if you tell the warden on me huh they gonna think you some bad nigger and they gonna have to get you right right moses knew that jenkins was right if there was anything at all against him even if there was some question to it he might not get his parole he picked up the box and started off to the incinerator jenkins walked behind him sliding his feet as he walked i hear you going to do some work over at the wardens office next week moses didnt answer you aint talky huh well i tell you one thing i bet that nigger clerk that williams that you wouldnt make probation this time bet him five dollars he didnt want to bet but i said whats wrong dont want to bet on your own race he bet then man he sure hates being a nigger he thinks hes gonna get white brownnosing around the guards anyhow i bet him so naturally you aint gonna get out moses stopped at the incinerator and handed over the box of books to the burning squad books from the library any good ones the dark slimfaced youth asked yeah some real hot ones jenkins answered come on we got more work to do we got to go over to the plant room and wipe up real good i got to go to the bathroom moses said now thats just too bad come on or ill write you up for sloughing off i got to go and that aint no damn sloughing off you raise your voice to me one more time and im gonna beat your ass silly nigger long as you got that uniform you can meet me some day when im free free you aint never gonna hear that word long side your name nigger i keep telling you that why you have to insist on disbelieving me they reached the plant room and jenkins signed the sheet for the guard to open the door there was a phone inside the plant room that the guard would use when they were finished only one of the huge generators was operating see all that oil on the floor over there go clean it up moses had cleaned the plant room before he went over to the sawdust box and filled the small scoop from it with this he started spreading it all over the oil watching it bead up around the sawdust tell me about the guy you killed nigger you know we dont have to talk about it jenkins thems prison rules moses hardly had the words out when jenkins club smashed across the small of his back the pain searing down the back of his legs he turned and grabbed the stick jenkins was only a foot away from him his thin lips tightened into a smile hit me nigger moses released the stick look jenkins i aint done nothing to you why dont you give me a break tell me about the guy you killed he was just a guy why did you kill him i didnt kill him you in jail cause you didnt kill him he slapped moses the sound was lost against the noise of the generator the guy i was with shot him was he white or black the guy you shot i didnt shoot him he was black moses lied you know what i saw the other day nigger what i saw that made my damn blood boil just leave me alone will you look i get three dollars when i sell my blood next week ill give you that ill tell you what i saw i saw that nigger with the bald head that big nigger on h block screwing a white boy you mean jake thats his name jake dont go that way you know jake dont go that way you calling me a liar i aint call you a liar why dont you give me a break when the last time you had some had some what some woman moses turned and continued spreading sawdust on the floor the next morning at breakfast the warden came around and talked to some of the men he did once in a while when he came over near moses he walked so fast that moses didnt have a chance to say anything to him i got chewed out about how that plant room wasnt properly cleaned they accusing me of sloughing off cause you didnt clean it good jenkins prodded moses along towards the plant house with his stick you tole me to stop moses protested shut your ugly black face nigger jenkins signed the paper to get into the plant house as soon as the door shut behind them he hit moses across the back with his stick big as you are nigger you aint nothing you hear that you aint nothing moses was already on the way to the saw dust bin you married no you got a mama yeah she put out you dont have the right to be talking about nobodys name whats wrong with you you supposed to be a guard and you ever have a white woman no you lying bastard i bet you picked up some white tramp someplace moses finished spreading the sawdust and started sweeping the floor you can tell me what was it like was it any different aint no use to being sullen lord moses thought dont let me get next to that man tell me about it and maybe ill lighten up a little moses continued to sweep he saw jenkins coming near and stiffened for the blow jenkins swung his stick again and again catching moses on his shoulders and arms moses tried to cover up his head and jenkins lifted a knee into his crotch moses fell to his knees he saw jenkins foot coming again but he couldnt move fast enough as it sank into his stomach dont hit him back he warned himself the foot came again always in the same place moses tried to curl up again again from the back and again until moses couldnt see until the nausea was more than anything else until his crying and helplessness shamed even him until he thought again about getting his high tops wet in the mississippi long grass at last it stopped and moses lay listening to the awful sound of his own breathing the sweat dripped from his face and the taste of puke was strong in his mouth somewhere in the back of his consciousness the generator grumbled like a brewing storm moses tried to stop his head from clearing he felt as if something was touching his knee sliding along his thigh fumbling with the front of his pants there was another sound quiet even close to his ear it took him a long while to realize that it was jenkins crouching over him hitting jenkins was more than good god it was glorious and every time that the thin white face jerked away from his fists every time that the eyes rolled to the top of his head so that only the white showed every time the blood spurted from the twisted nose and the face reddened moses felt better it was as if a great burden had been lifted from him and there was no use in stopping just because the figure in front of him was still no freedom had gone with the first blow and there was no use in stopping now until the swinging arm black and muscular could swing no more now the frenzied rhythm of a moment ago had slowed to an occasional smack against the inert figure that moses held across his lap then even that stopped and it was quiet for a while almost solemn in the stillness and then moses laughed him a laugh and once he had started there wasnt much use to stopping the magic word by stephen henderson hats right i y sent the letter thats rightdavis im pease t f meet you too one of you can sit here by the bed one of you can sit here heres the ash tray thanks fresh out and i still dont feel like much walking thats all right the nurse wont mind good now ill tell you the whole thing and all im asking is that you print it like it is i told you how they messed it up down here first of all most people didnt like himthe prof we called himbut he was really some guy he was brilliant if you ask me but he was strange and strange looking very tall all angles you know with a long bony face frankly if you didnt know otherwise youd take him for a white man in fact many people did say that he was white maybe he was but like i always say i dont see why a white man would want to be a negro in fact sometimes i dont see why anybody would want to course thats one of the funny things about prof he didnt have to be a negro but he said he was fact he was always trying to convince you that he was or trying to convince himself i dont know i swear he made you more race conscious than anybody i know and you never knew how to take him he was always making you mad calling you out of your namein class too man and you couldnt ignore him believe me hed read you right theredumb nigger you know the magic word and he didnt give a damn i think the administration was scared of him either that or they knew he was a heavy stud but like i said you couldnt ignore him one time i was downtown with a couple of fellows waiting for the bus and it was kinda crowded like everybody in town was waiting white folks too you know when up walks the damn prof togged to kill man continental and all that and you should see the gray chicks diggin him well here he is towering all over everybody like a great big playboy ad and what does he do as soon as he spots us he says hello spooks whats happening real jazzy like you know and the white folks looking all silly man because he knows us they dont know whether to laugh or to crap so we sort of talk for a while till he takes out this paper the afronyou know what i mean and starts talking about spooksl man i got so damn mad i liked to hit him and here he was enjoying it and all the patties were just looking man but they were squirming too he liked to make people squirm he told me so we got to be kinda tight after i left his class he kinda took to me i dont know why maybe because im real dark man like charcoalgray anyhow he told me that this whole business about race was stupid and the only way to destroy it was to embarrass people out of their pride well he had a good point and he had all kinds of arguments real convincing too and i think it was then that i halfway got to understand him he was always stirring up stuff though you know he nearly caused a riot downtown in one of the theaters he was with this fay girl see and this indian couple came in and sat down by him man he started to perform you know talking about niggers and mess like that so the indian guy jumped up and started lecturing on american hypocrisy and the ushers came over and everybody was raising cain and all the time the girl was trying to tell him honey they arent niggers theyre foreigners then suddenly the prof said well i didnt know youall were really liberal anyhow he said real loud i just want you to know that im a negro they didnt believe him of course that made him mad goddamn it he shouted im a negro a niggah a bootunderstand a darky the people just laughed at him then he turned to the girl look baby doll im a nigger a greasy spook see and you been sucking my tongue all day that did it they almost wrecked the place i dont know how he got out alive that was his favorite story and the white papers gave it about five lines he was a heckuva fellow and like i said didnt nobody like him worth a damnbut me and a couple other kids and i guess what we liked was the way hed go around popping egosyou ever put a cigarette to a tick anyhow like thatpoptake the dean well hes a good stud but hes the pious type you know always getting up in assembly with the glad tidings and the harkbacktothe religious ideals of the foundingfathers mess anyhow he called the prof in they say to talk to him about going to chapel and all that the prof put a whole lot of points on him so he left him alone for a while well something else comes uplisten im gonna tell it like it is same thing happens everywhere elsewell i tell you some of these campus broads had eyes for the prof so they put a little pressure on him and my man started chopping right and left it caused a big mess but they hushed it up and put him on probation and all that the way they do in big time but they couldnt hush up the chicks though and he had a tough rep with the ladyfolks yessir anyhow next thing i heard he was chopping the deans ole lady no lie man it was something terrible like i dont know why they didnt get rid of the cat anyhow the dean called him in but the prof told him if he didnt leave him alone hed you know make the ole babe quit him and like that yeah man he got into a whole lot of stuff rough parties and things you know that guy even married a prostitute no lie ugly chick toospitterpure scheaffers anyhow he brought her to all the concerts and art festivals and things like that and made people respect her and they did because they were afraid of him and he got a big charge out of it then when he got tired he put the broad down said she was cutting out on him as if he gave a damn well that gives you some ideas of what he was like except that every now and then if you could put up with him you could see that he was just jiving i remember the time i saw him down in the bottom talking with a bunch of tough looking kids i know they were tough i used to live down there he was just cutting up laughing and kidding with them and they were kidding him just having a ball he didnt see meill never forget that id never even seen him smile before that is a friendly smile and here he was laughing like mad and you know one thing he used to dance with those kids he knew it allmambo chacha stroll rubberleg madison shimmy everything he really goofed behind music guys like bartok and miles and thelonious monk you know he really dug sounds some times you know wed go to his place and sit down on this stray pad he had on the floor and hed give us peanuts and syrup and sometimes dates and wed you know try to dig too i and i forgot to tell you the cat could lecture too no lie you name it he knew it i mean really knew it i mean like hed tie up guys who were specialists visiting lectures and folks like that and he was always giving the papers the ass he was a terrible terrible cat i guess he must have been around or so but he looked younger sometimes sometimes he looked older it was hard to place him like ive been saying all along he seemed to change according to the angle that you saw him from or the situation that you saw him in one time i got the feeling that he hadnt made up his mind at all and that he was just trying on selves for size i dont know i had a weird conversation with him about three months before the happenings and it left me confused for a long time but as i think about it now it helped me to realize what was what not only about the prof but about a whole lot of things we were over at his place sipping a lil tea and feeling nice when he starts talking you know halfway to himself first then to me about the situation somehow he always got around to it i was tired of it but i didnt want to hurt the guys feelings so i listened at him take up the white mans burden kid he hasnt got the courage to take it up himselfnot the burden of empire the burden of conscience we are the worlds conscience now as the jew used to be yeah year i was real nice man he could talk all he wanted to remember jesus and simon the cyrene i looked at him well there you have it two ways the nigger taking the white mans burden but also jesus the eternal nigger carrying the burden of the world simon was really riding christs back as we all have done but simon earned the right he was a nigger too he was making me mad but i kept my cool and kept sipping the tea as i said before you cant ignore him baby he keeps pressing you he was very solemn your niggemess is divine boy its the best damn part of you im not a nigger i said i was still cool no he said youre not a nigger youre a negro a colored person thats right youre a damn fool he snapped but maybe one day youll grow up and be a nigger look at me im serious a man has to develop into a nigger hes not born that way the nigger is not necessarily a negro you know the negro is not unique in fact he has no real existence hes just a sunburnt savage or some white mans shadow wherever you find him but the nigger hes alive hes real webster says nigger is a vulgar and contemptuous name for a negro thats what webster says but how would he know he wasnt a nigger nigger is more than a name nigger is a state of being i was mad enough to puke well its a state i dont dig i see you dontso what does nigger mean to you anyhow dont you knowit means that nobody gives a damn about you cause youre black they despise you they spit on you lynch you say you stink you steal youre oversexed youre dumb yes now what about the negroes who call themselves niggers they mean the same thing sometimes he said sometimes they dont when a guy calls his wife nigger he means something else or when he tells nigger jokes where the spook is always outfoxing the white man and chopping the fay chicks nigger means lots of things well nigger means just one thing to the white man a black ape with rheumatism in the joint he smiled curiously yes now why is the white man so fascinated by that image ill tell you why it both repels and attracts him why because its the image of his lost manhood the image of his own primitive amoral self with all its brawling black fecundity oh jesus i thought its the eternal image of the dark force within us the force that civilization is destroying the force with many namesthe devil chango dionysus bacchus the fisher king the green knight gargantua osiris buddha and last but not least jesus christ youre crazy im not talking about your sweet lil blueeyed jesus im talking about jesus the tiger yeah some jazz black jesus the tiger well if he was so much of a tiger why didnt he make like samson instead of acting like a punk youre very young he said sarcastically the fact that he didnt make like samson made him superior to samson he didnt make like samson no he made like a nigger oh man i got up im sick of all this niggerness im cutting i thought you were perceptive he said but youre just like the rest youre sick of the niggerness so youre cutting all right then cut but where the hell are you cutting toill tell you to be a shadow a clown holding your whiteness before you like a mask well the mask doesnt fool anybody but yourself because when mr charley sees you he doesnt see your mask at all he sees a mirror if hes benevolent he sees you as his own smug reflection if hes not he sees through the mirror sees his real self in you and what he sees terrifies him he hates it and scorns it and spits at it because he doesnt have the courage to accept it as himself all right old mirrorhead cut i stared at him he was talking a whole lot of crazy stuff i thought he was blowing his stack but he was real solemn id never seen him like that before thats a trick mirror too by the way he said it also reflects inward and you can also see through it quite tricky boy you can see in it and through it it shows you all kinds of things but its damn sure hard to tell which ones are you i gave him one hard mad look and made it i didnt see much of him after that as i said i was fed up with all that niggerness after all i came to college to get myself an education to make something out of myself hell i wasnt ashamed of being colored and all that but i didnt consider myself any goddamn nigger i dont care what mr charley thought all the shooting and cutting and crapping and raping and scraping i was sick of all that shit i mean damn sick like the man says sick unto death jack and i wanted to rise above that i wanted to be somebody after i got my degrees and things people would respect me well thats what i thought then that was two weeks ago i was young then yeah baby im serious yeah im just but like im now since what happened you dont just chop off pieces of yourself like the prof said and you have to look real hard in the mirror and through the mirror and in all the goddamn mirrors that come flitting your way yeah i guess that if a fay cat calls me a nigger now i wouldnt get mad at all id just kinda look at him and smile anyhow the last time i saw him was at the sitins you remember thats what you wanted to hear about anyway it was a nice day in november when our kids got in on the act we had been reading about the action down in north carolina and thought that maybe we could jolt some egos here in virginia so after this big secret campus rally we slipped downtown and jack we struck hit six stores the first day the white folks were surprised they thought there was an invasion from mars or something and cops were swarming all over the streets with the k mutts ready to chew up any black butt they could but i have to give them credit they didnt mess with us fact they protected us but you could see that they werent too particular we had all kinds of signs you know like the real thingdont eat where you cant buy support our cause segregation is unchristian and stuff like that the kids really trooped out starryeyed and dignified as hell thats the thing that surprised the white folks you know the dignity and the way the kids dressed you know real collegiate they didnt dig that at all man they really must think were a pack of savages all the papers you know well dressed well behaved you know stuff like that man they dont know whats happening these kids tog all the time and theyre just like any other kids it really made you feel good to see them sticking together like that course ill tell you the truth some of those guys didnt really dig the movement you see passive resistance in fact i didnt really dig it not because i was chicken or stupid or anything like that but i have a heckuva temper man and i didnt know whether i could stand listening to some mudgy fudgy call me nigger to my face ill tell you something else wasnt a christian even so the reasoning behind it you know the brotherhood jive well that didnt move me at all anyhow here i was in the mess man im always in the mess anyhow we split up and went to about six stores like i told you we sat down at the counters and tried to order stuff but the babes wouldnt serve us just stood there acting silly trying to pretend that we werent there at all man that really peed me offthey just give you that blank stare like you dont exist its a bitch im telling you i was almost glad when the trouble came first the storemanager came and asked us out we asked him for service he asked us out again so we got out our books and started readingwords you knowi was real tense man my stomach was so upset that i couldntve eaten anything even if they had served me all kinds of weird mess was running through my mind i dont know how we made it but i didnt want to let on like i was nervous we pulled it off for a couple hours then left when we got outside the stuff really started to boil a bunch of young rebs were following us waving reb flags and calling us black niggers and things man i really wanted to get loose but i kept talking to myself kept telling myself about the cause and you know something i started believing in the cause funny man funny there were cops and dogs and reb flags all over everywhere but i wasnt scared anymore not even mad later when i got back to the campus i found out that they had arrested a bunch of the kids that night we gave them a big party next day we started the picket line we had all kinds of rallies and things and everybody kept talking about the cause about the strategy but thats where the hell really started there were about of us in the line it was november baby but hot hotand here we are tramp tramp the spooks are marching and here comes some sonavabitch and throws a block on you and nearly knocks you down now here comes a sweet old lady who turns up her nose like shes smelled something though christ knows she couldve smelled my aching feet and all kinds of expressions on those faces but the worst ones were the blank ones those that didnt pay any attention at all and here you are carrying the goddamn sign not even making a ripple and i thought about the prof and i was digging all the talk about the mirrors and things and i thought to myself that jesus christ himself could be in the picket line and these crackers still wouldnt budge i had been out there for almost an hour absorbing all the jazz when a woman walked up to me and hawked and spat in my lace man i started to swing the sign to cuss to crap to cry but i didnt do anything but try to wipe my face i guess i might even have been crying some i was so mad anyhow i looked up and what the hell did i see abraham lincoln thats rightabraham lincoln you think im crazy i thought i was too everything was getting blurry what kinda crap was this he started talking to me and i thought i was nuts the people passed around us chattering the cars buzzed in the streets and the kids paraded with their signs i was still mad but i could see now that he was phony yet somehow i wasnt sure i wasnt sure of anything as i looked up at him he took out his handkerchief and wiped the snot off my face and said with malice toward none it was the goddamn profi caught his voice with charity for all that big lanky phony that goddamn niggerham lincoln i wanted to cuss him and break the crappy stick over his head he just stood there as though he actually was lincoln then he got in the picket line and nobody paid any attention to him but us but me what was his gimmick was he mocking us again who the hell was the sonofabitch anyhow i was going to ask him first chance i got but as we reached the back of the store a car pulled to the curb and three guys jumped out and started banging on the prof i tried to run round to the front to call the cops but one of them hit me real hard thats all i remember i dont know how we got there but the next thing i remembered was this clearing in the woods somewhere we mustve been a good little ways from the highway because you could barely hear the sound of the cars i was groggy and sick and suddenly i felt this great big throbbing in my skull i put my hand to my head there wasnt any blood but there was a hickey big enough to fool a guinea hen i tried to get up and i fell the bastards had handcuffed my ankles they sure dig the tv i was telling myself wisely and i managed to get to my knees when i realized that somebody was watching me he was tough and tall and red dark hair i remember with the elvis type sideburns the jeans and all the other jazz but no leather jacket just an ordinary gabardine windbreaker he stood with his hands on his hips like an ad for levis or something grinning well now mr niggermr college niggerwe got a surprise for you i didnt say anything i was scared baby no lie say now niggermr nigger we goin fix yall up real fine give you somethin to write home about you like to sit down dont you i stared at him you hear me nigger he kicked me in the chest and laughed when i tumbled over on my back ya wanna sit down next to white women now dont you go on say it say it goddamnit when we through with you you wont wanna sit down for the rest of your goddamn life i mustve looked scared he seemed to get a sudden spasm of satisfactionkicks he took a razor blade out of his pocket and walked up to me and pressed it against my throat and the sweat popped out all over me and i felt this warm trickle down my leg he reared back and roared he was really getting his kicks dont worry mr nigger he said after a while we aint goin kill you just goin make you safe goin make a real man outta you i didnt know what he was talking about but i had read the colored papers and i had ideas and jack i was scared scared sick you rotten mucker fother i was screaming in my mind but the words couldnt get past the vomit from somewhere deep in the woods there came a long animal cry it was the prof theyd done something awful to him i could hear them laughing and cussing they were drunk pretty soon i could hear them coming back to the clearing the dry leaves and things crackling as they walked there must have been about ten or twelve of them two of them were older fellows about one of them had a razor in his hand and another had a dauber that had been dipped in pitch drag him back there with the other one someone said hell do it here let the nigger bleed no dont want no killin just goin fix him up they grabbed me and thats all i remember when i woke up again i couldnt move there was a burning all over my chest and i couldnt move my legs at all like somebody had dropped a big rock on me or something i saw the blood and my stomach gave out i cant stand to see blood i puked all over the place somebody put a wet cloth to my face and my senses started to clear and i saw that it was a cop who did this to you boy he said but i couldnt talk somebody calledit was another copthere were cops all over now they found the prof and brought him out on a stretcher three or four cops gathered around him looking half puzled half amused one of them was finishing the first aid what the hells going on whats the gimmick abe lincoln well he shouldve stayed dead hes in the wrong territory anyhow aw quit it you guys this is some actor type guy looking for publicity he damn sure got it its a goddamn shame theyd denut christ if they caught him talking to niggers this guy is a nigger you kiddin he looks white to me checked his identification didnt help any he had cards for both white and colored their voices were hazy in my mind there was a siren screaming somewhere and dogs barking cops were all over the place i could just see the prof lying there his pants were all bloody and the blood was caked on his face i knew that he wasnt going to make it even with the first aid he was already in shock i retched again but this time i didnt pass out here at the hospital they told me that the hoods didnt have time to rob both my jewels well thats not too bad one is enough but i wasnt worrying about myself i was thinking about the prof and all the crazy things he used to do and just who he really was and why did he want to let himself suffer like that like an animal he didnt have to he couldve told them that he was a white man or something or that he was just trying to gimmick up the niggers picket line it was almost as though he had asked for it what was he trying to prove and who the hell was he and what a hell of a way for a man to die you know i was thinking about that when you guys walked in and you know i was feeling bad man bad then the thought came to me and i dug the whole thing the cat was a nigger yeah baby niggernot nigger like negro but the magic word a by carolyn m rodgers enny loman had enough money to buy two reefers or two pills he wasnt sure which to get he weighed the alternatives the reefers would be mellow he knew where he could cop some good strong grass and he might like the kaleidoscopic effects he got from the weed he felt like digging some coltrane sides tonight but then somebody might be using the gangs layout and he couldnt dig or smoke in peace in that case if he ran by there first to check it out and somebody was thought he there theyd probably ask him what he was going to get into tonight and he would surely end up having to share his jive with someone maybe two or three someones and then he would only have a lightweight high that wouldnt last no time naw he wouldnt do that he could buy the pills that was probably the hippiest thing to do cause fact was you didnt have to do much sharing of them a dude wasnt expected to split em in half and turn somebody else on and everybody knew that one pill made you sick before it made you high so hed have the two pills all to himself but he was wary of them the high was cool except that it made him sleepy and he would go into a nod anywhere any time even while he was talking to someone and especially vice versa and they made him have a loose tired weightless but weighed down feeling then too he had vowed the last time hed had pills not to take any more it had been two weeks ago he remembered what had happened to him he had been on his way downtown to take in a james bond flick met one of his partners lou jean on the kedzie l track lou jean was a poorass puny nigger with no daddy and a parttime momma he had nine sisters and brothers and once benny had seen them fight over two slices of stale bread yeah he had been glad he could help him out they had been partners since last year when they had both got kicked out of school the same day for the same reason gangbanging lou jean had turned him on to two reds and a yellowjack for cents said he needed the dough for something to eat benny had ridden downtown and had stopped at the burger king for a hamburger and some french fries had washed the two reds down with his coke when nobody was looking he had left the walkin and had gone into the roosevelt theatre paid his fare took a seat waited after about minutes he decided to take the yellowjack the reds were too slow he got up and went to the mens room it was empty he took his time and looked into the mirror at his full yellow face he was definitely his mothers child same thick nearly wavy hair and flat nigger nose same heavy set body yeah his mothers genes were as loud and dominant as her voice for a few moments he tried to visualize what his daddy might have looked like but all he could distinguish was a mixture of himself his momma and every man he had ever seen when he returned to his seat james bond was rapping to some broad with big titties and fists full of slick red hair for a second sean connerys face changed colors and was brown like his and the redhead was pearlie his girl yeah it was cool the pills must be working he sat back and relaxed and soon the dialogue was his i dig you baby we could do wonderful things together his body melted into the chair and his head felt like a drunken spinning top he felt that free wild reckless something bubbling up in his chest that made him ache to laugh to bare his teeth like a horse and howl with joy with abandon with something yeah it was mellow after the movie he found his way to the l and somehow paid his fare and got on the train but he took the wrong train and it went south instead of west the next thing he knew somebody it was the conductor was shaking him telling him it was the end of the line he got off the l and went into a restaurant some coffee might help he had puked all over himself in the goddamn restaurant and a barrelshaped black lady had told him to pay his bill and get the hell out he had reached into his pocket for his dough no wallet aw man someone had wasted him on the l while hed been out he found cents in change had enough left over to call his aunt who lived on the south side and to tell her to come pick him up ooooo hed been sick he had puked all over himself in the alley behind the restaurant and he had smelled ugh but all that had happened two weeks ago and it wasnt gon be like that tonight naw he wasnt going on no train rides no movies uhuh none of that shit none of those changes he might go over to pearlies and sit and rap to her and if he got sick or sleepy well she would take care of him see that he either got home or got to bed hell thats what women were for maybe her old lady was gon be out for the evening yeah he would cop the pills then decide what to do he had better hurry up it was almost oclock and the cops were out for blood after the curfew if he got busted they wouldnt do nothing but rough him up a little and cop his pills but shit that was bad enough no pills no money and no high that would be a drag he made it on over to the poolroom found lonnell the local pusher of everything and copped the pills he kidded around with some of his partners for a few minutes then split he was making it on down the street when he saw officer dobel waiting for the light at the comer uh uh fat white bastard officer dobel hated all cats wearing naturals and bennys half wavy hair was past the maybeheneedsahaircut stage if he could just make it to the alley maybe dobel wouldnt bother him tonight he had to get them pills in him that was the main thing dobel might be in a nasty mood and take him down for possession the light changed just as benny made it to the alley he stopped and bent over as if he had dropped something and popped the pills into his mouth he almost choked trying to swallow them dry but after the third attempt they went down he gagged a couple of times and then he was okay as he straightened up and breathed a sigh of relief the squad car pulled up along side the curb and the m cop slowly got out all right up against the wall sonofabitch you know goddamn well youre violating curfew you are under arrest yeah benny thought he had known it was going to happen well he would be cool the pills would begin to work soon and he would leave the funky cops right in their tight sweating skins and soar up into the universe everything was going to be okay at least for the time being he backed against the wall his hands up to show he wasnt protesting or anything and a mischievous smile slid onto his face cmon now he drawled why you dudes wanna mess with me im just a poor country boy out here trying to make it home the top hat motel by charles k moreland jr awn was fast approaching and the black sky was mellowing into a purple tapestry q f gtars an j j ac y clouds leslie parham was racing the saturday sunrise to the top hat motel and his rendezvous with sharon sharon was dark and bony her lean shoulders offered little resting place for the straps of the multicolored sleeveless minidress she wore leslie peered into his rearview mirror at himself surveyed his short woolly hair with a widows peak in front his smooth broad nose and lips with a shadow of a mustache his high hairless cheekbones and thought that he should have been able to get a healthier broad than sharon sharon was practically the only girl who would take a chance with him though and he drove on mumbling he had spent minutes driving by looking at and trying to pick up a girl at th street and western avenue all but two of the half dozen girls there looked at leslies white fourdoor valiant with black wall tires and his dark ivyleague suit and stood where they were whispering that he was a policeman one fat girl in a skirt about a foot above her knees walked up to him and said lets do the thang he looked at her fat thighs which touchedoverlappedall the way down to her knees and shook his head and breathed an inaudible no thanks another girl came up more cautiously than the other and looked at him with suspicion where do you work she asked surprised leslie stammered wilshire and western what kind of work do you do well uh im an artist shit you must be the police the rest of the girls ignored him completely now and he sat there for minutes drove around the block a couple of times and sat there for another five or minutes with the engine idling for a time then stopped the radio on then off the parking lights on the high beams then off altogether after what seemed like an eternity of ignored signals to the girls he pulled the car onto western avenue and headed for home then he saw sharon she was down the hill about half a block from adams boulevard and two white men driving out of the arcadia sanitarium were calling at her she was walking away coolly adjusting the cheap red wig that sat high on her head ignoring them leslie slowed down and looked in her direction she waved at him and bent over to see into the car he slid the car over to the curb beside her you wanna date well yes how much you spending how much is it what i mean is how much do you how much can you spend you got and three for the room well no have you ever dated before where do you work im an art student ive got or dollars okay meet me at the top hat motel down on western do you know where it is leslie said yeah and drove off to the motel when he got there he had trouble parking his car and a man with a beard in janitors overalls told him not to park in the red zone leslie was embarrassed when the man saw him he wished he were invisible the man told him to wait in front of the office that his date would be there soon and then continued a conversation with another man about an foot cabin cruiser in the parking lot sharon came and ushered him into the motel office to pay for the room the office was a dingy slot in the wall there was a single bare light bulb and no chairs the room couldnt have been more than fiveby and the window where the manager stood was covered by a board with only a tiny slot for her eyes and a threeinch one at the bottom for the money do i give her all the money damn you really havent dated before have you naw dont give her but threefifty a pair of varicose white hands counted leslie his change from a five dollar bill and a voice from behind the slot drawled heres the key go to room seven and leave the key in the door when youre finished inside the room which had a coinoperated television and air conditioner sharon was cheerful take off your clothes she said as she quickly unzipped her onepiece dress and wiggled out of her black lace slip oh hell what are you doing she screamed as he reached in his back pocket for his wallet im just getting your money oh i thought you might have been getting ready to arrest me okay sharon stalked around the bed and in and out of the bathroom in her bra garter belt and stockings for a moment or two while leslie removed everything but his teeshirt and socks i better not take off everything he thought she didnt you just relax now while find my vaseline she told him digging through her purse she dug out a tiny bottle and came out of the bathroom then she turned back the bedspread revealing only one sheet flopped down applied the lubricant and told leslie she was ready he was still standing in the spot where he had taken off his last shoe watching her every move asking questions yeah you can wear a rubber i do enjoy it sometimes but usually i dont notice its mind over matter leslie sat down on the bed about three feet from her staring at her frail looking body and the woolly black part of her that seemed to hang from the black lace garter belt he asked more questions and tried to ignore his own organ which seemed to literally shrink into his stomach i do it so my two kids can eat she answered look if you want to hump for a long time or talk a lot itll cost you more money he said he didnt have any more money and sprawled on the bed beside her she smiled at him apologizing for the harshness of her tone and moved over to him and started caressing him look here for five dollars more ill give you some head too she said after a few minutes of caresses i cant afford it i havent got any more money youre clean arent you she asked and proceeded to service him not waiting for an answer leslie lay paralyzed for a moment this is no way to love he thought then he sat upright hey listen forget the rest of it okay im really sorry really he said putting on his clothes i cant tell you how sorry i really feel about this seriously dont think nothing of it oh and my names sharon her head peeped out of the door as she shouted and he walked past the cabin cruiser the crisp morning air chilled him he noticed the sky had turned pink driving home past western and th street he noticed only one girl on the corner two men were standing with her as if they owned the street i would have had more dignity jackingoff he thought out loud as he drove by cursing himself and wondering why men spent their money like that i didnt want her so much as i wanted her to want me the little known band in hollywoods haunted house was really good by leslies standards he had come to see them a half dozen times during their twoweek stand always alone and always optimistic none of his friends had ever heard of the village callers and when he tried in his tuneless way to sing their record which he always heard on the soul radio station he confused them more he stood in the back of the night club sipping a drink and shaking his head with the music he was totally oblivious to the people around him and he wondered how he could manage to get any one of the pretty girls there to notice him he didnt smoke but now he wanted a cigarette when he turned to the cigarette machine behind him a girl in white pants was standing there you shouldnt stand in front of the cigarette machine why not well youll block the light and they need all the light they can get out there to write down telephone numbers oh really yeah really you should come out on the dance floor with me and dance all right but i dont know where to leave my books what kind of books are they poetry leroi jones i write poetry oh yeah leroi jones ive heard of him he wrote dutchman didnt he right on i like the way he writes youre pretty fine you know that oh yeah i mean youre really nice looking thank you she was chin high to the fivefoot inch leslie and she had curly black hair she was only slightly plump but he didnt notice that for almost minutes you know you kind of look like shirley temple oh wow how come ive got to look like shirley temple well your natural its kind of curly and your rosy cheeks make you look kind of like a moppet a moppet oh wow i aint hardly a moppet she laughed they talked until the band announced that the club was closing they walked down hollywood boulevard away from the club and leslie offered her a ride to wherever she was going she had her own car but agreed to let him drive her to a bookstore she wanted to visit the bookstore was closed however so they rode around for nearly an hour and finally settled in a coffee shop for breakfast her name was jeanie im in the black_panther party you ever hear of it she said spreading apple jelly on toast of course i have who hasnt i went down there one time to join even and wow it was a bitch what happened well as soon as i walked in everybody started looking at me like i had a tail then some dude started following me around following you yeah i know when im being followed and this brother was following me they must have thought you were the man yeah well i never went back ill just have to get it on by myself when the time comes dig ive got a little secondhand store down the street from the watts towers and we use that for a meeting place and some of the brothers and the party captain will be there tonight if youd still like to join okay well go now these eggs and hash browns aint saying nothing to my stomach you do kind of look like the man you know you arent are you he started the car no not really i mean look i work for the police department parttime im going to be perfectly honest with you cause i aint got nothing to hide i work for the pig department im an artist i do sketches of suspects from descriptions but i hate those punks down there sometimes when i get a description of a brother that did something you know like shoplifting or something i figure he did it cause he had to eat or just make it i kind of make the picture not look like him so he wont get caught i wouldnt do that though if he hit some old lady in the head or something i shouldnt be telling you all this because it sounds so damn corny but thats the way i feel you know its funny i was just thinking about this good friend of mine she just got out of jail and her husband is still in soledad she was telling me just the other night that if i was lined up with any three other people and somebody was asked to choose who had sold out to the man i would get picked every time right on she laughed i dont mean to laugh but you really would i was out here when they had the watts rebellion in i called it the boston tea party at home in newport i was working for the newport police as an artist then but i actually wanted to waste some people i wished i knew how to make bombs not just molotovs bombs and mines honestly so that i could have wasted some police i saw so much stuff go down in newport it would turn your stomach and i know it must be times as bad in a big city like los angeles no really im not on his side im definitely for the brothers the car slowed in front of a dark building with a large sign which read watts teen center where is the place thats the store ive got to get a new sign made itll either be my favorite things or libra i havent made up my mind yet she said pointing to a driveway for him to park they went inside and were greeted by piles of musty old clothes and broken toys all over the floor the fourroom house had only one light bulb which had to be taken out by lesliebecause he could reach the ceiling without having to stand in a chairand moved from room to room the brothers must have gone home already but why dont you sit down for a while anyway jeanie said leslie sat on a dusty divan and jeanie spread clothes over the already cluttered floor making a pallet mattress which she covered with a bedspread jeanie sat down beside him and they talked she about the panthers he about his paintings that he would hang in her shop to sell before the first cut of the john coltrane album she had put on the record player was over they were rolling on the improvised mattress they kissed long and hard and his fingers and palms moved over her soft body by the end of the third album jeanie was pushing leslie away not now she said softly ive got to check in at the pad but ill see you again and then well have more time dont forget the paintings you promised me and oh ill get a ride to my car in the morning thanks for a nice evening the university of southern californias bovard feld was well lighted and well patrolled panthers with twoway radios monitored and watched the eight or unmarked and black and white police cars that monitored and watched them two dozen bearded peace and freedom party officials in blue chambray shirts with huey newton buttons sat nervously as eldridge cleaver campaigning for the partys presidential nomination concluded his address leslie was more interested in seeing jeanie again than in politics and he constantly scanned the crowd and the blueshirted female panther section for her face he had brought some of his drawings but he left the pad in his car so as not to seem too obvious after minutes of warnings by less prominent panthers and guiltfilled statements by sometimes dishevelled whites the meeting ended and leslie wandered around looking for jeanie leslie it was jeanie calling him leslie over here by the gate i want you to meet my roommate as he approached he saw the delicate looking girl with a well shaped short natural standing next to jeanie his brow furrowed and he wondered where he had seen her before both women were wearing blue sweatshirts with gothic lettering above and below a black cat reading black_panther party this is my roommate sharon sharon it was the the girl from western avenue leslie stood there seconds waiting for the charged silence to explode and leave him with only his shame his teeshirt and his steadily shrinking joint to protect himself well arent you at least going to say hello jeanie has told me so much about you i know damn well you know how to use your lips if just to talk oh yeah how do you do he said hoping she wouldnt recognize his voice damn jeanie shy aint the word for this brother right on jeanie chimed my roomie tells me youre an artist she said youd do a

grandmother lives just on the other side of vermont on th place and i was going to go by her house at sharon said yeah sure shes expecting me she is expecting me okay ill see you and call me tomorrow jeanie said lf more than people were strolling all around will rogers park hurrying to enjoy the last hours of the third watts summer festival leslie fumbled in his mind trying to recall the details touching off the watts riot some drunk and his mother yeah thats what it was when the police started beating up the mother the riot started yeah he thought the anxious energy that spawned the riot had been replaced with a festive air of rebuilding and rededication among the adults but leslie sensed that many of the teenagers though raucous and rowdy in their celebration were still sullen and angry about conditions in watts and neither did the presence of uniformed police in helmets help to allay the tension welling up inside him as he walked from the art show in the center of the park he saw people run past him toward the rd and central entrance to the park he heard shouts and screams from behind a refreshment stand a few yards from the corner he ran up in time to see police dragging a woman into a waiting police car the youths reacted violently as if magically they pulled rocks and bottles from their hats and sleeves and hurled them at the police curses and insults hung in the air leslie trembled until shots rang out he dived behind a rock landscape facing central avenue with about three other frightened people in front of them a black and white police car was parked idling a blue vapor street light barely lit the symbol of the city the goldoutlined black letters reading police and slanted italic letters saying to protect and serve on the side of the police car people were screaming all about him behind the rock one girl swore another cried one man ran from the park shouting tve been shot im shot he ran dashing in and out of the street for three blocks to the doorstep of the watts police substation he stumbled there on the step and fell he died there whimpering im shot a lieutenant from the hollenbeck division had come over when police called a tactical alert as they were clearing the park of all people he recognized leslie who also worked in that division parham the lieutenant said as a policeman searching leslie pushed him toward an exit parham we could use you here in the field go report to the command post at the corner right over there he pointed in the direction of six idling police cars blocking the intersection of rd and central id rather not sir and if its all the same to you im going home now leslie protested the lieutenant was walking away giving orders to some other policemen now and didnt hear his protest a burly blondeyebrowed cop grabbed leslies arm pushing him towards the command post you heard what the lieutenant said now be a good boy and do what the nice man said leslie snatched his arm from the mans grip turned and stood facing him clenching and unclenching his fists and gritting his teeth punk ass he whispered under his breath he walked toward the circle of cars in the middle of the street glass covered the ground all around the police barricade where police had shot out the street lights only the bluish moon and police spotlights lit the shadowy park the stark whiteness of the full moon hanging almost directly overhead made the degree night seem unnaturally cold leslie had his sketch pad in his hand a night so he could not even sneak away under the pretense of going for his work pad go home now goddammit he heard a policeman yell to a crowd of youths go home or go to the morgue one of the boys sauntered casually away from the el taco stand at nd and central where they had been standing leslie watched from the door of the car in which he had been put to work the cop ran up and smashed his gun barrel into the boys back the boy stumbled and turned the officer used his gun again this time on the boys collarbone the boy moaned and fell to the ground and three of his friends started to help him two other cops cocked their shotguns one said just give me a reason just give me a reason leslie felt a chill flash over his shoulders and chest and he dropped his pad and pencil he was afraid again like when he first heard the gunshots his mind raced ahead of his emotions a young boy no older than beaten for what for felonious walking too slow three other boys junior high school kids playing the grown up movie game one false move without the hollywood director to yell cut and without blank bullets leslie heard a scream a shrill womans scream shit naw i aint going home thats my sister in that car and she aint done a goddamn thing bitch shuddup or youll be in there with her leslie looked hard then ran over to the corner where the woman was standing in the street in front of a police car trying to drive off it was sharon he ran up to the policeman officer i know this woman ill take her home and who the hell are you the policeman said putting his gun butt into leslies stomach hard pushing him back a fat sergeant in a shortsleeved shirt ran up he was holding his helmet on his head with his right hand and his shotgun in his left comically as he ran he fumbled and trained his gun on leslie i work for the police department leslie told the sergeant the other cop told sharon that she was under arrest and she shrieked again i aint going shut up dammit the officer said and brought the barrel of his gun down on her head making a clunkingrattling sound as the pump handle shuddered from the blow leslie bolted for the policeman his face looked calm a kind of sideofthemouth smile all but disguised the tears streaming down his face he hit the cop in the back of the neck then surprised more than hurt by the blow the policeman turned leslie leaped into the air with the hardest kick he could deliver to the cursing blondeyebrowed mans groin before his left foot touched the ground again a shotgun blast from the sergeant amputated his leg at the knee two more blasts hit him as he fell away from the policeman the first caused his head to jerk shot from the blonds gun in his face the second laid open his vneck sweater and ivyleague shirt the silent breeze leafed through leslies drawing pad lying on the ground one of the police shoved sharon toward the car her wrists were handcuffed behind her back and a large gash on her left forehead was bleeding profusely closing her eye several drops of bright red blood fell gently on a drawing of the top hat motel as she back with the impact of the buck stumbled past i remember omar by mae jackson mar was a bad revoy lutionist and real hep too he had a fro so v y high that it almost nvr touched the clouds everybody that omar passed would just stop and stare that omar in his red green and yellow danshiki was something else he was so militant that one of his friends had a specially designed tiki made for him man all you had to do was push a button and out from the center of the tiki would pop a blade sharper than lighnen amar was a lover too yes he was he had women running after him from sun up till sun down he had himself some fine looking sisters and they were together too one sister would meet him at his door with slippers in hand while the other sister would be in his kitchenette preparing all kinds of soul food red beans and rice pigtails and cabbage barbque ribsand potato salad like i said before omar was a lover some kind of a beautiful cat militant and coolhe sho nuff had a way with women now some people said it was because of his really bad rapbut i have always maintained that it was because of his dine african features he was six feet one in chtall had a very broad nose and thick juicy lips see he was the type of dude that spent a lot of time kissing it was his custom to kiss every woman he met long and passionately he was what you would call a family man he loved contact and unity now look here omar was also a very good brother the kind of dude that you could depend upon when you were in trouble a naturalborn fund raiser he spent a lot of his time raising bail for his friends who were constantly being picked up bv racist cops and being jailed just for being black you know how this country is when it comes to black folks we are always being harassed and jailed on trumpedup charges well like i was saying before you could always depend upon brother omar especially when you needed bail money or when you were down to your last reefer i remember the successful rebellion that took place in destroyed once known as detroit yeap omar was there he set fire to every white owned business he could see in sight im here to tell you that the brother had to vision the kind that see only white when it comes to destroying i read in one of those white papers that fireboys and over policeboys were killed while trying to put out a fire in an old warehouse building you know how the white press does it they never print the whole truth now that i think about it they dont print half the truth but of course by hanging out on the corner i finally heard how it really happened through some reliable sources three thousand fireboys and over policeboys went running into this old building guns drawn and hoses out trying to be heroes so that they could cop some kind of special citation for something called bravery now when the black community saw this act of stupidity they contacted omar who went over and lead a prayin the kind of prayin that was just pleading for a strong wind and sure enough it came being that the people and their faith were so strong the old warehouse that was built of brick and iron just gave way and caved in now just you imasine that each and every one of the white american boys were trapped and burned to death fire is a mighty powerful thing all right everytime a rebellion took place omar was there to lead the prayin omar and the people got rid of a lot of trash that way that omar knew his business he was a credit to his profession now just as fast as the brother could lead a prayin strike a match to burn a building shoot a gun or push the button on his tiki he could whip up some really hep danshikis in no time flat yeap he was a very talented guy all right he could even beat the bongos with his tongue every afternoon after the sun went down omar would send messages via the bongos to the brothers and sisters in africa yeap like i said that omar could do just about everything a real talented guy if you ask me the brother is what you would call a grassroots intellectual he had read every revolutionary book around such as our folktale by julius lester one of his closest and best friend and black feeling black talk by nikki giovanni a real finelooking sister with a fro alomost bigger than omars nikki weighed pounds and that was with her machine gun on she was real lighthanded if you know what i mean well like i was saying before omar was a real grassroots intellectual he could hold you a conversation on just about any subject from white power to black_power from civil_rights to black rights from freedom schools to liberation schools he knew everything about everything you never could win an argument with him now some people said it was because he was a very emotional person but in my opinion he was just an ordinary aggressive cat just like the brothers and sisters everywhere once he had made up his revolutionary mind on a specific thing wasnt nuthin you could give or offer him that would make him change his mind he was real set in his black ways all right its been seven long months since i last saw omar dig i heard from some brothers and sisters in harlem that racist hunky cops kicked omars door down and walked into his apartment talking some kind of nonsense about them being there in the name of the law the brother got so mad that the first thing he did was reach in his pocket and pull out his comb to get his fro together slipped into his red green and yellow danshiki went into his drawer took out his nationalist flag and placed it on his automatic rifle and blew all cops away in the name of revolution some friends took a trip home yeap went back to africa where they ran into omar that omar they said hasnt changed a bit he had a fro so high that it had finally reached the clouds it was so heavy that he had two beautiful sisters dressed to kill walking beside him just to hold the sides up they tell me my friends that the brother has opened up a bookstore in the window were pictures of malcolm_x leroi jones and rap brown yeap like i said that omar was always a talentive cat a bad revolutionist real hep too the dc blues by sam greenlee reeman left the dif rectors office and j walked directly to the elevator nodding briefly at the directors secretary on the way out he pressed the button calling the elevator to his floor and inspected the attache case he had been presented as his goingaway present it was serviceably large of saddlestitched leather with brass fittings it contained the few things he had cleared from his desk in the office which had been his for years in the suite of offices behind the armed guards and door marked simply director the elevator arrived and he rode it down walked across the vast marble hall to the entrance and waited at the door for the directors limousine he had known that it would not be awaiting him at the steps and he showed no surprise no anger he had waited many years for what he had to do and a few minutes more for a car was no problem it might take him many more years to do what he had planned for so long and an impatient man he had carefully schooled himself in patience he stood at the door looking out into the huge courtyard of the building and out toward the trees that screened the building from the potomac river toward the city of washington hidden by the trees the courtyard was bright with the virginia spring sunshine unveiled by factory fallout he could not hear the birds behind the big glass doors of the entranceway but he knew that they would be singing in the trees that lined the river he had often brought his lunch to eat among the trees there listening to the birds watching the slow current of the river sitting among the pines and sycamore recalling the smells and sounds of summers spent in a boyscout camp in michigan a city boy from chicago he had never lost his awe and love of the woods their sights and sounds the building squatted vast and ugly a marble and granite conglomeration of the worst of neoclassical and governmentmodem architecture an ugly abscess created by bulldozers and billions in the midst of the oncebeautiful north virginia woods a cancerous abscess he thought sending out its tendrils of infection tens of thousands of miles he stepped through the door into the sunshine and listened to the sounds from the woods placing the case at his feet he was dressed in quiet bad taste his suit a bit too light his cuffs a bit too deep lapels a bit too wide shoulders a shade too padded tie too broad trousers too wide at the knee and ankle socks too short he wore large airplanetype sunglasses his hair was closely cropped and there was a thin surrounding of gold around a front tooth his suit was a bit too cheap and his wristwatch of karat gold a bit too expensive he walked with a gangling shuffle his head tilted slightly towards one shoulder and there was always a smile on his face even when alone in the building in which he worked broadening and flashing the thin gold when people approached he was very wellliked and would be missed waiting for the directors car he never once glanced back at the building in which he had spent a great part of the last five years of his life the black cadillac limousine swung into the drive and stopped just ahead of where freeman stood the negro chauffeur made no effort to get out to open the door freeman knew that he wouldnt open the door for him and patiently walked to the car opened the door for himself and climbed into the airconditioned interior the driver started moving before freeman was seated throwing him awkwardly into the far corner of the rear seat smiling gently freeman disentangled himself and leaned back into the foamrubber cushions looking out at the potomac river as they sped toward washington through the bulletproof glass you really going through with it you really quittin yes said freeman and they aint pushing you out i thought so at first but they aint pushing you out i didnt think cats like you ever quit a scene like you got i seen a lot like you in washington but i never knew one to quit on his own your kind love it here you dont even quit for more money someplace else it just dont make sense you really going back to that job you had like they say working with street gangs in chicago yes but this time ill be in charge of the program i shoulda known a title a goddamn title the only damn thing you cats dig more than money special assistant to the director wasnt enough now you going to be a director yourself or did they think up something more fancy the driver snorted in disgust freeman said nothing and they proceeded along the riverside road in silence they moved briefly through arlington and then onto the drive and past the cemetery the big statue of the marines raising the flag on their right they went across the bridge and past the pompous lincoln memorial the phallic washington monument at the end of the reflection pool and just short of the next bridge the jefferson memorial the cherry trees were in bloom a blaze of pink against the green the blue sky above with big fat cumulus clouds floating marshmallowlike against the bright blue sky they turned right on pennsylvania avenue and drove to the white house where the guard waved the car into the drive in front of the white house the driver again did not bother with the door and freeman let himself out and walked into the office annex he was met at the office door by a pudgy redfaced man with nervous mannerisms dan how are you right on time right on time well be going in to see the president in he looked at his watch and then glanced up at the clock on the wall behind the desk of the secretary exactly ten minutes now we go in between the boy scout delegation from east bengal and just before his monthly tea with some of the congressmens wives splitsecond timing around here you know and you know how he is if there is a foulup we have four minutes with him and then its finished hell give you a little present say a few words and then pose for pictures should get some play in the chicago press which wont do you any harm and ill send copies to you in chicago next week i dont know what his present will be hes pretty cagey about that kind of thing but you know what kind of response to give little surprise gratitude thanks and tell him how sorry you are to be leaving the team but i dont have to coach you dan you know what to do hey boy you know were all going to miss you around here remember that time he gave a rebel yell in the taj mahal and you smoothed things over with the indian press we havent forgotten that boy around here not a little bit you were always in there swinging in the clutch yeah sorry to see you go keep in touch now you hear make yourself to home i got to go check on those congressmens wives be right back and then we can go on in freeman sat in a big leather arm chair and looked at the big fourcolor portrait of the president on the woodpanelled wall behind the secretary in a few minutes the redfaced man returned all right lets go now we stand outside his office until the boy scouts come out then we go right in you know the drill they waited at the door until the scouts left beaming each holding a multipurpose jackknife they entered the office of the president the president was seated in his rockingchair his aide bent over and whispered in his ear as freeman approached the president arose and extended a hand thrusting his own quickly far up toward freemans thumb so that it couldnt be squeezed a trick learned from countless campaigns and handshakes well foreman mighty glad to see you again sit down sit down he had heard freemans name incorrectly the aide looked at freeman in a moment of panic freeman ignored his misspoken name and the aide relaxed in gratitude well now son they tell me youre leaving us sure we cant get you to change your mind the general now tells me hes mighty sorry to see you go says you do a good job over there by the river and the general doesnt hand out praise very easy you know yes sir i know and im flattered that he wants me to stay but im afraid i have to leave ive given it a great deal of thought and conscience calls you see ill be going right back where i grew up to try and use my education to help kids who are like i used to be well foreman thats a right fine attitude but dont you think you might be making a bigger contribution for those very people here in washington offer some inspiration for them to achieve to emulate you you know local boy makes good thats a point well taken mr president but id rather make my efforts in a more personal way my small contribution to our great society well now thats good very good we could use you around here maybe speechwriting i like that a small contribution to our great society the president turned to his aide put that down smitty want to see it in my next speech he squinted and gazed out into space as your president it is my humble pleasure to be able to make a small contribution to our great society got that smitty we could use more of your idealism around here foreman i certainly wish you the best of luck i spoke to your mayor last week and they plan to do more in that area im sure he could find room for you in his new commission well mr president i already have a position with a private social welfare agency one i worked for before i came into the government well now foreman never underestimate the good the government does for the people even though i am a firm believer in private enterprise as you know yes sir i recognize the great contributions the government has made toward the lives of the individual citizen and that is at the head of the war on poverty but there have to be increased efforts by private agencies and individuals youre right of course we cant have people dependent on the government to take care of all their problems now can we no sir and i always ask not what my country can do for me but what i can do for my country the presidents smile tightened his aide hastily thrust a package into his hand foreman heres a little momento id like to let you have a little token of my appreciation of your efforts in your countrys behalf freeman opened the package it was a multipurpose pocket knife identical to those handed to the east bengali boy scouts freeman wondered if the congressmens wives would find pocket knives useful he smiled his thanks you remember that time we were on that tour of the east and all that fuss they made because i gave a little old rebel yell in the taj mahal well you sure handled those indian newsmen well but i never could understand why they were so riled well sir its a tomb you know it was a little like someone being disrespectful in the alamo well now that you put it that way but i meant no disrespect yes sir i told them that his aide gave him a signal and the president rose and grasped freemans hand down my way when you give a man a sharp instrument as a present you have to give him something in return so that the friendship isnt broken yes sir here you are freeman slid off his tie clasp and gave it to the president there was a cold silence the presidents grin frozen on his face his aide hurried freeman to the door recovering the president called out now if you get down my way you stop in to see me you hear the president frowned down at the tie clasp in his big hand it was in the shape of a pt boat he walked out into the bright spring sunshine paused on the steps of the white house and looked out at the traffic on pennsylvania avenue he walked to the side of the building to the parking lot the chauffeur was leaning against the fender of the shiny black cadillac smoking a cigarette he looked up at freeman well bigtime the man say you can have the car as long as you want it today where you want to go you can go back to the office i have a bag in the hotel where the airport limousine leaves for national ill walk from here the driver looked at freeman and flipped the butt at him it landed just short of the toe of his shoe freeman looked at the stillsmoking cigarette butt then he looked up at the driver nigger he said if you had hit me with that butt it would have been your black ass the driver stiffened and moved forward from the fender of the car come on said freeman you been wanting some of me for years now lets get it on ill lay your black ass on the white house steps youd like that wouldnt you you out of a job and now you get big and bad in front of the white house no i aint going to fight you here you come down to u street and ill kill you you couldnt kill me on the best day you ever had now you can drive me lets go the driver started around the hood of the car to the drivers seat freeman stood at the door and waited until he had reached the other side nigger open my door they stood looking at one another across the long low top of the car their elongated reflections almost touching the driver walked slowly back around the car and opened the door freeman got into the back seat he told him the name of the hotel where he had been staying since the packers had shipped his effects to his new apartment in chicago the weekend before they stopped at the entrance and freeman passed the check for his bag to the driver he got out then returned with the bag without a word they rode to national airport in silence when they arrived at the terminal freeman got out and handed the driver his plane ticket park the car and check my bag through bring the ticket to me in the bar upstairs he walked into the terminal and upstairs to the bar and ordered a carlsberg he sipped the cold brew until the driver returned heres your ticket bigtime one day im going to kill you go polish the car boy you wont be killing me anytime the driver stood looking at freemans reflection in the mirror to the rear of the bar freeman sipping his beer coolly returned his stare the driver frowned in curiosity he had never seen that expression in the five years freeman had been with the agency finally he turned without another word and left the bar that was stupid freeman thought five years of cooling it and when i blew it it had to be him hell we could probably be poolshooting buddies tasting a bit and chasing chicks but there was no other way the cover had to be complete no holes anywhere it had had to be that way and now he was ready or was he had his mask become him he would find out soon now had he really put them on or had he been putting himself on for a half a decade although trained for it he had never been allowed to be a functioning agent but then that was not why he had been recruited they had never felt he had either the guts or intelligence to function in the field and he had reinforced their thoughts on that score he smiled to himself he had conned them all and in his own way had been the best of the spooks and they might never know it for five years he had been the cia nigger and his job had been to sit by the door what can we say to you that will help you to believe you are learning now about the american revolution the declaration of independence the founding fathers and the constitution and each morning in class you place your hand over your heart and pledge allegiance to the flag and to the country of your birth and it all has meaning for you you are an american and that proud heritage represented by the events and documents and words you are learning is your heritage but soon you will begin to learn other things things which inevitably will leave you in a quandary things which will force you to call into question the meaning of the events and documents and words you have treasured you will learn that for you the heritage in which you have had pride also has emptiness and the knowledge will break your heart we who are older who have traveled the way you must go have not yet found a method of sparing you that heartbreak we want you to believe what you are learning now for the passions and the principles which brought into being the american revolution the declaration of independence and the constitution represent humankind at its noblest we want you to believe in these things even as we concede in sadness that you will need strength beyond what we can give you to hold on to your belief in the world that awaits you
dear brothers and sisters this letter may touch on sensitive and painful areas but it is based on the assumption that every contradiction within our struggle must be examined with relentless care and discussed with total cardor throughout the brotherhood of our blackness on the other hand it must also be clear that i do not assume that those of us who work out in the academic halls of the south are any more free from powerful and ironic inner confusions than vou who operate in the north nevertheless there are certain current developments among you which appear dangerousindeed disastrousfrom our perspective we are convinced that no meaningful building of the black university can take place unless at least some of these issues are resolved so i have taken it upon myself to try to articulate our general concerns especially as they are directed to those of you who study and teach on northern campuses let me get to the point in the most brutal manner first and then attempt to elaborate with greater precison as i go the center of our concern is this do the black student and faculty brothers in northern schools realize that much of your motion over the past year has often appeared to encourage the destruction of those colleges and universities where some black students study in the south besides do you realize that such action towards destruction puts you in league with many white northern academic administrators who are ready to deny the future of black southern education ready to manipulate the death of potentially powerful black institutions now let me say more fully what i mean over the past several years for dozens of good bad and indifferent reasons the schools of the north have been discovering that they need black students faculty persons and various levels of blackoriented curriculum as you well know the current commercial value of blackness has not been one of the least of the reasons for the belated and somewhat sudden awakening as might have been expected these white institutions turned increasingly towards the black campuses of the south there they found a readymade supply of black faculty and discovered the presence of some afroamerican curriculum which had not been destroyed by integration in addition they began to enter into serious competition with the southern schools for the best black students all this action was facilitated by the ready access such institutions had to the very financial sources which had been traditionally parsimonious in their help to black schools for some of the same tasks of course it should also be said loudly that the braindraining process was significantly aided by the great hesitancy on the part of many faculty persons and administrators in the predominantly negro colleges to realize that our experience as a people was worthy of serious academic exploration and by their failure to offer the younger black scholars those encouragements which money cannot buy but that is another article then came the assassination of our brother in april and many of you stepped up the pace of your action a hundredfold wherever you were gathered on the northern campuses whatever your numbers you demanded more faculty more courses more black students than ever before freedom now became blackness now so you rapped with articulate vigor boycotted threatened all kinds of things took over meetings classes and buildingsand generally raised hell meanwhile we watched from the south we applauded we laughed at trembling white administrators who seemed ready to offer you everything you demandedsometimes before the words were dry on the leaflets occasionally we joined in the action on your behalf and strengthened our own students in their resolve to their own southern thing as a matter of fact when an increasingly large number of us were wafted through the skies to visit your campuses as consultants and lecturers and to become objects of tempting salary offers some of our egos were momentarily bolstered or our minds momentarily deranged beyond description our black academic forefathers had never known such high adventure we thought now for a variety of reasons a blessed but painful clarity has begun to break into our euphoric white visions we realize now that this situation is clearly neither a matter for laughter nor for selfgratification rather it seems evident that we wereand arebeing tempted to sell out the black colleges of the south and it appears no less evident that many of you wereand areunwittingly acting as agents in the process being used by persons who are not unwitting at all what we see in the new black light is that we are being called upon bv the northern administrators though your voices are often the ones on tie phones to give our energies our course outlines and finally our fullt me talents to these institutions so for instance programs in afroamerican studies begin to spring up from the ithaca to berkeley and we are invited to help staff them all again it also appears that northernbased financial sources are more ready to fund afroamerican studies in rural ohio and upstate new york than in the heart of the black south this means of course that it is possible for the northern schools in the postassassination period to offer salaries sometimes fifty to one hundred per cent higher than the black schoolsto say nothing of space time atmosphere and assistance for research and publishing not only is this happening to us a faculty persons but we watch as you count your numbers on the campuses we hear you demanding more black company especially from among the ranks of the brilliant brothers and sisters on the block and it becomes clear what this means for us it means that recruiters now often black from the north move more fully than ever before into the traditional southern territories of the black schools and offer fabulous scholarships and other financial aid to the best black students available they also offer of course the prestige of their names to a still prestigeconscious black community when collegebourd brothers and sisters weigh these offers against those of the black schoos often latemoving black schools it is understandably hard for themfor you to resist thus the southern colleges face increased deracination on every level by now it should be clear that this southern exposure provides a different perspective therefore it is not a matter of our begrudging you the blackness you so sorely need in those bastions of whiteness rather it is a matter of letting you know how it looks to us for instance as the white administrators of the north and south explain their newly discovered love for black students and faculty and their sudden conversion to black studies we who are the objects of that bulldozing love had to hear move than the words which are spoken we think our southern position allowsus to hear essentially these sentiments from the keepers of the embattled educational establishments we are determind to get our black multitokens up here they say if we dont do it quickly well lose money status and perhaps some of our nicest buildings therefore we have learned well our lessons from the black communitys hero and we are determined to get students courses and faculty members by any means necessary if that involves the destruction of the black schools of the south so be it we never thought very much of them anyway weve got the money and the prestige they havent as everyone knows money and prestige buy everything even loudtalking guntoting black militants indeed just as this letter to you was being completed two black students from northwestern university came into my office at spelman i had met them during one of my visits up north two years before and now they were in atlanta returning the visitand recruiting black students for northwestern just as i was presenting to them some of the central concerns of my letter the phone rang and the long distance operator introduced the voice of an old acquaintancea dean at a prestigious white institution in pennsylvania he said he wanted to know if there was any directory of black scholars available or if i had a list i could give him because his afroamerican student organization was demanding black faculty representation in every department of the college he had already seen a piece of writing in which i had decried the raping of black schools but he was calling anyway he said i told him that i was quite serious in my published position and therefore had no intention of giving him such a list when we needed in the black schools every excellent black scholar we could find at that point he produced a fascinating and revealing response one worth reporting he said you realize of course that there are many persons in the northern schools who have serious questions about whether those institutions should continueat least as black schools and that is one of the reasons why they have no hesitation about attempting to draw from them whatever faculty they can the conversation came to a more or less abrupt halt after that and i reported it to my friends from northwestern for the same purpose that i report it to you to ask whether you have pondered the implications of such attitudes as you make your moves of course when we consider the past performances of the colonizing world the attitude of the white administrators should not startle us the metropolitan areas have had no more qualms about sapping the human creative resources of their colonies in a later period than they did about claiming the physical resources in an earlier more blatant time nor should good intentions becloud the issue for if they do exist anywhere they do not in any way lessen the impact of the attitudes which make the socalled braindrain possible whatever has suited the purpose of the colonizers has been defined as good and necessary whether it takes place between brussels and leopoldville or between new haven and atlanta nor does it matter that the term has sometimes been assimilation and at other times it has been integration ultimately it spells destruction of the heart of the colonized people if it is not stopped ultimately it is reminiscent of harold cruses lament for the cultural now followed by the physical destruction of the heart of harlem finally when we remember the historical attitudes of white northern institutions towards the black schools of the south we are not surprised for the current action fits well their pattern of basic unconcern about the needs of black life what does surprise and trouble us is the way in which many of you brothers and sisters on the northern campuses are participating fully in the patterns of our common destruction i say common destruction out of a conviction that whatever diminishes the life and vitality of any significant black institutions especially those which have been rooted in our history and which are now being pushed to an encounter with our essential blackness is a destroyer of us all so this letter comes as an urgent fraternal message raising what is for us a crucial set of concerns assuming that we are no longer committed to the individualistic ethos of america nor to integration as it has so far been defined and assuming that one of our major goals is the building of new levels of solidarity within the black community i wish to raise the following questions for serious discussion as you assess the total struggle and your own particular situations in the north in what ways may those of us who teach on southern campuses be of greatest help to you how much of our energies should be spent in consulting and lecturing in the north at your request when there is so much business to take care of down here many of you have been involved in attempts to recruit us to teach fulltime on northern campuses urging us to take the to year appointments which we have been offered how do you reconcile this position with the needs of the thousands of black students in the south though i have no inclination to play the numbers game it is important to consider the fact that the black student group usually numbers less than on most northern campuses and is an unusually large figurethough it often represents a miniscule percentage of the total student body on the other hand you ask us to leave campuses with black student populations ranging from to more than if we really intend to make the search for the black university more than good rapping material for a hundred conferences then where can we take the best concrete first stepson a white campus or a traditionally negro one especially when we consider the service the black university must render to its immediate community is it contradictory in the extreme to consider such nationbuilding service coming from black universities in overwhelmingly white institutions one former professor at a wellknown negro university recently announced to the world that he will do his black thing from now on at a predominantly white school he made this decision he said because black schools eventually will be more likely to imitate a good thing if it happens in a white context first without using such words other black faculty persons have evidently taken a similar point of view how does that way of producing blackness fit into our rhetoric concerning the needs of the community is it really more imitation that we must have now considering our sadly limited resources can there be more than a few really excellent programs or institutes in afroamerican studies in this country is it possible that the recent announcements of the creation of at least two dozen such programs will lead to even more dispersion of our black talents rather than to the consolidation we so badly need for this period if only a few such black research and teaching centers can live with significant integrity where should they be developed indeed where will they find nurture during a period of prolonged struggle to move to an even more directly personal level have any of you considered the possibility that it might make more sense to bring black students to a blackoriented professor in the south than to take him away from his campus in other words have you questioned your own locations seriously in the light of our need to gather ourselves together have you given serious thought to your own sense of vocation the building of the black university whether it be realized in one or a dozen locations demands totally committed teachers organizers and administrators who have moved beyond jiving to real work what about you perhaps you dont know that black students in the south on the negro campuses are also calling for more black faculty when will we find them these are as i said questions for discussion though they may sound rhetorical and loaded at points they are not meant to stifle debate if they seem unfairly weighted they simply bear all the freight of my own fullest concerns for our future in this strange land even as i raise the questions though i am well aware of the fact that many of you may have currently excellent reasons for staying on the northern campuses where you are so as we develop those discussions which must question and reexamine both the southern and nothern black academic positions i wish to add a few concrete suggestions for action action which may make it possible for us to serverather than destroy each other where we are now l on the recruiting of black faculty for northern schools if this must be done during these days when the supply of wellequipped blackconscious brothers and sisters is so limited then why not work for the establishment of special visiting professorships rather than outright raiding of black schools under such an arrangement faculty from the south could be invited for one year we could teach one course in our specialty each quarter or semester and be available for many kinds of counselling there would also be freedom from the many ordinary academic pressures of our southern campuses and time as well as secretarial and research assistance could be made available for more research writing and publication at the same time we would not be wrenched away from the southern schools on an indefinite basis in a sense this would be no more than a token presence of course but it represents a temporary measure which might have some mutual benefit while we discuss the questions above and while we seek to increase the supply of brothers and sisters who can do the job on the recruiting of black students there are obviously hundreds of thousands of black students outside of the colleges who ought to be involved in some meaningful experience of higher education since your institutions have obtained funds from many sources for some of this task why not make at least part of that money available in more creative ways for instance a consortium of one or more white and one or more black schools could be created solely for the purposes of recruiting black students through some pooling of funds mostly yours in the north black students could then be approached with this offer here are the funds you need to go through college you can use the money to attend for example morehouse dillard cornell or the university of illinois if you choose a black school we ask only that you agree to spend one of your years on the predominantly white campus strengthening your brothers there if you choose an overwhelmingly white school you will have the privilege of going home for a year in this way black students could take the money from white schools and use it in any way they choose besides under the new conditions now prevailing in both black and white institutions the exchange could not help but be fruitful the issue of finances is a crucial one especially as it relates to the future of black colleges some institutions would obviously serve the cause best if they merged with other schools to create new strengths and expanded facilities but even those which remained need to be enlarged and endowed in ways that black schools have not known up to now why for instance should it not be possible for prestigious northern schools to use their prestige to help obtain special research grants for certain work which can be done well only by black scholars or why should your more affluent northern institutions not be pressed to make other significant financial contributions to the life of these schools they now so blithely seek to rape the united negro college fund might be one general depository others can be found perhaps an autonomous but well funded black educational foundation ought to be established with its single mission the financing of creative ventures in black education this would not exempt the existing white foundations of course it would simply mean that this black institution would be able to give all of its time and energies to the task so far it has been relatively easy to get white institutions to perform certain kinds of moneyproducing acts on behalf of black education on their own campuses perhaps the time has come to press them to use part of their budgets even sections of their endowment funds to help establish such a foundation or otherwise to make longterm substantial investments in the black academic institutions these would of course constitute no more than preliminary steps towards restitution certainly it is no accident that such proposals fit the pattern of what the former colonizing nations must do to be of significant assistance to the areas they crippled finally it is apparent in the current rush to blackness on the part of white institutions that there simply is not the beginning of an adequate supply of persons trained in afroamerican studies it is imperative for usand for youthat we move urgently to fill that gap in ways other than the stripping of the southern black campuses the various institutes and phd programs in this field which have appeared over the past year are obviously meant to meet the need as well as to satisfy you and to keep you off certain backs but i would argue that most of them cannot and will not do the job indeed some of them may die as soon as you stop blowing on the other hand it is only logical that black institutions in the black community if properly funded organized and led could probably do the best job of creating new scholars in the field of afroamerican studies this seems especially likely in those places where traditions libraries and faculties seem at least adequate even now and where students are pressing sometimes reluctant others towards blackness in atlanta that has been our basic assumption and a group of us have moved towards the creation of such an institute for afroamerican studies we think that black students throughout the nation should know this and should ponder its possible meaning for your own presents and futures as some of you know there are in the atlanta university center six negro institutions in various stages of their search for blackness on the faculties are more than persons whose training experience and teaching in the field of afroamerican life and culture are at least significant the slaughter collection of negro literature the georgia state archives and the newly begun martin_luther_king memorial library a documentation center for the movement combine to present unusual library and archival resources on the black experience apart from such tangibles we are also beneficiaries of the spirit of the great pioneering work in black studies done in atlanta by such persons as w e b du bois e franklin frazier rayford logan e s braithwaithe ira dea reid and many others it is against this background of past and present resources that we are now in the process of creating an institute for afroamerican studies under the umbrella of the martin_luther_king jr memorial center research teaching celebration and action are to be the central driving forcesall focused on the life and times of the peoples of african descent i mention the institute here because it will need many things which you can help provide it will need millions of dollars the best staff from every part of the african diaspora students who are ready to take care of business and it must have continuous exposure throughout the black community the schools you attend could help raise funds for this institute for they will need our products both human and informational if they are to be transformed into viable situations some of you will ultimately comprise the staff and student body the plans you now have for afroamerican studies in white settings must be reexamined and challenged by atlanta in short i am proposing that you help this institute become the major black educational creation of this generation you have a kind of leverage in the white world which must not be dissipated in minor ambiguous victories more importantly you have a power which must not be turned against meaningful black institutions the challenge to help create such an institute to break down the many brittle assumptions of conventional american education to move consistently towards our intellectual roots in the struggle for liberationthis is i think a challenge more appropriate to your power as you ponder these matters i trust you will remember that my questions and proposals are meant to be only some of the ingredients in a dialogue which must take place among us the letter is written in the spirit of black ecumenical concern as we move towards a new humanity the words are my own but the concerns are shared by many other persons on the southern campuses we look forward to appropriate response from the north east and west most black people who are seriously concerned about the nature of the black struggle in education automatically embrace the black university concept this thought process is usually based on a taste for the term the security of being included and the assumption that black must necessarily mean liberation but it is a dangerous process unless we as black people discipline ourselves to neverforevenamoment stop our analysis of the man and his subtle forms of oppression and subversion we must require of ourselves honest scientific analysis immersed in our spiritemotions of how educational activities can lead toand be a part ofthe struggle for the liberation of all black people one of the best ways to understand this is to pin the ideological basis of the term as it is used by different people the dangerous uses of the term fall under the ideological position of revisionary neocolonial racism while the progressive forces of blackour strugglemust beare guided by revolutionary panafrican nationalism these are descriptive terms that conveniently cover polar opposites though clearly a systematic analysis would yield more precise types of each however this article is not meant to be merely a methodological exercise but is intended as a working paper for all black people interested in that ideological struggle to understand more fully the correct direction toward liberation we are mainly concerned with four basic questions what are the ideological bases of conflict concerning the liberation struggle for black people whathowwhy are certain institutions playing significant roles in the development of the concept of the black university what are some of the dangers of neocolonial racist pacification and what is the correct ideological basis of our black struggle toward liberation after providing a working definition of each ideological position the meaning of each will be examined through the workings of five institutional contexts related to the concept of the black university by examining several major trends based on the two opposite positions we hope to clarify certain dangers to our struggle and also we hope to begin to underscore guidelines for our liberation struggle the ideological bases of racial conflict in the united states most previous formulations of the ideological bases of racial conflict in the united states suffer from liberal assumptionsillusions black people were to be dealt with as either a topic of intergroup human relations or of minority group relations this was somehow related to the white mans message that everything would be cool anyway since we all live in a melting pot also the only acceptable responsible approach to change was limited to the dictates of the system obviously the same system responsible for our oppression strange forms of racist social darwinisms lurk through this society and haunt us as we will to be free this type of formulation is inadequate surprise surprise because it is simply a function of this society and its white owners and has little to do with where black people are and where we want to go but black nationalism has never been legitimate in the united states since legitimacy was also a function of white nationalism serving to support white supremacy so a major illusion was to propagate integration as the only legitimate goal for black people the integrationists used tostill say that the problem is that some white people who are from the old school will learn in time and will support what is right every major alternative pointed essentially to the whiteisright theory while much of our black reality was either suppressed or ignored black nationalism is an idea whose time has come and with it has come the obvious need to reformulate the structure of our ideological struggle struggle throughout the third world has helped free us from the american integration myth we have come to know of colonial ism and we are becoming aware that we are a colonized people living in the very bowels of the monster our presence in this country is the result of an illegitimate political process whose most damaging contemporary effect is to convince us of our birthright to citizenship ha to call us to be patriotic and to put us eagerly to work to uphold this system many of us have merely been made to internalize the overseers whip and thus to control ourselves indeed we are a colonized people the key problem then is to isolate the major ideological forces which undergird the system and those opposing it our ideological forces today we know the american system for what it is neocolonial racism functioning to pacify black people and to influence black affairs with revisionary subversion the system is racist because white is still right and black people have never been dealt with as peopleslavery has not been paid for which means that we are interpreted as either just becoming white enough to be considered people or that we are merely being tolerated until someone figures out what to do with us or does it a simple example of neocolonialism is when a negro is sent to manage and control black people in place of a white cat though the basic job assignment is the same for either the most progressive black ideological forces constitute revolutionary panafrican nationalism nationalism is beliefsemotions of racial solidarity and pride panafrican nationalism emphasizes two important points for our identity and struggle all black people are african wherever they are we are africans colonized in the americas all africans must unite against our common enemy and join third world liberation struggles our ideology must be revolutionary as we fight a colonialist system our goal is to destroy it and to replace it with a system that speaks to our needs to quote a brother we dont believe that what we want is better than what others have we just believe it has got to be better for us and if two arent possible well fight to the death for ours since death of a kind is our fate in any case so the ideological conflict is between forces designed to keep us loyal to the system oppressing us or to make sure that we cannot get ourselves together to do something about it and the forces of liberation designed to reunite a separated people to mobilize the will of a people to liberate itself from racist colonial bondage with giant steps toward new africa role of institutions the ideological conflict is best understood by examining the role of certain institutions and not the role of particular people as we are so often tricked into believing this is particularly true when were concerned with concepts like the black university we can describe three kinds of institutions two representing the forces of oppression direct colonial control conies from agencies of the federal government private foundations and white universities these colonial forces combine to influence and to direct their neocolonial extensions the predominantly negro colleges the third really shouldn t be called an institution but a growing number of organized thrusts emerging from the black community with the sole purpose of making education relevant toforwithin our liberation struggle colonial forces employ the twofaced approach to black people using one hand to actively suppress us while using the other hand to urge the vanguard forward into full view for the slaughter some see this as a paradox but it is really a vise one that is closing faster all of the time why is it that institutions like princeton harvard yale rockefeller and the u s congress will sometimes encourage small groups or individuals who are to them black nationalist extremists while at the same time refusing to rid their investment portfolios of south african stocks or economic interests supporting racism throughout the usa how can the congress pass civil_rights legislation to help black to become like whites and then persecute adam clayton powell for being just like them you surely can fill in additional questions for yourself neocolonial forces are virtual laboratories for negro citizens who want the security of a place in or at least of white society while at the same time becoming masters of survival culture fun and games here the vise is cloaked in hues of brown a coloration meant to confuseif not to convinceus into acceptance demands for a program more relevant to black needs are usually met with two responses which clearly reveal their position we have always been interested in the study of the negro we have a good library collection and we have a tradition of research and teaching what is left out is that this tradition stopped to years ago and exactly the opposite trend has reached its summit a brief search for current materials and a look at course catalogs will demonstrate the reactionary reality of this sickness we will not support racism and reject as racist the demand for black history especially if it is stipulated that the instructor be black however there is normally no argument when choosing negro presidents for predominantly negro colleges but holy hell explodes when demanding black teachers for black courses new agencies for black education association of afroamerican educators new school of afroamerican thought affro arts theaterschool university system of the nation of islam etc are now developing around the country these agencies do at least three things illuminate contradictions about the education provided for black people prepare people for the struggle and immerse our children in the saving grace of blackness however the new black search is quite obviously in danger of being subverted by the abovementioned colonial forces the positive thrust not only includes the goals being sought but also involves the very process and basic assumptions of education itself and since we have yet to see who will succumb to or reject the seductive hustle of white resources we must proceed to discuss its dangers before we begin to chart our course toward liberation dangers of neocolonial racist pacification since we were taken political prisoners over years ago and are still in bondage we can safely assume that a thorough analysis of the forms and methodology of past oppression will at least provide the basis for perceiving future dangers in a summary fashion there are at least four devices at work for colonial and neocolonial institutions although they are often applied in different ways in the typology of dangers facing the black university concept there are four types of dangers listed each appears to be relevant to both the colonial and neocolonial institutions the term inflated expectations refers to the dangerous possibility that advocates of the black university concept will be lured into the trap of believing in the devils actually believing that fundsresourcespositions will be made available for creative work i was tricked on two occasions in as many years though my action was considerably more naive than what i really believed and was told over and over and over again whew the colonial institutions especially major universities and the ford foundation use their vast resources to blow peoples minds and to cop and while the neocolonialist predominantly negro college has pull here it is not resources but traditions which often trick folks what one discovers is that these traditions are often more manufactured than real and when real frequently have been abused by the colleges reference group conflicts often result from inflated expectations not to mention the serious ego problems facilitated in the process simply put the problem concerns who or what groupblack people are to think of as they prepare to move this is often related to what audiences they speak to where they send proposals for funding where they choose to publish who they relate to as far as colleges are concerned etc the colonial confrontation is classic in that it presents the best traditional form of confrontation blacks directly facing white authority and power the neocolonial problem is ambiguous here as blacks move toward a common analysis and hold onto the goal of liberation as manifested in the black university negroes of all ideological persuasions and experiences move to neutralize to polemicize and to expel blacks from their schools often brotherhood alone prevents a san francisco state type struggle from emerging at morehouse though this pattern is subject to shift at any moment note the recent unpublicized burnings around the atlanta university center following martin_luther_king jrs funeral and a recent campus visit by stokely carmichael an increasingly important concern is how the limited resources committed to the black university concept are being diffused throughout the country dig it the following together brothers are scattered at white schools throughout the country nathan hare alvin pouissant robert browne charles hamilton st clair drake harry edwards price cobbs william grier edgar beckham and those negro schools with black faculty are unique even when every effort is made to stifle their work and to get rid of them there is consequently no center for revolutionary black education and that shouldnt come as a big surprise only the most secure white colleges are announcing grandiose plans for the recruitment of black faculty note the recent ucla announce ment of a plan to hire black professors by fall last there is the problem of definition if lyndon johnson could coopt the civil_rights thrust deceitfully smiling as he proclaimed we shall overcome then black people ought to watch out if the united negro college fund could place an ad in the new york times portraying a negro in cap and gown with the caption black_power then black people ought to watch out but normally colonial forces are the first to move in on ideological concepts note the emasculated verison of the class conflict as compared to what karl marx meant in the manifesto only after a few foundation grants and a few conferences for whites is it normally possible for negroes to use the termand then it is often psychologically difficult for them to sav it without perjorative gesticulations terminological cooptation is a process to confuse the ideological struggle for popular support we must always be aware of the need for clarity and we must never hesitate to provide an understandable analysis for any group of our people and now having looked at the dangers we ought to examine the positive ideological basis for our struggle ideological guidelines for struggle there are five ideological guidelines that fit these discussions though it is in the course of struggle itself that we will define what is ultimately necessary for our liberation these must be as free as possible of the above listed dangers a african identity no other identification is as close to our history and as far from our oppressors the term afroamerican still somehow legitimates the hell of america and separates us through generations from africa our identity as africans is based on the utility it has for struggle only by recognizing the alien character of this country even though it is sometimes tolerable because of our contributions to it can we ever hope to successfully wage the revolutionary struggle b operational unity while it is obvious that one allinclusive organization for black people would be impossible to build it is not impossible to move toward coalitions of groups most national liberation struggles have been based on the operational unity of a diverse set of organizations and we can see moves in this direction with the black congress in los angeles the united black front in washington d c the black congress in chicago and the attempt to build a black peoples alliance in atlanta we must work cooperatively on common goals in order to utilize all resources and for their thousand blows deal one death blow mentioned earlier the whole black revolution is a reaction to grievances too often ignored and promises too frequently forgotten thus there is the possibility of overreaction on both sides it is a painful experience for both the majority and the minority in a society to understand that so much of its fabric is interwoven with racism the desire to eradicate it or to forget it this is a much less feasible possibility in the context of modern society with its mass media and mass communication can lead to many false starts and wellintentioned mistakes the majority of blacks do not want an apartheid society but many will stand with black only causes until society shows that it really means to include blacks in the society on an equal and meaningful basis the black students are quite justified in demanding more coverage of black history and the contributions of blacks to society although some of the black students dont believe that white students should be admitted to these courses black history courses will be of considerable value to white students also certainly the relatively inane treatment of slavery and the reconstruction period by historians deserves correction in the minds of all some definitive works on reconstruction such as that of john hope franklin chairman of the history department at the university of chicago have been written but to a great extent these are not included in the basic history courses that are taken by most students black students are justified in asking that more black counselors and advisers be appointed not that only black counselors can counsel black students but black students should have black counselors available if they want to talk with one also black and white students should be able to see blacks in a variety of positions in the university demands of the type that i have just mentioned are not to develop an apartheid university rather they are to provide for a valid recognition of black people and black students as a part of society and a part of the university the consideration of the black student as a special case in the university particularly at an institution that prides itself on its democratic traditions might appear to violate principles of equality and nondiscrimination but the university as one of the most important institutions of society has a responsibility to help blacks and other minority groups achieve the position of social and economic equality that is implicit in our system president james m hester of new york university for example says that nyu intends to discriminate positively in favor of black students to help eradicate the effects of racism on them although it can be argued that the university should merely reflect the values and traditions of society and create knowledge for the sake of knowledge many people in society look to the university for leadership and guidance in the solution of a variety of social and intellectual problems the universitys concern with black students is clearly within this framework certainly mistakes will be made the black students will make mistakes and should be allowed to learn from them university administrators will make mistakes and should also be allowed to learn from them the black student awakening and the contemporary student activism on americas campuses point the way for the enhancement of the university as an important institution in our society those of us in the university should really hold ourselves in their debt for so forcefully bringing this challenge to us the concern of africanamerican educators must be first with education and only secondarily with those structures set aside for educational activities ie schools this is because the goal is a relevant and productive education for our people education has no absolute standards and can therefore not be limited by any predetermined or already extant systems or structures rather education is an experience in concentrated enculturation which always takes place in the most feasible and culturally expedient location realizing the shortcomings of white american schools the fundamental approach has to be either to make those schools adequate through change or to move elsewhere to administer education and before considering whether or not american schools can be altered sufficiently we have to first recognize the essential need for a new approach to education from a black perspective any educational system must be a viable cultural cell in its particular social complex and must work in conjunction with other such institutions in the society religion legal codes social organizations etc towards affecting coordination and continuity of culture and values in afroamerica most schools have not been such a viable cultural institution established by our people to promote our own general welfare but rather a substandard distortion of white americas idea of education the latter serves as a valid institution in the broader other society and as such has always had to justify the historic and contemporary subordination of africanamericans it has unfor tunately forced many of the same such values of inferiority both intellectual and practical upon us in ways both subtle and overt it has aided in our oppression intellectually it has perpetuated a white lie over black truth in a more practical sense it has given us broken and outmoded tools with which to operate in the larger society thereby insuring our traditional position of economic political and social impotency the normal role of education as a lever for cultural enrichment has lunctioned improperly in our community black students returning to the community hoping to develop its positive aspects have ioand themselves unequipped to operate effectively very little in the educational system has dealt with afroamerica from either a positive constructive or realistic framework the massive unrest among black students today reflects the recognition of this fact the long overdue need for school systems to address the most pointed problems of american society especially as they relate to africanamericans as well as the failure to accurately reflect the history and culture of black people has precipitated this hightide of legitimate discontent hence increased student activism around this issue represents a last call for commitment on the part of american academia towards real and meaningful education nevertheless some african americans have accepted education as the answer and what of them can they not be used as examples of what america holds for the black man first of all they are decidedly in a great minority and can therefore not be a legitimate index by which to assess the present state of afroamerica as a whole and although an increasing number of negroes hold quasimiddleincome jobs this does not obliterate the realitv that although most of the poor people in america are in fact white most of the black people in america in fact are poorfailures in even the american sense a nar row spectrum of economic acquisition and stability moreover the socalled successful negro middleclassman cannot be held up as a symbol of black americanism because in a broader social sense he is also illegitimate laying aside for the moment the whole question of practicality and possibility let us just consider the relation of the middleclass negro to the broader africanamerican community although he is recognized as respectable by the white society sometimes black youth for the most part reject his brand of social success they simply cannot relate to him the questions to which he presents answers are not the most relevant ones in their lives black children are quite aware of the potential insecurities of their lifestyle yet they persist in their ways to attribute this to psychological maladjustment is to assume that schools are more inherently correct than people most black students dont want to be like their family doctor physical education teacher or their case worker they dont want to sell insurance be lawyers or even work in factories as apprentices the social sacrifice inherent in achieving these positions is too great for them they must be offered new alternatives not just alternative ways to become middleclass negroes in addition it is unrealistic to concentrate on enlargement of the black bourgeoisie for this group has its classic creation as a buffer zone between the masses of blacks and the masses of whites it cannot exist without the existence of the other two externally to itself in fact if the masses of africanamericans were to become middleclass negroes they would have negated themselves for there would be no middle only a full realization of a white top and a black bottom comparison of the positions held now by negro college graduates and their white counterparts illustrates this point vividly therefore the absence of respectable africanamericans in the community is not the answer to the problem it is rather a failure of the schools as part and parcel of the system which spawns the black bourgeoisie to be relevant to the community as a total institution from beginning to end its perspective its program and its product have not addressed the needs of the africanamerican such a miscarriage of sociointellectual pregnancy has destroyed the average africanamericans respect for education the middleclass negro succeeds only at the exoense of his soul while the soul ful blackbrother suffers a life of economic insecurity both are equally politically impotent and hence the community is stagnant moreover in respect to soul it becomes apparent that soul is thus more than a music style a way of walkingthatwalk or talkingthattalk it becomes an inner drive whose motor manifestations are present in the aforementioned traits soul becomes that which leads one knowingly in a more meaningful direction than synthetic capitalist christian materialism temptingly invites its a natural thang ie of nature and as such deserves more respect than we often give it it is as maulana ron karenga points out one thing the white man has never been able to deal with because he cant understand it therefore neither his schools nor anything else in his society has ever cannot and probably never will be able to handle it the white boy engaged in the worship of technology we must not sell our souls for money and machines we must move then to resurrect education as a constructive cultural institution among our people aside from the need for white schools to perpetuate the white lie mentioned above other considerations seem to point to the ultimate need for allblack school systems and consequently the nec ssity for africanamerican educators to take stock of their present condition and to prepare for the essential move back to black the concern of all public schools is obviously educating the public in america that public contains a lrge predominance of nonblacks and a considerably smaller number o third world peoples the majority of whom are africanamericans because of their historical and ethnic differences these two groups are decidedly distinct culturally yet the american public education system operating in accord with the countrys meltingpot myth works on the erroneous assumption that there can at once be a basically homoceeos school wsystem to serve all american inhabitants this is in fact a myth because the historical existence of africanoid peoples in america has been one of separateness therefore a balanced blackwhite educational program is a contradiction of both ethnic and historical reality and hence we must consider the alleged massive failure of africanamericans to adapt to the american school system not so much as a psychological maladjustment to be relieved by remedial and compensatory programs which in essence seek to find new ways to stuff the same rotten food down everrejecting throats but rather as a sociocultural mismatch a poorly balanced diet which is indicative of our even broader paradoxical selfcontradictory existence in america in short when there are consistently so many dysfunctional products we must question not only the raw material but the nature of the m machine itself the failure of a round peg to fit into a square hole is not because the peg isnt square but rather because it wasnt made to fit in a square hole in the first place the question can now be raised as to whether or not the present school systems can in fact be changed to meet the needs of africanamericans are such changes realistic more important are they desirable first of all it seems as though no american school has yet affected sufficient changes to satisfy the everincreasing demands of black students at all levels and perhaps this inability is illuminated by two observations on the one hand and already mentioned above since the american schools are part of the total american sociocultural complex a viable institution in that society it must be compatible to the stability of that system unless it either justifies or ignores the historic and contemporary oppression of africanamericans the society as an entity cannot exist to deal with the slanting of curriculum for this purpose would be redundant we all know whats happening there yet we have to also reiterate a need for new career opportunities white schools are structured to meet the needs of the white community our needs are quite different and often contradictory to those in fact one of the foremost designs of a black school will be the destruction of white schools as the legitimate source of education for africanamericans a second point involves the desirability of such a change in highly mechanized industrial america the schools at all levels have become the nations largest baby sitter finding nothing more expedient to do with its youth america offers a hour school week with extra curricular activities for overtime the world of academia has become a haven of escapism specializing in the mass dissemination of functional ignorance justified by tradition and legitimized as education american education tends to be a rather static type of thing so static that it does not apply its most elementary findings to fundamental issues elementary biology is inapplicable to marys divine conception courses in communism and racism are outlawed in the schools the study of them being allocated to exclusive federal scholars like the kerner commission and the house unamerican activities committee who readily admit these are the two biggest problems facing the entire country by the same token black history becomes a nice thing to study but not from which to learn lessons regarding this societys illegitimacy in relation to black people and of course there is always the matter of cooptation white folks taking over our thang for the enterprising white hustler this has always been a good gigeconomically intellectually culturally you name it tragic it is when we realize that africanamericans have been the creative backbone of this country and nevertheless have little or nothing to show for it we have to seek to reclaim our own heritage and to control the definition of our own history and culture in order to preserve a meaningful and accurate definition of our situationpast present and futurefrom our own perspective for ourselves and our prosperity it should therefore be the goal of the africanamerican educator to seek the establishment of a fluid educational structure for reality is everchanging and once established a black education should never need to be revolutionized but rather in a constant state of evolution always putting the present in its proper perspective our education must answer frantz fanons charge what we want to do is to go forward all the time night and day in the company of man in the company of all men we must work out new concepts and try to set afoot a new man black people in america have no power to change the public schools socalled decentralization has yet to prove its viability without real control of its schools the black community that society which the educational system must serve and hence those who must have the power to define education from their own perspective and sufficient for relevance to them has only a tokenistic or advisory function and what is to prevent the dismissal of such advisory entities when political sentiments change in the governing colonial power structure as brother stokely carmichael has pointed out this is preciselv the lesson which black people must learn from reconstruction in this country and so the concern of the educator must not be to integrate by any means necessary the africanamerican student into a basically dysfunctional educational system but rather if he chooses to work within that system to work towards its destruction as a source of black oppression for those who do not wish to accept the cold reality of this there is a sort of alternate approach and that is to merely strive to offer a valid educational experience to the africanamerican student one which evolves from a black frame of reference operates with materials drawn from the black experience and prepares the individual for relevant and effective functioning within and in accord with the general welfare of that society if this can be done within the existing structures then do it but if it cannot be done there it is the clear duty of the africanamerican educator to denounce that system and to seek any means necessary to serve the black community in which his position and realitv ultimately rest no man is any more than the context to which he owes his existence maulana karenga oughout this t land a volcano of student alienation and esentment compounded in the case of black studentsis erupting in the ir form of ephemeral administrative takeovers visavis black students the problem stems in part from the emptiness and subtle racism of the college system in part from the pain of black student experiences in the society which the college system serves black students it is necessary to know are descendants of a people cut off from their attachment to land culture and country robbed of a sense of pride in pastness the roots of identity so essential as a springboard for a sense of collective destiny shut off from involvement in the educational process during slavery it was unlawful to teach a black person to read or write black americans then largely inhabiting the south sought adjustment by way of supernatural rationalizations such as the superstition still extant that if you read too much youre bound to go crazy the problem today though manyfaceted is irritated by the gross invisibility of black students despite their seemingly mushrooming physical presenceon most white college campuses the neglect of the black students needs may be apparent but acutely unnoticed in the scarcity for example of courses dealing forthrightly with the black race its problems and its contributions in american society i sort of thought negroes came here to try to become white a white student leader recently admitted in the wake of a general black revolt the black college students awareness of the psychology of exclusion grows ever keener and he longs at last for educational and political visibility accordingly while the perfunctory nature and general obsolescence of higher education in america plagues white students as well the black student is impelled to seek visibility get it together and move on up and come back home through sharp demands for symbols such as the presence on campus of at least a token number of black professors and courses exposing black history and culture down to the inclusion of hog maws and chitterlings on cafeteria menus which already include beef stroganoff meatballs and spaghetti and occasionally chop suey black students see themselves as windowdressing tokens of black participation in campus life knowing that as individuals they are in but nevertheless wanting general recognition of the fact that they are there this contrasts with the situation of black students on the negro college campus where protest does occasionally reflect racial and color considerationsstemming chiefly from negro college conformity to the mores and values of the white college systembut more typically takes the form of a basic quest for personal freedom the liberalizing of curfew regulations and other aspects of the right not to be treated as children while training to be adults by comparison the white college permits a greater degree of freedom thought not as much as they claim to believe in and not enough to please todays generation of students reared on the permissive approach members of an age group which constitutes an increasing majority while treated as a kind of minority particularly is the white college characterized by a greater spirit of inquiry than the typical negro college this intellectual activity rubs off on the student black students become concerned just as white students are except that whatever problem white students encounter black students inherit plus the dual condition of being rejected or ignored as individuals or as blacks on white campuses located in small college communities blacks live in social isolation aggravated frequently by a skewed sex distribution where their acceptance is superficial even when apparent in less exclusive colleges located in large cities the opportunities for social and romantic philandering are more prevalent in both the greater number of their kind on campus and a relative access to the offcampus black community this quest for meaningful social relations coupled with discriminatory housing and economic considerations increase the black students probability of becoming a campus commuter commuting each day between the black community and the white campus black students experience a daily sense of discrepancy between two contrasting even conflicting worlds one world whose spirit has been largely broken in the quest for the social elevation which the black student now holds dear the other world characterized by a good deal of minutiae which the black student recognizes as profoundly irrelevant to himself his fate and his experience and yet he knows so well that he must wade somehow through this white milieu in search of ratification for the white rat race which is a chore for anybody the chore is simply compounded by the fact that psychologically and otherwise it does not relate so well to what is crucial to the black students life inclining him in too many cases to give up he eventually comes to see it as essentially a bad set this sense of defeatism and despair is reinforced and magnified by the models of failure surrounding him in the black community on top of that exposure to harsh measures of discrimination past or present provoke a feeling of suspicion out of which can develop a negative definition of certain phenomena which the white middle class employs for social acceptance including not merely cultural symbols of status it might become derogatory for example to be seen spending much time with books under the prevailing college system structured so that an individual succeeds best by conforming most to middle class values black students labor considerably less prepared than white students of suburban training and experience to cope they grow naturally and indelibly alienated it might become more in to be pretty good at cards for example which only multiplies the probability of failure in the academic arena the black studentcovertly at firstrightfully begins to question the nature of standards impassionately dangled above his head as obstacles to the acquisition of the stamp qualified recently during a talk at yale university i had the occasion to ponder the blank and in a good many cases openmouthed stares of ignorance from the predominantly white audience when i related how all white students given a test devised by a black colleague and myself had fundamentally flunked all were unable to identify such commodities as hog maws fried pies and butter roll the professorcollaborator and i had been impelled to concoct the test at the risk of falling victims to the fallacy of reductio ad absurdum after a ruckus between black students and white administrators at a predominantly white college over the choice of a professor for a course in ancient black history the administrators choice was a young white fellow armed with an ivy league phd and muchlauded publications in learned journals the black choice of the black students preferred also by many white students bore no college credentials but probably knew as much about ancient black history as anybody extant having recently spent two years haunting the schomburg collection in new york the white professor knew little or nothing about the subject under scrutiny he was quick to admit but continued to cry out with strong emotion that he was qualified the black students who sought to break up his class could not understand why the administration would choose a white man admitting his ignorance to teach a course while rejecting the black man who knew all about it later it occurred to me that a black historian seeking publication in learned journals is placed in a rather precarious position of having to document his work when writing aggressively against the slavery era with references from the writings and records kept by a slave society in which black persons were restricted by law and custom from access to the written word while a graduate student in sociology at the university of chicago ran afoul of academias demand for copious footnoting fleetingly scanning library shelves for instant references from unread books to win high marks and influence professors with padded documentation a harvard administrator in the audience at yale assured me that i did not invent that vulgar practice even so it was for me excusable because unlike my professors who were unable to tell me the identity of the four tops i was culturally deprived i acquired the phd without gross dishonor and that appears sometimes now to count in the minds of some people more than all the good and bad things i have eve done my contempt grew stronger in any case as l discovered the footnoting cliques in references used to buttress white theorizing on the black race not only did i detect mutualquoting affairs i noted that a professor might suggest hypotheses as many did to thesis students who then graciously used some of the professors work for references only in turn to have their thesis used by the professor to document a larger theory based on the hypotheses of the several students i learned further while poring over learned journals that the motivation behind the footnoted expressions of gratitude to wealthy foundations and colleagues was not gratitude alone the fact that a toprated foundation has backed a piece of research gives it the boost of prestige the scholarly custom of sending a manuscript around to sundry colleagues reaps similarly the inference that the reviewing colleagues have given it the stamp of approval this dirty knowledge as one of my professors called it gave me as a faltering black student from a rural district in oklahoma a new kind of confidence many experiences which can turn him either on or off confront the black college student in the typical white college classroom for example he must sit silently bemused while his eminent sociology professor reports solemnly but proudly that his surveys show there will be no riots in chicago because as one suggested early last september only seven per cent of negroes surveyed say they definitely approve of riots a black student might not realize that such a professor like his peers at large is suffering from the bias of democracys myth of majorityrule but the calculator in his brain might quickly register blacks and wonder how many negroes his professor believes sufficient to start a riot the professor himself may later have stood perplexed when rioting broke out in chicago on the heels of martin_luther_kings assassination but he is not likely to alter his methods or standards of scholarly excellence which he requires his black students to accept early in his educational career the black student encounters the subordinating slap of white supremacy modes of communication for instance compel him to lose his ingroup dialect and imitate the snarls and twangs of the white race there becomes thear nine nighyun law lower and so on verbal facility is frankly presented to the black student as the salient ingredient for admission to college although i know young black men with more verbal facility than i will ever have who have either flunked out or dropped out of school beyond this the black student instinctively if only faintly is affronted by the fact that foreign languages required are exclusively of white european origin though oriental languages may be offered as electives this in spite of the fact that chinese is spoken by more individuals than any other language in the world and swahili an african language competes very favorably with german this is just one of the examples of white snobbishness lurking behind the criteria of excellence which by no means however is entirely a product of racism alone running through its history also is a strain fundamentally of a different sort though it too is racial by coincidence in its consequences in the beginning american education particularly on the college level was highly private restricted to the few who were wealthy enough to afford it such persons as social theorist thorsten veblen observed in his book the theory of the leisure class were characterized by a peculiar mentality in which owing to the necessity for displaying ones wealth it was prestigious to be free from productive endeavor any work done could not be remunerative and preferably should be of no significant use to anybody let alone oneself to waste time and to have the time to waste time were the symbols of prestige their educational enterprise accordingly was characterized by a liberal arts approach where students learned a little about a lot of things and a lot about nothing the leisureclass syndrome and its snobbish motivations encouraged a preoccupation with lofty gobbledygook such as footnoting students might be compelled to labor in memorizing the idiomatic expressions and the verbal conjugations of dead languages or more currently languages which invariably fade from the students memory and while remembered are useless in postcollege life as middle class aspirants began to emulate the leisure class and education was largely socialized the principle of exclusiveness was reinforced by the need to stem the flood of recruits to professional occupations hence the student might make as and bs in all required courses only to fail the comprehensive exam or the language test or pass all academic requirements only to fail the bar exam because of political beliefs or color of skin education lost much of its capacity for vitalizing the mind and since the endproducts became more important than the process eventually amounted to a routine assimilation of approved bodies of knowledge a process which fails particularly to inspire a black child of working class origin i sometimes shock students into a realization of the shallowness of the american college scene by walking into a classroom and throwing out a concept preferably with a germansounding name such as zeitschaft whether this is a word i do not know which i might claim to be a concept for a societal condition in which there is widespread feelings of racism or intergroup hostility while students are busy copying down the term i proceed to show how to measure the intensity of the zeitschaft predicament this is accomplished i further instruct by computing an index of racial response an index of racial response by now i am calling it the irr score is computed by observing a sample of persons from two or more racial groups over a period of time say whites and blacks passing or encountering one another on a given street corner during a given day charting the number of smiles exhibited by the individuals comprising the sample and dividing the number of smiles observed by the number of persons in the sample then dividing this by the square root of two while the students are furiously engaged in copying this down virtually slobbering in anticipation of returning to their dormitories where they will ambivalently complain of the difficulty of the course perhaps requesting their roommates aid in calling out the material for memory i step back and explain my desire to have the students see the board clearly inasmuch as i had made it all up i further state that i knew that they did not understand it no more than i had and that they are not being educated in spite of what they are accustomed to believe by merely memorizing a professors fodder and regurgitating it on his test white students it is true are victims of the same condition but it is doubly alien to the experience of black students who moreover are burdened by many another unconscious assumption of white su premacy take the matter of the cultural imperialism which white ethnocentrism produces a white anthropology professor may think nothing of dividing african tribes into primitive and westernized then pointing out that primitive tribes are more characterized by the matrilineal system tracing ancestry through the mother instead of the father while neglecting to point out that this could be a more accurate procedure the black student who first called mv attention to this fact indicated that you have to take the mothers word for it and sometimes she doesnt know herself he swore that a boy in his georgia bayou community came home from school one day and told his father happily that he was going to marry a girl let us call her pearlie mae his father said son i didnt know that you would go that far you cant marry pearlie mae thats my daughter shes your sister dont tell your mamma now the boy moped around then broke down and told his mother what was wrong thats okay his mother consoled you can marry pearlie mae dont tell your daddy but he aint your father sociology classes will discuss the merits of the moynihan report on the negro family incognizant of the implications of moynihans own figures showing for example that for every nonwhite males between the ages of and in new york city there are extra females somebody of necessity must carry a greater sexual burden than rightfully is his share or a number of women will languish via induced celibacy at the same time the condition is being intensified by the disproportionate rates at which black males are dying in vietnam depleting the supply of eligible black males this cold demographic fact will lead to family disorganization and high rates of adultery no matter how moral or stable as social scientists say black sexual codes might be similarly anthropology professors will subject black students to discussions on family disorganization among africans in kenya for example impervious to the fact that much family strife is a product of the christian missionaries importation of an alien monogamy which replacing the existing polygamy evidently geared to the demography and socioeconomic needs of the people displaced surplus wives in order to save them and produced a good deal of the family disorganization which anthropologists get grants and trips abroad to study courses in european history will skip over the slave trade while courses in american history will mention black persons only with reference to slavery and the myth that lincolns restricted emancipation proclamation freed all of them courses and textbooks in literature remain lily white many white students spurred by involvement in civil_rights activities and the daily prominence of the black struggle in news coverage are growing keenly aware of these curious omissions but it is ever so much more painful when the student is black black students who wail about the absence of blackness in white college education accordingly are not trying to destroy american education so much as they are trying desperately to renovate it their compensatory response to black exclusion has taken a separatist flavor for the most part on the surface but it may seem ironic to those who misunderstand them that in the name of black nationalism calling for the presence of more black students and professors they actually are bringing about more desegregation of white colleges than there ever was before the name of the game is the elevation of a people by means of one important escalatorcollege education separatism and integrationism are possible approaches to that end they lose their effectiveness when swayed by dogmatic traces of absolutism they become full ends in themselves it will be an irony of recorded history i have written elsewhere that integration was used in the second half of this century to hold the black race down just as segregation was so instituted in the first half black students now seem to feel that integration particularly in the token way in which it has been practiced up to now and the neotokenist manner now emerging elevates individual members of the group but paradoxically in plucking many of the strongest members from the group while failing to alter the lot of the group as a whole weakens the collective thrust which the group might otherwise muster increasingly black students are turning their backs on the old tendency for negro college graduates to escape from the black community instead of returning to help build it this new mood is born of a greater awareness of the glories of their own past as a people an image they now wish to convey also to others hence the clamor for more black courses and courses taught from a black perspective or dark courses as i overheard one white colleague tell another later translated by a sociology professor into colorcompatible courses in the effort to make education relevant to the black communityand by indirection to the white communitythe communities themselves may be transformed each in its own way and so to speak made relevant to a bona fide education thus black student endeavors not only if successful might bring about a kind of black renaissance they could possibly wield an impact on the entire cemetery of american education during a im y fiv ej ttx day weekend that q r started on nov miqrr more than students scholars and artists from states and more than colleges and universities gathered at howard university for a conference called towards a black university it was the most comprehensive group of great black thinkers ever to focus on this single issue if you ran your finger down the guest list it would fall on names like dr alvin poussaint leroi jones maxroach harold cruse rhody mccoy ossie davis maul ana ron karenga stokely carmichael dr andress taylor and hundreds of others with national and local reputations to the howard campus the conference had the effect of a rock thrown into a pool it caused ripples but two months later the surface of the pool gave little sign that the questions raised by the conference were submerged there however for some like acklyn lynch a social science instructor at howard who helped to design the conference it achieved exactly what he had supposed it would it gave people a chance to get together and start to talk about the kinds of things they were going to have to do it furthered the dialogue he added that he was still talking and exchanging ideas by telephone with people from all over the country people he had met at the conference during those bright warm five days the howard campus was full of dashikis afros undercover fbi agents and revolutionary talk former howard instructor nathan hare had declined an invitation to return for the conference because he said howard students would rather talk about a black university instead of making the university black he stayed at san francisco state college where students were doing more than talking his statement read unless every howard student comes armed with a shotgun and a molotov cocktail they are defenseless against an amos n andy administration lynch reflected later however that talk was all they had intended to do back in the s and s scientists from all over the world were meeting and talking about space exploration but the first flight didnt take place until years later buddy hunt a howard freshman interrupted to say that the black university couldnt wait that long we were all sitting in lynchs office on the third floor of founders library lynch was quick to add that he had not meant that it should he turned from marking final examination papers but you cant have a fiveday conference and after its over go out and build a black university there are thousands of questions that you have to answer first but the prospect of revolutionary talk was enough to bring a reaction from the trustees i quoted to lynch a statement the board had issued to the effect that howard was founded years ago primarily for the education of disadvantaged black people but nothing in its charter will support a black university they said seemingly unmindful that howard years later has very little relation to the really disadvantaged black people who live in the slums surrounding the campus in northwest washington the trustees were making it plain that the school which has produced half the countrys black doctors a good percentage of its black lawyers senator edward brooke supreme court justice thurgood marshall and washingtons mayor walter washington was not going to tolerate anything revolutionary happening to general howards university as one student called it and laughed lynch looked up from his papermarking again the trustees didnt have to tell us that the conference was not designed to have howard become the black university invitations to the conference stated precisely what the conference was designed for the concept of a black university is revolutionary it emerges out of the frustrations of black students educators activist and community leaders who recognize that the present institutions of higher learning have no relevance to the total black community and who realize the contradictions of allowing themselves to be accultured into a society which debili tates black people our responsibility as conference participants is to define the structure and mechanics of that university on wednesday in a twohour keynote speech stokely carmichael told the delegates they were going to have to quit talking and start acting but the conferees had come from as far away as califor nia to talk so they broke into small workshops and met in classrooms and houses in the community and read poetry and prose and listened to jazz and talked the range of subjects was too wide to summarize well in short every aspect imaginable was dealt withfinancial international political curricular artistic athletic technological environmental structural agricultural musical clerical there were workshops digging out the answers to some of the thousands of questions that had to be answered a howard coed tall thin very attractive recalled that some of the most beautiful people in the world were in town for that weekend lynch complained however that only about five percent of the howard student body participated this figure seemed surprisingly low to some of the outsiders who were there that weekend but it was hard to tell the participants from the students who were simply making their regular rounds to classes in the same buildings lynch said he took it upon himself to close the workshop sessions to representatives of the white press he said he was trying to avoid the danger of misrepresentation and sensationalism but others say it was more a group decision which was in part motivated by the planners belief that black people at this stage talk more freely when there are no white people present which meant that some conferees attempted to eject white faculty members one observer said the selection of who was black enough got a little ridiculous a black former howard student who came on his own said he was put out because he happened to work for a white newspaper he said there was a dude a holder of a black belt in karate at the door to cramton auditorium threatening to hurt him if he was caught inside the dude had a list of folks he was going to chop up the former student said the local media reacted with anger white americans perhaps more than any other people on earth get really disturbed when they are discriminated against radio station wwdc broadcast an editorial which started off by saying officially approved discrimination is supposed to be a thing of the past and ended up with howard university chartered by congress supported in large by public money has no right to permit discrimination on its campus emphasis added the administration was in a dilemma it was caught between white money and black students a spokesman for the university said the administration did nothing organizers of the conference said the university closed certain facilities to the conference forcing it to hold most of its last workshops in the gym several outsiders said at the end that there were so few people remaining that all the workshops could fit into the gym perhaps all of the reports are partially correct or perhaps none of them are some participants complained that the conference did not get much support from the community this may have been because the conference was not well advertised in washington by barring the washington presswhich thougl overwhelmingly whiteowned i nonetheless the least segregatec and the fairest of any large citj press establishment in the countn the organizers assured that ven little news would come down fron howard hill to the rest of wash ington but the conference survived al this midway through a major re organization was necessary to keef all the participants from attending the workshops conducted by the big names and neglecting the ones where a lot of the bread and butter work was being done a small group of hard working students planned and made the major decisions at the conference all of them i interviewed said there were many things they would do differently if they had it to do over again but all agreed it was a good first step joey mitchell a howard junior who is in charge of reprinting the official results of the conference rated it a success despite the bumpy road it traveled he has in hand resolutions and about papers that deal not only with the black universitys role but also with the bordering areas of the black mans role historically presently and the future in white society the papers and resolutions are available through the office of the howard university student association which sponsored and paid for the conference the papers and resolutions summarize what came out of the interaction of students artists muslims professors scientists community leaders clergymen poets musicians and intellectuals mitchell said they are first steps which will have to be joined to the next steps taken in new york or atlanta or los angeles or san francisco or somewhere the term negritude created by the brilliant west indian poet aime cesaire and nurtured to maturity by leopold sedar senghor the poet politician of senegal can help us understand where the black writer is in this country today negritude in essence as i understand it denotes that particular quality those certain nuances which are universal to the thought action and behavior of black africans the concept of negritude has been and to some extent still is of fundamental importance in the writings literature of black africans trained in the frenchspeaking areas ie by those writers who have willingly or unwillingly whatever the case may be adopted french cultural habits as part of their lifestyle negritude came into existence not purely as the result of french culture but as a needed reaction to french classical education suddenly black africans stranded together in time of crisis the weak and strong seek out their own in some french bar intellectualizing and rationalizing their existence became keenly aware of the fact that they were blackmen but most important they finally realized this in the most profound terms that were nonwhite too negritude in its final analysis can be considered the antithesis of everything french ie everything antiblack everything white the frenchafrican finally realized that he was accepted by the dominant white french society only because he was willing to subordinate his blackness and become as french as possible this meant among other things that the african had to adopt the dress mannerism culture and religion of western civilization thus the policy of assimilation was used to systematically destroy the mind and total identity of black africans stripping him completely of his africanness his blackness leaving him more french than african thats the context in which negritude grew it became that rebellious force used by the frenchafricans to try and recapture their past their culture their religion themselves and most of all their future with negritude the african writer did an aboutface and decided to exalt seek recreate and contain his africanness rather than continuing to run away from it or to cover it with the appropriate french substitutes this new literary movement to which cesaire helped give birth started in when the parisian review published his cahier dun retour au pays natal journal of a return to my native country which has since been reissued in book form by presence africaine the journal and later poems gave impetus to what is now considered negritude but negritude itself the concept of goes back a little further to about and was called negrismo negrismo started in cuba and was as was negritude influenced by africa and all things african cubans as well as africans had grown up under the white ruling class which tried to destroy everything antiwhite antiwestern or anything remotely connected with africa negrismo grew rapidly and influenced such writers as the cuban poets ramon guirao and nicolas guillen and the puerto rican poet luis pales matos thus the frame of reference that the african and cuban writers used to work in has been established to bring the concept of negritude a little closer to home i refer you to leopold senghors definition negritude is the sum total of the values of the civilization of the african world it is not racialism it is culture it is the embracing and domination of a situation in order to apprehend the cosmos by process of coming to terms with it negritude as we had then begun to conceive and define it was a weapon of defense and attack and inspiration actually negritude is the sum total of black consciousness and when used is not only applicable to literature but to all forms of art eg painting sculpture dance music etc ezekiel mphahlele who most certainly is not a proponent of negritude relates this sumtotal feeling in his the african image it is rather the assimilated african who has absorbed french culture who is now passionately wanting to recapture his past in his poetry he extols his ancestors ancestoral mask african wood carvings and bronze art and tries to recover the moorings of his oral literature he clearly feels he has come to a deadend in european culture and is still not really accepted as an organic part of french society for all the assimilation he has been through as a result frenchspeaking african nationalists have become a personification of this strong revulsion i think that by lightly reviewing the idea of negritude it will enable us to better understand the thought and meaning of blackwriting how alike blackpeople in this country are to the assimilated frenchafricans however in our case the term assimilated can be substituted with the euphemism integrated blackwriting as we view it today is the result of centuries of slavery and forced alienation from africa and onesself weve been exiles in a strange land where our whole lifestyle repeatedly comes into contradiction after contradiction blackwriting to the afroamerican as is negritude to the frenchafrican is the antithesis to a decadent culture that has systematically over the centuries debased and dehumanized us with the fury and passion of an unfeeling computer literature produced by blackhands is not necessarily blackwriting what has to be embodied in blackwriting first and foremost is that consciousness which reflects the true black experience the true afroamerican experience written and related in a style indicative of that experience which may mean as i believe it does new forms and perhaps adaptiveness of present forms black consciousness in any case can be a conscious or an unconscious effort in blackwriting if one is black its very difficult to write otherwise although we must understand there will be a pervasive presence of every and anything that is indigenous to the afroamerican people blackart is a functional art its what the africans call a collective art our art is committed to humanism it commits the artist they commit him in a future which then becomes present for him an integral part of himself the blackwriterartisan works out a concrete situation which means that he commits not only himself but his race his geography his history as well he uses the materials that are at hand and the everyday things which make up the texture of his life rejecting the anecdotal for this does not commit because it is without significance blackart as is african art is perishable this too is why it is functional like a poem is written not to be read and put aside but to actually become a part of the giver and receiver to perform some function to move the emotions to become a part of the dance or to simply make one act whereas the work itself is perishable the style and spirit of the creation is maintained and is used to produce new works here we can clearly see that art for arts sake is something out of a shakespearian dream it does not exist all blackart is social art for peoples sake an example of good blackwriting now in existence is an anthology called black fire edited by leroi jones ameer baraha and larry neal morrow pp black fire includes between its jackets a convincing collection of afroamerican literature its contributors plus its editors move to define and to present a forceful concentration of blackwriting with essays poems short stories and plays this is not to say that every author represented in black fire has contributed a work of art in accordance with my standards but it is to say that every selection of work in black fire is significant significant in that i feel that the test of a good writerpoet is not necessarily in what he says or how he says it but in what his work does to us i mean does the writer widen us does he clear our vision does he add to a deepening of our knowledge does he amplify our total being the saturday review said of black fire the ambitions of black fire make it newsworthy and instructive but the disparity between its ambitions and its achievement is painful and embarrassing painful and embarrassing to whom certainly not to those who contributed to it certainly not to the blackpeople who read it not many at certainly not to me but yes painful and embarrassing to some white boy who teaches english at williams college in massachusetts and has in all likelihood only seen six negroes in his lifetime who feels that just because saturday review sends him the books to review its his responsibility to be painful and embarrassed about it quietasitskept it was supposed to be painful for him and vet this painful and embarrassing reviewer from williams college goes on to say that yet an irreverent reviewer could merely repeat larry neals own statement and say the text could be destroyed and no one would be hurt in the least by it he the saturday reviews black literature authority does not remotely understand what larry neal meant by that statement brother neal was working from an ideological concept so foreign so alien to the western mind that one wonders how such people as the reviewer continue to have such control over blackpeople brother neal was quite clearly talking about the perishability of blackart remember art for the peoples sake art being functional and social meaning that the people will help to shape the art not here forever but until its full meaning has been realized what we have to understand is that every piece of writing in black fire is legitimate regardless of excellence because as with the frenchafricans of negritude black writers are in a process of defining and legitimizing their own worthworks and we dont need the great white pens of the saturday review or other liberal white sheets to sanction what they feel is or is not black literature or literature period black fire helped us to move into our own direction james t stewart points out whats necessary the point of the whole thing is that we must emancipate our minds from western values and standards we must rid our minds of these values saying so will not be enough with that we can easily understand what a b spellman was relating when he wrote there is a school of young african painters who have never seen a european painting and who refuse to be shown one david llorens clears the air when in the fellah the chosen ones the guardian he writes perhaps the starting point is to look at ourselves finally to question our existence not only to question it but also to realize our existence but sister lethonia gee is hipped to a beautiful part of her existence as indicated in her poem by glistening dancing seas all art is the reflection of its creator look at new york city chicago washington d c need i say more where and what you live in reflects you if you created it art is totalbeing it cannot be separated from life thats why we say that blackart is not only social but political which leads larry neal to say the artist and the political activist are one they are both shapers of the future reality both understand and manipulate the collective myths of the race how else could a b spellman write lines like thisc run on home blackpeople the only way to be is to be and unlike the frenchafricans black writers are not trying to address themselves to white people senghor and others wrote firstly for the frenchman not for the african people black poetrywriting is written for toabout and around the livesspiritactionshumanism and total existence of blackpeople black writing in formsoundwordusageintonationrhythmrepetitiondirectiondefinition and beauty is opposed to that which is now and yesterday considered writing ie white literature black fire may not be read by many blackpeople in its present form hard cover edition because of the price anytime a book is more than thirtyfive cents to one dollar you are in trouble to buy a book that costs more would do harm to most black families daily budgets but if possible i suggest that you acquire a copy of black ire steal it borrow it or wait for it to appear in paperback hopefully we can as a people move toward a black printing company so that we will not have to continuously run to the establishment presses to be published finally this is u yrmomma yrhistory yrliterature them is u actually a beautiful reflection understood by u alone others will not our creations are ours no one can really take away yrinnerself if u have one people can napalm other people because they never felt the pain of flesh falling off ones body george washington is their hero because there is nothing better the mod squad and julia are forced upon u in prime tv time because that is their reality not ours the great white hope is just that the great white hope our heroes will be named willie bigger thomas blood pee wee and maniac and will come out of the projects and be hip to richard nixon and lyndon johnson because their fathers were hip to them and their fathers fathers fathers and on and on leroi jones said it anyone who wears shoes would do well to purchase a pair ride them to your nearest bookstore and invest the difference wisely dark symphony free press an anthology edited by james a emanuel and theodore l gross is a must for anyone who happens not to be an authority on black literature and no doubt the authorities few that they are have already added it to their libraries a total of black authors of whom are deceased are represented in the page book of short stories essays poetry and criticism the book is divided into four sections early literature the negro awakening major authors and contemporary literature not the least of its merits are the lucid informative introductions to three sections there is no introduction to major authors essaylike biographical sketches on the four selectees as major authors langston hughes richard wright ralph ellison and james baldwin provide perceptive commentary on their many works shorter biographical sketches are included in the case of each of the other contributors clearly the editors did not in this case request of the authors a contribution of their own choosing the editors did the selecting and they were selective and even though the reader might on occasion wish they had selected a different work by a particular writer he must appreciate their having for the most part provided insights into the reasoning that led to their choices included in early literature are works by charles w chesnutt whose first story was published in and whose racial identity was for some years not made public paul laurence dunbar the master of dialect who died in at the tender age of frederick douglass and w e b dubois one might in reading douglass letter to his master or rereading it as the case might be make certain connections between then and now nuances in his fierce pride remind this reader of current literary celebrant eldridge cleaver and more in this work by douglass there is unmistakably the sense that man achieves goodness by wanting the freedom of others a quality critics have cited in praising the existentialist novels of one john uodike the section is concluded ith a poem and a chapter from the souls of black folk by w e b dubois whose awakening was indeed early one agrees with the editors that no brief selection from his voluminous work could do justice to this man of the world but how schizoid the mind that would make such a recognition and yet omit him from inclusion in major authors or was that politicalas surely must have been the case as regards leroi jones who is represented in the section on contemporary literature by three poems the negro awakening includes the works of james weldon johnson alain locke claude mckav jean toomer rudolph fisher eric walrond sterling a brown and countee cullen it marks the period better known as the negro renaissance the s that era in which black writers came together in their separateness and dived into the literary seas only to come out to borrow a line from claude mckays baptism a stronger soul within a finer frame the scholarship of alain lockes the new negro and the singularly classic work of criticism by sterling a brown negro character as seen by white authors are outstanding in this section the excerpts from cane recently reissued by harper and row as a perennial classic reveal the extraordinary gift of jean toomer the man who so early deserted the naturalistic fiction and who had he not ceased writing most certainly would have contributed much to that deeper exploration of the consciousness psychic and cosmic ongoing in the literature of the past odd years flying home and king of the bingo game by ellison the man who killed a shadow by wright and baldwins sonnys blues are stories that speak for themselves the excellence of the late langston hughes is present in the form of five poems and two hilarious jesse b semple tales and for those who have stubbornly insisted that the literature of social protest was unconcerned with exploration of the ultimate questions hughes story on the road is a brilliant example of their folly in the middle of the depression which marks as well the time of the writing a black man in search of shelter from the cold and snow is felled by the cops the moment he succeeds in breaking down the door of a white church in his unconscious state he dreams dreams that the church comes falling down that christ comes off the cross well ill be dogged said sargent this heres the first time i ever seed you off the cross yes said christ crunching his feet in the snow you had to pull the church down to get me off the cross it is vintage hughes the ethics of living jim crow hidden name and complex fate and notes of a native son nonfictional works by wright ellison and baldwin respectively have in common their autobiographical natures and yet in a most interesting way serve as a reflection of just how diverse were the backgrounds that shaped the sensibilities of the three extraordinary artists contemporary literature features the works of albert murray john a williams paule marshall ernest j gaines william melvin kelley melvin b tolson arna bontemps robert e hayden dudley randall margaret a walker gwendolyn brooks james a emanuel mari evans leroi jones arthur p davis philip butcher nathan a scott jr and julian mayfield it is worth noting i think that the italicized authors contributions to black literature would include their having along with the writers of the early literature and the negro awakening profoundly influenced the others appearing in this final section space will not permit much comment on the works of the above but the short stories of gains and kelley are witness to exceptional talents julian mayfields essay into the mainstream and oblivion brings us into the day that is upon us a day one can hardly hope to comprehend while ignoring ones own writers and persisting in the belief that the prophets were whitedavid llorens it was fisk universitys fit acting president i james lawson v whose voice at the other end of the line asked how soon can you be here for a personal interview i fumbled the key to my office at oaklands merritt junior college between my anxious fingers realizing that relinquishing them would mark the end of my contracted services for the year straining my ear against the friday afternoon summer noises which seeped into the public telephone booth forming static and following the demands of long distance communication in terms of abrupt decision making i startled even myself by answering monday that is if thats agreeable it was with him going home and in a matter of a few days two decades stood between my alma mater and hometown and me for me it was a period of growth mobility turbulence and commitment and i presumed it to be not too different back home i now lived in the suburbs of san francisco bay area in an integrated neighborhood with my dentist husband and five children we wore the badge of acceptance for having made it in the good old american freeenterprising mainstream tradition but already my third teenager to graduate from the local high school in as many years was saying forget it im tired of being exotic a museum piece the social integrator i choose a negro collegeone of those in nashville i pointed out to the young ones the fact that they could very well be sentimentalizing the southern situation since unlike me they had not grown uo in a segregated environment still failing to dampen their enthusiasm i reminded them that nashville was the home that i had been orphaned from and not them they checked me with you better know it for two years i had worked as a parttime instructor in two junior colleges one of these was a nearly allwhite suburban tomorrowlandtype institution the other a ghettofringed urban yesteryear model with over black students having asked myself a few questions such as to whom did i owe my allegiance where were my teaching skills most needed which situation offered the greater reward in humanistic rather than materialistic terms even as i noted the leaded nature of them i knew the proper answer perhaps i always knew it just as most black intellectuals have known it factors such as the vast difference between the two plantsboth of whom i supported through taxesthe aura of academic freedom and exploration which seemed far more prevalent in one the huge investment in terms of personal involvement and extra curricular time which one demanded in order to meet the communitys needs succeeded in clouding the real issue but i had already returned the shiny new key to my office in the suburban school and was ghettobound when i heard that fisk was in need of english teachers black ones and then there was stanford camerons exhortation in the may negro digest come home black intellectuals before its too late you cant go home again seems closer to the truth according to my own personal experience john o killens writerinresidence at fisk has identified the problem of the century and the main job of the black revolution as that of the deniggerization of the world and when he points out that minds enslaved with words must be freed with words it seems he offers a direct challenge to black language arts experts who should play key roles in liberating black consciousness if indeed the midtwentieth century is a world given over to racism the negro college campus is apt to be strategically the seat of neocolonial rule the english department which requires that every student come through its portals for a stamp of approval and a ticket of eligibility in pursuit of academic degrees must be the focal point of conditioning the mind of the negro to accept his role in a racist world if this is true a university such as fiskwith nine of the teachers in the english department white including the past chairman and interim chairmandoes not give any indication of the white mans conditioning of black minds cracking at the seams in fact the disproportion of white to negro teachers would suggest reinforcement of the traditional pattern and should assure the power structure that the seams are uptight going home then is a twoway road and must be paved with good intentions by all parties concerned the total black community of the usa has been duped by institutionalized brainwashing in the schools churches yes even the homes and historical conditioning toward an acceptance of a status of dehumanization and deprivation spiritual social if not actually physical the total white community is diseased with racial delusionsinstitutionalized in the same ways through myth and deed sanctioned by religious creed and lawthereby rendering it incompetent to deal with a democratic nonracist world body in a healthy way our educational institutions reflect the american dilemma in a stark mirror image there are many black intellectuals such as j herman blake negro digest march from the university of california berkeley who see rampant racism at one of americas great universities who sees the institution as an intellectual microcosm of america who sees these campuses for what they arehideous for white draft dodgers exploiters of the scholarship racket racist snobs who use the campuses as country clubs and sports arenas there are many black intellectuals who are disenchanted with the great northern and western colleges and universities where in the spirit of the democratic tradition they have been hired out by the rent a negro agency for the instant integrated look what are his alternatives are the negro colleges and universities ready for him or are they engaged in a historical sweep marked by a headlong rush down the sellout road to integration or intellectual and scholastic extermination of the black man an example which might point out the fallacy of this thinking is that at a time when the ratio of negro dentists to the negro population is at a crisis low level around percent of the entering freshmen at the dental college of meharry medical college one of the twc negro medical colleges were white students are educational institutions faced with the task of educating black people committed to the task which should be within their special province while northern schools are crying out for teachers with a specialty in motivating and educating the culturally divergent child is the negro university training its student teachers to meet this demand the northern and western college having admitted to the historical distortions which have created the american image in all its unreality is now seeking teachers who are aware of the inclusivity of americas heritage are the negro universities teaching contemporary american literature which includes the contributions which have been categorically excluded from mainstream anthologies because it represented black art do they offer courses in revisionist history revolutionary black sociology afroamerican culture anc humanities black art and life political science in the black community black students at many of the california colleges and universities are demanding a black curriculum as a specialty in the black studies department which will ultimately offer a degree and a new career field this of course enables the student so trained to be a more effective worker in community action programs involving minorities does the negro campus provide an atmosphere for innovative programs and a laboratory for testing new methodology the black intellectual must be willing to choose a position which offers more in humanistic rewards than materialistic gains his role as a missionary if he must assume that role at this time must be played out with black principals as supporting members of his cast and on location in the black ghettoes across the land being whiteworld missionaries spreads us too thin and dissipates our energies without the benefits of making racial gains ambition must be tempered with compassion and concern for the black brother on the other hand the black communities wherever they exist must prepare for this second coming they must prepare the way for him this time around he should be the welcomed guest and not the intruder they must lay the groundwork which will result in an acceptance of him in the same good faith as he accepts the challenge the educational institutions must have no doubts about his belonging about the role he is destined to play in reconstructing a healthy american society above all it must be made clear that the black intellectual is not suspect rather the total society is suspect the total academic environment is suspect he has learned his lesson once he has achieved at great odds he has proven it can be done and that he can do it and having accepted the challenge he indicates a willingness to do it again success breeds success he becomes by example hope for the black student he must be kept comfortable in his blackness in order to impart selfassuredness to his students and most important the black student must want the black intellectual back home he must make him feel at ease must make him believe in himself and in his decision to come back where its at the student must enter a partnership with the intellectual to start the wheels of meaningful education grinding at a new alltime high a recordbreaking pace black students must understand that when adam clayton powell admonished the graduating class at howard university to seek audacious power and thereby ushered in the age of black_power he called for a black renaissance resurrected black creativity in all disciplines a rededication toward building black institutions of splendid achievement with intellectual excitement dynamic creativity humanistic idealism none of these can be achieved without black scholars who have key roles in developing this idea from dream to reality this is a reality with a future it is one which can act as a serum to cure the diseases which wittingly or not halfhearted integration attempts have brought to the black communityintellectual mediocrity economic inferiority political subservience going home can and should be a beautiful thing for as adam clayton powell points out we are the last revolutionaries in americathe last transfusion of freedom into the bloodstream of democracy because we are we must mobilize our wintry discontent to transform the cold heart and white face of this nation this is going to be a jjf r somewhat personal ac i count of my experiences baching in a rural black college in the south it is not written in bitterness i liked the school especially the students i enjoyed teaching them i liked my fellow teachers i even liked the administrators and it was great living in the country after escaping from the din and clatter of clashing delusions of grandeur in new york city my connection with the college was an act of desperation on both sides they were desperate because their history teacher suddenly resigned at midsemester and they couldnt find anyone else i was desperate for more complicated reasons ever since i was years old i had belonged to the selfrighteous left to those who felt that because they subscribed to certain beliefs they were automatically wise virtuous and destined to play an earthshaking role in the world i had married into the faith and all my social ties were with fellow believers naturally we talked to ourselves and each other reinforcing our mutual delusions now the only world i knew or could easily function in as the white mother of black kids was shattered i had gone through a sudden perception change it is not easy to describe i suddenly saw people and their interactions in a new way everyone seemed to be wearing a mask and these masks were telling themselves and each other lies the masks were cold and unemotional there was at the same time intense emotional nonverbal communication going on which i was directly perceiving but the nonverbal communication between myself and others was different there was something which i can only describe as spirit which shook them leapt into their eyes flashed there for a moment like a desperate prisoner begging to be freed and then disappeared no one had slipped me any acid i knew nothing about mysticism id been an atheist since i was so there were limited ways for me to interpret all this first i asked myself do other people perceive the way i perceive now or do they perceive the way i used to perceive i watched them for a while and concluded that they only perceive the lying masks but they do not know that they are lying the masks were the limits of their consciousness and their only way of knowing what goes on in the world is what the masks tell each other no one else whom i could observe was perceiving like me the lying masks were interacting with each other and arriving at a concensus which they accepted as reality and people were acting on the basis of this consensus my impression was that very little of what existed in the real world got past the masks i concluded that either i was crazy and they were all sane or i was sane and they were all crazy i had no wav of knowing for sure so i decided to test it out while being very careful not to say or do anything that would get me locked up i would operate on the basis of the reality which i perceived and observe others operating upon the basis of the reality which they perceived and see whose reality was more reliable i found myself back in new york in among familiar places and people really perceiving them all for the first time i couldnt play their games anymore i longed desperately to escape from the circles i had always moved in and to try out my new perceptions on the world out there i went to the college for the interview the president explained to me that they had only been hiring white teachers for a year the board was afraid that any white teacher who would come there would be a communist they hired chinese and east indians but alas they couldnt get enough teachers of any race and finally the board permitted him to hire a few whites he asked me is there anything you have to tell me i might as well know it now yes there is my kids are black are they adopted no theyre my natural children i have some relatives who look as white as you do i have often been taken for a creole im from new orleans i speak french whatever i say around here reaches all ears i could say have you met our new creole history teacher from new orleans thats fine with me when you get your drivers license be sure they get the race right all the teachers except one believed it some of them even began to comment that i was a typical creole type one of the teachers from new orleans asked me where i had lived and i told him the seventh ward which is a very mixedup place i invited a creole friend to visit me and introduced her as my cousin the teachers were convinced but not the students they werent fooled they knew i was a foreigner a gi bride there were debates about me in the dormitories shes irishno shes german no shes italian i showed them my passport to prove that i was born in new orleans they still didnt believe me why do you think im a foreigner i dont have an accent no but you dont act like an american teaching was hard work i had a heavy load i had never taught before and was teaching subjects i hadnt studied in years on one days notice my first minutes in a classroom were memorable i looked down at the faces puzzled to the point of panic their pencils poised above their notebooks not knowing what to write finally i read the same expression on every face what in the hell is this woman talking about i stopped you dont understand what im saying do you they all shook their heads no ok lets start over we spent a lot of time on words words were concepts and once they had a word they understood a lot of things once i used the word paternalism and no one knew what that meant i explained paternalism is when somebody makes you do what they want you to do by acting niceand you better do it or else the students had been taught to obey to learn by rote they couldnt understand why i objected to their quoting the textbook word for word on their exams i didnt copy it i memorized it they were used to the teacher giving them all the questions and all the pat answers to the questions once we discussed a question in class and i closed the discussion without giving them an answer they were disturbed but whats the answer whats the answer there isnt any answer i replied they laughed they had never heard of such a thing most of the students were from the immediate area they were from very poor families with lots of kids they were patient and longsuffering the campus was like a prison it was several miles out of town and there was no public transportation girls were expelled for riding in boys cars the girls had to be in their rooms by pm they couldnt even sit on the porch even in the summer the girls dorm had iron bars on the windows the presidents dogs were released from their kennel to roam the campus at night the teachers favorite topic of conversation was the students how stupid and ignorant they were the students dont count at all said a not very scholarly teacher a university is a community of scholars it exists for the sake of the teachers the school was desperate for phds and the degree seemed to be all important the chairman of my department was an east indian who had just gotten his doctorate from nyu he had never taught knew nothing about this country planned to return to india and enter politics shortly and was very status conscious he pretended not to know his black colleagues when they met off campus then there were several elderly chinese refugees the students couldnt understand their english they cared nothing about the students they let them cheat openly on exams because they didnt want to bother stopping them students were eager to get into their classes because they gave good grades and expected nothing from the students although it was a state college they had something called religious emphasis week this consisted of sermons in which the social order was thoroughly identified with god the students were exhorted to feel eternally grateful for the opportunity to get a college education although i dont think that is a good description of what they were getting right after religious emphasis week we had a class discussion on a statement by napoleon to the effect that the only way to make the poor and downtrodden submit to their lot here on earth is to promise them rewards in the hereafter one of the students thought napoleon had something there the other students indignantly stared her down many of the teachers complained about the students lack of spontaneity they never smile they never show a spark of life after a while we had to close the windows and doors in my class because the discussions were getting so animated when one of my students said i dont know why we should be grateful to lincoln for freeing us he only did it because he had to i thought i had it made there were a handful of students from the outside world most of them on athletic scholarships one student a basketball player from indiana was determinedly hostile to me and influenced the class the day malcolm was killed we both found ourselves explaining to the class who malcolm was one of the students said didnt malcolm preach hate we both answered together malcolm didnt preach hate before the term was over the basketball player was carrying my books to class arent you afraid the students will make fun of you i dont care anything about that he said most of the students were from tobacco farms but the college was in a lumbering area the family that owned the lumber mill owned the town and everyone in it they wouldnt allow an antipoverty program in the area because they didnt want any interference with their cheap help but the college did have funds for student jobs which teachers were given the right to distribute among their favorites the college community was a weird world of makebelieve there were teachers at that school who had worked there for years and had never been to town they didnt even know where main street was these were the teachers most likely to talk about what a lovely advanced progressive town it was how important the college was to the town and how much the black teachers were esteemed by the community i soon discovered that the only way to maintain these fantasies of prestige power and status in relation to the town was indeed not to go there black phds would find themselves addressed by their first names by white store clerks my kids and i were nearly assaulted for trying to buy a takeout pizza from a white restaurant when i told my fellow teachers about it i was advised not to file a complaint if i wanted to keep my job late spring and early summer was harvest time on the nearby truck farms migrant workers arrived from florida on open trucks some of my students told me they had hidden migrant workers who were trying to escape from the camps as time passed recruiting of workers to get in the crops became aggressive students were stopped on the streets recruiters approached small children one morning at oclock i found my nineyearold son dressed and ready to pick corn for a day i had a hard time stopping him the children told me about conditions in the fields they had to look out for the tractors the tractors didnt look out for them it was swampy country and there were poisonous snakes the children were transported on the backs of open trucks three small boys had been killed on the highway the year before the children seemed to be frightened they would come and tell me when they were beaten up i would ask if they told their parents they always said they wont do anything about it i didnt know what to tell them i couldnt do anything about it either one little boy with terror in his eyes was mute my son tried to teach him to speak the ku klux klan was very active in the area and they would hold silent demonstrations lines of cars with confederate plates would parade slowly down main street blowing their horns i got worried about my kids we lived on the campus my son went to school right across the street i told him to keep away from white people especially people with confederate plates on their car he paid me no mind hed bring white boys on the campus to play with him once he told me mom you were wrong about those people with confederate plates on their car i made friends with some of them i went to their house they were very nice kids can make you feel humble sometimes the campus was like an island after i had been there for a week it was hard to remember any other world everything was provided by the school credit was opened up for me in town i rented my house from the school i got my meals from the school but there was no paycheck the first two months i worked there if i needed a few bucks i had to go ask the president to please give me an advance on my salary i was afraid i would be like the sharecropper with his bales of cotton when payday came i thought they would say you owe us i finally worked up to getting paid every month its an isolated ingrown community the teachers each live in their own little world and are afraid to talk to each other they treat each other with the greatest formal respect perhaps to compensate for the lack of respect they receive outside no one is on a firstname basis with his colleagues it is always mr mrs or best of all dr the teachers have absolute power over the students the administration has absolute power over the teachers the local policeman has absolute power over the administration and as the true cliche goes power corrupts some of the students were conditioned to corruption around final exam time some of the girls offered to clean my house and couldnt understand why i refused students complained to me about teachers flunking students who rejected their advancesas if i could do anything about it at the end of the semester i heard that a teacher with tenure was fired for no apparent reason before the summer was over i was fired although i had a contract to teach the next year because a young man who was my friend had registered for summer school no one at the college objected but the local policeman told the president to fire me which he did with much guilty selfrighteous indignation i knew it hurt to be reminded that when it comes down to it the local policeman runs the school i had no hard feelings about being fired what i did object to was the effort to stop me from securing employment elsewhere stating that i was fired for violation of ethical codes and customs which are expected for membership in the college community here which really sounds awful and concluding by i hope for you and yours the best of everything that reminds me of bob dylan theyll stone you then theyll wish you good luck the american association of university professors asked for four months salary for me for breach of contract i never got it i suppose the local policeman would not allow it i was blacklisted all the way to detroit i was hired as a substitute teacher in the detroit public schools and then told that some of the committee members on further discussion had changed their vote a secret memorandum a copy of which some kind anonymous soul at the school board mailed to me stated it would be our strong recommendation that mrs hall not be hired in any capacity by the detroit board of education this opinion is based on her lack of judgment and general background for working in our schools memorandum from gladys v hamilton to miss malorney dated dec file no approved by julie strwn adm asst robt le anderson this officiallyapproved blacklist did not stop albert schiff from writing me on jan suggesting that i complete more courses and reapply for employment with the detroit public schools i was informed by the american association of university professors that there were other complaints about blacklisting emanating from the same school their approach is resign thereby voluntarily renouncing your contract rights or they will do their best to see that you never get a job again i was fortunate because i am also a legal secretary and we got by on that for a while and since i couldnt get a job i went back to school and learned fellowships ill have my doctorate in history from the university of michigan in a few months most teachers in black colleges arent so lucky they cant type i am making this modest contribution to the discussion of the black university in the hope that some effort will be made to raise the degraded position of teachers in rural black colleges to something approaching national standards they are treated like serfs they feel like they are serfs and in fact they are serfs still they are in a better position to change the situation than are the students if the teachers were well organized and got support from professional organizations from the outside i dont know yet whose reality works but it sure is interesting finding out in special issue of the negro digest devoted to a considerauon of the black uni versity concept you editorialized that something is gravely wrong with the conventional approach to the education of black children no longer is arguable much of the problem of course is general there is something gravely wrong with american education period however as always in a society whichbeing racist by nature assigns opportunities and rewards according to race and color those people suffer most who are regarded least and those people in the american society are black people the general validity of this observation should not be a bar to repetitive assertions until all those who are responsible for and involved in education at whatever level in our country not only recognize the deficiencies in our total educational system but are engaged upon meaningful programs to correct what needs to be corrected the important question is how can the system best be changed for black children and young adults in the united states this question takes on some particular connotations since the traditionally or predominantly black colleges and universities have borne the brunt of the responsibility for educating the black leadership of this country many of these schools have compared favorably and still do with other schools of similar size with more resources and stronger faculties in many instances these largely segregated schools did superior jobs with their studentproducts despite the problems inherent in black higher education not the least of these problems being the necessity for combatting and remedying the deficiencies of our general educational system so far as black students were concerned the increasingly complex nature of our society and government beginning with the great depression of the s the technological advances which began with the necessity for a more efficient war machine during the s the acceleration of these developments following the launching of sputnik i in and the ensuing age of cybernation have effected basic changes in our society these changesinvolving environmental conditions manpower requirements and individual and societal attitudeshave created new challenges and opportunities for all segments of our society these challenges and opportunities demand a fundamental and continuing reappraisal of courses of study in institutions of higher education it occurs to me that the necessity for a changed role for the predominantly or traditionally black colleges and universities must be viewed at least partially within this context this suggests an awesomely dual responsibility for the predominantly or traditionally black schools of higher educationie a relevance and validity with regard to black students and black communities and a relevance and validity with regard to the society in which black students and black communities will exist inherent in both responsibilities is the necessity for preparing students to meet the challenges of change in todays and tomorrows world and with respect to both responsibilities the overriding consideration should and must be to give these students that education and training sought after in todays and tomorrows labor market essentially then the education of black americans must encompass at least three objectivesie an increased awareness and knowledge of their heritage and of the contributions they have made throughout history a motivation and ability to render muchneeded assistance and services of various kinds to the total black community and the development of knowledge and skills necessary for gainful employment and satisfactory living in the larger everchanging society in terms of what is necessary for sustained upward economic and social mobility of black americans i think it meaningless if not dangerous to attempt to assign priorities as between these three objectives they are all necessary moreover they constitute the basis for the continuing validity and relevance of predominantly or traditionally black institutions of higher learning these considerations dictate some rather basic modifications in the curricula of our colleges and universities modifications which involve new directions new and different courses and innovatively different techniques and methodologies of instruction moreover there is the necessity for relating our curricula and campus activities more definitively and directly to the needs of the communities of which we are a part none of this will be easy but all is possible with varying degrees of ease or difficulty dependent upon conditions pertaining to particular colleges or universities at fisk we are attempting to meet the challenges represented by the need and desire for black identity dignity and status on the one hand and by the new career opportunities for black college graduates on the other regarding the former we have instituted courses in africancaribbean studies the fine arts literature history race relations sociology and anthropology which focus on contributions problems and developments of black people regarding the latter for example we are in the process of establishing an ambitious program in business administration which will prepare students who choose this area of study for promising employment immediately upon graduation as well as for graduate study in the field we are cognizant of the need to do even more to meet the twin challenges above and are continually alert to the opportunities for doing more we are convinced however that meeting the first challenge should represent a supplement to and enrichment of our basic program and our efforts to meet the second challenge the idea of a black university is not clear to me i hear some advocates say that they want a black university large enough to enroll ten thousand students they mean a new creation this would be a very expensive enterprise if half of the students lived in dormitories cost for the construction of dormitories alone could be easily or million dollars the academic plant to accommodate ten thousand students would cost another or million dollars and this is a conservative estimate such a plant could cost between and million dollars if money of this magnitude is to be gotten from the negro community we can forget it the negroes record of supporting higher education leads me to predict that black people would never give that amount of money if the negroes educational efforts were all centered in this one university and they might be able to get the money from black people who could get them united to give it do the advocates of a single black university expect to get the money from white people white support of negro educational institutions over the past hundred years has been niggardly what would lead one to believe that white philanthropy would be more generous in its giving to a black university than it has been in giving to predominantly negro colleges it should be made crystal clear what is meant by a black university how much of the curriculum would be devoted to afroamerican people how much of the curriculum would be devoted to disciplines other than afroamerican studies would the faculty be all black would the student body be all black if white faculty and white students are excluded do we expect socalled white colleges and universities to exclude all black scholars and black students would the supreme court permit this kind of segregation do we mean by black universities regional centers of institutions that are already in existence as one writer in the march negro digest advocates if we mean regional black colleges and universities the question of the complexion of the faculty and student body must still be asked and answered frankly i do not believe we need to build a new black university in order to get what i think we need nor do i believe we need to concentrate on a few colleges and universities in certain centers of the united states in order to get what we need and must have i believe that there could and should be established in every negro or black college in the united states a division of afroamerican studies which would concentrate on the black mans history and all that he has contributed to the arts and sciences literature and art sports and drama politics and business i believe existing institutions can do this including the institutions that call themselves white this is not enough i have always believed that negro or black colleges should be deeply concerned with and deeply involved in the life of the black community instead of training negroes to get away from the poor and the ghettos they should be trained to help improve the conditions of black people so that the gap between all ciasses of negroes will be narrowed or eliminated there are six million college and university students enrolled in institutions of higher education of which or not more than four percent are black certainly not more than or five percent are black a single black university of would be a mere drop in the bucket but if all institutions of higher learning tackled the problem of black identity through the teaching of afroamerican history and through training to help improve the conditions of less privileged black people we could do now what has been neglected for a hundred years negro students are ready for it now years ago when dr carter g woodson the eminent negro historian was trying to get black students to appreciate themselves and africa he didnt have much success and let me say with emphasis that to get this done we do not have to become racists and drive out all white teachers and all white students with government industry and white institutions pulling black scholars apart to get them there just arent enough black scholars to go around although i can appreciate the current emphasis on blackness and the much discussed black university i am mighty glad that i didnt have to wait years for someone in the late s to teach me to appreciate being what i am black my mother unlettered and untutored did say many times to her children you are as good as anybody this was helpful to me although the white world did not accept my mothers philosophy my heroes were black in my native south carolina fairly often some negro would come along selling pictures or pamphlets of a few negro leaders and pictures of fred douglass booker t washington and paul laurence dunbar hung on our walls in my high school days booker t washington meant more to me than george washington frederick douglass the unyielding negro abolitionist was more of a hero to me than william lloyd garrison the fanatic white abolitionist dunbar as a poet inspired me more than longfellow i heard about crispus attucks and was thrilled the negroes in the south carolina legislature during reconstruction and in the postreconstruction years were men who were held up to us in high school history classes as being great men and not the negrohating ben r tillman and his kind i had identity the thrust now is toward black identity and i have no quarrel with those who advocate it fortunately i have always had black identity the emphasis that the f i young blacks have j ii placed upon the discovery and promulgation of the truth about the afroamerican community is refreshing for so many years the vast majority of us have been in such hot pursuit of the norms of the majority culture that we haveperhaps unwittinglyforsaken our own identity and assumed a false superego that leaves us fragmented persons i say the vast majority this is by no means true of all blacks in i had to take negro history as a requirement for the a b at virginia union university in i had to take negro literature to graduate all the way from phyllis wheatley to margaret walker moreover when in college we wired fred waring and asked him to include our alma mater on his saturday medley of college songs he did judge earl dearing of louisville and i signed the telegram in the fall of indeed some of us have been proud aware conscious and black for a long long time we find it appalling that black students lump all middle class blacks negroes in one ball and condemn them all as spineless accommodationists this is false and arrogant notwithstanding the charge applies to enough to make it valid and because there is a sufficient void in the knowledge and appreciation of the history of american blacks it is understandable that there is a call for a black university since there have been white universities for so long and all other kinds of de facto separate universities serving ethnic and demographic units it is time for blacks to cry out rather recently the jews established brandeis and expanded yeshiva by adding a coed undergraduate program catholics never entrusted higher or lower education to the majority if jews and catholics regard their traditions as sufficiently precious to preserve them in their own schools a black university makes sense the lutherans too what is st olafs moreover public colleges located in pockets of cultural homogeneity have in fact been conduits of a continuity of mores and attitudeseg ole miss lsu georgia tech vmi and the citadel blacks still feel like aliens on these campuses yet a black university faces some very practical problems that may indicate another answer who would finance such an enterprise the idea of racial separation has already fallen on evil days because it has been associated with violence somehow it has not enjoyed a positive affirmative connotation it has been associated with the riots and four letter words this is an awful casualty it is an idea that should be debated on its own merits i cannot see the sponsorship for such an idea forthcoming but the idea need not die aborning a black university is more imminent than many imagine if the concepts of violence and negative chauvinism can be strained out only nine months of planning could accomplish what most have in mind for a black universitv at atlanta fisk or howard since there is no black math chemistry biology or physics what we are talking about is an orientation in history literature social science psychology fine arts and education that is black it means viewing these disciplines from the perspective of a black student standing body deep soul deep in his own culture this implies no hostility no separatism no alienation it could imply a disciplined scholarship that will unearth truths long hidden a bona fide experience of the thought and feelings of black writers painters and musicians a construction of social theories that will have an authenticity for black people the most dramatic results could be seen in teacher education hardly any school does justice to the challenge of the black pupil in its teacher education program but even that would not be enough every university every college should recognize the neglect of black facts and begin to institute programs in black studies interdisciplinary and scholarly there are asian studies indian studies urban studies mexican studies and space studies all sorts of studies black studies can be added with no vast shift in administrative machinery and indeed many are doing just that a third alternative is perhaps more useful the location of city county and state community colleges should take into account the concentration of blacks in the cities centers the appointment of imaginative presidents hustling deans and teachers with common sense to head and run community colleges in the cities centers could turn these opportunities to great benefit for black people an honest relevant curriculum would accomplish again what most of us sense as the mission of a black university the sanguine expectation that a wellfinanced completely autonomous black university can be founded and supported is a forlorn one i fear fine if it can be really good and not makeshift this is too late for another crude botchy handtomouth college to be started otherwise let substantial ongoing private black schools those who have the vision and the freedom convert their present pursuit of western civ to an understanding of man through the eyes of black people let the major public and private institutions embrace the cause of black discovery and let public community colleges in the urban core look around them and act accordingly with integrity and enthusiasm the march edition nr of negro digest on the black university celebrates a significant turning point in the history of american race relations taken together the articles in that edition constitute the most compact statement extant of the quest on the part of young black intellectuals for selfdefinition in the realm of educational theory and technique confronted with the intractable facts of history and culture an apparently growing number of black thinkers reopened with fresh intensity the old debate regarding the purpose and strategy of education for black americans disillusioned with both the conceptual depth of integration as an intellectual construct and with its slow growth as a social reality increasing attention is now being given to the internal dynamics of the black community itself whether this refocusing of vision will aid the struggle for black freedom will depend very heavily on just how faithful it is to the regimen of fact and logic in the black community for this community is not the simple phenomenon that many white and some black writers have taken it to be carter g woodson very aptly asserted in his book the miseducation of the negro that the negro community suffers for lack of delimitation because of the various ramifications of life in the united states the negro community in a sense is composed of those around you but it functions in a different way you cannot see it by merely looking out of the window of the school room this community requires scientific investigation similarly the black college is a complex datum requiring the disciplined approaches of sound theory technique and insight if the realities of its past the dynamics of its present and the promise of its future are to be accurately gauged whether we like it or not what has always beenand what will likely continue to beof critical importance are the interconnections of the black college with the world around it the white world as well as the black world a fundamental assumption of this article is that no important institution within any communitywhite or blackcan be adequately understood through a process of violent abstraction from the setting in which it moves and lives and has its being the article by j herman blake on the black university and its community gives us valuable information about some of the socioeconomic changes now occurring within the black community particularly in terms of the northward and cityward movement of black people and in terms of changes in occupational roles and income levels of black males and females some of these are rather wellknown facts that the majority of black americans now live in the central cities of metropolitan areas that despite higher levels of education the employment situation of black people has changed little from the last hired first fired status that the black female has a better chance of obtaining a job consistent with her education and training than the black male in the professional technical and managerial categories while the black males are more likely than females to be adequately represented in clerical positions that the relative situation for the black man improved between and while the absolute situation declined that the absolute and relative situation of middleincome blacks is getting better and that of lowincome blacks is getting worse these are all important and interesting data but what is their significance for educational mission and strategy the question is not answered directly but answers are sometimes implied and sometimes inherent in the conceptual description of the black university provided by the other contributors to the edition all of the writers assume the absolutely critical importance of transforming the predominantly negro college into a meaningful and relevant instrument of social change the article by darwin turner is by far the wisest and most reasoned description of the total scope of problems and possibilities to be considered whether because of distinct definitions of tasks or for some other reason his is the only article which treats the black university contextually in terms of the hard facts of financing policymaking faculty recruitment and administration as well as in terms of the currently more popular dimensions of curriculum development and public service it is interesting to note that in view of the fact that so many black students today get much of their emotional and intellectual fuel from black and third world oriented thinkers not a single word of the entire edition is addressed to the issue of roles for student involvement in the black university one of the major constituencies of any college and one of the most important bearers of an ethical vocation in history today are students precisely because of their selfconceptions as significant agents of social changea selfimage in the most serious need of careful scrutinyno concept of the prophetic social role of the black university mcworter is complete without dealing in a large way with students if a summary of the arguments can be attempted the authors seem to be saying that somewhere near the heart of the problems confronting the black community is what carter g woodson called the miseducation of the negro this miseducation consists principally in the education of black scholars to feel contempt for themselves and for the black community by failing to confront them with adequate knowledge about themselves both to counter white stereotypes and to bolster their selfconfidence the negro colleges have also failed to develop meaningful helping relationships between black scholars and the balck community accustomed to facile imitations of white middle class life styles negro colleges have failed to plumb the depths of the black experience thus stephen henderson underlines the contention that in the search for identity the black experience is not only relevant it is fundamental and crucial a strengthened sense of identity will produce not only a black university which serves the black american community it will create the indispensable precondition for new linkages with the entire third world a unique internationalism will be created in which according to vincent harding the uniqueness of our approach to the world would be found in our vision through an unashamedly black oriented prism in the academic program and in a hundred other less structured ways the black university would seek to explore celebrate and record the experience of the nonwestern world similarly gerald mcworter views as a key component of the very meaning of blackness the affirmation of an identity independent of the historical human evils of modern nation states the significant problem encountered here is not adequately stated in terms of the simply dichotemy of integration versus separatism the real question is whether this statement of mission and strategy does justice to the facts and the logic of the very black experience it claims to celebrate this writer has no quarrel with the objectives of a black university which seeks to serve the needs of the black community nor with the concern for more adequate study and dramatization of events in the black experience nor with the desire to create unquestionably intelligent and competent centers of learning for black people nonetheless as is well known agreement on specific objectives and even on particular tactical points does not necessarily mean agreement on underlying issues embedded in the strategy itself this writer wishes to focus on but one of such issues with the hope of clarifying some of the strategic questions raised the issue can be introduced by raising a question regarding in exactly what ways does the black ex perience address the problem of racism encountered by the black community in the areas of housing and employment for example what curricular expression of the black experience would relate the black university more effectively to the black community is the creation of a black consciousness in the minds and hearts of black people more important than assisting them with their daily struggle for survival are the two problems the same thing anyone familiar with the long and often bitter struggle in our colleges and universities not only to get black studies but a particular ideological brand of black studies will know that these are not trivial questions in a footnote to a widely talked about but seldom read volume frantz fanon makes an important observation about the decision of the president of senegal to include the study of the idea of negroism in the curriculum if this decision was due to an anxiety to study historical causes no one can criticize it but if on the other hand it was taken in order to create black selfconsciousness it is simply a turning of his back upon history the point fanon is making is that the people are helped not by excessive investments in the study of the peoples culture but by addressing current problems felt by the people of the four authors who discuss the curriculum of the black university three of them mcworter henderson and harding seem to give clear priority to the humanistic sciences henderson is quite explicit that such a university would almost by definition involve chiefly those disciplines which are humancentered ie the social sciences the behavioral sciences literature art and the like moreover the faculty of the university would be staffed with black humanists and specialists in blackness and although he says that the nonhumanistic sciences should have an honored place in the curriculum it is obvious where the resources of such a university would be invested i want to state the strongest possible disagreement with this bifurcation of the black experience it is the logical outcome of a narrow conception of black identity which if actually pursued would isolate the black university even further than some of these same authors say it is today from the black community if as stokely carmichael and charles hamilton persuasively argue the process of political modernization must take place in both the black and white communities in order to treat adequately the problems of racism then a black university which invests a preponderance of its resources in black humanistic studies is seriously disadvantaged in its intentions to help and that prepares them to deal effectively with that world is a basic fact to people in every black community in this land parochial programs of black studies based on uncritical concepts of black identity will not help either our students or these desperately hungry communities such narrowly conceived programs may help some professors and politicians and not a few students talk about helping oppressed people get in by any means necessary to do it right now but such violent discourse only helps the ego of the speaker for that is not political language that is the language of insurrection and it is both misleading and dishonest unless such spokesmen have both the readiness and the capacity to carry forward the action implied if the black university is truly to become the serviceoriented center of research and action that vincent harding desires if it is to use his words to set up skills banks for developing nations and urge those students who do not return to the black american communities to offer their skills to africa latin america and wherever else they are needed then it will clearly have to give the nonhumanistic sciences of mathematics statistics accounting engineering physics et al a very great deal of support such a university would not be able to afford to invest all or even the majority of its resources in humanistic programs there is no reason why such disciplines cannot be construed as within the programs of black studies it is the purpose and strategy of a uinversity which defines its being black studies can be taught for the purpose of condescending to or patronizing black people as darwin turner observed in his article by the same token nonblack courses can be taught for the purpose of helping black people both at home and abroad a functional black university will strive to engage in the kind of teaching and research and public service which provides people with the disciplines of thought and action by which they can mature as persons and help shape the world into a more human place of habitation the irremediable blackness of afroamericans would be accepted both as a fact of life and as a positive value but it would not restrict the experience of black identity to the immediacies of skinassociated cultural values the black experience is one crucible in which we work our way to a vision of and a connection with the human potential in all men a final word by way of illustration ralph ellison has complained that his awardwinning novel invisible man is often misread to imply that it was the blackness of skin of the hero which made him invisible to white americans instead says ellison the heros invisibility is not a matter of being seen but a refusal to run the risk of his own humanity which involves guilt this is not an attack upon white society it is what the hero refuses to do in each section which leads to further action he must assert and achieve his own humanity he cannot run with the pack and do this a functional black university will see the need for instruction in the disciplines of personal moral responsibility as well as in the techniques of social action asserting and achieving ones humanity means that black people are not exempted from the universal human need to develop a personal idiom as well as a group style black people too need the art of transforming and transcending even the materials and patterns of black culture we cannot run with the pack and do this whether the pack is white or black in the words of the spiritual you got to walk this lonesome valley by yourself confronted with a book like how we live contemporary life in contemporary fiction the inclination is to shrug throw it aside and proceed to something more relevant and instructive for black people the time has long since passed when black people should waste their energies challenging the racist assumptions at the base of such books there is much work to be done the task of turning the attention of black people away from the integrationist lures which are allpervasive and toward the possibilities inherent in submergence in their own history and culture is monumental it is obviously wasteful to debate the racists andworse recognizing them merely feeds their arrogance and depravity even so it is important to keep in mind the many millions of black peopleespecially studentswho are influenced by the kind of racist tripe which passes for criticism of black literary works generations of black students have gone out into the world as professionals believing that the white view of black literature is the valid view and there are far far too many black teachers who slavishly repeat the antiblack nonsense they have learned in the nations colleges and universities black students must not be abandoned to the insidious propaganda which holds in essence that black writers rarely produce works of art because of course there is an element of protest in their work only white writers have the objectivity toward race which is necessary to produce art when the subject matter is race pure crap and yet it is propagated everywhere it cannot therefore be ignored as it so richly deserves to be in how we live a big pages expensive anthology compiled by l rust hills and his wife penny chapin and published by macmillan the racist line is presented with startling candor the section dealing with black life and literature is small pages and toward the rear of the book six authors are presented and three of that six are white now here in the editors own words are the reasons why only three black writers ralph ellison james baldwin john a williams are included among some authors many of them thirdrate and unimportant by any truly objective yardstick and read and weepwhy it was necessary for the editors to select fiction by three white writers to provide an authentically literary reflection of how we blacks live unlike the jews who have equal opportunities and can change their distinguishing names and noses and adopt the elite religious and life styles and thus not only melt in but rise to the top in a few generations the negroes have a much longer and more difficult road to follow in order to lose their racial stigma and become plain ordinary americans the editors explain gloriously ignorant of the monstrousness of their presumption and condescension for these reasons and some others the editors proceed blithely there has been no negro renaissance in contemporary american fiction to compare with the jewish renaissance there are at least a halfdozen jewish writers in the absolutelv firstrank of american writ a ing today and there are dozens of others whose potentiality or achievement places them not far behind only two really first rate negro writers can be namedralph ellison and james baldwinand the ranks behind them are almost empty to mention the names of ronald fair ernest j gaines chester himes claude brown william melvin kellev paule marshall and john a williams is to stretch and virtually exhaust the list of negroes from whom we can expect literary fiction of significant interest it is not that negroes are not writing or being published but aside from ellison and baldwin they have not yet produced the kind of writing that satisfies the complex contemporary read white literary tastes and sensibilities this situation will of course change soon the editors write throwing black writers a patronizing bone but up to this time it seems that the dialects and situations of negro life have provided the negro writer with the kind of material that is translatable only into a direct recounting of or protest against the sordid or subtle facts of his oppression and finally this this all the above quotes is all perhaps by way of explaining that two of the stories in this section are by jewish writers and one is by a southern white woman there it is and you had better believe it two jews and a southern white woman are better equipped to write about race because apparently they are not hampered by the kind of material that is translatable only into a direct recounting of or protest against the sordid or subtle facts of black oppression in other words the black angle of vision is literarily invalid true literature on race comes only through the white sensibility to begin with none of the whiteauthored stories is really about black people and there is some question in the mind of this black reader whether those black people portrayed in the white stories came through as living breathing human beings but my sensibility is a black one and in the view of the editors of how we live is therefore automatically not to be taken seriously if after some years i do not know black people and how they live and am incapable of passing judgment on the authentic portrayal of black people and black life then i can learn all that i do not know by reading jewish and southern writers the premise is familiar of course in every facet of american life white people know better than black people what is best and what is the right procedure for black people in his story the nickel misery of george washington carver brown jewish ivan gold writes about a black soldier who simply is not to be believed except in the fond fantasies of white people he speaks in an ersatz amos and andy dialect saying such nonblack things as yons all confused and yall know who copperhaid is that skinny nigrah boy indicating that mr gold might have been more at home with a white anglosaxon boy from the ozarks worse mr gold makes his caricature a blackfaced jewish schlmiel a doubledumb loser with an outsized capacity for debasement which might be common among semites but which is black only in the veiled hopes of white people mr gold in short suffers from the william styronnat turner syndrome the bernard malamud story black is my favorite color is better than mr golds but mr malamud is a better writer than mr gold and an infinitely superior observer of human beings and their behavior black or white however a black lady friend who read mr malamuds story at my request was not impressed with the authors creation of the black female character in the story ornita i guess there are black women like that she said but i dont know them the white southern woman author is the late flannery oconnor of georgia a fine and sensitive writer her black character in the story everything that rises must converge is observed mrs oconnor does not enter into the womans psyche she plays it safe the storys chief character is a white woman with whom mrs oconnor isand should befamiliar a runofthemill georgia racist but here a word should be said mrs oconnor chose one kind of georgia expression of racial bigotry she might well have chosen another two women are likely to confront each other across the racial wall in much less violent terms than two men and yet confrontation between men is more usual a black writer might well have chosen the more usual confrontation and to mr and mrs hills his story would have been unacceptable as literature one thing more the hills state authoritatively that ralph ellison and james baldwin are the only two really first rate negro writers who can be named relegating to mediocrity such superb craftsmen as john a williams paule marshall william melvin kelley and ernest j gaines and totally ignoring saunders redding robert boles carlene hatcher polite and kristin hunter the hills can be excused for not knowing about alice walker lindsay patterson audrey lee louise meriwether and the whole new bundle of black writers just being published and no one expects them to recognize the genius of militants leroi jones larry neal or ed bullins but they have slapped in the face even those black writers who slavishly submit to the white literary dogma which demeans them how we live then is important for black readers and writers for the reason that it provides them with an example of what they must continue to guard against black students in and out of integrated schools must be protected from the virulent racism inherent in criticism by literary gurus like l rust and penny chapin hillshoyt w fuller
it has been noted before when the occasion warranted it that no man and no nation holds power forever the greatness that was rome was and will never be again time moves on and fortune changes hands these laws are immutable one supposes however that it might be merely human that those who hold power should behave as if the laws are not inexorable in racist america inheritor and guardian of the old western tradition of rule and exploitation of nonwhite peoples some of the more alert of the oppressors recognize all too well the elusiveness of power and the fact that unparalleled wealth and technology ultimately are no insurors of lasting supremacy on the one level rearguard scientists continue to promote the theory of the genetic superiority of white men on the other level militarists

leading nation of the west seems intent upon taking every opposition met by american power can be dismissed as communist and there is outraged denial that america has colonial intentions the vietnamese war for them the americans its a war saving the world against communism and has nothing to do with race mr toynbee explained in a recent interview published in the new york times but americans feel about the vietnameseand the arabs toothey are natives not human beings a native is a human being who is treated as not being a human being dr toynbee keeps trying to put race in perspective what i am trying to do is explain to western people that they are only a small minority of the world the great world is asia and africaoutside the west he says in a time of madness sanity is an obscenity it is easy to imagine the powermad militarists damning dr toynbee to oblivion as a traitor some of the more romantic of the disaffected black americans looking out upon the world with somewhat more wishful thinking than sharpness of perception char acterize the whole third world as in effect a conglomeration of niggers it is not that truth does not lie essentially at the center of such an argument it is merely that adherence to its truthfulness with an overinvestment of faith is extremely dangerous without a dutiful consideration for the subtleties and shadings of power pride and politics money talks persuasively in the councils of nations just as it does in city councils and america is where the money is still events are bearing out the dictum of that great black philosopher and prophet w e b du bois that this is the century of the color line the nonwhite peoples of the world already have demonstrated a need for solidarityat bandung in algeria in cairo in angolaand the growing disparity between the rich and the poor the exploiters and the exploited the west and the remainder of the world can only deepen that need for solidarity as for the black world in particular unity is much more in than a mere hope the murder of patrice lumumba at the behest of the imperialists in the congo triggers a reaction in manhattan and the slaughter of black people in the streets of detroit sends throngs into the streets of daressalaam more important the spirit of panamericanism which du bois nurtured and which kwame nkrumah sought to make a reality burns brightly in the breasts to the shores of senegal there is of thousands of young black men much more than hope there is defrom san francisco to sao paulo termination on the occasion commemorating the twenu tyseventh anniversary of the abolition of slavery frederick douglass unleashed his unparalleled eloquence over the issue of race pride among black people he uncompromisingly denounced any and every attempt directed towards promoting race pride contending that a people cannot be proud of its race or color since it has neither the choice nor the power to be what it is he strongly preached doing away with this supercilious nonsense for him only achievement should give reason for pride if black people were to be proud let it be because we have had some agency in producing that of which we can properly be proud indeed he was proud of his own achievement not because i am a colored man but because i am a man and because color is a misfortune and is treated as a crime by the american people frederick douglass of course remains one of the great heroes in black history and rightly so yet it seems to me that in criticizing the advocates of race pride among black people in incidentally almost exactly the same terms as the critics of todays wave of race pride douglass overlooked certain fundamentals needed for a people to achieve certain goals in life in so doing he authored an oversight which in fact made him selfcontradictory ie he denounced race pride while upholding achievement pride is pride of a people not directly related to the level of achievement of that people what douglass and his fellow critics then and now seem to have forgotten is the essence of the black mans fight namely to repudiate not only the lies that the whites have said about him but also to recreate old truths these lies include that black man was is not civilized that the black man was is a savage that the black man was is lazy etc etcd all these lies of course directed their authors to the killing conclusion that the black man is inferior more than advancing these lies the whites believed them and unbelievable and sad as it is the black man believed these lies about himself having been thus convinced the black mans ambition for achievement became squelched for how can inferiors be positive activists and achievers of great wonderssocial political economic technological and otherwise inferiors generally spend a large share of their time being ashamed of their life and their origin one of the most debasing facts about slavery is the fact that it sought with all the vigor at its command to strip the black man of his pride and confidence as a person and as a people this was of course a conscious design of slavery as an institution the fact is unless a man is decisively stripped of these fundamental human qualities that is selfconfidence and pride attempts to make him a slave become fruitless he will continue to assert himself as a man and will not voluntarily submit to any degradation slave masters were well schooled in these facts and took all necessary measures to make the slave look negatively on his past and thus lose all selfpride and confidence the ultimate result was that the slave ended up loving his oppressor rather than hating him alexis de tocqueville in his perceptive study democracy in america observed that the negro in america preoccupies himself with making a thousand fruitless efforts to insinuate himself among men who repulse him he conforms to the taste of his oppressors adopts their opinions and hopes by imitating them to form a part of their community having been told from infancy that his race is naturally inferior to that of the whites he assents to the proposition and is ashamed of his own nature in each of his features he discovers a trace of slavery and if it were in his power he would rid himself of everything that makes him what he is such is the result of what i call the negrofication process as created by institutional slavery it ought to be clear to even the most elementary sociopsychologist that a man whose whole life is manifested through imitational behavior devotes a large share of his time not in the exercise of creative initiative but in observing the behavior of those he emulates this is a fundamental difference that must be recognized between whites and negroes the first order of business was is therefore to set the record straight top items on the black mans agenda must not only include the need to repudiate the white mans lies about himlies whose roots have grown so deep with years that they now sound like truthsbut also the need to inculcate in the black man a viable sense of selfrespect unless and until this selfrespect selfpride is in his whole soul no man can expect to realize achievement of any great magnitude authentic behavior must replace imitational behavior as a prerequisite to any real political achievement among and by the blacks race pride must underlie black political thought for the most part all it takes is taking what has been said of him and turning it around rather than speaking disparagingly of his land of origin he must seek to create a positive picture of africa acknowledge its greatness past and present and welcome any connection with it he must learn to support his african brethren in his hour of need such as in rhodesia south africa angola and mozambique if this avenue of mutual support were earnestly pursued blacks could create one of the most viable international political machineries ever known it would take only a matter of days for rhodesia to tumble and from its ashes a zimbabwe to be reborn south africa would begin to accept not only a black mans heart in order to save the life of a white racist but also would begin to transplant the whole black mans life in that country into its politicaleconomic mainstream but such functional political activity cannot come to pass until the black man starts taking a positive view of his whole life and creates a sense of pride for what he is the black man must look beyond the economic advantages that have been afforded him by chance or design mostly by chance for as edward w blyden a great black political activist of the th century observed such economic advantages have accrued at the expense of his manhood he continued we have been dragged into depths of degradation we have been taught a cringing servility we have been drilled into contentment with the most undignified circumstances our finer sensibilities have been blunted there has been almost utter extinction of all that delicacy of feeling and sentiment which adorns character a number of questions must be asked of those of us who are committed to the creation of race pride what is the nature of commitment how is it to be realized is the current wave of nationalism sweeping across ghettoville usa or across the world for that matter just one more peak in the black mans history or is it here to stay this last question is being asked in view of the fact that black his tory is replete with occasions and figures closely resembling those of todays movement stokely carmichael during the meredith trial in started chanting we want black_power that chant left nobody black or white indeed no institution untouched edward blyden at the close of the th century demanded some african power of course both carmichael and blyden meant the same thing namely the type of black or african power where our physical pecuniary and intellectual strength may be collected like brother imari biyden was demanding some spot whence such an influence may go forth in behalf of the race as shall be felt by the nations we are now so scattered and divided that we can do nothing in order to bring the scattered and divided black people together both blyden and carmichael recognized the need to create race pride among them for no people ashamed of themselves like to voluntarily get together they realized as did others that no viable political social and economic institutions could be established until the people come together and people would not come together unless there was some race pride the widespread apathy that benights the black belt of america should be attributed not so much to the lack of political education as to the negative selfimage that is prevalent in these communities one of the reasons why the black man has experienced political frustration is that he has operated not from a positive but rather from a negative selfimage base for the most part his whole participation in the political life has been executed via paternalistic guidance bv whites to be sure the black man has made some substantive demands on the political system but the type of compromise or concession that followed such demands were carefully designed into control gimmicks this only engineered more frustration this is a liability to the nation itself what is needed therefore is a call to attitudinal revolutionand that is what it isrevolution without this revolution this race pride the black manwherever he may bewill continue to be prey to the sociopolitical and economic systems of the day while institutional slavery may have disappeared its mark lingers on it is our duty in the words of alexander crummell to cast off its graveclothes and resist its deadly influences this will not only reverse the rule of the black mans political life that is taxation without representation but will create an undying love for our people and as dr w e b du bois noted will substantially reduce the degree of lawlessness and crime among our people by our people if as a nation we must seek ye first the political kingdom as per kwame nkrumahs dictum we must as a people seek a revolution in our attitudes towards each other i would like first to make some assertions g about what negritude s is not this prelimi nary dogmatism is required by the recklessness and abandon with which the word now falls from lipsboth thick and thin negritude is not simply anything black and it is certainly not everything black negritude is not wearing turbans and fezzes though these may be quite alluring it is not tearing up ads for palmers skin whitener it is not abandoning madame walker in africa where negritude is surely present white paint has been used for ritual and cosmetic purposes since the time when the sahara was a land of lush vegetation in africa today from dakar to kinshasa barefoot ladies do not scorn the adornment of wigs imported from paris negritude is not posturing or agitation but reflection not a code but a principle not therapy for the bemused but a modality for the thinking man the word itself which does not come trippingly from the anglosaxonized tongue is a gallic creation it was first employed by aime cesaire the martinican poet in in the poem cahier dun retour au pays natal which we shall translate as notebook of a return visit to my native land here is the passage in french and then in my translation he is describing the geographical position of his native land with guadeloupe above it as well as haiti ou la negritude se mit debout pour la premiere fois et dit quelle croyait a son humanite haiti where negritude rises to its feet for the first time and says that it has believed in its own humanity to deal with this striking neologism of we have to go back in time and extend our gaze from harlem to the left bank of the seine in paris paris is a city of manifestos literary historians recall the romantic and symbolist documents political historians think of those of the revolution and the commune in almost unnoticed there appeared a review entitled legitime defense legitimate defense edited by martinican students it too was a manifesto and in the unfolding of time the movement which it articulated was to become the concern both of literary and political history specifically legitime defense demanded a new west indian poetry which would no longer reflect the french tradition years antecedent but which would respond to the present need of west indian man this significant paragraph occurs in that manifestoi translate the wind which rises from black america will we hope quickly clean our west indies of the abortive fruit of a decayed culture langston hughes and claude mckay the two revolutionary black poets have brought us steeped in red wine the african love of life the african joy in love the african dream of death and already young haitian poets deliver to us lines swollen with a future dynamism we quickly perceive that legitime defense drew nutriment from the harlem renaissance and from the indigenist movement in haiti and i must next speak of these if any single name other than that of langston hughes should evoke for us the mind and spirit of the harlem renaissance it is that of alain leroy locke he was in the words of langston hughes the granddaddy of the movement in dr locke edited the classic anthology the new negro which should be required readings for todays neoafricanophiles here in rich profusion was revealed an intensity of thought and feeling which came as a revelation to america and indeed to the western world in the twenties dr locke looked with considerable insight to the african origins of americas black population and defined a cultural strategy which i have called ancestralism locke had long been a friend of w e b du bois and shared completely with the older man a concern with panafricanism they were repeatedly cultural collaborators i had the privilege of knowing dr locke during the last years of his life and can attest to the fervor with which he tended the flame of afroamerican cultural expression this is an appropriate moment in history to ask ourselves what the significance of the harlem renaissance was to study and appraise it brings forcibly to our mind the fact that much now being hailed as new in the analysis of the afroamerican experience has been known and expressed already this is not to deny credit and commendation to recent spokesmen who have expanded their energies on the killing ground but i feel strongly that young black americans would profit mightily from pondering the maxim those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it the message of the harlem renaissance was wafted across the caribbean to haiti the story has been told with scholarly elegance by professor naomi garrett and i will but sketch the background in the united states occupied the republicthe uniquely black republicof haiti this was part of a pattern of american imperialism which in the name of fiscal responsibility and civic order included the occupation of nicaragua and the dominican republic as well as frequent flexing of muscles in other middle american states it is appropriate to mention in explanation rather than in defense that north american ideas of fiscal responsibility and civic order were honored in the breach rather than in the observance by the motley crew of multicolored middle american governments for the haitian bourgeosie the american occupation was a traumatic experience until these latter years a fundamental praxis of american imperialism was that when darker peoples were to be dealt with it was prudent to send southerners to do the dealing in the light of their long experience in such matters there was an enlightened public opinion in the us which deplored and condemned the fact and the fashion of the american occupation in haiti almost from the beginning yet as late as years after the occupation began american authorities could still be so crass and stupid as to decree that the students in the lycees of haiti abandon their classical studies and study agriculture down with bossuet up with burbank luther to be sure i have often speculated on this strange timing did it take that long for the occupying administration to learn what the haitians were doing in those lycees or was it only possible for them to turn to the problems of secondary education then because it had required more than a decade to restore fiscal responsibility and civic order the generation of haitian intellectuals and writers who came to maturity in this period of their nations history entertained certain misgivings about the civilization western civilizationwhich gave birth to the louts who possessing no apparent culturein the older sense of that wordcould nevertheless entertain no serious doubt of their own superiority to the haitians the reaction was to produce in the latter half of the s and the early s a number of poets and writers who sought a special significance in their african heritage not directly connected with this school of poets but honored by them working apart and continuing a quest he had begun in the s was that remarkable haitian man of letters jean pricemars at last report he was still working a fact that those of us who saw him as ambassador to paris in his eighties can find readily believable he is the creator of haitianism the haitian school of ethnology and with du bois and locke one of the three tutelary geniuses of negritude legitime defense which has led us to harlem and to haiti had a single issue that was sufficient to sustain a climate of opinion two years later in a journal fated to have a longer life appeared letudiant noir the black student here in one endeavor were grouped students from africa as well as the west indies three personalities of the first rank still active still controversial emerge from the team of letudiant noir the veritable fathers of negritude leopold sedar senghor then a student from the french colony of senegal now president of independent senegal and a major french poet aime cesaire then a student from martinique now mayor of fortdefrance deputy to the french assembly poet and playwright in the grand tradition leon damas then a student from french guyana which he later represented in the assembly now a unesco expert and cultural historian here at the origin of negritude we are faced with the essential paradox of the concept and the source of its difficulty particularly for the anglosaxon mind for we have three french intellectuals descendents of descartes and vol taire and children of the concept of liberty fraternity and equality the revolutionary heritagewho through their own experience and even more through the contemplation of the plight of their fellow and lessfavored colonial brethren could find profound disparities in what they knew and in what they felt in their gallicism if i may risk a coarse metaphor i would say that negritude springs at least circumstantially from a view of the backside of french civilization i might raise the tone if i adapt the fashionable jargon of the day and say that the elaboration of the idea of negritude was motivated by black consciousnessspecifically that of senghor dumas and cesaire in france some uptodate people might call it a syndrome rather than an idea but let us abandon the jargon which facilitates and obscures and return to our young men in their dingy paris lodgings they were intellectuals they were colonials they were black they were however from different sides of the ocean please take note of my ethnocentrism when i say oceani mean the atlantic the cultural contrasts of their origins were striking senghor had been born in a senegalese village and spoke only serer until he went to school cesaire had been born in the slums of fortdefrance a tropical provincial french town in many ways and his first tongue was almost certainly a city dialect of creole a language the linguists are still trying to classify damas was a bourgeois from an overseas provincial town but were the cultural contrasts of their infancy and early childhood as profound as they seemed to the casual observeror even to the trained sociologist they came to doubt this and out of this doubt intellectual doubt i hasten to addcame the formulation of negritude for our young men were aware of a kind of fellow feeling a kinship that lay beneath and beyond their immediate origins and certainly a great distance from that which they shared as french university students a kinship which could only be accounted for by some other agency or force there were three possible explanations it arose from temperament from race or from culture but if so from a kind of level of culture not hitherto recognized a literary critic with a psychoanalytic bent would probably not find too great a consonance of temperament in these three men and it was certainly not that race then surely it is the classic european position that race counts and tells in the nineteenth century matthew arnold the highest type of wellbred english intelligence could expatiate loudly and long on the celtic race and show the ineradicable difference between it and the germanic english race while arnold never said the celts were inferior that is what his english readers understood and i think that is probably what his celtic readers understood alsoand did not agree with however in the early thirties despite the great triumph that political racism was enjoying in germany the scientific community was entering a casenotproven plea our young men were then left with the culturehypothesis and negritude i emphasize is a doctrine of cultural and not of racial unity of course there is another possibility which would occur to cynics and skepticsnamely that the fellowfeeling the kinship which they felt impelled to explain did not in reality exist but might have been a product of their imaginings quickened by too little good french food and too much bad vin ordinaire in the fashion of all lordly expositors of difficult subjects i shall dismiss this thesis as trivial the notion of there being a sufficiently broad base of african culture to speak of it as a unifying or at any rate identifyingfactor found in black populations in africa in the west indies and in the american continents we sometimes forget there are two is staggering to most people but it staggers them in different directions absurd say some perfectly obvious say others i would like to suggest however that the whole pattern of recent research concerning what is assimilated during the first years of life will shortly lead us to distinguish between deep culture and broad culture and see that negritudeas defined by its founders is a phenomenon of deep culture frances war ordeal saw the end of letudiant noir negritude like so many other aspects of french life went into the resistance it was nurtured during this period by the climate of existentialist thought jeanpaul sartre was to bring to the theoreticians of negritude a formidable support in his analysis and rebuttal of french bourgeois intellectualism following the war grouped around alioune diop of senegal there appeared the group who brought out in december of the journal presence africaine it appeared simultaneously in paris and dakar it carried the best wishes and congratulations of leading french intellectuals such as andre gide sartre michel leiris and georges balandier the names of senghor cesaire and richard wright also appear in the first issue presence africaine rapidly assumed a unique place in the intellectual and cultural spectrum of france and the world it developed a publishing house whose total inventory is now numbered in the hundreds its first volume was bantu philosophy by the belgian priest r p tempels later defrocked for his views the journal established the society of african culture which in turn organized under the presidency of pricemars two congresses of black writers and artists one in in paris and a second in rome in it was this same society of african culture which in organized the first world festival of negro arts held at dakar under the patronage of senghor i had the pleasure of attending that event and will say a few words about it the festival brought to dakar during the month of april sages and scholars artists and dilletantes journalists and jobhunters and some folks who just plain came some came for the party and some for the pilgrimage some were looking for laughs and some for the vision splendid but there they were splendid and resplendent in the hues of the sun and of the rainbow and it was a joy to see some were disappointed some dismayed many were exhilarated and not a few strangely gratified by the satisfaction of a certain undefinable ineffable sense of participation in a historic moment for despite all the downgrading all the clamor all the claims and counterclaims something did take place in dakar in dakar there was for the first time anywhere an encounter in the realm of art in the realm of the spirit such as has not taken place before whether one calls it negritude brotherhood or ballyhoo the fact is that black and quasiblack people from all over the worldand naturally enough white folks toogathered together to observe and reflect on the spiritual and artistic achievements of black peoples from all over the world freed of the cumbersome sociopoliticoeconomic contexts in which these are habitually viewed and the result was the affirmation of a cultural heritage long despised long deprecated long deplored what are the implications of the concept of negritudeof a uniquely black african cultural heritage for scholarship i will give you an anecdote in response to this query when i mentioned to one of the leading american authorities on african art that i was coediting with a colleague an anthology of essays and studies on negritude she expressed to me the reservations that she and her close collaborator the leading british specialist on african art had as to the usefulness of this concept quite recently when she was visiting me after having read the anthology through from cover to cover she expressed the view that it was a very useful thing to have done in a discussion concerning african art which ensued she was talking about the great variety of idiom to be found in african art then she said if however one takes any number of african pieces and mixes them with other apparently similar examples of tribal art from other parts of the world you can immediately separate the african pieces theirs is a world apart they are distinguished by their theirshe searched for a word caught my eye capitulated by their negritude this expert has been a student of african art for over years and had never needed the word until that moment or to be exact had needed it but had not used it until then when its significance came to to her suddenly like a spiritual illumination much of the nonsense that generations of western scholars have written about black people might have been avoided had the concept of negritude been articulated and understood earlier on the other hand much nonsense is still being engendered and subsidized in ignorance of the concept and not only by whites dangers lie in the other directionchiefly as a result of the industry and energy of the ignorant it has been truly said that nothing is more terrifying than ignorance in action no useful purpose is served by perverting a useful concept of culture into a mystique a counterracism this course has in fact been consciously and conscientiously urged by some but its usefulness i question its morality i execrate the dialectical view which holds that negritude is a necessary antithesis to white supremacy superiority and dominationto blanchitude if you willis worthy of support for the phenomenon viewed thus from a hegelian point of view leads toward the higher synthesis of universalism an urgent goal if we are all to avoid being atomicized but dialects and mysticism apart on the simple and scientifically definable terrain of culture we can state that negritude the notion of a consistent and historically valid nexus of black african values is of irreplaceable value in the continuing task of understanding societies in which persons of african descent are to be found the moslem middle v f i a f east is strategically laid out to form a natgl ural link between africa asja and europe the area forms a bridge between two oceanic areasthe atlantic and its tributaries and the indian ocean and its persian gulf and red sea offshoots the area is generally but not universally understood to include lebanon syria jordan iraq iran saudi arabia the yemen kuwait turkey and more recently the greater part of north africa in comparison to the history of western europe the history of the middle east goes back over years one of the most conspicuous facts about the area is that each of the countries consists of an astounding mosaic of people the mosaic consists of multitudinous details an old bearded man in a white turban will pierce the cold hours before sunrise with the cry prayer is better than sleep a jet streaks overhead as veiled women wash clothes in a nearby stream located near a wide boulevard crowded with the latest model european cars in the bazaar there is the hum of voices transacting the business of the day in government offices bright young men conduct national and international affairs over steaming cups of tea in baghdad one will find black arabs in responsible positions at every turn there are also in this vast geographical area assyrians kurds turks persians bedouins and an assortment of other people whose blood has been mixed with the black african to describe the people and civilization of the middle east is as formidable a task as it is to describe all of the various people and their cultures on the continent of africa however the people including the black persians as well as the blond turks share one common element in life they are all members of the moslem brotherhood the black followers of islam in the middle east are certainly in the minority but they share a dignity and knowledge of self difficult for most westerners to understand indeed many westerners think it is only the reedy quartertone of the music of the area that serves as the unifying thread between the tall black egyptian and the short smallboned syrian the mystique is much deeper than this black people came to the middle east by three routes i from the sudan and surrounding areas to north africa over the sahara desert down the nile and across the indian ocean andor red sea by ship the early followers of muhammad who were traders caravanmen and sailors penetrated the vast area below the sahara the traders were seeking new and expanded trade opportunities the great armies of islam were in search of new converts and extended their conversion to africa but also they carried islam to southwestern europe and as far east as borneo those unwilling to accept islam were enslaved and treated as infidels as one would guess the slaves captured by the armies of islam included all hues black men from africa mongoloids from central asia and white men from southern europe it is unfortunate to have to use the term slave because servitude in islam carried no social inferiority there was no distinction made between sons of women who happened to have been slaves as we will see later and a father who was free and of the aristocracy whereas the majority of black people found in the middle east were brought or came under the influence of islam there is some evidence that there were blacks in persia before the iranians came at least two authorities have indicated that in the persian province of khuzistan which is located on the persian gulf the aborigines were blacks according to two frenchmen dieulafoy and de morgan the people of the susian plain were negroes of distinction herodotus even observed that these men were in no way different in appearance from the other ethiopians then there is the other historical evidence that appears on most ancient basreliefs figures of negroes are seen frequently one traveler brigadier general percy sykes reported in his writings that the whole population of bashakird and sarhad were a puzzle and that possibly the whole area extending from the northern shores of the persian gulf to india was made up of black people at one time ttie greeks in their mythology no doubt recognized the fact that blacks occupied this part of persia they describe darkskinned memnon who came to the aid of troy as the offspring of aurora a white mountain woman and of tithonus the ethiopian god memnon the ethiopian prince as the legend goes leads in battle an army of susians of the persian lowlands and ethiopians today in this same area of persia the visitor will find black people in just about every town and hamlet in the mother of the year in khuzistan province was a negro it is generally known that many of irans outstanding families from the persian gulf region can trace their negro ancestry in tehran today some of the descendants of negroes hold minor positions in government offices and some have their own small businesses in kuwait the negro has historically been a part of the development of that oil wealthy country there are cases where sudanese have become kuwaiti nationals and have moved into high government posts the minister of fisheries be ing a good example of acceptance of a black but a moslem who happened to be black the harathins can still be found in the oases of the sahara in the fetid tihama which is the coastal plain of yemen and in the sweltering valley of hadramut in the hadramut one finds a mixture of african arab and mongoloid many of the handramuti traders have brought javanese and malayan wives back from the east indies to add further to the mixture of races in this part of the middle east the arrival of the moslem missionaries in africa did not receive a ready audience for many years there were unsuccessful attempts to convert africans below the sahara eventually africans realized that accepting islam provided a social and political communion as well as protection and assistance from the atlantic to the china wall it is significant to note that the reason these missionaries probably were so readily accepted was because missionaries of islam accepted their black converts as equals and as part of the moslem brotherhood from the very first utterance of acceptance of allah as their god no doubt this rapid conversion when it began was advanced by the absence of any feeling of repulsion towards black men as often is the case in white christianity although the koran forbade the enslavement of a moslem it did not guarantee him freedom if he embraced islam after enslavement however the liberation of slaves was considered a meritorious act in the sight of god there are many cases where slaves rose to very high positions of trust after embracing islam this explains why slaves were often taken because they were capable of education and responsibility if it were felt that a person was not capable of being a moslem he was killed or condemned to a life of servitude blacks who were formerly prisoners of war captured in raids on villages or were bought on the open slave market later went on to make significant contributions in war science art and literature indeed the contributions of black men in the middle east is a brilliant chapter in an exciting history there were blacks who came to the middle east as hired guards for the caravans that plied the trade routes from china to persia to timbuctu the blacks were fierce fighters and protected the caravans carrying goods from maurauding nomadic tribal raiders wealthy sultans in all of islam were eager to have black men in their private armies many of these soldiers were from the sudan and abyssinia in the conquering armies of the turks many of the leading officers were blacks some of whom were generals the turks rewarded these leaders by making them governors of provinces of the territories captured the bukharis or black cavalry units served as the core of an army these troops were usually quartered outside the palace and were popular among the local women by mixing with white women the bukharis gradually became lighter in skin color nevertheless they always took great pride in their african ancestry and liked to boast about the amount of african blood in their veins the use of these gallant soldiers decreased when european drill masters and officers were hired in the armies during the middle of the nineteenth century militarily another group of highly prized black men were the iron workers that is the blacksmiths gunsmiths and sword makers who traveled with the military forces to the military the smith was a vital member of the company it was known that without wellshod horses and the very best of fighting equipment battles could be lost quite often a family of these highly skilled smiths was attached to royal families and remained with them for generations in harems from marrakesh to istanbul blacks played important roles true many of them were eunuchs as was the custom they nevertheless were influential and highly respected besides being used to guard the chastity of the sultans wives and concubines the black eunuch often served as chief of protocol in the guest house the visitor did well to keep in the good graces with this very important member of the sultans personal staff the extent of the blacks knowledge of political intrigue within the sultans court was highly respected and often the strength of a ruler rested in the competence of his black adviser the sultans son usually received his advice from a black companion who was referred to as brother on matters of love feuds and intrigues the highest positions were reserved for the black member of the sultans court as an example traditionally for many years the holy city medina was governed by one of the leading blacks from a sultans court there are many examples in turkey persia and iraq where influential blacks married into families of lesser nobility than that of sultan and were absorbed after several generations there were cases where a loyal servant was rewarded with the most attractive woman from a harem if he could afford an additional wife he married her to turn the other side of the coin black women were much sought after in the harems and by the ordinary arab it was usually the woman from abyssinia who was more esteemed than any others her child was often the favorite among the other children of the father because of the childs ethiopian blood ali one of the sons of sultan hason of shiraz in persia was the son of an ethiopian mother when his father died he had disputes with his brothers finally left home and ended up in zanzibar where he established a colony sir thomas gibb points out that many of the abbasid caliphs of baghdad were born of black women ibrahim brother of harun alrahid was the son of a black woman ibrahim captured baghdad and named himself caliph he retained this position until forced out of it by almamun the royal princes of the wadai in the sudan who began their reign around claim to be descendants of the abbasids beginning with the fifteenth century and onwards some of the ottoman sultans were offsprings of black women who were part of harems in fact many of the dynasties of monarchs who had black mothers or grandmothers were in power for several hundred years however there was never any stigma attached to this fact of parentage many of the intellectuals or men of the pen were blacks they were active as professors at mosque colleges administered and expounded islamic law from the very earliest times moslem jurists were forced to pay attention to the variety of problems found among different racial groups there was within the legal system a class of lawyers known as the muftis and many of these scholars were from black africa coming from as far east as the sudan and as far west as kano and mauritania they served in government offices under the mamluk sultans of egypt and were officially appointed to sit in the judicial college called dar eladl each of the chief cities of the empire had its own muftis who had been trained at special colleges too many westerners are mistaken to think that the college mosque of elazhar at cairo is the only institution of the kind undoubtedly it was the most important seat of higher education in the middle east but there were some smaller mosque colleges in different parts of egypt similar but smaller college mosques were to be found throughout the middle east and moslem africa there was communication between these institutions as well as exchange of professors at elazhar there were or professors excluding junior teachers and officials among the professors at this outstanding university were black mathematicians and poets the students came from egypt and africa particularly sudan somalia and the region of the niger these black men of the pen are responsible too for projecting an image of strength and pride in achievement the record of the black man in the middle east is still buried and needs to be unearthed his history in the middle east is perhaps the least known and least studied by black scholars and students the libraries and archives from alexandria and khartoum to tehran are waiting for black scholars to begin writing about this glorious history we must remember that the black world does not end in africa but extends into the middle east we must remember that when a moslem in kuwait says all qawmiyya t he is really saying i know about soul too the man best known j r i as malcolm_x lived ii g three distinct and in terrelated lives under the respective names malcolm little malcolm_x and elhajj malik elshabazz any honest attempt to understand the total man must begin with some understanding of the significant components that went into his making the racist society that produced and killed malcolm_x is responsible for what he was and for destroying what he could have been he had the greatest leadership potential of any person to emerge directly from the black proletariat in this century in another time under different circumstances he might have been a kingand a good one he might have made a nation and he might have destroyed one he was a creation of the interplay of powerful and conflicting forces in midcentury america no other country or combination of forces could have shaped him the way he was and ultimately destroyed him with such unique ruthlessness malcolm_x knew before he could explain it to himself and others that he was living in a society that was engaged in systematic destruction of his peoples selfrespect his first memories are of conflict in this respect his early life was no different than most black americans where conflict comes early and stays late in his own words when my mother was pregnant with me she told me later a party of hooded ku klux klan riders galloped up to our home in omaha nebraska one night surrounding the house brandishing their shotguns and rifles they shouted for my father to come out my mother went to the front door and opened it standing where they could see her pregnant condition she told them that she was alone with her three small children and that my father was away preaching in milwaukee the klansmen shouted threats and warnings at her that we had better get out of town because the good christian white people were not going to stand for my fathers spreading trouble among the good negroes of omaha with the back to africa preachings of marcus garvey this was how he remembered his father an ambitious dreamer attempting to maintain himself and his family while bigoted white policemen ku klux klansmen and black legionnaires were determined to teach him to stay in his place the father of malcolm_x was killed while fighting against the restricted place that was assigned to his people in this country much later and in many different ways malcolm_x continued the same fight and was subsequently killed for the same reason every major event in malcolms life brought him into conflict with the society that still thrives on the oppression of his people his mother was born as a result of her mother being raped by a white man in the west indies when he was four the house where he and his family lived was burned down by members of the ku klux klan when he was six his father met a violent death that his family always believed was a lynching after the death of his father who was a follower of the black nationalist marcus garvey his family was broken up and for a number of years he lived in state institutions and boarding homes when he finally went to school he made good marks but lost interest and was a dropout at the age of he went to live with his sister in boston and went to work at the kinds of jobs available to negro youthmainly the jobs not wanted by white people like shoeshine boy soda jerk hotel busboy member of a dining car crew on trains traveling to new york and a waiter in a harlem night dub from these jobs he found his way into the underworld and thought at the time that his position in life was advancing in the jungle of the underworld where the fiercest survive by fleecing the weak and the defenseless he became a master manipulator skilled in gambling the selling of drugs burglary and hustling a friend who had helped him get his first job gave him the rationale for his actions the main thing you have to remember he was told is that everything in the world is a hustle malcolm returned to boston where he was later arrested for burglary and sentenced to years in prison the year was and he was not quite years old prison was another school for malcolm he now had time to think and plan out of this thinking he underwent a conversion that literally transformed his whole life by letters and visits from his family he was introduced to the black muslim movement which calls itself officially the lostfound nation of islam he tested himself in the discipline of his newly chosen religion by refusing to eat pork the event startled his fellow inmates who had nicknamed him satan he describes the occasion in this manner it was the funniest thingthe reaction and the way that it spread in prison where so little breaks the monotonous routine the smallest thing causes a commotion of talk it was being mentioned all over the cell block by night that satan didnt eat pork it made me very proud in some odd way one of the universal images of the negroin prison and outwas that he couldnt do without pork it made me feel good to see that my not eating it had especially startled the white convicts later i would learn when i had read and studied islam a good deal that unconsciously my first preislamic submission had been manifested i had experienced for the first time the muslim teaching if you take one step toward allahallah with take two steps toward you my brothers and sisters in detroit and chicago had all become converted to what they were being taught was the natural religion for the black man his description of his process of selfeducation in prison is an indictment of the american educational system and a tribute to his own perseverance in obtaining an education after being poorly prepared in the public schools while in prison he devised his own method of selfeducation and learned how to speak and debate effectively so that he could participate and defend the movement after his release from prison he started by copying words from the dictionary that might be helpful to him beginning with a he went through to z and then he writes for the first time i could pick up a book and actually understand what the book was saying this aspect of his story calls attention to the tremendous reservoirs of talent and even genius locked up in the black ghettos among the masses it also indicates what can be accomplished when the talent of this oppressed group is respected and given hope and a purpose within a few years he was to become a debater with a national reputation he took on politicians college professors journalists and anyone black or white who had the nerve to meet him he was respected by some and feared by others malcolm was released from prison in when he was years old for a few weeks he took a job with his oldest brother wilfred as a furniture salesman in detroit he went to chicago before the end of that year to hear and meet the leader of the nation of islam elijah muhammad he was accepted into the movement and given the name malcolm_x he went back to detroit and was made assistant minister of the detroit mosque from this point on his rise in the movement and in the eyes of the public was rapid at the end of he went to chicago to live with the leader of the nation of islam and to be trained by him personally after organizing a mosque in philadelphia he was sent to head the movement in harlem in before he was years old in a few years he was able to transform the black muslim move ment into a national organization and himself into one of the countrys best known personalities as the public spokesman and defender of the movement he literally put it on the map this was the beginning of his trouble with his leader elijah muhammad when the public thought of the black muslim movement they thought first of malcolm_x malcolm_x had appeal far beyond the movement he was one of the most frequent speakers on the nations campuses and the object of admiration by thousands of militant youth in his pamphlet malcolm_x the man and his ideas george breitman gives the following description of malcolms appeal as a speaker his speaking style was unique plain direct like an arrow devoid of flowery trimming he used metaphors and figures of speech that were lean and simple rooted in the ordinary daily experience of his audiences he knew what the masses thought and how they felt their strengths and their weaknesses he reached right into their minds and hearts without wasting a word and he never tried to flatter them despite an extraordinary ability to move and arouse his listeners his main appeal was to reason not emotion i want only to convey the idea that rarely has there been a man in america better able to communicate ideas to the most oppressed people and that was not just a matter of technique which can be learned and applied in any situation by almost anybody but that it was a rare case of a man in closest communion with the oppressed able to speak to them because he identified himself with them an authentic expression of their yearning for freedom a true product of their growth in the same way that lenin was a product of the russian people from when he was made responsible for the black muslim movement in harlem the history of that movement is essentially the history of the rise of malcolm_x in public speeches where he nearly always prefaced his remarks with the statement the honorable elijah muhammad teaches us malcolm_x was teaching lessons about the black americans fight for basic dignity that was more meaningfully logical than anything that elijah muhammad had ever conceived he was the public figure most identified with the movement and most sought after as its spokesman louis e lomax referred to him as the st paul of the black muslim movement and adds not onlv was he knocked to the ground by the bright light of truth while on an evil iourney but he also rose from the dust stunned with a new name and a burning zeal to travel in the opposite direction and carry americas million negroes with him in these years malcolm_x was preaching separation and frightening more white people than the social protest organizations that were demanding integration the bold act of refusing integration was a challenge to a society that never intended to integrate the black americans in the first place with this act malcolm_x put american society on the defensive by questioning its intentions toward his people and proving that those intentions were false also he made black america question itself and face reality he identified the enemy of their promise indicted that enemy and still did not relieve the victim his own people of the responsibility for being the instrument of their own liberation to place malcolm_x and his roughhewed grandeur in proper perspective one must first understand the nature of the society that produced him and ultimately destroyed him to a large extent the shadow of slavery still hangs over this land and affects the daily life of every american slavery was the black gold that produced americas first wealth and power slavery was the breeding ground for the most contagious and contaminating monster of all timesracism it was this racism and oppression by white america that convinced malcolm_x of the necessity of black nationalism as the vehicle for black liberation as opposed to integration while he was in the black muslim movement although his black nationalism while he was in the muslim organization was narrow and sectarian this did not prevent him from playing a tremendously important role in the evolution of the black freedom struggle prior to the arrival of malcolm_x on the scene most of white america looked upon the established civil_rights organizations as extremists although most of them were creatures and creations of the white controllers of power but malcolm comes along and says not only do i refuse to integrate with you white man but i demand that i be completely separated from you in some states of our own or back home in africa not only is your christianity a fraud but your democracy a brittle lie neither the white man nor his black apologists could answer the latter argument because they could not answer malcolm in this area they attacked him where he was most vulnerable the concept of separatism and that all white folks were blueeyed devilslabeling him a hate monger racist dangerous fanatic black supremacist etc in reality he was none of these things certainly he didnt preach black supremacy malcolm_x preached black pride black redemption black reaffirmation and he gave the black woman the image of a black man that she could respect the fact that malcolm_x while in the black muslim movement could reject a white person on any term caused most of white amer ica psychological suicide and instilled admiration and pride in most black americans for the egos of most americans are so bloated that they cannot conceive of a black man rejecting them it can be stated categorically that malcolm_x while in the black muslim movement and out of it created the present stage of the civil_rights struggleto the extent that he was a catalytic agentoff stage sarcastically criticising the civil_rights leaders popping a whip which activated them into more radical action and programs he was the alternative with which the power holders of america had to deal if they didnt deal with the established civil_rights leaders on december about two weeks after president john f kennedys assassination malcolm_x addressed a public rally at manhattan center in new york city he was speaking as a replacement for elijah muhammad as he had done many times before after the speech in a question and answer period malcolm_x made the remark that led to his suspension as a muslim minister in answer to a question what do you think about president kennedys assassination malcolm_x answered that he saw the case as the chickens coming home to roost soon after the remark malcolm_x was suspended by elijah muhammad and directed to stop speaking for days some weeks later when malcolm_x realized that there were a number of highly placed persons in the black muslim movement conspiring against him seemingly with elijah muhammads consent he left the movement malcolm devotes a chapter in his book to the growth of his disenchantment and his eventual suspension from the black muslim movement he says i had helped mr muhammad and his ministers to revolutionize the american black mans thinking opening his eyes until he would never again look in the same fearful way at the white man if i harbored any personal disappointment whatsoever it was that privately i was convinced that our nation of islam could be an even greater force in the american black mans overall struggleif we engaged in more action by that i mean i thought privately that we should have amended or relaxed our general nonengagement policy i felt that wherever black people committed themselves in the little rocks and the birminghams and other places militantly disciplined muslims should also be therefor all the world to see and respect and discuss on march he publicly announced that he was starting a new organization in fact two new organizations were started the muslim mosque inc and the organization of afroamerican unity malcolm_x was still somewhat beholden to elijah muhammad in the weeks immediately following his break with the movement at his press conference on march th he said in part i am and always will be a muslim my religion is islam i still believe that mr muhammads i analysis of the problem is the most realistic and that his solution is the best one this means that i too believe the best solution is complete separation with our people going back home to our own african homeland but separation back to africa is still a longrange program and while it is yet to materialize million of our people who are still here in america need better food clothing housing education and jobs right now mr muhammads program does point us back homeward but it also contains within it what we could and should be doing to help solve many of our problems while we are still here internal differences within the nation of islam forced me out of it i did not leave of my own free will but now that it has happened i intend to make the most of it now that i have more independence of action i intend to use a more flexible approach toward working with others to get a solution to this problem i do not pretend to be a divine man but do believe in divine guidance divine power and in the fulfillment of divine prophecy i am not educated nor am an expert in any particular field but i am sincere and my sincerity is my credentials the problem facing our people here in america is bigger than all other personal or organizational differences therefore as leaders we must stop worrying about the threat that we seem to think we pose to each others personal prestige and concentrate our united efforts toward solving the unending hurt that is being done daily to our people here in america i am going to organize and head a new mosque in new york city known as the muslim mosque inc this gives us a religious base and the spiritual force necessary to rid our people of the vices that destroy the moral fiber of our community our political philosophy will be black nationalism our economic and social philosophy will be black nationalism our cultural emphasis will be black nationalism many of our people arent religiously inclined so the muslim mosque inc will be organized in such a manner as to provide for the active participation of all negroes in our political economic and social programs despite their religious or nonreligious beliefs the political philosophy of black nationalism means we must control the politics and the politicians of our community they must no longer take orders from outside forces we will organize and sweep out of office all negro politicians who are puppets for me outside forces malcolm_x had now thrust himself into a new area of conflict that would take him briefly to a high point of international attention and partial acceptance during the last phase of his life malcolm_x established the muslim mosque inc and a nonreligious organizationthe organization of afroamerican unity patterned after the organization of african unity he attempted to internationalize the civil_rights struggle by taking it to the united nations in several trips to africa and one to mecca he sought the counsel and support of african and asian heads of state his trip to mecca and africa had a revolutionary effect upon his thinking his perennial call had always been for black unity and selfdefense in opposition to the integrationists program of nonviolence passive resistance and negrowhiteunity when he returned home from his trip he was no longer opposed to progressive whites uniting with revolutionary blacks as his enemies would suggest but to malcolm and correctly so the role of the white progressive was not in black organizations but in white organizations in white communities convincing and converting the unconverted to the black cause further and perhaps more important malcolm had observed the perfidy of the white liberal and the american left whenever afroamericans sought to be instruments of their own liberation he was convinced that there could be no blackwhite unity until there was black unity that there could be no workers solidarity until there is racial solidarity the overwhelming majority of white americans demonstrate daily that they cannot and will not accept the black man as an equal in all its ramificationsafter having years of racism preached to them from the pulpit taught in the primer and textbook practiced by the government apotheosized on editorial pages lauded on the airways and television screens it would be tantamount to selfcastration a gutting of the ego it would be asking white america to completely purge itself of everything it has been taught fed and believed for years it was this recognition of what racism had done to the white man and the black mind that the following paragraph was and is a keystone of the organization of afroamerican unitys program we must revamp our entire thinking and redirect our learning trends so that we can put forth a confident identity and wipe out the false image built up by an oppressive society we can build a foundation for liberating our minds by studying the different philosophies and psychologies of others provisions are being made for the study of languages of eastern origin such as swahili hausa and arabic such studies will give us as afroamericans a direct access to ideas and history of our ancestors as well as histories of mankind at large more so than any other afroamerican leader malcolm_x realized that there must be a concomitant cultural and educational revolution if the physical revolution is to be successful no revolution has ever sustained itself on emotion when malcolm_x returned from his trip to mecca and africa he completely repudiated the black muslims program of separation their acquisitive thirst for money and property and machine idolatry he felt that they were merely imitating the racist enemy he still believed in separation from his racist enemy but his was an ideological separation to malcolm_x the belief was that the afroamerican must transcend his enemy not imitate him for he foresaw that both the black muslims and the integrationists were aping the oppressor that neither recognized that the struggle for black freedom was neither social nor moral it was and is a power struggle a struggle between the whitehaves and the blackhavenots a struggle of the oppressor and the oppressed and if the oppressed is to breach the power of the oppressor he must either acquire power or align himself with power therefore it is not accidental that malcolms political arm the organization of afroamerican unity was patterned to the letter and spirit after the organization of african unity nor should it be surprising that he officially linked up the problems of afroamericans with the problems of his black brothers and sisters on the mother continent malcolm_xs vision was broad enough to see that the afroamericans were not a minority as the enemy and his lackeys would have us believe afroamericans are not an isolated million there are over million black people in the western hemisphere cuba brazil latin america the west indies america etc and malcolm knew that when we unite these millions with the million on the african continent the black man becomes a mighty force the second largest people on earth and so malcolms perennial theme was unity unity unity the formation of the organization of afroamerican unity and the establishment of an official connection with africa was one of the most important acts of the twentieth century for this act gave the afroamericans an official link with the new emerging power emanating from both africa and asia thus malcolm_x succeeded where marcus garvey and others had failed thus doing this malcolm projected the cause of afro american freedom into the international arena of power when he internationalized the problem by raising it from the level of civil_rights to that of human rights and by linking up with africa malcolm_x threw himself into the crossfire of that invisible international cartel of power and finance which deposes presidents and prime ministers dissolves parliaments if they refuse to do their bidding it was this force i believe which killed malcolm_x which killed lumumba which killed hammarskjold there is another and more potent reason why the american oppressors feared malcolm_x and desired him dead and that is the publicized fact that he was going to bring the oppression of afroamericans before the united nations charging the united states government with genocide many of the oppressors had conniptions when confronted with the prospect of a world body discussing the problems of afroamericans in the introduction to malcolm_xs autobiography m s handler has said no man in our time aroused fear and hatred in the white man as did malcolm because in him the white man sensed an implacable foe who could not be had for any pricea man unreservedly committed to the cause of liberating the black man in american society rather than integrating the black man into that society he was more precisely a man in search of a definition of himself and his relationship to his people his country and the world that a man who had inhabited the lower depth of life could rise in triumph as a reproach to its ills and become an uncompromising champion of his people is in itself a remarkable feat malcolm_x went beyond this feat though he came from the american ghetto and directed his message to the people in the american ghetto first of all he also became in his brief lifetime a figure of world importance he was assassinated on february while on the threshold of his potential about the men of his breed the writer john oliver killens has said he was a dedicated patriot dignity was his country manhood was his government and freedom was his landnew york city november it is years since i racial disturbances first e occurred in the notting hill section of london today again racial violence is a real possibility in britain even a cursory examination of the events of the last decade reveals a marked deterioration in relations between the races moreover the process has been sharply accelerated during the past year to americans now harvesting the fruits of centuries of bigotry the signs are ominously familiar britains colored residents numbering one million and consisting in the main of west indians pakistanis indians and some west africans are but percent of the entire population however when one realizes that in nonwhites totalled only about it is obvious that the influx has been rapid exceedingly so for many in a highly homogenized nation traditionally suspicious of strangers undeniably britons who have long claimed immunity to the bacillus of racial prejudice have now been infected indeed judging by the extent of discrimination in housing and employment the disease has reached epidemic proportions though to be sure many have proven immune according to a governmentsponsored survey released in job discrimination based on race is commonplace employment agencies admitted that colored applicants were referred to a very small percentage of employers labor unions were no more tolerant furthermore coloreds were not acceptable as tenants in fully twothirds of all privately owned property discrimination in auto insurance was also substantiated as in the united states nonwhites who cannot find jobs commensurate with their talents or living accommodations adequate for their families needs have grown increasingly bitter one manifestation of this bitterness has been the emergence of a black_power movement for a short period of time the black_power movement was personified by michael x a trinidadian whose autobiography was recently published while its author languished in prison in november he was convicted of violating that provision of the race relations act of which prohibits incitement to racial hostility his conviction resulted from a speech delivered in reading in which michael observed in i saw white savages kicking black women in the streets and black brothers running away his admonition to the audience was allegedly if you ever see a white man laying a hand on your black woman kill him immediately michael xs life in the west indies and britain studded as it has been with humiliating and degrading experiences sharply underscores the globalization of the color problem in the second half of the twentieth century few of his experiences would sound particularly novel to black americans his militant response to those experiences namely his advocacy of black pow er would be still less novel michael whose father was a portuguese merchant was often reminded as a child by his mother a black barbadian herself that white is pretty black is ugly she actually forbade him to play with negro children she discouraged him from dating negro girls and years later she was shocked and keenly disappointed when he married a black woman in england not surprisingly michael x or michael abdul malik as he now calls himself underwent an identity crisis which he subsequently saw being repeated in his young daughter the girl is fond of drawing michael comments in his book i watch her for a while and every so often i say put a little more black in here blacks a very pretty col or particularly galling to michael was the prejudice which prevented him from working as a british merchant seaman and which required him to sail aboard norwegian vessels in common with black people in the united states he found all too often that the police in the ghetto are the type who think black people are all savages like his friend malcolm_x michael living in a society which rejected him earned his livelihood as a pimp outside the societys laws like malcolm he had affairs with white women which in retrospect he regretted like malcolm he eventually came to grips with the twin problem of a much tarnished racial selfimage and black_powerlessness dropped his slave name de freitas and converted to islam unlike malcolm whose rebirth was made possible by the muslims michael fashioned his own instrument the racial adjustment action society or raas as it is usually called the choice of name had a curious rationale raas according to michael is a west indian word referring to a menstrual blood cloth therefore it symbolizes the way the black man has been drained of his life blood for so long also the word ras derived from arabic is used in parts of africa in ethiopia for example to mean leader or head among raas aims were not only the uniting of nonwhites in the british isles but safeguarding their rights as human beings promoting black ownership of business to reduce dependency upon white capital creating cooperative housing projects and providing legal advice loosely structured the organization attracted pakistanis indians and turbaned sikhs as well as west indians and guianese associate membership was open to sympathetic europeans but it was michaels conviction that white people ought not be accorded a major role in the black freedom movement as in the united states whites have been influential in respectable civil_rights organizations in britain such as card the campaign against racial discrimination the gulf between the moderates and the militants widened throughout and when to the delight of his colored audience michael described englishmen as white monkeys and condemned them for dehumanizing and raping the mind and spirit of the black man he preached black consciousness and reiterated the now familiar phrase black is beautiful in his autobiography michael claims that raas had a membership on paper of after being in existence for one year because an entirely active membership was preferred the size of the organization was cut to some apparently since michaels imprisonment it has been reduced further some defections including that of roy sawh can be attributed to the religious that is islamic character which had been given to raas born in guiana sawh is a flamboyant hyde park orator who had served as its fulltime national organizer by the beginning of raas had been eclipsed by the universal coloured peoples association the ucpa first emerged on britains racial scene in november shortly after its formation when members appeared at a weekend card meeting sporting badges on which the phrase black_power and a picture of a black_panther were displayed president of the ucpa is obi b egbuna who was bom in onitsha in what is now biafra in included in his writings are a play a novel a pamphlet the murder of nigeria and articles on racial injustice egbunas awareness of the plight of afroamericans and his debt to malcolm_x and stokely carmichael are apparent in his writings graphically illustrating this transatlantic racial link was the first issue june of a periodical black_power speaks published by the ucpa it contained an editorial entitled hands off rap brown an ode to malcolm_x a poem by w e b du bois a picture of stokely speaking at the ucpa platform at hyde park speakers corner and a plea to readers to join the ucpa soul brothers now and make black_power a way of life black_power has been defined in a special statement of the ucpa as the totality of the economic cultural political and if necessary military power which the black peoples of the world must acquire in order to get the white oppressor off their backs echoing michael malcolm and stokely the statement talks of cultural genocide and the need for black cultural nationalism in addition it bemoans the denial of equal opportunity to black people in short it bluntly asserts we do not enjoy being black in a whitecontrolled britain the objectives of the ucpa are comprehensive and include the establishment of nurseries for colored children the organization of study groups for blacks to stress racial interests and the formation of cooperatives especially significant is the fact that the problem of black people in britain is seen in a worldwide context the resident of harlem the black angolan and the west indian in londons ladbroke grove have a common oppressor international white power their only solution it is maintained is international black_power ian smith in rhodesia and harold wilson in britain it is argued differ not in principle but in tactics some recent racial developments make such an argument plausible to a growing number of coloreds in england on march after soulsearing and often bitter debate both in and out of parliament an emergency bill to check the influx of asians from kenya was enacted into law this act which affected not aliens but british subjects was later roundly condemned by the international commission of jurists and in april enoch powell a leading rightwing conservative made his inflammatory speech in birmingham on the race question powell conjured up visions of whole areas of the country subjected to black domination and prophesied racial violence unless further colored immigration was stopped and blacks already living in britain were encouraged to depart although powell was relieved of his post as shadow minister of defense popular support for his position was considerable not only did rightwingers and longtime racists rally to his standard but they were joined by dockers as well as workers from the smithfield market on july some smithfield demonstrators marched to whitehall carrying placards reading no sellout to black_power keep britain white and guess whos coming to dinner even passage of a new race relation bill designed to minimize discrimination in housing and employment probably cannot mitigate a sense of rejection deepened by such demonstrations there are indications that powell by polarizing racial opinion has strengthened the black_power movement still quite small it is growing perceptibly for example the hustler the first ghetto newspaper appeared shortly after the powell incident published in notting hill its orientation is black_power of course black_power is not to be equated with violence yet inevitably there is talk of bloodshed in britain the ucpa while it does not favor the use of force believes that the only way to neutralize violence is to employ violence it takes a single match stick to burn london down it takes one angry black man to light that match egbuna has dismissed gandhis passive resistance as ineffective for a small minority and michael x using the idiom of the ghetto has written in anger and sorrow that the black man walking through notting hill says we should burn this place down who brought about ghanas independence the people q who were the moving forces outstandingly dr kwame vv nkrumah after his return from overseas in with an absence of years from his home nkrumah became the secretary of the united gold coast convention he regarded the ugcc as a movement backed almost entirely by reactionaries middle class lawyers and merchants since the executive of the ugcc followed a reactionary course the time was ripe for a showdown this opportunity to bring about ghana independence and to carry on panafrican agitation in africa were what really attracted dr nkrumah back to ghana he had been in london in the honourable company of dedicated blackmen of courage such as george padmore peter abrahams c l r james and jomo kenyatta nkrumah sought the support of the ghana young men and women to push the movement for independence such men as kojo botsio and k a gbedemah joined forces with nkrumah to form an active forwardmoving organization in he broke away from this organization with many others to form the convention peoples party a more dynamic organization capable of achieving the independence which finally crystallized in he also was elected the general secretary of the cpp the organizations which comprised the cpp were the workers brigade the state construction workers the national council of ghana women the ghana young pioneers the trade union congress the united ghana farmers council and the cooperatives the members of these various organizations were members of the cpp and they worked to realize the ideology of the party a member

that the dominant character which should take precedence in all that we do is the character of the membership of the cpp this character is the guiding force of our ghanaian life and existence and constitutes the bulwark against national treachery intrigue subversion and other unghanaian activities the work of the cpp prior to independence was essentially that for the attainment of independence for ghana since independence the m cpp moved its activities in the following directions a political an upper house of the legislature known as the senate shall be created for the chiefs the eventual adoption of a republican government for the total political independence from britain universal suffrage at the age of direct eitcuons v itn no property or residential qualifications for can didates a

up to years of age the university college to be brought up to university status and more new ones established a planned campaign to abolish illiteracy d family assistance a free national health service a high standard of housing program a pipedwater supply in all parts of the country a national insurance scheme in order to achieve these the cpp demanded hard work and sacrifice from its members as well as ghanaian citizenry president nkrumah stated thus to travel this road every member of the cpp every ghanaian man and woman every boy and girl all of us together must work and give service to the nation to the best of our ability even the disabled the blind and the crippled must be equipped in this great crusade to contribute their quota to the total national effort he spoke against the advocates of racialism before ghana attained independence he was against race discrimination whatever form it may take people have not been expelled from the country or prevented from entering ghana because of their color those who were expelled from the country were responsible for such action and it was due to their subversive political activities he has declared my hatred against imperialists can never dwindle but i want everyone in this country to remember is that we are fighting against a system and not against any individual race or color i do not believe in racialism and localism the concept africa for the africans does not mean that other races are excluded from it no it only means that africans shall and must govern themselves in their own countries without imperialist and foreign impositions but the people of other races can remain in african soil carry on their legitimate avocations and live on terms of peace friendship and equality with africans on their own soil social and economic rehabilitation of ghana under the leadership of nkrumah after independence was achieved early in in that years christmas eve message to the nation nkrumah declared my first objective is to abolish from ghana poverty ignorance and disease we shall measure our progress by the improvement in the health of our people by the number of children in school and by the quality of their education by the availability of water and electricity in our towns and villages and by the happiness which our people take in being able to manage their own affairs and no more by alien powers the welfare of our people is our chief pride and it is by this that my government will ask to be judged i think that what follows will show that the judgment on this test will prove to be favorable the problem of social and economic transformation recognized the limiting circumstances from the beginning of nkrumahs rule economic and social change demands some choices either an outright and fullscale dictatorial regimentation and an imposition of a period of privation is adopted or a combination of foreign capital and technicians to participate in certain essential projects with some sacrifice from the citizenry to finance general social and industrial development will have to be made the ghana government made the latter choice following or using a socialist plan which has four parts the stateowned sector joint state and private enterprise the cooperative movement private enterprise the stateowned sector included electricity and water supplies hydroelectric projects arms and ammunition and alcoholic beverages these services and industries were administered by an industrial development corporation on behalf of the nation this corporation ran an efficient factory for making furniture with ghanaian timber instead of exporting timber and later to import furniture at an exorbitant price brickmaking works and a modern printing establishment to produce daily newspapers government documents and statesponsored books the enterprises jointly owned by the state and private companies was largely an intention rather than practice the idea was to insist upon state participation in monopolies whose interests might beor are incompatible with public interests and in infant industries which need state protection as well as those sick industries which might use subsidies what happens in the western european countries canada and the usa why nationalize steel industries in britain why government contracts and trade tariffs in the usa why guidelines to labour and industries in the usa certain industries had suffered during the colonial period to rehabilitate them cooperatives became a very crucial method for improvement and survival take for example the cocoa problems the middlemen exploited the cocoa farmers while the cocoa swollen root disease devastated the cocoa trees to counteract the activities of the middlemen a voluntary cooperative movement among the farmers developed to great proportions their produce had to be pooled together and selling was done in bulk thereby overcoming the exploitation by the middlemen the cocoa marketing board developed side by side with the cooperatives the government of ghana aimed at integrating the cooperative movement with its national economic planning rivalry between the cooperatives and the cmb was unhealthy and as a result the nkrumah government found a solution by establishing ghana farmers marketing cooperatives and finally gave the country an efficient coordination of this aspect of the national economy since the revenue from cocoa was by far the largest source of national wealth it became necessary that a portion of this revenue should be set aside to contribute to the plans for national construction and social development in november at the opening ceremony of the cocoa house the headquarters of the marketing board nkrumah on behalf of the government stated the accumulated reserves of the cmb are public money held in trust by the government for the benefit of the farmers and the people of this country most of the cocoa farmers patriotically accepted this appreciating the security which it afforded them a large percentage of the reserve funds had been devoted to the development of the cocoa industry itself the following are examples of the disbursement of the fund a cocoa rehabilitation and control of the swollen root disease million million b endowment for the faculty of agriculture of the university of ghana million million c donation to the west african cocoa research institute study of cocoa disease and the development of highyielding varieties million million d new hospitals schools social servicesroads water supply clinics and dispensaries and certain projects in the economic development plan million million the cocoa swollen root disease has no known cure and the only practical measure was to persuade the farmers to cut down the infected trees with compensation a national campaign was launched and finally the cocoa swollen root disease was eradicated by cutting them down diamond industry the ghana government endeavored to bring about the africanization of the diamond industry on cooperative lines similar to the cocoagrowers organization this cooperative would train africans to serve as valuers polishers and graders of the diamonds in addition an agency under ghanaian control would be set up in london to place the diamonds on the world market the complete africanization of the diamond industry would inevitably place the wealth in the hands of ghanaians for their own enjoyment the scheme met with violent opposition from the vested interests in the diamond industry domestically and of course internationally england france and the usa delay occurred but by plans had been endorsed by the government to place percent of the ghanaian diamond industry on a cooperative basis and in a marketing board was set up to sell the ghanaian supply to dealers the development of the diamond industry in ghana has been impressive in the output was a little over carats by output rose to million carats valued at million million approximately the world demand for ghanaian diamonds is great since they are mostly suited for industrial purposes the expansion of the diamond industry is part of the diversification of the economy to save it from dependence on one crop king cocoa economists know the danger of oneindustry state it is always in a precarious position if prices fall the whole economy is affected the governments agriculture department followed the national plan to diversify the agricultural sector of the economy the aims were to provide enough food for the growing population and to provide funds for financing the various development projects it also gave balance to the nations economy bananas coffee coconuts copra kola nuts rubber tobacco cattleranching vegetables and fishing were developed according to the national plan prior to the execution of this diversification food had to be imported in seven years from to in conjunction with the agricultural diversification the aiding factors such as the use of fertilizers seed dressing new varieties improved husbandry techniques mechanized cultivation in grassland areas the distribution of seedlings at cheap prices credits for tools and equipment a service of tractors were all established irrigation and water conservation were developed including the construction of dams in the northern and upper regions all these were accomplished within the period of nkrumahs administration the ghanaian pattern of agricultural socialism was well developed stateplanned and serviced cooperatively run comprehensive and nationwide fishing prior to independence was primitive and the supply very inadequate for postindependence fishing was revolutionized the traditional canoe fleet with paddle were motorized fish catch increased cold storage plants in inland areas and cold stores plant and canning in tema were established these have been done to achieve economic efficiency and to transform the diet of the people providing them with adequate supplies of high quality protein which they needed so much the builders of the new ghana realized that for the nation s wealth to be increased so that the standards of life of its people their material conditions health education and cultural fulfillment increased to desired levels their agricultural advance must be accompanied by an equal industrial advance this provides the achievement of a balanced economic and social growth the first need for industry is power electric power for machinery for processing raw materials for facilitating refrigeration for the operating of chemical plants and for smelting minerals to this end the volta river project was geared the volta river varies in flow in the ratio of as much as tol between flood and low water the flood before the dam project was running waste the project is intended to store the water in the manmade lake covering square miles providing a reserve for the low water season enabling a constant flow through tne great dam which will generate the power the lake will provide a new highway to the distant north helping to break down isolation and backwardness a new fishing industry will be created and the square miles of land around the shores of the lake will be flooded each season at high water amenable to intensive cultivation of crops such as rice there is an incidental aspect of the volta river project which is exceptionally pleasing besides the material purposes new modern towns will spring up and some have sprung up the site of the dam and power station will be kept free from ugliness to make it a true attraction for ghanaians and tourists from abroad thereby helping to develop tourism as a source of revenue this project was initiated by the government as a part of ghanas patterned construction its origin was essentially socialist but the project itself is partly public enterprise and partly private enterprise the power development was undertaken from public resources while the development of the smelter remained private enterprise the dam the power station the manmade lake the water highway the distribution of electricity throughout ghanas industrial sector have all been on the side of public enterprise another aspect of the move towards industrialization was the attempt to overcome the key drawback in the development of ghana the lack of a good harbor goods and passengers abroad seagoing vessels had to be transferred to boats some distance from land and rowed through the surf to the dock at accra a modern deepwater port providing berths capable of handling up to tons a year was constructed at tema miles from accra at a cost of million million two new towns were developed as a result of this construction tema new town for the dock workers and tema new village for the fishermen and their families what was the situation regarding educational facilities since independence any noticeable improvement the following statistics points out the facts see statistics during the colonial period tuition cost of books and all the other incidental expenses were paid by parents who had children in school after independence tuition was abolished in primary and secondary schools generous government scholarships were given to ghanaians who study in the universities in ghana as well as those in foreign universities mass education meant more in ghana villagers deep in the forests were under instructors cutting a way through the trees and undergrowth and building fewer roads to the main routes to the towns so that they could exchange their produce for previously unknown goods in the shops and link themselves with the social and cultural development which was sweeping the country they built halls and schools dug trenches for irrigation organized the collection of refuse thereby improving sanitation this was an extraordinary voluntary cooperation in personal progress and community betterment the youth was organized and known as the national workers brigade to perform community service the boys were apprenticed in masonry carpentry plumbing automobile fitting electrical engineering vehicle mechanics and tractor operations the girls learned the marketing of produce food preservation household duties secretarial and office duties they were sent to different camps for their training here was a nation recruiting its youth not principally in military forces but into a disciplined army devoted entirely to constructive community activity as an index of the national economic growth the gnp rose from million in to million in percentage increase was from percent annual growth to percent growth rate in something should be said about the man dr nkrumah the leader of the ghana movement his conception of socialism demands personal services in contrast with personal gain british and american newspaper reports have many times presented a different image the public in these two countries as well as in their satellite nations have been given the picture of a man who sought grandeur and ostentation when corruption invaded his ministers secretaries of departments he demanded that each of his ministers should reveal his income and possessions and how they were obtained the clue to the corrupt behaviors of his ministers was their construction of palatial mansions which they could not afford in their circumstances and salaries he on behalf of the government insisted that they should show examples to the nation that they should surrender all financial and business interests and live at reasonable standard ministers who did not conform were dismissed two among those dismissed were later reappointed partly in recognition of their past service to ghanaian freedom and partly because of their later adherence to principle their abilities and influence dr nkrumah believed in the complete freedom of all africans people of african descent and other peoples of the world equality and dignity of the human being was his first order in life one may question why the leaders of the opposition were arrested and detained for long periods without trial why the disturbances in ghana why the attempts to assassinate him the answers lie in understanding what african socialism means and what was the stage of alien political development in ghana inherited from the colonial administration dr nkrumahs government espoused socialism as an economic system in the context of african communalism which in no way is a prototype of european socialism de graft johnson made this clear when he wrote what our social structure which may be termed communalism cannot cope with is the modern world with its capitalist industries and our task here is to adapt the principles of socialism to our own particular mode of life alternately we can develop our basic traditional institutions in keeping with the basic principles of communalism to fit modern conditions i think we shall attempt both in african political systems there were never opposition parties per se people were active and participated fully in town and village discussions as a body gave their assent and registered their opposition to issues as they arose there was unity in diversity it was the paramount chief who acted as the voice of the people the socialism of africa differs from the european type european socialism was born of conflict the conflict that was sanctified into a philosophy the class war was looked upon not as something evil but as something necessary and good as prayer is to christianity or to islam so civil war class war is to european versions of socialisma means inseparable from the end each becomes the basis of a whole way of life the european socialist cannot think of his socialism without its fathercapitalism such a contradiction africans find intolerable it virtually says that without capitalism and the conflict which it creates within any society there can be no socialism african socialism did not arise from the agrarian revolution it did not start from the existence of conflicting classes in society it started as a family society its objective is the extended family africans have no more need to be converted to socialism than they have to be taught democracy europeans and other imperialists remain ignorant of the fact that socialism and democracy are rooted in the african past which produced contemporary africans these africans acknowledge that socialism must look to wider horizons for the extended family nyerete stated modern african socialism can no longer confine the idea of the social family within the limits of the tribe nor indeed of the nation for no true african socialist can look at a line drawn on a map and say the people on this side of that line are my brothers but these who happen to live on the other side of it have no claim on me every individual on this african continent is his brother the above also portrays nkrumahs socialism every african national leader had been engaged in the supreme need to build a sense of nationhood from diverse racial tribal and religious loyalties this has not been an easy task ghana had this problem particularly in the resistance of the ashanti and some northern peoples to incorporation in a united state it had to overcome the opposition of powerful chiefs regarded as the spiritual heads of communities as well as their political masters such chiefs are no more competent or capable of running the modern state nkrumah also inherited the bitter antagonism of the reactionary professional and business elite who he ousted as directors of the national movement the social disturbances were undoubtedly accented by conspiracies on the part of some of the opposition leaders who by all means were the paid agents of the british and the nato allies and the frustrated members of the cpp to overthrow the regime by assassinating president nkrumah some of those ghanaians who were definitely in the assassination plot which they attempted were apprehended and detained without trial their trial would have meant the death penalty and the pressure of public opinion would have made commutation of the sentence difficult the attacks on president nkrumahs life were misinterpreted by the western press as signs of unpopularity the facts prior to the coup point to a different direction the resistance of the ghanaian anglophiles the subversive activities of the local agents of the capitalist world the psychological poverty of arch tribalists and the unending quest to keep the black man down by the same ugly greedy and wicked imperialists account for the fall of nkrumahs government but not the man the coup on nkrumahs government february dealt a catastrophic blow to the african continent take a statistic of the black world and see the identical damage done to our brave leaderspatrice lumumba of the congo balewa of nigeria malcolm_x of the usa those living but ousted from office president nkrumah and president ben bella of algeria why this pattern the answer is very clear to all thinking peoples the fall of nkrumahs government is the fall of africa and africans his leadership was a pacesetter a guiding star and an inspirational one since the tragedy the continent has fallen into oblivion the portuguese in angola and mozambique the ian smiths and harold wilsons the nazi republic of south africa and their international cohorts are happy ghana and ghanaians are no more independent if we understand what freedom and independence means how can it be free when a major sector of the economy has been taken over by the foreign capitalists ghana is now starting on the path of having apartheid schools the london sunday telegraph of march writes the ghanaian staff of ashanti goldfields are incensed over the setting up of an allwhite primary school by the management and refusal to allow senior africans to form their staff association applications from ghanaian senior staff to enter their children in such schools have been rejected such a school never existed under nkrumah more than private schools with a fee of have been established this is a move to deny the children of any average worker the opportunity for education on the political front paramount chiefs as of february have been destooled by the military regime terrorism is now the order of the day the ghanaian times of february and published thus reports coming from ashanti give cause for serious concern in ashanti and the central regions and indeed in some other places in scattered areas of the country towns and villages in these areas of the country are being subjected to a wave of terrorism and dacoity unparalleled in the history of this country fear stalks the land in many homes there is not a wink of sleep for man or woman armed robbery is showing upward surge because of the lowebbing relations between the public and the police what an insult to human intelligence the militarycumpolice regime has abolished political party organization it has proclaimed that governing a country without any party or parties is the surest way to ensure democracy what an illusion what a contradiction on the economic front the ghana trade union congress which had pledged its support to the nlc is now begging for recognition which it had under nkrumahs government the u s capitalists have grabbed the ghana economy the firestone rubber company has taken over the stateoperated rubber plantations the u s international hotels corporation now controls all former state hotels advertisement for a managerial post for the nowcontrolled hotels stipulated quite clearly that ghanaian or african applicants will not be considered the economy is stagnating despite the assurance given by britain and the u s a that neocolonialism and capitalism will triumph in ghana as a payment for the criminal coup the british promised a loan of and the usa million finally the most outrageous act of the military regime is the sending away in ghanaian airways all the nationalist refugees from angola mozambique southern rhodesia south west africa and the republic of south africa back to their respective places of origin their military and police escorts handed them over to the imperialist authorities for their final destruction such is the situation the democracy and newlywon freedom for the ghanaians and africa the direct causes of the imperialists attack on nkrumah before the independence of ghana the currency authority was the west african currency board established in by executive decree of the colonial office with headquarters in london the wacb was nothing other than a local agent the control of the commercial banks was under the wacb the monetary policy adopted was at the whims and caprices of the wacb and principally at the dictation of london on march three days before ghana became independent the central bank of ghana was established it thus became the sole bank of issue the banker to the government and other commercial banks the fiscal agent of the government in dealing with important international financial institutions eg the international monetary fund and the world bank it also operated for the government in exchange control as the sole bank of issue it had the power to influence the credit situation with a view to maintaining monetary stability in ghana and the external value of the ghana pound the cbg originated a local money market by issuing on behalf of the government day treasury bills this enabled the ghanaians to invest their money domestically it also curtailed the volume of funds transferred out of ghana to britain such transfers were of a high magnitude prior to the establishment of the central bank the central bank created an atmosphere which encouraged the establishment of indigenous owned and operated commercial banks and also the expansion of branches of the older ones between march and november branch banks increased from to this was the breaking of the monopoly position of the british barclays bank dominion colonial and overseas ltd and bank of west africa ltd since the monopoly position was threatened the foreign owners mounted a series of attacks on the nkrumah government we can see how sincere the british position is free competition in britain and monopoly in africa in line with the goal for relative economic independence a reduction in the high shipping costs of ghanian exports the ghana national shipping line was established after formerly all exports from and imports to ghana had been carried by the british shipping firms the profits from such services accrued to britain the prohibitive shipping charges reduced the profit margin that could have gone to ghana passenger service provided by the shipping firms was controlled by the british with the establishment of the ghana black star line national shipping line the charges on exports and passenger services were reduced to reasonable levels the profits became a source of revenue to be used in financing other economic development projects as well as in expanding the shipping lines a third case of monopoly is the air lines colonial ghana had no national airways the air transport was owned operated and controlled by the british overseas airways corporationair france and panamerican air lines with independence and the establishment of the ghana airways corporation the monopoly position of the british was demolished more revenue was thereby secured for ghana the purchase of some aircraft from the soviet union instead of the more costly ones manufactured by the nato countries contributed to the animosity directed at nkrumahs government the african continent had been described as the sleeping giant dr nkrumah called the african allafrican peoples conference in this conference brought political leaders trade unionists nationalists and others from different works of life together for a common endeavourthe complete liberation of the continent from foreign domination nkrumah had declared in his independence message of march that he would not consider ghana free and independent as long as any portion of the african soil remained under foreign control ghana provided free transportation for revolutionary refugees from the racialist nightmare of angola mozambique southern rhodesia south west africa and the republic of south africa it also aided guinea when it elected to be her own boss and to chart her own destiny rather than remain in the french community and be a province of france imagine such an anarchronism part of the african continent a portion of france making black africans frenchmen this destroys the work of nature the colonial nato countries jubilantly anticipated the collapse of guinea when france pulled out taking with it everything including paperclips and toilet tissue before the african continent had been balkanized brothers and sisters husbands and wives and even tribes were arbitrarily and forcibly separated by the unnatural political boundaries drawn by the greedy europeans today some problems that confront african countries are the offshoots of the unnatural boundaries to overcome such unending division nkrumah by political action and marriage involved the whole of north africa in the united and collective effort of breaking down the artificial disgraceful wall that had separated the african land mass and its peoples finally nkrumah with the cooperation of the late w e b du bois and george padmore initiated the dialogue on the possibility of publishing encyclopedia africana for the purpose of placing african historical cultural and social achievements of antiquity in proper perspective for all these reasons the nato powers mounted their attack on this great african one thing is clear to the patriotic african in fledgling states imperialists interest flourish where there is an atmosphere of dissension they are endangered in an atmosphere of national unity and stability some people have accused the government of having too much power over the national economy i have to remind those people that under colonial administration the little postal telegraphic and rail communications broadcasting electricity and water services that existed were all publicly owned and administered nobody domestically or internationally raised a cry of woe but as soon as the ghanaians under nkrumahs direction added an airline a shipping line a central bank loud echoes of dictatorship started to roar in the firmament since then ghana has met with active resistance from vested interest groups within and without in the effort to build a national economy jules ferry premier of france in when he spoke in the chamber of deputies in defence of the colonial policy of the french government stated thus it is not clear that the great states of modern europe the moment their industrial power is founded are confronted with an immense and difficult problem which is the basis of industrial life the very condition of existencethe question of markets have you not seen the great industrial nations one by one arrive at a colonial policy and we can say that this colonial policy is a luxury for modern nations not at all gentlemen this policy is for all of us a necessity like the market itself today as you know the law of supply and demand freedom of exchange the influence of speculations all these move in a circle which extends to the ends of the world colonies are for rich countries one of the most lucrative methods of investigating capital i say that france which is glutted with capital and which has exported considerable quantities has an interest in looking at this side of the colonial question it is the same question as that of outlets for our manufacture the same situation applies to the motives of neocolonialists and imperialists albert sarraut french colonial secretary of state in spoke in stronger terms in paris what is the use of painting the truth at the start colonization was not an act of civilization nor was it a desire to civilize it was an act of force motivated by interests an episode in the vital competition which from man to man from group to group has gone on ever increasing the people who set out to seize colonies in distant lands were thinking primarily of themselves and were working for their own profits and conquering for their own power the origin of colonization is nothing else than enterprise of individual interests a onesided and egotistical imposition of the strong upon the weak you can see who really thinks of nkrumah as a dictator is it the true african no no it is the neocolonialists and their lackeys in ghana and the rest of africa the coup was effected by the imperialists lackeys in ghana in concert with thier international neocolonialist powers whatever might have happened nkrumahs philosophy remains indestructible and will be fostered in africa and in ghana as long as this planet earth exists any persons have wondered what were the characteristics that made marcus garvey a personality to be reckoned how is it that this little black man born in a small island could conceive the idea of redeeming the continent of africa and uniting a scattered race heredity in the first instance played an important part in his life he had a sympathetic heart and an expansive mind he was gentle and softspoken just like his mother but when provoked or on a platform the maroon blood of his father would boil within him and he would roar like a lion in projecting to the world the oppression fears hopes and ambitions of his peopleinto this dynamic personality came ideas and those ideas repeatedly projected themselves in his mind until they developed into idealssomething that must be achieved must be accomplished then the driving urge from within forced action the appalling conditions of his people everywhere cried aloud for a change as he said in a speech everywhere i go i see the poverty misery and suffering of my people i ask where is the black mans government where are his statesmen where is his flag his battleships and planes to protect him from oppression and wrong the answer isthere are none and i vowed to help him free himself and determine his own destiny for nationhood is the highest ideal of all peoples thus he found his purpose in life and pursued it to the bitter end without sparing himself and those who were loyal to him serving his race became an obsession with him and everything else had to fit into his workwife children and relatives must be expendable in this great cause embodied in his slogan africa for the africans those at home and those abroad his motto one god one aim one destiny as a solution to the negro problem in america garvey was vigorously opposed to miscegenationrace suicideas a way out of the political social and economic thralldom of the black minority he protested against the plea of interracial organizations for integration as a final goal for argued he the negro is not now equal to the whites who are in the majority and in powerin all material phases of life so that integration if achieved on a national scale would be unequal integration and therefore humiliating to black americans during the process and they would be absorbed into the white society and thereby lose their identity and any distinct contribution they make to the greatness of the nation the following are some excerpts from his philosophy and opinions which disclose the workings of the mind of this man the mission of the universal negro improvement association is to arouse the sleeping consciousness of negroes everywhere to the point where he will as one concerted body act for our own preservation by laying the foundation for such we will be able to work toward the glorious realization of an emancipated race and a constructed nation nationhood is the only means by which civilization can completely protect itself it is the highest ideal of any peopleto govern themselves while others are raising the cry for a white america a white canada a white australia we without reservation raise the cryand loudly toofor africas freedom to fight for african redemption does not mean that we must give up our domestic fights for political justice and industrial rights it does not mean that we must become disloyal to any government or to any country wherein we were born each and every race outside of its domestic national loyalty has a loyalty to itself therefore it is foolish for the negro to talk about not being interested in his own racial political social and industrial destiny we can be loyal american citizens or british subjects as the irishman or the jew and yet fight for the redemption of africa and complete emancipation of the race out of the unsettled state and condition of the world will come such revolutions that will give each and every race that is oppressed the opportunity to march forward the last world war world war i brought the opportunity to many heretofore subject races to regain their freedom the next world war will give africa the opportunity for which we are preparing we are going to have wars and rumors of wars in another or years we will have a changed world politically and africa will not be one of the most backward nations but africa shall be i feel sure one of the greatest commonwealths that will once more hold up the torchlight of civilization and bestow the blessings of freedom liberty and democracy upon all mankind power is the only argument that satisfies man except the individual the race or the nation has power that is exclusive it means that that individual race or nation will be bound by the will of the others who possess this great qualification it is the physical and pugilistic power of harry wills that makes white men afraid to fight him it was the industrial and scientific power of the teutonic race that kept it for years as dictator of the economic and scientific policies of europe it is the naval and political power of great britain that keeps her mistress of the seas it is the commercial and financial power of the united states of america that makes her the greatest banker in the world hence it is advisable for the negro to get power of every kind power in education science industry politics and higher government that kind of power that will stand out signally so that other races and nations can see and if they will not see then feel man is not satisfied or moved by prayers or petitions but every man is moved by that power of authority which forces him to do even against his will thus spoke garvey in the s it is remarkable that he did not harbour hate and bitterness in his heart against those who doublecrossed him turned government informers and others who used the press to make vicious lying statements against him especially in the garvey must go campaign in america launched by his rivals and which ended in his trial imprisonment and deportation said he if i kept piling up hate in my heart against those who daily seek my destruction my spirit would be poisoned by it how then could i love and serve my people they can destroy my body but they will never be able to break my will or suppress my fighting spirit i have breathed it into the minds of millions of my people the world over no human agency can stop us it is the will of god that this race of mine shall determine its own destiny and take its rightful place as equals among gods children the million dollar question asked by white reporters from news agencies and influential newspapers was mr garvey how are you going to redeem africa he answered in the year africa will be redeemedregardless of the armaments of the imperial powersby emancipating the minds of subjected peoples to realize and know that freedom of thought and action are the inherent right of all peoples after that free thought will devise ways and means to battle its way to freedom the small european imperial nations will fight the big powers for more expansion in africa and asia when this happens the peoples of these continents will get the big opportunity to free themselves as y l things will be too hot for europe to hold what she has as far back as garvey predicted the independence of the west indies in an article in the african times and orient review london he stated as one who knows the people well i make no apology for prophesy ing that there will soon be a turning point in the history of the west indies and that the people who inhabit that portion of the western hemisphere will be the instruments of uniting a scattered race who before the close of many centuries will found an empire on which the sun shall shine as ceaselessly as it shines on the empires of the north today time rolls on and in the year human rights yearwe found nearly all of the territories of africa and the west indies independent and represented in the united nations the negro problem in america has become the white mans problemhow to stem the tide of black_powerwhich is generated by black unity the basic power a small minority of oppressed people can achieve in a majority white nation is to take action in their best interests the new negro is thinking for himself and by himself and not in terms of being an appendage to a white society but with the backing of independent nations of his race and kindred spirit nuclear power is misused to decimate people and to destroy countries but black_power is generated to protect people from injustices and wrongs white supremacists cannot tap its source although they can destroy some of its exponents they cannot destroy the ideal it is in every black man woman and childs heart to get his human rights and to keep them to maintain them against all odds it is the spirit of garveyism it is an ideal a goal a working philosophy it motivates peoples to great achievements it is eternal in the breasts of peoples of african descent everywhere we met almost two weeks before the interview which follows below abdias do nascimento and i he did not have the lingering anxiety i had because when we my wife melba and i arrived at the first reception given for him he leapt to embrace us joy in his eye i then stood back for a little while looking him over trying to assess where he was coming from so now eye meets brothers eye against and across whatever lies of whatever white guidebook there is affirmation in the silences of this movement beyond the superficialities of the oppressors languages we use the language we speak the language of solidarity and brotherhood our spirit claws its way out of the depths of our purposes through our eyes we shake hands again hug brother meets brotherall barriers gone do you know this fool i showed him a copy of negro digest septoct with a photograph of eduardo de oliveira the black brazilian poet who is one of those familiar abominable apologists for white racism nascimento shook his head in disgust nodded a painful yes and asked for a copy of that issue of negro digest to show to the people in brazil abdias do nascimento is an afrobrazilian playwright actor painter director and founder of ten teatro experimental do negro nascimento is in the united states to check out the black theater he would like to see a dialogue between brazil africa and the rest of afroamerica he hopes to have a black arts and culture festival in brazil in to help unite our efforts he would also like to see a black world magazine published in french portuguese and english with contributors from all over the black world because our problems and desires are similar following is our interview as i recorded it in new york dr kwame nkrumah more than any present day vr african leader has stood out as the most articulate and consistent champion of the african peoples struggle against imperialism colonialism and their associated refinements of neocolonialism and racial oppression his numerous books speeches and political activities spanning a period of over twenty years testify to his prodigious labor and dedication in the service of the oppressed people of africa and their equally oppressed cousins in the western world particularly in the united states it is not without significance that among people who were to fire nkrumahs own political consciousness were those remarkable and selfless afroamerican leaders marcus garvey and dr w e b du bois in africa itself nkrumah has been the most consistent advocate of the twin goals of total african liberation and unity he has seen that without total liberation africa could never control her own destiny or realize her full potentiality he has also seen that without political unity african independence would remain nothing but a shell protecting foreign interests bent upon the plunder of the wealth of the continent and the economic subjugation of its people while it is true that the african people have in general sacrificed considerably to attain their political independence that independence could only have value for them to the extent that it was linked up with genuine economic independence many of the miniscule states of africa which presently boast themselves politically independent are unlikely ever to attain a genuine allround independence they will remain prey to those who wield the levers of economic power they will remain in other words neocolonial client states whose economic lifelines and political orientation will remain essentially at the beck and call of foreign interests it is on this general and valid ground that nkrumah has called for a union of african states such that the independence for which the people of africa have craved for centuries may become meaningful unity would result in the pooling of energies and resources it would constitute a bulwark against foreign attempts to exploit the young states of africa without it each small state must remain prey to foreign intrigues and manoeuvres much as in latin america nkrumahs prognosis on the likely fate of small disunited states in africa has already been amply shown to be valid numerous coups already have taken place all over africa and in most cases directed against progressive regimes seeking to bring about the genuine independence of their countries while no exhaustive study has been made to show whose hand was behind these upheavalsalways a difficult exercise given the nature of the casethere is little doubt that foreign interests were involved to a more or less decisive extent certainly nkrumahs analysis of the ghanaian coup which overthrew his government in february leaves the reader persuaded to the view that this was not a purely ghanaian militarypolice putsch the hand that fired the gun against its own government was indeed ghanaian the brain that hatched the plot or fomented its execution was not but how did the coup take place who spearheaded the revolt why what explains its apparently easy success and what future for independent africa the above represents some of the questions nkrumah has sought to answer in this book for analytical purposes the book may be taken as consisting of three interconnected themes the onset and mechanism of the coup itself the internal ghanaian political situation and the lessons for other african states that the ghanaian experience provides we shall try to deal with these themes in turn hereunder i dr nkrumah had left ghana on february on an official trip to hanoi to try to discover possibilities of ending the vietnam was as early as possible he was going to hanoi at the invitation of president ho chi minh on arrival in peking on the th however he was to learn from the chinese government that a coup had that day taken place in ghana immediately a decision was made to discontinue the trip to hanoi and a statement was issued to the press urging the people of ghana to stand firm and resist the illegal usurpation of power by the army and police in addition various assignments were given to the officials accompanying the president prior to the return to africa of the entire party surprisingly however these highranking officials seemed completely stunned to paralysis by the coup and seemed more concerned about their own personal fortunes under the new order than about resisting the illegal seizure of power thus for example foreign minister a quaison sackey a former ghanaian united nations representative and president of the general assembly of the un was instructed to go to addis ababa to represent the legal government of ghana at a meeting of oau foreign ministers but he chose instead to fly to accra the miiltarypolice junta quickly put him in jail on arrival though he was soon to be released it is significant that the only politically reliable people in the presidents party at this time of tremendous shock and stress were the security officers and members of dr nkrumahs personal staff it is these loyal individuals who accompanied him to guinea where he has remained to date as for the actual coup itself it appears that the major figure here was police commissioner john harlley it was he who maintained contact with two junior army officers emmanuel kotoka and akwasi afrifa whose two garrisons were used in the storming of key strong points in accra on the early morning of february with their commissioner at the very center of the plot the police of course offered every facility to the advancing troops indeed the only serious resistance the soldiers encountered was at the residence of the army chief of staff general barwah and at flagstaff house the official residence of the president general barwah refused to join the conspiracy and was shot on the spot by kotoka at flagstaff house tremendous resistance was offered by the presidential guard regiment for many hours until the guard was overpowered by superior numbers and weaponry some of the reasons for the coup will receive mention subsequently it is interesting however to note that these were far different from those which kotoka and afrifa gave the troops under their command the soldiersmany of whom are apparently illiteratewere told that the coup had to take place because a nkrumah intended to send them to fight the ian smith regime in rhodesia b nkrumah also intended to send them to fight in vietnam and c with the departure of the president for north vietnam there was in any case no government the army it was pointed out had to take power or else someone else would the russians it was revealed were already installed in a tunnel under flagstaff house and more of them were on their way to ghana to take over the government pp this jumble of fictitious and inconsistent argumentations apparently sounded plausible enough to induce the troops to action the important thing here however is to note how a coup which was hailed elsewhere as popular and justified had to be backed up with a series of falsehoods by its instigators in order to sell it to presumably reluctant soldiers for if a country is lying under the boot of an oppressoras ghana has been alleged in the western press to have beenwhy should it even be necessary to explain in detail that the country deserves to be liberated above all why invent reasons to explain why the action is necessary the probability seems strong that the plotters were not fired by any high national ideals their action sprang essentially from personal and power motives and therefore had to be backed up by a stream of hysterical demagoguery which could at least give a semblance of plausibility if not respectability to their actions but why is it that the coup was not greeted with any widespread popular resistance this is after all one element which antinkrumah propaganda has seized on to substantiate the allegation that the coup was popularly welcomed nkrumah suggests several factors that explain the apparent welcome that the coup met from the ordinary people first the army made it clear that any resister would be summarily and brutally dealt with the case of general barwah has already been referred to several other lesswell known people were similarly savaged moreover all top party and government officials were rounded up early in the exercise so that the masses remained leaderless at a crucial stage in the process of arresting the soldiers did not scruple to torture and severely beat up their victims for example professor kojo abraham at that time vice chancellor of the university of ghana and a noted scholar was severely beaten before being thrown into prison the manuscript of a book he was writing was publicly burnt nazistyle while he was taken into prison pp second nkrumah points out that resistance was slow in coming and when it did start it remained largely underground the april attempt at a countercoup seems to bear this out third there were certain elements especially in accra who genuinely welcomed the coup because the previous government had been unmindful of their special interests the relatively privileged professional and business strata including the famous accra market women no doubt chafed under the various austerity measures which the economic development of the country had made necessary they resented having to make sacrifices when independence should have meant the arrival of the golden age in any event these elements plus those released from prisons in order to give way to the thousands of new inmates together with others who were sheerly intimidated by the show of militarypolice power paraded in the popular demonstrations to which so much importance has been given in certain circles another reason for the lack of much overt resistance may well be a more general one in an underdeveloped country where communication lines are limited and centralized the advantage in any contest for power tends to go to whoever can seize these lines of communication at the outset seizure of communications means the ability to transmit messages favourable to one side immediately and widely the opposition is in this case put at a decided disadvantage for not only is it incapable of putting its case across it has also virtually to fight on terrain chosen by the dominant group since it is the latter which through its control of official communication channels selects the issues for debate no wonder then that most coup leaders place the radio station the post office etc as priority targets on the way to the seizure of powerthe ghanaian coup was as already indicated engineered by the leadership of the police force in collaboration with certain segments of the army but excluding its top personnel the new regime came to rest on three institutional pillarsthe army the police and the civil service bureaucracy the new government christened the national liberation council or nlc comprises four army officers and four police officers the chairman joseph ankrah is an army officer whom nkrumah had earlier retired but whom the young putschists pressed back into service to give an aura of respectability to the junta it appears that the civil service generally fell into line with the new order without a murmur without the collaboration of this service the junta would no doubt have found it well nigh impossible to run the country neither the police nor the army could have taken effective control of the state machinery on its own or in combination the civil service it appears was quite happy to facilitate the militarypolice grab of power we will return to this point later the one thing that stands out about members of the ghanaian junta and a factor which nkrumah deals with at some length is their utter lack of any political experience none of them had ever been involved in politics before the coup none of them ever took part in the liberation of their country from colonialism on the contrary several of them had respectable posts in the colonial army and police force both of which were used by the british imperialists to suppress the freedom movement which dr nkrumah and others successfully led indeed one of the junta members police officer deku played some part in the arrest and imprisonment of nkrumah himself in the preindependence days when the british colonialists were engaged in the harassment and suppression of nkrumahs proindependence convention peoples party in view of all this the reader may well ask for whom then did these latterday patriots choose to liberate ghana when their country was a happy hunting ground of british colonial exploiters they not only did nothing to liberate it they zealously collaborated with the foreign exploiter to suppress those who struggled for a genuine liberation now that the fruits of that struggle were beginning to flourish our loyal police and military officers come on the scene topple their own countrys popularly elected government while mumbling hypocritical phrases about national liberation the evidence for the inference that the juntas loyalties are to foreign imperialists and not to ghana or africa does not have to be derived solely from nkrumahs book a member of the junta col a afrifa has himself written a book on the coup the ghana coup london frank cass in this book afrifa argues among other things that the coup became necessary because nkrumahs panafricanist goals were misguided he makes clear that the quest for african liberation and unity was wrong that what was necessary was the strengthening of ghanas relations with britain and the british empire now known as the commonwealth in his own words organization of african unity or no organization of african unity i will claim my citizenship of ghana and of the commonwealth in any part of the world i have been trained in the united kingdom as a soldier and i am prepared to fight alongside my friends in the united kingdom in the same way as canadians and australians will do how could we be friends belonging to the commonwealth and stay out in time of commonwealth adversity here then is a mind trained to be loyal to its imperialist master and a mind which becomes outraged by any suggestion that an independent african state has any right to stay out in time of the empires adversity whatever that might be this slavish hankering for a return to the womb of the mother country is not confined to the members of the junta the prominent civilian supporters of the regime are generally men who have in the past shown their hatred of complete independence for their country as nkrumah points out p some of these men eg dr busia even petitioned the british government in the s against granting independence to the then gold coast arguing that the country was not yet ready for such independence the coup has presumably given them an opportunity to put their peculiar principles into practice it will be interesting to see what sort of politicalconstitutional contraption they will put together for the newly liberated ghana as already indicated one feature of the men spearheading the coup u in ghana is their common record of loyal service to the british colonial regime that preceded the nkrumah government the question naturally arises as to why nkrumah continued to maintain an army a police force and a civil service all of whose top officers were largely a carryover from the colonial past if you are going to set up a revolutionary government dedicated to radically new policy orientations and programs surely the last person you want to work with is the erstwhile defender of the imperialist presence why then did nkrumah assume that he could pursue his radical policies at home and abroad with the assistance of the inherited forces of conservatism and reaction nkrumah argues that his pursuit of both ghanaian socioeconomic development and panafricanism necessitated the africanization of the state structures wherever possible he points out for example that ghana would have presented an uninspiring picture in panafricanist circles if its national army were british officered p it was therefore necessary to put africans in charge and the individuals available for this were those who had served in the colonial army or police force this reviewer remains somewhat unimpressed with this argument the africanization argument is fraught with all kinds of illusions after all what is the difference between a whiteofficered army and a blackofficered one if both sets of officers owe allegiance to foreign interests in ghana it seems quite evident that army officers like afrifa steeped in british traditions and modes of thought as revealed partly in the above citation from his book were as much a liability for nkrumahs government as any actual whitefaced british officers would have been to suppose there was any advantage in substituting black officers for white regardless of the ideological orientation of those same black officers was quite illusory when we look at the civil service bureaucracy we are again struck by the prevalence here too of the colonial hangover as in the army and police as already suggested the civil service seems to have welcomed the armypolice coup warmly and to have proceeded to serve the new regime quite loyally how is it that these bureaucrats could switch political masters just as easily as women change fashions nkrumahs answer here is that the civil service had a tradition of serving whatever government was in power and that therefore they went along with the new regime p here again one feels this is only a very partial explanation after all the ghanaian civil service cannot have had any tradition of serving whatever government was in power it can only have had experience of two types of governmentthe colonial and the postindependence governments if the suggestion in the book is that the civil service even in the colonial era developed the tradition of serving any government the inference is quite wrong the colonial regime was one and the same throughout the colonial period no matter how frequent the turnover of british governors and top officials might be these were changes of personnel not of system it is therefore quite erroneous to say the civil service had a tradition of serving any government a more accurate judgement is the one nkrumah hints at when he observes many of the senior officials all originally served with the old colonial regime which had opposed trade unionism and socialism in any form and was against any real representation of the people in government behind the scenes the civil servants always looked back to the colonial times when their senior membersin practice ran the country p what emerges from the foregoing discussion is the existence in a country like ghana of several significant centers of powerarmy police and bureaucracyall of which were manned at the most vital sensitive levels by personnel whose political loyalties were at best equivocal nkrumah gives several illustrations of the unreliability of some of these top officials thus for example at one time he asked the attorney general to investigate a case of diamond smuggling it transpired that the linchpin in this operation was a certain white man who had some years previously been deported from ghana he had however been readmitted into the country after his deportation order had been revoked by police commissioner harlley see above harlley of course had no such authority by then he simply used nkrumahs name to revoke the deportation order without bothering to obtain the presidents permission the information relating to the deportee and his contacts with top officers of the ghanaian police force was passed by the attorney general on to the chief of the civil service so he could pass it on to the president the said chief however did not see it that way and the information never reached the president until much later though even then it did not reach him through the usual channels see pp it is clear that the army police and bureaucratic apparatus in ghana were fertile ground for intrigues and any foreigninspired attempts to subvert the government of the day with officers of such unreliability and doubtful loyalty any foreign interests intent on removing nkrumah from power would have a relatively easy time of doing it this possibility seems to have in fact been exploited by at least one foreign power let us quote the author himself in ghana the embassies of the united states britain and west germany were all implicated in the plot to overthrow my government it is alleged that u s ambassador franklin williams offered the traitors million dollars to carry out a coup detat afrifa harlley and kotoka were to get a large share of this if they would assassinate me at accra airport as i prepared to leave for hanoi i understand afrifa said i think i will fail and declined the offer so apparently did the others and who is this franklin williams who allegedly attempted to buy ghanaian army and police officers to kill their own president let us again allow the author to speak it is particularly disgraceful that it should have been an afroamerican ambassador who sold himself out to the imperialists and allowed himself to be used in this way it was this same man who deliberately lied when he publicly described the coup as bloodless however his treachery provides a sharp reminder of the insidious ways in which the enemies of africa can operate in the usa the uncle tom figure is well known p the lesson from all this is that those progressive african governments which would survive the strains and stresses of the present era in the world must keep constantly on the look out for the enemy from without and from within in these days of neocolonialism a foreign power bent on toppling the government of some small underdeveloped republic does not have to dispatch an army to accomplish the purpose all that is necessary is to find some reliable natives willing to act catspaw for a fee and to pay them accordingly the result can then be hailed from the rooftops as a great victory for democracy and freedom and the former leaders can then be denounced and maligned as if they never made any positive contribution to their country hence in ghana today nkrumahs contributions to ghanas achievement of independence to the economic development of his country to its educational and social advance and to the struggle for african liberation and unity etc all these tremendous contributions are deemed unworthy even of perfunctory mention by the partisans of the nlc instead all the praise is being heaped on the foreign business men who have been scouring the country in a desperate attempt to make a fat buck whilst the going is good the african revolution if it is to succeed at all will never do so on the basis of indiscriminate alliances and compromises between progressive forces and decadent proimperialist elements what is required is the establishment of a thoroughgoing revolutionary movement based on mass support and participation and resting on a politically reliable institutional base the revolution is made by the people it is for the people its survival and the realization of its objectives belong with the people its makers the objectives of the revolution cannot be attained through the agency of those whose sympathies lie elsewherepfumo dzvuku sam greenlee author of the novel the spook who sat by the door says that eight american publishers turned down his novel and that he finally had to take it to england to get it published it is easy to understand why the spook who sal by the door is perhaps the first black revolutionary novel to be published by a whiteowned commercial publishing firm either in america or england this is decidedly not to ignore the black commandos by juiian moreau a revolutionary novel which was privately published in now with mr greenlees novel out there in the world of books where it cannot be entirely overlooked there is a good chance that an american publisher will be persuaded to consideror reconsiderit and since nothing is more imitative than a commercial publisher perhaps attention will turn in turn to mr moreaus novel this however is an occasion for discussing mr greenlees novel in brief the novel concerns the adventures of one dan freeman a bright young man out of chicagos south side who travels the familiar route from grating poverty up to middleclass comfort via government employment mr freeman even achieves one of those firsts the black bourgeoisie is known to pursue with such passion and that in this case is the heart of the story dan freeman is selected as the first negro member of the central intelligence agency cia and he gets the chancethe coveted opportunity to sit by the door so that all the world knows that the cia is integrated but author greenlee has more things up his sleeve than the rise to eminence to one enterprising bourgie and satire is one of them his treatment of the machinations of dan freeman in the world of politics and power is light slick and hip seriousness nevertheless lies at the center of freemans adventures and at the core of the novel dan freeman is no ordinary bourgie he is one of a breed that is going to be the key to any real alteration of the oppressive american system he is an undercover revolutionary the bulk of the novel deals with what dan freeman does whento the astonishment of nearly everybody he resigns his prestigious government position and returns to chicago to do social work among the troublesome gangs in the city and it would be unfair to potential readers of the novel to tell what finally happens beyond the fact that the novels climax is a kind of watts turned upsidedown it is not unfair though to say that very little that happens is by chance dan freeman who was smart enough to grow up in the ghetto with a record clean enough to clear him for the cia is a young man of very special talents most of which are also possessedundevelopedby thousands of similarly bright young men on the street corners and in the poolrooms and dan freeman sets it as his special task to help develop those latent talents and to give them a new direction the first reaction to mr greenlees novel is applause here is a book which presents a black hero who is both angry and clever a combination which seems all too rare in the racial hustings but even more important the man is committed and he has translated his commitment into practical patterns of action designed to empower the black community in one area where power counts mr greenlees hero begins where the heroes of many black novels end with the knowledge that he lives in a racist society which gives no evidence at all of lifting the real barriers against black freedom and mobility he has faced that reality and made his own decision on the surface he has decidedas his counterparts are expected toto make the best of a bad situation and grab what comforts and advantages are made available to him he has it made with a playboy pad a sleek imported sports car lots of bunny broads and a sophistication garnered from traveling over the world and on the periphery of high places as a favored government employee but mr greenlees hero is cursed with honesty and a clear vision he knows that the life he seems to be living is an illusion and so he rejects it the other life is more dangerous of course but it is the only one he can live and still respect himself dan freeman then is an authentic black hero a revolutionary man andas suchhe is more than a little welcome upon the literary scene but while mr greenlees black hero is both timely and appropriate he does not breathe adequately as flesh and blood mr greenlee strives understandably to stress the superficially the phoniness of his heros personality when superficiality and phoniness are aspects of his cover and yet there are only occasions when the depth and complexity and ambiguity of dan freemans character emerge selfevident undeclared by the author a serious flaw of the novel is the absence of an object against which dan freemans humanity might be bounced he is too much purposeful too little warmth and yet some of this is possibly intended as a writer mr greenlee is swiftpaced and competent even when he dwells a bit too attentively on details of scene and gesture his style is quick and orderly the novel is brief and it is perhaps designed as an entertainment a book to be read first and savored for a long while afterwards the books hero is portrayed as a man of action sureminded and determined and that might be the characterization the author wanted to emphasize in any case the spook who sat by the door sets a publishing precedent it is about a black hero who goes systematically about the business of putting black_power to one of its more effective uses and that is revolutionaryh w fuller he began to feel the prickle of boredom running down his spine and not for the first time that day he thought how extraordinary it must be to be able to talk to a woman of his own kind in an intelligent fashion the black skin shone on his impassive face as he listened to the beat the ebb and flow of talk around him and what the lights glow on the so casually plunging necklines of the women in the room why he wondered was it that a woman of his own african race could walk calmly down the street with her breast swinging bare as she suckled her infant while white women like the fat blonde who sat next to him this evening with her breasts covered but only just demanded attention for her body he was well aware that he could have heror any woman in the room for that matterfor the taking he was not the only african to have belonged to this consciously leftist drearily bohemian group of white people the hit and run liberals others had told him a little about the group but knowledge killed desire and the white skin that should have fascinated repelled him the blonde was saying something to him now he listened i think these meetings of ours are wonderful dont you ncato the husky tone filled her plainest remark with a sexual meaning she was wearing a skirt made of patches of brightly colored material and a black blouse and as she leaned forward to talk to him the blouse fell open the neckline loose displaying the soft rolls of fat right down to her navel she was an improvement on the others he thought he liked her blunt use of his name without prefix or title or query yes he said his tone was flat they are interesting and all the time the false air of comradeship was about him stifling like a cloud of smoke the whites were too hearty the blacks too obsequious there was an unreality about it all she was flirting with him now rubbing her shoulder against him leaning towards him suggesting that she might give him a lift homeand to bedin the big green buick that belonged to her husband he rose to his feet suddenly and looked down at her forcing a smile thank you he said i will walk home i have a headache the cold air outside was like a bath after the stink of perfume and liquor and cigarettes and he came out into it with a deep sense of loss and loneliness education could cut a man like himself off from his own people the women of his race were still chattels to be bought and sold to work and to bear children if he wanted to marry a girl of his own color he would have to look for her in the states and according to all he had heard that didnt work out too well either the men of his race if they were educated became different enslaved with white mens ways and fashions white mens drink and women it is like the loneliness of frankenstein he thought there are no words for it but the sharp air of winter was like a creamy hand on the flesh of his face and as he climbed the hill to the native location the ghetto of the black people the moon shone through the short fir trees until they stood up like dark tufts against the horizon they are like african hair he told himself and suddenly with a great excitement he knew that he must paint them he switched on the light in the bare little room that served him as study and living quarters in oneand pulled out his box of oils and the thick pad of woven paper he always used because it was cheaper than proper canvas he worked swiftly his mind still seeing the queer dark tufts in the moonlight he used the stubs of his brushes to get the cotton wool effect of the trees it was well into the night before he was finished the exhilaration was with him still as he started to put away his things it was probably the best he had done yet he was so carried away by it that he scarcely heard the soft tap of fingers on his door it was the blonde what do you want he asked and then angered by the disturbance the intrusion on his privacy he said brutally do you want me to go to bed with you she flinched a little at that but she answered him evenly enough frank speech was always encouraged in the group no she said i was passing and saw your light still on it was a good five miles out of her direct route home then she caught sight of the picture which he had propped up against a jug on the table the better to look at it ncato that is pretty have you just finished it i didnt know that you painted he said nothing to that for part of him the greater part was artist and was predominant over the part of him that was african as an artist he liked to hear his work being praised even by this bitchblonde she could not take her eyes away from the painting it was as if she had transferred her desire for his body to his painting he saw behind the light greygreen eyes the avidity of her the animal need that was there he saw her wet pink lips i want that picture she said petulant now how much do you want for it what will you take it was late and a great weariness overtook him and the loneliness he looked at the picture memorizing it i do not want it he said in the flat expressionless voice that he normally used you may have it he placed it in her outstretched grasping hands mass education meant more in ghana villagers deep in the forests were under instructors cutting a way through the trees and undergrowth and building fewer roads to the main routes to the towns so that they could exchange their produce for previously unknown goods in the shops and link themselves with the social and cultural development which was sweeping the country they built halls and schools dug trenches for irrigation organized the collection of refuse thereby improving sanitation this was an extraordinary voluntary cooperation in personal progress and community betterment the youth was organized and known as the national workers brigade to perform community service the boys were apprenticed in masonry carpentry plumbing automobile fitting electrical engineering vehicle mechanics and tractor operations the girls learned the marketing of produce food preservation household duties secretarial and office duties they were sent to different camps for their training here was a nation recruiting its youth not principally in military forces but into a disciplined army devoted entirely to constructive community activity as an index of the national economic growth the gnp rose from million in to million in percentage increase was from percent annual growth to percent growth rate in something should be said about the man dr nkrumah the leader of the ghana movement his conception of socialism demands personal services in contrast with personal gain british and american newspaper reports have many times presented a different image the public in these two countries as well as in their satellite nations have been given the picture of a man who sought grandeur and ostentation when corruption invaded his ministers secretaries of departments he demanded that each of his ministers should reveal his income and possessions and how they were obtained the clue to the corrupt behaviors of his ministers was their construction of palatial mansions which they could not afford in their circumstances and salaries he on behalf of the government insisted that they should show examples to the nation that they should surrender all financial and business interests and live at reasonable standard ministers who did not conform were dismissed two among those dismissed were later reappointed partly in recognition of their past service to ghanaian freedom and partly because of their later adherence to principle their abilities and influence dr nkrumah believed in the complete freedom of all africans people of african descent and other peoples of the world equality and dignity of the human being was his first order in life one may question why the leaders of the opposition were arrested and detained for long periods without trial why the disturbances in ghana why the attempts to assassinate him the answers lie in understanding what african socialism means and what was the stage of alien political development in ghana inherited from the colonial administration dr nkrumahs government espoused socialism as an economic system in the context of african communalism which in no way is a prototype of european socialism de graft johnson made this clear when he wrote what our social structure which may be termed communalism cannot cope with is the modern world with its capitalist industries and our task here is to adapt the principles of socialism to our own particular mode of life alternately we can develop our basic traditional institutions in keeping with the basic principles of communalism to fit modern conditions i think we shall attempt both in african political systems there were never opposition parties per se people were active and participated fully in town and village discussions as a body gave their assent and registered their opposition to issues as they arose there was unity in diversity it was the paramount chief who acted as the voice of the people the socialism of africa differs from the european type european socialism was born of conflict the conflict that was sanctified into a philosophy the class war was looked upon not as something evil but as something necessary and good as prayer is to christianity or to islam so civil war class war is to european versions of socialisma means inseparable from the end each becomes the basis of a whole way of life the european socialist cannot think of his socialism without its fathercapitalism such a contradiction africans find intolerable it virtually says that without capitalism and the conflict which it creates within any society there can be no socialism african socialism did not arise from the agrarian revolution it did not start from the existence of conflicting classes in society it started as a family society its objective is the extended family africans have no more need to be converted to socialism than they have to be taught democracy europeans and other imperialists remain ignorant of the fact that socialism and democracy are rooted in the african past which produced contemporary africans these africans acknowledge that socialism must look to wider horizons for the extended family nyerete stated modern african socialism can no longer confine the idea of the social family within the limits of the tribe nor indeed of the nation for no true african socialist can look at a line drawn on a map and say the people on this side of that line are my brothers but these who happen to live on the other side of it have no claim on me every individual on this african continent is his brother the above also portrays nkrumahs socialism every african national leader had been engaged in the supreme need to build a sense of nationhood from diverse racial tribal and religious loyalties this has not been an easy task ghana had this problem particularly in the resistance of the ashanti and some northern peoples to incorporation in a united state it had to overcome the opposition of powerful chiefs regarded as the spiritual heads of communities as well as their political masters such chiefs are no more competent or capable of running the modern state nkrumah also inherited the bitter antagonism of the reactionary professional and business elite who he ousted as directors of the national movement the social disturbances were undoubtedly accented by conspiracies on the part of some of the opposition leaders who by all means were the paid agents of the british and the nato allies and the frustrated members of the cpp to overthrow the regime by assassinating president nkrumah some of those ghanaians who were definitely in the assassination plot which they attempted were apprehended and detained without trial their trial would have meant the death penalty and the pressure of public opinion would have made commutation of the sentence difficult the attacks on president nkrumahs life were misinterpreted by the western press as signs of unpopularity the facts prior to the coup point to a different direction the resistance of the ghanaian anglophiles the subversive activities of the local agents of the capitalist world the psychological poverty of arch tribalists and the unending quest to keep the black man down by the same ugly greedy and wicked imperialists account for the fall of nkrumahs government but not the man the coup on nkrumahs government february dealt a catastrophic blow to the african continent take a statistic of the black world and see the identical damage done to our brave leaderspatrice lumumba of the congo balewa of nigeria malcolm_x of the usa those living but ousted from office president nkrumah and president ben bella of algeria why this pattern the answer is very clear to all thinking peoples the fall of nkrumahs government is the fall of africa and africans his leadership was a pacesetter a guiding star and an inspirational one since the tragedy the continent has fallen into oblivion the portuguese in angola and mozambique the ian smiths and harold wilsons the nazi republic of south africa and their international cohorts are happy ghana and ghanaians are no more independent if we understand what freedom and independence means how can it be free when a major sector of the economy has been taken over by the foreign capitalists ghana is now starting on the path of having apartheid schools the london sunday telegraph of march writes the ghanaian staff of ashanti goldfields are incensed over the setting up of an allwhite primary school by the management and refusal to allow senior africans to form their staff association applications from ghanaian senior staff to enter their children in such schools have been rejected such a school never existed under nkrumah more than private schools with a fee of have been established this is a move to deny the children of any average worker the opportunity for education on the political front paramount chiefs as of february have been destooled by the military regime terrorism is now the order of the day the ghanaian times of february and published thus reports coming from ashanti give cause for serious concern in ashanti and the central regions and indeed in some other places in scattered areas of the country towns and villages in these areas of the country are being subjected to a wave of terrorism and dacoity unparalleled in the history of this country fear stalks the land in many homes there is not a wink of sleep for man or woman armed robbery is showing upward surge because of the lowebbing relations between the public and the police what an insult to human intelligence the militarycumpolice regime has abolished political party organization it has proclaimed that governing a country without any party or parties is the surest way to ensure democracy what an illusion what a contradiction on the economic front the ghana trade union congress which had pledged its support to the nlc is now begging for recognition which it had under nkrumahs government the u s capitalists have grabbed the ghana economy the firestone rubber company has taken over the stateoperated rubber plantations the u s international hotels corporation now controls all former state hotels advertisement for a managerial post for the nowcontrolled hotels stipulated quite clearly that ghanaian or african applicants will not be considered the economy is stagnating despite the assurance given by britain and the u s a that neocolonialism and capitalism will triumph in ghana as a payment for the criminal coup the british promised a loan of and the usa million finally the most outrageous act of the military regime is the sending away in ghanaian airways all the nationalist refugees from angola mozambique southern rhodesia south west africa and the republic of south africa back to their respective places of origin their military and police escorts handed them over to the imperialist authorities for their final destruction such is the situation the democracy and newlywon freedom for the ghanaians and africa the direct causes of the imperialists attack on nkrumah before the independence of ghana the currency authority was the west african currency board established in by executive decree of the colonial office with headquarters in london the wacb was nothing other than a local agent the control of the commercial banks was under the wacb the monetary policy adopted was at the whims and caprices of the wacb and principally at the dictation of london on march three days before ghana became independent the central bank of ghana was established it thus became the sole bank of issue the banker to the government and other commercial banks the fiscal agent of the government in dealing with important international financial institutions eg the international monetary fund and the world bank it also operated for the government in exchange control as the sole bank of issue it had the power to influence the credit situation with a view to maintaining monetary stability in ghana and the external value of the ghana pound the cbg originated a local money market by issuing on behalf of the government day treasury bills this enabled the ghanaians to invest their money domestically it also curtailed the volume of funds transferred out of ghana to britain such transfers were of a high magnitude prior to the establishment of the central bank the central bank created an atmosphere which encouraged the establishment of indigenous owned and operated commercial banks and also the expansion of branches of the older ones between march and november branch banks increased from to this was the breaking of the monopoly position of the british barclays bank dominion colonial and overseas ltd and bank of west africa ltd since the monopoly position was threatened the foreign owners mounted a series of attacks on the nkrumah government we can see how sincere the british position is free competition in britain and monopoly in africa in line with the goal for relative economic independence a reduction in the high shipping costs of ghanian exports the ghana national shipping line was established after formerly all exports from and imports to ghana had been carried by the british shipping firms the profits from such services accrued to britain the prohibitive shipping charges reduced the profit margin that could have gone to ghana passenger service provided by the shipping firms was controlled by the british with the establishment of the ghana black star line national shipping line the charges on exports and passenger services were reduced to reasonable levels the profits became a source of revenue to be used in financing other economic development projects as well as in expanding the shipping lines a third case of monopoly is the air lines colonial ghana had no national airways the air transport was owned operated and controlled by the british overseas airways corporationair france and panamerican air lines with independence and the establishment of the ghana airways corporation the monopoly position of the british was demolished more revenue was thereby secured for ghana the purchase of some aircraft from the soviet union instead of the more costly ones manufactured by the nato countries contributed to the animosity directed at nkrumahs government the african continent had been described as the sleeping giant dr nkrumah called the african allafrican peoples conference in this conference brought political leaders trade unionists nationalists and others from different works of life together for a common endeavourthe complete liberation of the continent from foreign domination nkrumah had declared in his independence message of march that he would not consider ghana free and independent as long as any portion of the african soil remained under foreign control ghana provided free transportation for revolutionary refugees from the racialist nightmare of angola mozambique southern rhodesia south west africa and the republic of south africa it also aided guinea when it elected to be her own boss and to chart her own destiny rather than remain in the french community and be a province of france imagine such an anarchronism part of the african continent a portion of france making black africans frenchmen this destroys the work of nature the colonial nato countries jubilantly anticipated the collapse of guinea when france pulled out taking with it everything including paperclips and toilet tissue before the african continent had been balkanized brothers and sisters husbands and wives and even tribes were arbitrarily and forcibly separated by the unnatural political boundaries drawn by the greedy europeans today some problems that confront african countries are the offshoots of the unnatural boundaries to overcome such unending division nkrumah by political action and marriage involved the whole of north africa in the united and collective effort of breaking down the artificial disgraceful wall that had separated the african land mass and its peoples finally nkrumah with the cooperation of the late w e b du bois and george padmore initiated the dialogue on the possibility of publishing encyclopedia africana for the purpose of placing african historical cultural and social achievements of antiquity in proper perspective for all these reasons the nato powers mounted their attack on this great african one thing is clear to the patriotic african in fledgling states imperialists interest flourish where there is an atmosphere of dissension they are endangered in an atmosphere of national unity and stability some people have accused the government of having too much power over the national economy i have to remind those people that under colonial administration the little postal telegraphic and rail communications broadcasting electricity and water services that existed were all publicly owned and administered nobody domestically or internationally raised a cry of woe but as soon as the ghanaians under nkrumahs direction added an airline a shipping line a central bank loud echoes of dictatorship started to roar in the firmament since then ghana has met with active resistance from vested interest groups within and without in the effort to build a national economy jules ferry premier of france in when he spoke in the chamber of deputies in defence of the colonial policy of the french government stated thus it is not clear that the great states of modern europe the moment their industrial power is founded are confronted with an immense and difficult problem which is the basis of industrial life the very condition of existencethe question of markets have you not seen the great industrial nations one by one arrive at a colonial policy and we can say that this colonial policy is a luxury for modern nations not at all gentlemen this policy is for all of us a necessity like the market itself today as you know the law of supply and demand freedom of exchange the influence of speculations all these move in a circle which extends to the ends of the world colonies are for rich countries one of the most lucrative methods of investigating capital i say that france which is glutted with capital and which has exported considerable quantities has an interest in looking at this side of the colonial question it is the same question as that of outlets for our manufacture the same situation applies to the motives of neocolonialists and imperialists albert sarraut french colonial secretary of state in spoke in stronger terms in paris what is the use of painting the truth at the start colonization was not an act of civilization nor was it a desire to civilize it was an act of force motivated by interests an episode in the vital competition which from man to man from group to group has gone on ever increasing the people who set out to seize colonies in distant lands were thinking primarily of themselves and were working for their own profits and conquering for their own power the origin of colonization is nothing else than enterprise of individual interests a onesided and egotistical imposition of the strong upon the weak you can see who really thinks of nkrumah as a dictator is it the true african no no it is the neocolonialists and their lackeys in ghana and the rest of africa the coup was effected by the imperialists lackeys in ghana in concert with thier international neocolonialist powers whatever might have happened nkrumahs philosophy remains indestructible and will be fostered in africa and in ghana as long as this planet earth exists
the sixties was for v rt v black americans a ii decade of spiritual ins quiry and of emotion a j discovery jhe three most important discoveries might be summarized in the following slogans black is beautiful the third world the american dream is a nightmare none of these slogans constitutes a new finding indeed they represent on the intellectual level rediscovery since an attentive read ing of the molders of black thought in this century will find their clear enunciation in marcus garvey w e b du bois and a philip randolph like all slogans which substitute generality for the elusiveness of the particular insight of the pertinent analysis these acquire in the wake of mindless iteration the shadow of ambiguity and the possibility of confusion a slogan is not a pro gram and lung power is not brain power nevertheless the consciousness of self indicated by these slogans is a necessary first step in the selfrealization of black americans a reahzation only possible when the question of identity has been answered black people in america are a people at once of and apart from the abstraction america this complex situation is the imperative with which all black analysis and all black movement must begin neither the simplistics of integration nor of separatism represents mature responses to this reality in this light our slogans when interpreted in a simplistic manner simply serve to keep the brothers in the wilderness black is beautiful it is also ugly it is ugly when a leader of one of the baddest bands of blacks sips tea with a few woollyheaded whites at a white university and tells them that the students of the black college across town are all uncle toms the third world exists but it no more represents unity or virtue or the affirmation of man than the first or the second do japans investments in south africa betoken afroasian unity does the warfare in which black ibo and black hausa fall at each others throats represent black virtue is the stride cretinism of chinas cultural revolution morally superior to russian imperialism in czechoslovakia or to us murder in viet nam finally who are the denizens of the nightmare are those who buy avidly the insolent chariots of detroit and the most expensive products of the shoemakers art exclusively white are those who in search of identity create a new cosmetics industry really abandoning the merchant mentality of the good old american way in favor of a new black bit a great deal of clarity is needed if the selfconsciousness of the sixties is to become the selfrealization of the seventies selfconsciousness must become a tool in the analysis of the world if it is to become a weapon in changing it at present the newly gained selfconsciousness is being squandered in signifying and putting down white folks bourgeois negroes uncle toms and everybody who does not agree with younamehim when time is not being used in this fashion it is being used to devise time and energyconsuming cults in which neoand pseudoafrican costumes are expected to slap the man in the face is he slapped who is slapped most of all i deplore those activists passivists who can profess no knowledge of the past but who go right on discussing it judging it reviling it a good case can be made for ignoring the past while building the future i am not the one to make such a case but the irony is that those who seem to want to do so cant they are paralyzed by a verbalizing virus which keeps them exorcising the demons whose meaning they deny here indeed is the challenge of the seventies to break the enervating cycle of ritual and rhetoric and replace it by the propulsion of rigor and reason to conserve the energy now expended and exhausted in fulsome denunciation and utilize it in the construction of institutions and modalities arising from the consciousness of self beyond this plane of industry lies the prospect of selfrealization itself a commencement not a conclusion hat lies ahead w f for black americans is precisely what happed t them alm st years ago when the reconstruction came to an end the gains made during this second reconstruction were negligible and they were made under liberal administrations those of kennedy and johnson during the first reconstruction a multitude of laws were passed but were not enforced the same thing is happening now this nixon administration is a repressive one and black people know it therefore unless the repression and oppression become unbearable think black people will cool it until nixon and his bosses ruin the nation then move once again under liberal administrations everywhere we look we see racism the tone set by the nixon administration being blatantly practiced there can be no doubt about it we see it in the officials elected by the citizens of various cities see it in the police behavior we sec it in the workers in the churches in the armed forces yea it pours like vermin from the woodwork black people everywhere are in trouble nonwhite people everywhere are in trouble and i think the major task of black art is to defineate the political and social situation because it is the most important one survival depends on it ours and theirs hs black people we are presently faced j with the most critical jkand s phisticated de cisions concerning our colonial status to become thoroughly americans assimilation to separate in some manner withdraw or to seize total control of america revolution within each of these three general goals there are complexities and contradictions that we still must struggle with we are not struggling with them now since the advent of the national anti poverty programs and white americas sophisticated dying vampirecultures cooptation of soul and danshikis et alindeed since whitefolk have been allowed once againto be intricately immersed within our ideological struggles from pantherism commitemism to doyourownthingism rugged individualism updated with soul many of our brothers and sisters have been busted and have their asses over political hummers brothers and sisters weve got w to stop and check ourselves out where are we going nowhere but were doin it with soul and thats all that counts what do we want as a people as a nation we really are not sure are we a people a nation we really are not sure if we were a people a nation the least we would do would be honest with ourselves and each other check out our brothers and sisters from the socalled cultural nationalists to the panthers afraid of black criticism readv to blow you away if you dont support them or if you criticize them check out the poverticians and movement hustlers hovering around cutting up folk for the best position to receive the piddling chumpchange they say they are robbing and fooling the man for we militantly confront the man so that we can cooly negotiate for a piece of the rancid pie our militant intellectuals our militant activists our militant politicians still have much allegiance to and fear ofwhite america check it out our students struggle for black studies courses and more black students at white colleges for the sake of becoming better americansnot for the sake of aiding in the seizing of control in america there are militantand often violentconfrontations with the cracker for brothers and sisters to join the racistcapitalist unions for the sake of becoming better americansnot for the sake of revealing the racistcapitalist contradictions around the role of black workers we have returned to integrationist meetings and rallies primarily because the mediaprojected black_panther party is working from a white radical preworld war ii marxistleninist ideological frameworkrather than deal with the history of consistent white radical racism and copouts from the arrogant crusades through toussaint louverture gabriel prosser w e b du bois albizu campos george padmore kwame nkrumah to today in essence our present movement is passionately caught up in the moral political and cultural decadence and perversion of white america deep in many of our brothers and sisters hearts there is the heated desire to be president of the u s president of the imperialist ford foundation to be a rich gov rockefeller with soul to produce and act in a soulful am curious type flick have we forgotten our historical destiny fear not the number and education of our enemies against whom we shall have to contend for our lawful right let no man of us budge one step and let slaveholders come to beat us from our country america is more our country than it is the whites we have enriched it i with our blood and tears so said good brother david walk er in and yes after years we have almost forgotten being bedazzled by the trinkets and brothels of a white nation suffering from general paresis if we do not take up brother walkers call today what will lie ahead for blackfolk will be psychedelic slavery the ultimate in peaceful suffering the ultimate in white bestiality our race would be reduced to moonfolk excavating resources for whites if we move to separate our act of separating may satisfy some of our psychological needs but separatism does not destroy white racism or white capitalism and it certainly cannot destroy white imperialism we must and will fight for national control and independence from america as heroically and spiritually as our vietnamese brothers and sisters as our puerto rican brothers and sisters our mozambiquen azanian and nambibian brothers as well of our panamerican and third world brothers and sisters because we are the part of the panafrican race most strategically placed within the belly and brain of the white beast because we are the most technologically advarceo of our race because we indeed did and do enrich this country with our blood and tears and because we have a moral and spiritual commitment to our slave ancestors and to our indian brothers and sisters who heroically defended their nations against arrogant bestiality because of these things and because of our panafrican and third world brothers and sisters strugling against white racism and imperialism we must we will let no man of us budge one step and let slaveholders come to beat us from our country s e anderson ed bullins sc jrtfche test of fire and rita steel lies ahead for ii black people presivsl dent richard m nixon shows it more each day cutting off welfare and social benefits slowing of the economy antiinflation to whites niggerdeflation to blacks continual wars advocacy of compulsary birth control lies doubletalk tricknology and fascism the blackman will be forced to survive or will perish at first the desperateness of his situation will cause him to react in suicidal manners such as killing his brothers in feuds organizational coups community purges and other types of madness fostered by blackskinned men who have white minds those blackmen who come together in brotherhood and black love may survive but only the most together will only those that strive to be black and righteous will all that can be done now is to create to build or organize to defend to expand to plan and go forward into the future in unity black america is the key to black liberation africa is the lock ready to be sprung we must free all the africansourselves in america and of course those in the motherland ed bullins need systems of v r t all kinds that are rer yy i sponsible to black s people one brother j i who is otherwise very together said he was going to a white publisher to get his book published his explanation was that the publisher could effectively distribute the book what the brother preferred not to see was that a black writer whose book goes through a white distribution system will find that his thoughts are going to whites first and foremost for that is what the distributor is aiming at white money in addition to that the white publisher is editing for a white public the book may have been written for black people but it will end up edited for the white public meanwhile the white man is the intermediary he allows us to speak to each brother by way of him i do not think i have to explain the dangers in that we are just going to have to build our own publishing and distributing systems as best we can values ethics will lead us into program and that is where values should take us around the wisdom of black people brought us to the intuitive state of rip it down rip their institutions down around and on the wisdom of black people proposed the additional idea of alternative institutions or systemslanguage dress economics religion education community control what became known as black_power not a new idea but a renewed idea when the cry for black_power went out the first thing the man did was to throw some black spokesmen in front of cameras asking them to define black_power allowing them to speak through him i forget those definitions i know to me and many others black_power meant independent spiritualeconomicpoliticalcultural power for us black people one thing the man noticed was that the spokesmen differedemphasized different areas like politics economics or culture concepts united in the phrase black_power but the man deliberately projected those differences as confusion and since then the result has been actual confusion the reasons for the confusion are not simple but one of the main reasons was our lack of a value system andor ideology philosophy or system of thought if you prefer no system of basic concepts truths historical examplesrationalizedwhich would allow us to analyze with clarity act with full confidence toward a goal or goals have one more point to make we may be the only people in the history of the world who so wholeheartedly send our children to the enemys schools to be instructed then we wonder why we have an historical discontinuity why the children hate their elders why they hate themselves the emphasis here is on children coming back against black parents that in several ways meansleads to selfdoubt lack of confidence in ourselves and in each other ultimately we will have to develop an ideology for only from an ideology can a substantial lasting value system come lack of actual ideology was why for example some of garveys followers fell for naacpism integration marxistleninsm capitalism as soon as garvey was dead some of his top people fell those various ways lack of ideology was not the only problem but it was a central one until we come up with an ideologyworldview if you prefer we wont stand much of a chance against the ideologies of the west the three cs capitalism christianity communism marxistleninism these are the alternatives we have been given the roads we have been allowed to travel we have to have the nerve we have to ask ourselves after the fighting and bloodshed what then marxistleninism freud einstein j p morgan will the master still be master of our minds even in his death if he is master of our minds how different will our fates be how different our leadership how different our world we have to ask ourselves that now figuratively speaking the first half of the twentieth century was that period when the black americans were rehearsing for a show that they never put on the road the promise of freedom dignity and citizenship was dangled before us like carrots before a rabbit until we realized that the promise was a lie and that we did not like carrots anyway out of this realization the demand for black_power and black history was born the circumstance produced what i call the black and beautiful age thats where we are now and what lies ahead for us will depend on how we move out of this age to another one that will be the real test of our ability to handle the power that we have been demanding before we can move to our next stage of development and responsibility we will have to ask ourselves some hard questions and we will have to answer them honestly if the next stage of our history is nation building do we know how to hold a nation together we are collectively black and beautiful but does this fact help us to know what makes an airplane fly or how to cure a stomach ache what lies ahead of us will be determined by how well we take an inventory of ourselves and how we react to our findings in this kind of world being black and beautiful means very little unless you are also black and powerful tij will come in the rii form of notes ideas ii and nonideas passing hrou h me like time passes through the year month the world personal notes will be personal keeping in mind that im a black man first then poet reflections in hour thoughts which both kept me awake and forced me to sleep my new found ability to sleep four to five hours a night indicated a new maturity a short preface ive traveled from coast to coast and halfway around the world which means that ive been able to communicate mainly listened with brothers and sisters from san jose california to the university of new york from sir george williams university montreal canada to toogaloo college mississippi from luther college docora iowa to the university of algiers algeria north africa from those points and many smallerlarger points in between i traveled deliberately to give and receive positivenegative messages lets view together from a poets bridge leadership is not as we knew i i it the concept of leadership has to be redefined keeping in mind he who controls the image controls the action i find very little difference between all the news thats fit to print and the worlds greatest newspaper the two papers mentioned and others are only moderate examples of that which is wrong with this country and im sure if confronted none of them would acknowledge that neither truth nor the positive in terest of black folks is a part of their makeup americas image makers developers of myths and the destroyers of weaker men crazy is what they called malcolm_x stokley carmichael and rap brown crazy was their assessment of w e b du bois and paul robeson crazy is the adjective used to describe marcus garvey kwame nkrumah ameer baraka leroi jones etc crazy is crazy only when black people move in an uncrazy way to confront the real craziness of the world actually crazy is crazy only as the crazy canwill define it the new leadership is us each one of us we as a body of one will have to reflect that which should bethat which is necessary too often weve assigned roles to our leaders we must now assign these roles to ourselves we must become the malcolms du boises and nkrumahs of tomorrowdo not ask of others what you are not willing to givedo yourself reflect that which is necessary what it means is are we serious and what are we willing to sacrifice our children are watching us and we must not become the new pimps of tomorrow tomorrow is tomorrow if we want one tomorrow is tomorrow if we canwill define it to define and legitimize our own existence is the basis of a continuous existence europe may be a myth but it would be very difficult to prove that it is congress is one of the most corrupt institutions in the na tion but these are just words if no one believes it this white boy may be a sissy a punk and very unhip but he is also undeniably the worldrunner europeans define what europe is those there and those here members of congress define what corruption is those that are and those that are the white boy may be the adjectives indicated above but obviously that doesnt interfere with his running of the world our movement is to awaken the consciousness of blackness of ourselves the closed societies naacp sclc sncc the black_panthers all black fraternities and sororities core and anymost socalled black organizations that are moving to liberate us we are black men and black women human beings we cannotmust not be forced to become something unnatural such as organizational robots each organization mentioned above demands of its members that they reflect that organization and not necessarily black people in order to become a part one has to meet certain prerequisites such as become less blacker become more blacker do not wear a tie wear a tie seek integration seek segregation change yrname do not change yrname seek black culture demean black culture read only this read only that being political not political enough power comes out of here power comes out of there wear yrhair this way wear yrhair that way quote this brother quote that brother get high dont get high formal education self education wear a suit wear dashikis bare arms dont bear arms etc etc the new class division one group of negroes saying that other negroes are not relevant and blacks saying that afroamericans are not relevant and vice versa weve created such divisions among ourselves that our personalities change as television programs do this year its in next its out our actions move as the group does im not advocating a return to strict individualism which in itself is just as harmful but a movement toward combining all efforts which allow and encourage constructive criticism and constructive actions how can one black person blackball another we must move from ego satisfying pettiness and superficial idealism to the real world its popular individualgroups to say that they are going to use the man mainly for their own limitedpersonal goals but if we become products of the realworld well begin to understand that its very difficult to usemake use of the man that uses the world unless one is equipped to do thatand division is not part of that equipment it requires all our talents and most of all it demands of each of us the willingness to listen learn act and grow a man with an ethic a history and spiritual guidance is the beginning of a people with an ethic a history and meaningful spirituality ive often come across black people who wander throughout the world thinking they are a modem day meursaultraskolnikov or frederick henry and have never heard of bigger thomas harry ames or tucker caliban you reflect whatwhere you are if a brother moves throughout the world quoting camus or dostoievsky understand thats where hes at if he digs rubinstein and janis joplin thats where he is to move people from that point its necessary we must do it without alienating them its not to impress one with ones knowledge but with ones actions the values which we believe in cannot necessarily be taughtbut may have to be demonstrated if the ethic history and spiritual life you advocate is important be it your being it will be the most effective attractionor distraction this is the age of power the powerage the vietnam disaster could not exist if the majority of white people in the unitedstatesofamerica did not want it to exist the united nations would not be as ineffective as it is if this country didnt want it that way brothers malcolm_x and martin_luther_king jr would be alive if we could have backed up their words how does one bring down a monster without becoming one if you see a blackman walking around with a perpetual smile on his face its not because hes happy the basis of power is land land is the only hing that nobody nowhere is making any more of we can buy these bell bottoms next year if they are still in style but that mustang next yearbut land is going actionfast and that white boy is hip to it for hes all over the world taking it future of the j negro in america is inextricably tied to the future of america i j there is no country at the present time that offers the promise and the hope for our people as does this nation america then must solve her remaining problems by the use of her ideologies so well expressed in the declaration of independence and in our federal constitution the remaining vestige of the social evils of racial prejudice discrimination and separatism must be abandoned and the doors of opportunity must be opened widely to all americans so that they may seize every opportunity and assume every responsibility for making this nation a great just free and democratic fellowship american negroes must now do more than seek their rights they must also work to preserve the rights that are now available and to take their responsibility with other citizens in the economic cultural moral and spiritual growth of the nation with the ballot now given the future for the negro in politics is greater if the negro himself will accept the fact of a biracial culture and work in it and through it to gain further rights and to make further contributions with the scientific age upon us negroes must do all within their power to develop skills and to become as strong intellectually as any other groups so that their ability will render them essential and worthy workmen in the ongoing culture of this nation if the negro divorces himself from his nation and from responsibility as a citizen and resorts to exploits of destruction and bitterness he shall move from the heights already attained to lower valleys of privation servitude and despair the future of the american negro is with the nation but also with himself d only knows what lies ahead for black americans and as we review the events of recent monthsthe obvious failure of thepoverty program the spurious efforts toward black capitalism americas refusal to reorder its value system increased activity of black snipers renewed efforts at minority repression and the not often publicized schism ranks of black leadersnot be blamed for wondering if even god in all his infinite wisdom knows if anything is to point toward new directions for black americans it will be the budding unity which seems to be welding blacks together local coalitions and black united fronts are forming across the land this should inevitably lead to the creation of a national union of blacks made tenacious and invulnerable by the sweet smell of economic and political victories in neighborhoods communities and cities yet there is a warning which must be made as black leaders pitch the rhetoric of promise to the clamoring throngs for in the past the white man has craftily raised the expectations of black folk knowing that the fulfillment was certain to lag behind today however these rising expectations are largely due to the new black instrumentations which are producing a symphony of hope scored with notes of selfdetermination black nationalism black pride and revolution if fulfillment does not catch up to expectations this time the brothers fury will be unpredictable because his own leaders will have been the ones who dangled the succulent but evasive fruits of freedom what lies ahead for black americans depends as much upon the black individual as upon the black leader and it depends upon the quality of the efforts of both today we talk black we talk tough and we talk revolution rhetoric can substitute for revolution if we see revolution as the movement of a body in an orbit or circle with all the black talk one must wonder if we are indeed in orbit caught in a frustrating circle going nowhere but revolution is also a complete and drastic change and this is the revolution which black americans must not talk but experience america which has been the land of the living dead for black people will never know the revolution about which so many are talking until resurrection comes to the black man individually and in total the movement has reached its most crucial stage rising expectations are near the summit as dr martin_luther_king jr saw the promised land black americans j are beginning to catch sight of the dream black leaders are providing the glimpse and if the movement gets locked in orbit if the freedom train cannot pull away from the circular track utter despair will shroud black america and the dream may always be a reverie the ultimate success of the movement is not in the hands of those we choose to make our leaders for no matter how great their talents they cannot lead if the multitude will not follow our leaders sometimes march at cross purposes leaving the multitude bewildered not sure which way to head the black masses must rise person by personfrom the american graveyard and declare their godgiven freedom this cannot be accomplished from the halls ol congress nor from the white

gotten so i dont know whether im negro black a tom or supernegro digest november tom the complainant was a doctor at an interracially attended symposium he got the laugh he also got the explanation he was unable to request he is not a laughable figure for he represents the confusion of the numerical majority of negro america an indiscriminate component which includes the elite the middleclass and the poor who view black as suspect and threatening to the known quality of their daily existence if the sixties have had any positive affect it may be that the turmoil has forced a black minority to examine its premises clarify its definitions and reevaluate directions from this kind of individual and group introspection a certain commonality of thought has emerged and there are explanations we can say we move toward the trauma of the seventies with clarity in certain respects our methodologies may be disparate and our goals variedbut collectively we do know what black is and what it exacts the path to revolution is the only future course left for black people there is no other alternative that has not been tried repeatedly in an exhaustive search to save the humanity of those most inhumane but the forgiving quality of our african traditions must now be suspended we must commit ourselves to the task of constructing a new world a world of men not beasts a world where love is what time it is and people have evolved beyond hate the ofay has sinned against god we are gods righteous warriors and must rise as gods ourselves the black revolution must burn the earth rid of the white boys curse so that love can reign and we can become who we were really meant to be our immediate future must will be based on the following two processes the resolution of our identity crisis black becomes the positive reflection of ourselves versus the alien whites and when we really rebel and become our true african selves we will then have started acting out our true role in the postamerican future of the world and in order to sustain and reinforce this new identity new cultural forms will emerge utilizing myth ritual symbol and values but the cultural solution to the identity crisis is necessary but not sufficient black people must move toward a common analysis of the world a political analysis there can be no revolution without a common political analysis our analysis must be scientific not poetic based on the entire world scene and not one local or national situation and provide a concrete alternative for the future rather than a vague vision of mythical tomorrow we now find ourselves in the preliminary stages of developing in these two ways culturally and politically however to over develop either independent of the other is to deny the possibility of total revolution total black revolution involves both requiring a unification of the cultural and the political what can we expect j flnrr from the seventies of course these times move too fast and too strangely to predict the future history like nature has this strange habit of creating mutations as the african in the americas is a mutation of history itself and therein lies our destiny i will chance to suggest trends that i deduce from the sixties we can expect greater military preparation on the pigs part and frequent violent conflicts with them we can expect new subtle forms of cooptation of articulate black people the communication and education industries are already moving in this direction i expect black studies especially on white campuses to turn into a monster in the s think that in we will find dozens of colleges turning out hundreds of blacktalking bourgies with phds in malcolm_x and john coltrane what a horror revolutionary institutions like malcolm_x university in durham will prove to be the relevant education centers community control of public school education will continue to be a national issue coalition politics with white people will prove for the umpteenth time to be a very dead end large numbers of black individuals particularly men will continue to intermarry and so define themselves out of the struggle there will be a further decline of large national organizations and an increase in the number of local programs designed to meet the specific needs of a given community it will be the unified efforts by these local programs acting in concert that will produce the synthesis that we need to move to a revolutionary stage this will produce a dilterent kind of leader one with little national charisma but with a functional local constituency there will be a radical revival of interest in local politics as black and white people struggle for control of municipal governments panafricanism around the writings and speeches of osagyefo nkrumah and malcolm will be the dominant ideology black people will think of something to do that no one black or white ever had the slightest no am certain tion that they would do of this i nz jahn in the j nr appendix of his book ii neoafrican literature a history f black writing stated that as of january there existed no magazine in the united states concerned exclusively with africanamerican literature the statement is rather remarkable when we consider that soulbook black dialogue and the journal of black poetry were all publishing by then the statement thus submerges a whole literary movement the emergence of these journals and others similar to them was the literary enactment of the crisis of the sixties the break with the west through them black literature reorganizes itself serving the cause of blackness by analyzing its suppression and recreating its images and its myths their role is thus revolutionary and since the building of a black national consciousness is conceived of as urgent by those who write in the revolutionary journal it must be accomplished on many levels the immediate outer realities call for a reporting of the facts of oppression for a mobilization of forces for sociopolitical analysis the soul within and the fragmented community require an imagemaking mythbuilding symbolization of that reality political activism and poetry can thus complement each other it is not the subject matter which distinguishes sociopolitical literature from esthetic literature here the subject matter is really always the same black survival through identity and strength but the fiction or poetry of survival is rendered through imagery through symbols through experimentation with different rhythms with different syntactical forms with a different vocabulary through the indirectness of its statement about our condition the revolutionary journals thus attest to an allinclusive view of the black experience and it would be a mistake to pass them by in the vain search for evidences of the literary expression of a people neatly fractured off from life as is too often the case in old tired societies with nothing left to fight for it would be a misreading of the times all the journals with which we are concerned have certain things in common in addition to their double development political and literary all of them show a noncommercial orientation they have operated on limited funds and a missed edition has not been infrequent they are distributed principally through black dealers and by subscriotion they thus are written by black people for black people and it is rare that a white writer appears in their pages as did ted vincent in soulbook with manv editorial reservations and a letter to the editor of black dialogue from a rather pompous white reader of the first issue states in part i cannot find one word in this black dialogue which comes from one of you to me one of us the advertising is limited to black bookstores black publishing companies the other black journals except the first two issues of black dialogue had some advertising from radical white groups the editorial boards tend to have overlapping membership a number of the poets and writers publish in all of the journals most of them do not publish in white journals or anthologies we can isolate the following aspects as typical of the literature appearing in these journals the black community of brothers those who share our condition and with whom we work for the common liberation may be perceived as national western hemispheric international or the community may be perceived as bandungthe whole of the nonwhite world the existing black culture may be glorified in a conscious effort to build a sense of identity from the immediate past or it may be rejected as the heirloom of slavery and a new or modified cultural image projected which incorporates bandung elements andor draws on the prewestern past a gap may exist particularly in the early phases between the political and the esthetic consciousness ie one writer may single out certain aspects of reality as having immediate relevance in practical life yet another may be symbolically working through other aspects in his art similarly either the sociopolitical or the artisticliterary thrust may have greater emphasis or there may be a shift in emphasis there is a sustained mythbuilding process which creates new gods and renovates the universe and which provides the black community with black or bandung heroes or restores those heroes to it which white society has sullied and submerged behind negative terms and concepts among the revolutionary journals several types can be isolated those which have local contributorship and readership and deal with local issues those produced on college campuses by black student organizations those which have or are seeking wide representation and wide readership in the black community it is impossible to discuss all the journals here i could list perhaps thirty some of which are now defunct which to my knowledge have appeared in the past four years or so and which share all the characteristics listed above however soulbook black dialogue and the journal of black poetry are the most important ones in terms of age and consistency of publication circulation and how wellknown the contributors are through these three we can analyze some of the developments which characterize the genre as a whole black dialogue provides a good study in the growth and development of the revolutionary journal the first issue resulted from efforts by a group of san francisco state college students much of this first issue is local in tone but succeeding issues come more and more to reflect black america generally the editorial board expands at present the board has regional representatives from new york headquarters san franciscowest coast the midwest southern united states africa in terms of content black dialogue has come to include art forms particularly graphic other than literary there are issues in which political writing dominates winter in which political and artistic content is almost equally divided julyaugust and the latest issue spring contains no political articles although political concerns are evident in other ways eg the fullpage announcement dont let them destroy harlem stop the state building with an illustration showing angry blacks pelting a corralled grinning lindsay and cohorts this is by no means the essential criterion by which to judge the magazines maturity the growing evenness of tone which was not there in the first issues is a surer indication the political articles of the first issue show an acute awareness of the international character of black literary expression and of the right of a society of people to nonannihilation ie nonabsorption by the west and to nationhood whether that society is african or africanamerican but the intellectual analysis has not yet been internalized and the fiction and poetry show us still to be in the painful break with white society still tormenting ourselves with the moribund integrationist experience the literature shows us still on the lonely quest which preludes the discovery of peoplehood as a lived experience this attitude is replacedyou can see the process from issue to issueby a sense of group purpose by a growth a hope a conscious creation the personal poems now acquire an archtypal sense which the earlier ones lack the poet is not a black man he is the black mannegative images of black society tend now to have behind them a missionary message we know the trickery that exiles us and still we dance ed spriggs autumn black images are now projected on the cosmos as we now begin to perceive ourselves as universal beings our souls are open skies and childrenzooming across green places larry neal autumn soulbook more militant than black dialogue it is the quarterly journal of revolutionary afroamerica and more consistent in tone and format appeared shortly before black dialogue and also on the west coast berkeley racist usa soulbook publishes a proportionately large amount of political analysis but its short stories and poetry are an important part of its format frantz fanon on the political front aime cesaire on the cultural are frequently featured written about and translated articles and communiques keep us posted on liberation movements everywhere soulbook thus embraces as brothers all the bandung world we black people realize that we have something in common with the majority of the worlds peoples we are all nonwhite and we are all oppressed by white cedric little soulbook the theme of throwing off the shackles and the call to arms of the revolutionary writings is transmuted in the poetry into various motifs and that of castration is one of the most prevalent by ritual reinactment of the death of virility the poet gives himself andor his audience a chance to be reborn into manhood black soldier marched home hung up his balls patricia bullins soulbook when deranged vipers sliced through your black genitals my body was one huge bleeding ball k willy kgositsile soulbook black bourgeois man he got no nuts left one in desk drawer wife got other one in pouch tween her legs bobb hamilton soulbook the journal of black poetry unlike black dialogue or soulbook is mainly concerned with one phase of literature but the journal also expresses activist concerns within its literary format and yet maintains a consistent tone and approach to do this it relies heavily on pictorial expression the center spread for instance of the fall issue shows an outline map of the united states cut into two jagged halves one half of the map bears part of a photograph of young black men behind bars the caption directly over them reads usa and above that the label others in the other half of the map black hands clasp each other in brotherhood and above the heads of a family unit black man woman and child a raised black arm clasps a rifle the caption above reads afroamerica and above that selfrule also the journal often includes essays which in discussing black art or culture look inevitably to the political aspects when black people talk about black consciousness or power they are speaking indirectly of nationalismwhether cultural political or economic we are cultural slaves dig it victims of what bro harold cruse calls cultural imperialism askia muhammad toure rolland snellings spring black culture and black survival are after all one and the same thing if we compare chronologically the issues of all three journals we discover that the literature which glorifies the subculture works in dialect works which describe the black woman in very sensual terms works which accept or glorify cohabitation occur most clearly in the earlier issues of soulbook and of black dialogue and that the embracing of african and eastern symbols and images some experimentation with the forms within these cultures is most clearly illustrated in later issues of the journal of black poetry clearly there is a widening of the potentials here for a renovated literature and a forsaking of chauvinism as too confining in the work of the poets to give us back our heroes and to provide us with new ones two types of black men are always sung jazz and blues musicians otis redding ornette coleman charlie parker and above all john coltrane and political activists chaka nat turner marcus garvey patrice lumumba and more than any man any time anywhere malcolm photographs and drawings of malcolm as well as poetry abound in these journals of course poetry about malcolm is not confined to those writing in the journals so much of it exists that it has been anthologized for malcolm poems on the life and death of malcolm_x broadside press it is a sign of malcolms growing status as the source at which to renew our faith in our destiny that his example is invoked in a black dialogue editorial to help two groups within the black community see the way clear to settling their differences his actions in life have become symbolic of the destiny of african americans the statements and comments made by brother leroi represent a step eastwards in african american culture that was prophesied by the epic journeys of el hajj malik el shabazz malcolm_x to mother africa the holy city mecca and the middle east askia muhammad toure journal of black poetry fall the choice of adjective epic is indicative malcolm is the epic hero of our struggle of our journey toward a new consciousness toward a new nation his significance far more than historical is mythological these three journals with which we have dealt did not exist more than five years ago yet their writers and thinkers many ot whom are now in their thirties existed long before then as writers and thinkers somewhere in the black communities the journals emerged to fill the need for that meeting place for members of the black community wherever that community may exist to quote black dialogue through these journals and the many others which have sprung up since current black literature is being grouped and diffused digested and in a sense even created the revolutionary black journal made its appearance at that moment in our history somewhere in the midsixties when black people began to forsake civil_rights and integration and began to seek out a sense of self they exist as one manifestation of that intense looking inward to see what we really wanted the direction and developing quality of black literature can be but imper fectly seen if these journals are ignored the revolutionary black journals attest to a growth toward nationhood in an everexpanding harmony with the nonwhite universe they are an important index of the measure and meaning of the sixtiescarolyn gerald he s have seen us move from nonviolent protest and hopes of integration to selfdefense violence black pride and hopes of black_power our movement has been swift we have suffered losses but we have made gains however feel we are not in a period of flux a time of indecisiona time of double trouble our leaders have either been coopted into the system are in exile in jail or have just plain copped out stokely is in africa but moving in a very positive direction huey is in jail eldridge is in exile rap is under house arrest the brothers are fighting each other on the west coast and in the process have lost the people infighting continues on the east coast malcolm is dead and nathan wright has integrated so throughout black america we see sad spectacles such as these gang warfare between black militant groups a group of black college students in detroit donating a statue of a black madonna sculptured by a white artist and donated to a white college black studies programs turning into agencies for spying on black people the crime rate among blacks continuing to soar a black female vocalist on tv supposedly promoting black pride but sporting a blond afro wig black nationalists in harlem losing valuable time protesting to whites about a state office building for what we have always had to struggle for our survival in this land are we so fat now that we can relax or drop our guard i think not but unfortunately far too many of our people are doing just this we are not developing and expanding black philosophy white culture continues to preoccupy much of our thinking and doing every white fad that comes along we pick up too many of our people are hooked on the beatles mod squad and white rock festivals we are not preparing ourselves for economic depression or recession the only farms we have are those run by elijah muhammad and a few determined black southern farmers remember all that money we spent on the poor peoples campaign in washington with that kind of cash we could have purchased two counties in alabama or michigan white economists are preparing now for a serious economic slowdown while we prepare for revolution with old obsolete rifles owning a few farms to feed our people is not the whole answer of course other things are needed we need to explore realistic self defense for survival we need to establish economic and diplomatic relations with black people in africa and latin america we need to further define and expand black culture black history is wide open for more study research and writing we must stop the systematic education genocide of black children i think part of our problem is our evaluation of the situation here too many of our militant brothers are convinced the philosophy and or tactics of che guevera marx engels or mao can be applied to our problem here when our thinking moves in this vein we are easy prey for the white radicals who tell us that the problem here is a class struggle and as soon as black and white workers overthrow the white capitalistic power structure well all march hand and hand to a class less integrated promised land damned lie the problem in america is racism oppressive white racism against black people whites may be socialists but they still tend to be racists check cuba since the revolution garvey warned us to beware of white radicals he called them greeks bearing gifts if we cant trust white radicals then it follows we cant trust the white power structure our only alternative is to turn to ourselves i know its hard for many of us to do this its so easy to hook up with whites they have a lot of money and a lot of expertise but they also have a long history of tricking black people i just finished reading where one of our leaders is advocating that black people support the peace movement ridiculous unless you want to spend another ten years marching with the enemy nobody wants peace anymore than black people for weve been at war for over years but joining with whites for anything is a waste of time history has proven that as soon as the crisis is over its open season on black people and our so called white friends are nowhere to be found here are some examples paul robesonwhen the going got tough he was deserted by his white radical friends world i war i and iiunprecedented lilynchings of black people followed each war reconstruction after the civil warall the white liberals and radicals were in full bloom it i seemed for awhile that real liberty equality and power were coming to black people but the northern republicans liberals and radicals at that time sold out to the southern whites in order to get dixie support for rutherford b hayes for president of the united states the klan began to ride black officeholders were killed or kicked out of office and the wholesale murder of black people reared its ugly head again we were not prepared to protect ourselves because we had depended on our socalled white friends for our protection they deserted us then and theyll do it today only black people are the salvation of black people there are no ifs ands and buts about it we must turn to ourselves for our own survival and liberation wish my black activist brothers could understand this simple rule read the philosophy and opinions of marcus garvey its all there we live in a racist society that never has and never will care anything about black people that might be a hard pill to swallow but its the whole truth let us begin to forge real black unity we must stop begging someone else to do for us what we should be doing for ourselves we must learn to sacrifice to build and to fight effectively margaret walker sums it up beautifully in the closing lines of her poem for my people in the united states and in africa the caribbean islands and in other parts of the world where people of african descent are numerous the s was a period when we discarded one set of illusions and took on another inasmuch as the seeds of conflict and achievement that are planted in one decade are harvested in another the s can only be understood when looked at from the vantage point of the s this is where our present day illusions began in in the case of henderson vs the united states the supreme court ended diningcar segregation on railroads by requiring them to permit negroes to occupy any empty seat in the diner instead of being confined to a partitioned section this decision was based on the interstate commerce act the justice department joined the plaintiff in this case in the same year president trumans committee on equality of treatment and opportunity in the armed forces reported that black americans were still barred from of specializations in the army despite announced policy to the contrary gwendolyn brooks became the first afroamerican to win a pulitzer prize in poetry for her collection of poems annie allen another fresh writing talent emerged in the presence of william demby whose novel beetle creek see page was a literary success and he was hailed as one of the new writers of promise in the following year in the case of mckissick vs carmichael the university of north carolina law school was opened to negroes by court order in the political campaigns of all political parties from republican to socialist had statements in their platforms declaring their abhorrence of discrimination and pledging assistance to the black voters of this country we had the illusion that we were entering a decade of great promise then other things awakened us to a reality the white citizens council became active as a reaction to the supreme court decision outlawing segregation in the schools in the s reached a ceremonial climax before it was well under way in the presence of the historical march on washington on reflection this event that was supposed to be the monumental turning point in the fight for jobs citizenship and dignity for black americans turned out to be one of the greatest picnics in history in my opinion it accomplished absolutely nothing the march on washington was really a march in washington the power structure let black americans and their white allies indulge themselves but did not yield one iota of the power that man needs to make himself free for a while after the lethargy that followed the march on washington set in the attention of black americans turned toward africa where nations were becoming free almost by the week the africans were indulging in illusions too soon the international colonial power structure started destroying the leaders of these countries through assassinations and coups as fast as they came to power yet the great personalities continued to emerge both in africa and the united states one of the most spectacular to emerge from the black proletariat was malcolm_x as the s drew to a close the decade might be called the period of our great illusions and our naivete we frightened white people with something called black_power but they didnt stay frightened very long before they began to either destroy the black_power apparatus or to buy its leaders looking back on the s and the beautiful hopefulness of a civil_rights movement that was born and died before our eyes i think it is that decade of the black mans beautiful dreaming before awakening to a new reality that reality is that freedom is a hardwon thingt is not left by one generation to and all important lesson in the the other freedom is a thing that s the decade has been his each generation must take and se master teacher and some of his cure with its own hands if the longawaited maturity has emerged black man has learned this simple from itjohn henrik clarke the two groups of peopl e for whom the black_power movei ment was a matter of life and death were the white liberals and the wouldbe black bourgeoisie james baldwin for all we may come to think of him was the one who jammed the white liberal in a corner and made him choke in his guilt and leroi jones continued it in the early part of the sixties the liberal didnt know where the hell to go in reality his conception of black people was worse than most of us would think he really didnt know the black american and in most cases thought him basically a free spontaneous noble savage the liberal when he came to think about the paucity of black revoltsthere was not really a paucity of them was ashamed of blacks in fact before the black_power movement few whites felt any pride in the achievements of blacks consequently the black_power movement brought black pride and identity not so much to ghetto blacks as it did to white liberals who now can feel proud of their blacks feel proud of the fact that blacks finally are accepting themselves finally creating a black culture finally becoming aware of the white mans pernicious politics for the white the black was invented with black_power before that there were only slaves stupid selfhating niggers who wanted to be white what a weird view of history the wouldbe black bourgeoisie was in the same position as the white he couldnt jump off into the black bourgeoisie because that had been blown he couldnt go back into the ghetto because thats not the american way of life and so he jumped off into what the mass media and the present government termed black_power naturals are beautifuland there were some beautiful black sisters before them too my mother was onebut i suspect the people who were starving before the inception of the black is beautiful craze are probably dead by now what i am suggesting is that one must be very careful with the media for the simple reason that it always does the reverse of what it pretends to do in its attempt to inform the public it only succeeds in providing content for itself the media in other words a televised account of a police attack on the black_panthers becomes finally the content for the newsit becomes television but of course if the show is viewed by another black_panther he will say if someone asks him what he is i watching i am watching this brother talk about the pig which is real if most viewers would respond thusly the image would be a ii true image of reality it would be true protest and not merely a mirror reflection the media is counterrevolutionarythat is it is against destroying itself hence against destroying the white viewer whom it pacifiesbecause the moment protest is introduced into the media it ceases being protest and become the news a new tv show about spooks etc it is true that the media is one way of getting recognized but the error in this is that most people confuse the presentation of a problem with the solution to the problem the impact of eldridge cleaver in society obscures for many the fact that thousands of black men are in prison because of the injustice of white society television has come to belong to nixon and the white liberals who argue that the problem is not racism but class the latest technique is to have blacks on television yes but to have them putting each other down on screen one evening i watched four shows where there were blacks putting down blacks there is the black cop who puts down the black criminal they had james earl jones saying things like man if racism is your bag youre a drag the black employer puts down the black employeethe assumption being that blacks are racists against themselves if you want to understand the media check this out leslie uggams show she is always kissing white boys and talking sex with them enough to make you puke is the whitest show on the air right and sly and the family stone who are maybe the blackest thing going appear on leslie uggams show why because when it comes to media there is only media it is not simply a matter of saying that black actors will do anything for a part or that a performer will appear on anybodys show for the money like the fifth dimension can be seen on the woody allen show right alongside billy graham its all media although it certainly looks that way but rather they are into a thing which cuts across other categories like politics race sex etc the sixties should have shown us the way the media works against the black man that is the industrialized black man and the seventies should reveal the wavs the media j orientated black man will deal with that in the seventies i suspect black criticism will be keener than it has been in the past will be keen enough for example to detect that the media itself is racist literacy is a technique of the media which has always worked against black people when the white man discovered africa he called the whole continent illiteratethat is pagan voodoo deserving of slavery etc but how could africa be illiterate when it didnt have a literate tradition the white man made the black slave believe he was a slave because he was illiterate and how could the slave defend himself unless in fact he was literate when however the slave did become literate literacy is also christian moral whiteness he became bonded in a way he had never been before he was bonded to white culture and the only way he could free or even explain that bond was to become whiter or rather more literate when the slave learned to read for the first time he experienced the modern white mans sense of guilt and alienation for he felt cut off from his own experiences here is the confession of a slave pennington which is supported by the confessions of other slaves like frederick douglass vassa booker t washington after he learned to read i was made to feel that whatever else i might do i was not qualified to do that as i have myself alienated from himgodby wicked words was deeply convicted of the guilt of my own sins against god the black writer today must be aware of the influence of literacy on his art he must be aware of all the sideaffects of this medium car insurance c v owning a car is usu ally a necessity espe dally in areas where public transportation is inadequate and people have to travel long distances to get to work the high prices and declining quality of care the rising cost ol repairs and maintenance are painful enough the cost of financing cars is a great burden especially when the owner has to pay out large sums for car insurance while he is paying for the car sometimes paying interest on the insurance as well in the black community flybynight insurance companies which often go bankrupt leaving their clients holding the bag in case of an accident prey upon their victims by charging astronomical rates there are families of working people who pay a thousand dollars a year just for car insurance to cite once more my own experience when i lived in detroit the only liability insurance could get involved paying a year and signing a contract to renew the policy at the same rate for additional years when i moved to ann arbor i got the same coverage with a reliable company for i worked for many years in negligence law offices dealing mostly with auto accident cases worked in plaintiffs work defense work and for the defense office of a large insurance company and my conclusion is that car insurance is a fantastic racket which milks the policyholders and the victims of accidents for the sake of the insurance companies the doctors and the lawyers engaged in the business it is estimated incidentally that half the income of the lawyers in this country comes from accident cases here is the problem no one can collect damages no matter how great their injuries unless they can prove that the other party was wholly at fault for the accident and the injured party did not contribute in any way to the accident a vast field for litigation is created and many people with serious damages are not compensated because they cannot prove that the other party was entirely at fault furthermore insurance companies will settle claims for minor injuries just to avoid the expense of defending them but in cases of serious injury no expense is spared in defense the case is dragged out to force the victim to settle for less than the case is worth and the more serious the injury is the less likely is the compensation to be adequate then if the victim finally collects about onethird goes to his lawyer another big chunk to the doctors who testify for him charging witness fees in addition to fees for treatment then there are the defense doctors many of them with highsounding titles and qualifications who havent practiced medicine in years since they find it more lucrative to spend their time testifying in court for insurance companies the obvious solution is an insurance commission which would collect a reasonable fixed sum with each car license with which to compensate victims of auto accidents for personal injury and property damage regardless of who is to blame for the accident extreme cases of negligence or recklessness would be a criminal not a civil matter this solution would afford much better protection to the public at lower cost and eliminate the race tax on car insurance guaranteed annual wage or negative income tax this simple and reasonable substitute for the welfare system would eliminate the cost of maintaining a bureaucratic structure manned bv social worko ers who play a largely negative and destructive role in the black community concretely i have in mind the complaint of an adc mother that investigators from the welfare department had broken down her door trying to catch her sleeping with her husband tax appropriations we need to proclaim a new equality equality of public services it is grossly inequitable to allow the congregation of wealthy families into communities where they provide themselves and each other with lush funds for schools hospitals parks and recreation sanitation and every conceivable public service leaving those trapped in the cities to suffer with only a fraction of the funds per capita which is spent in the suburbs the principle should be established on a statewide if not a nationwide basis that tax funds for municipal services be allocated to each community on a per capita basis dismantling and decentraliza tion of municipal government once equitable funds have been provided municipal functions should be localh controlled on the basis of small community units breaking up the purposefully blind corrupt and irresponsible bureaucracies of our large cities police and municipal courts jails and juvenile homes education health sanitation housing inspection the licensing of businesses parks and recreation would come under the control of the local community with officials elected locally and directly responsible to the community inmates of jails and juvenile homes should be transferred to the control of the communities from which they come all jail sentences pronounced in the past should be reviewed by the new community courts capital punishment should be ended as a largely black mans punishment municipal employment and business ownership andor management would be by people residing in the community stores which overcharge customers or sell poorer quality or smaller selection of merchandise than in suburban branches would have their licenses revoked the community could hire comparison shoppers from among local housewives to visit suburban food chain stores and compare price and quality the drug traffic i will conclude with what i believe to be the most vital question that is the illegal drug traffic it is obvious that those who profit most from the drug traffic have little to fear from the police and the courts which are supposed to be protecting the publie hardearned dollars are poured on a grand scale from black pockets into the coffers of the underworld it is hard to overestimate the extent of drug addiction in the black community official estimates are ludicrous i have a friend who was brought up on w th street in harlem of all the boys who grew up on his block he is the only one who is not either dead in jail or a street addict the situation in michigan is not much if at all better the fact that the medical establishment in michigan suffers from selective blindness does not change the real world out there the illegal drug traffic is an extraordinarily ruthless efficient exploitative mechanism fueled mainly by heroin a desperate need for drugs is created and a corrupting structure pervades the community sale of drugs is one important means of supporting a habit pressure is immense to create new addicts to serve as customers spreading the structure into ever widening circles thus a pecking order is established in which survival depends upon ruthless exploitation of the next man or woman and at the outer fringe of the expanding pyramid are those who live by theft and prostitution victimized by the police a mass of highly motivated criminals is created street slaves lie hardearned dollars are poured on a grand scale from black pockets into the coffers of the underworld it is hard to overestimate the extent of drug addiction in the black community official estifor the organized underworld which collects au leaving the street addicts half starved and half naked avidly recruiting new victims in order to take some of the pressure off their own backs endless tribute is paid by the families of addicts who try to keep them alive and off the street many addicts work sometimes holding down two jobs in an effort to support their habits without resorting to crime as a historian of afroamerican slavery i cannot resist the temptation to compare the relatively crude means by which slaves were forced into theft and prostitution with the much vaster more efficient more impersonal means employed in our cities today in the cities of the spanish empire theft and prostitution were carried out thinly disguised as slaves working for themselves in return for bringing back a certain amount of money each day to the master a spanish law in forbade masters from sending their female slaves or free black women out in the street to sell things and if they do not bring back the profits which the masters suppose they should they send them out at night to whatever torpor and dishonesty leads them another spanish law of makes the situation even clearer we have been told of the harsh punishments which some masters inflict upon their slaves even for making small mistakes with the scandalous abuse of sending black and mulatto women out to earn a daily sum most of them going out in public nude causing a great scandal and committing many mortal sins in order to bring to their masters the money they require in brazil travellers were shocked by the large numbers of respectable brazilian ladies who lived off the immoral earnings of their female slaves male street slaves were engaged largely in theft clearly the system is more efficient now the masters do not own any particular slave who they had to pay a lot of money for so they dont care whether an individual slave lives or dies they dont need to punish their slaves they have the police the courts and the jails for that and if these are not enough they have the national guard and the army in fact they never see their slaves the only time they notice them is when they threaten the social order then the masters deplore violence rioting and crime in the streets no one even slightly familiar with how openly the drug traffic is carried on in the black community can doubt that it is thoroughly protected but there is an aspect of the protection afforded by the institutions of our society to the drug traffic which is less familiar that is the intimidation of the medical profession by federal narcotics agents who dont seem to worry about the drug traffic out in the streets so much as that maybe a medical doctor will have enough professional selfrespect to treat an addict i approached several doctors about treating addicts and their response was very enlightening one said theyll investigate my income tax another an eminent member of a state commission dealing with alcoholism and narcotics addiction said he knew nothing about addicts had never seen one and panicked at the suggestion that perhaps the experience would be enlightening another more humane and courageous doctor explained that he had treated an addict and received a visit from federal narcotics agents who scrupulously examine the prescriptions handled in drug stores they asked the doctor why he was treating this man the doctor insisted upon his right to do so thereafter a pharmacist who filled his prescriptions reported to him that federal narcotics agents had been around asking if he thought that the doctor was a drug addict at a highly respectable ritual held at the university of michigan last january attended a panel on medical aspects of drug addiction i asked the members of the panel from the floor why doctors are so afraid to treat addicts a psvehiatrist who practices in detroit answered that the problem no longer exists since the american medical association had accepted new guidelines allowing physicians to treat addicts thereupon i took out a pencil and paper and asked for the name of a doctor in detroit who would treat addicts he said to write to him and he would send me a list i wrote he never answered our society treats addicts worse than lepers were treated during the middle ages they are ostracized like lepers but unlike lepers they are refused medical treatment i talked to a man in new york who told me he was refused admission to four different hospitals when he was suffering from acute serum hepatitis because he had needle tracks on his arms whatever socalled treatment available until very recent years has been a monopoly of the psychiatric establishment which now has a big stake in its obviouslv false theories o of addiction but patients are a necessary evil if you want to get grants and so the psychiatric establishment clings desperatelv to its besieged positions essentially they blame the victimthe usual pastime in our societyby denying the physiological basis for addiction claiming that addicts choose to use drugs and can choose to give them up elaborate and very expensive hospitals and detention centers are set up sadistic group therapy sessions are indulged in to cure the socalled addictive personality the victims are supposed to beg the psychiatric establishment long and hard for treatment to prove how motivated they are thats supposed to be therapeutic and when the treatment fails the doctors blame the patients and change the patients instead of the treatment there is a very effective medical treatment for heroin addiction it is safe very inexpensive and widely applicable so far this treatment has been made available to relatively few addicts not for medical reasons but because only a few private doctors have begun to treat addicts the treatment involves substituting methadone taken once a day orally for heroin methadone is a synthetic narcotic it allows the addict to function normally it is not debilitating like heroin the dosage does not have to be escalated it does not produce euphoria it simply represses withdrawal symptoms and drug craving it costs about cents a day the treatment was developed by dr marie nyswander a psychiatrist and dr vincent dole a biochemist a husband and wife team at rockefeller university in new york dr nvswander after many years attempting to treat addicts at the united states public health hospital in lexington kentucky concluded that psychiatry was irrelevant to the problem and that heroin addiction is basicallv a metabolic disease there are nearly patients in the program which is now supported by the state and city of new york dr nyswander found that the socalled addictive personality disappears when the drug cravings are satisfied and concludes that heroin addiction is not psychogenic but results when drugs are made available to large numbers of adolescents normal adolescent curiosity would prompt experimentation and physiological predisposition would make addiction inevitable for many of these youngsters the black community has had to face the problem of availability of drugs for many years the problem is somewhat more recent in middle class white communities although there are methadone programs in a number of states there is no such program in michigan i am interested in contacting people especially medical doctors who are willing to initiate treatment either in their private practice or through an institutional framework it is often said that street addicts are very hard to get to know ive found that on the contrary its easy all you have to do is treat them like they are human this is such a unique experience for them that they are shocked into a trusting relationship it may sound strange but my faith in humanity was restored by getting to know street addicts who live by theft and prostitution in spite of the frightful degradation of their lives their desperation their helplessness they go on living maintain a wide margin of decency and a great deal of compassion for each other when i ask myself if i believe that i could survive physically or morally under those conditions my answer is no when i was studying the methadone program in new york i talked to and listened to the conversations of several patients on the program some of them had started methadone maintenance treatment in jail they were speculating about why there was a twoyear waiting list to get methadone treatment one patient said they cant open it up to everyone because if they did seven out of the eight floors at the tombs a large prison in new york would be empty and the wardens would lose their jobs i believe that this profound insightful statement says more than all the thousands and thousands of words in the riot commission report a year after the great detroit uprising we see one new building going up on the skyline of detroit it is an extension to the jail the only other major construction projects noticeable are more expressways to get out of town on and so beyond all the rhetoric it is obvious what the power structure has faith in not a word is required just look at the detroit skyline and during the merciful silence perhaps a few people will have enough courage to perceive our nation the way it really is and enough love for and faith in our nation to try to change it dr kwame nkrumah the first african leader to win independence for his people in our time has written a new book handbook of revolutionary warfare international paperback like everything written by nkrumah ever since the declaration to the colonial peoples adopted by the panafrican congress held in england this book is a call to colonial peoples to unite themselves for the struggle against imperialism and colonialism this latest publication is particularly significant however because it represents the reflections and projections of an african leader who having ruled an independent african state the nation of ghana for nine years was then deposed by a combination of internal and external neocolonialist forces kwame nkrumah has felt the harshest blows that the imoerialist enemy can deal but these have only made him more determined to fight this fact itself gives us an insight into the revolutionary spirit of the man a spirit which is continually reinforced by his scientific analvsis of the period in which we live nkrumah is always mindful that we are living in a period of worldwide revolution and counterrevolution and that revolution is not a matter of a single day or a single battle but entails a long struggle in the course of which setbacks and retreats are inevitable it is this tenacitv of spirit and consciousness of worldwide revolution and counterrevolution backed up by continuing scientific evaluation of the movement which distinguishes such great revolutionary geniuses of our period as mao tse tung fidel castro and ho chi minh from the moment that nkrumah became president of independent ghana in march he made clear that independence for ghana was only the beginning african nationalism had now been established in the gold coastthe new ghana he wrote in his autobiography published on the eve of his inauguration from now on it must be panafrican nationalism our task is not done and our own safety is not assured until the last vestiges of colonialism have been swept from africa in the declaration of fundamental principles adopted by the new nation ghana explicitly offered to surrender its hardwon sovereignity in order to further the development of a union of african states in april only one year after the celebration of independence nkrumah called together an allafrican conference of independent african states to pledge themselves to the eradication of colonialism on the continent freedom fighters from all over africa among them patrice lumumba found in ghana the political organizational and material resources to fortify them for liberation struggles in every african colony from south africa to algeria and from kenya to the congo when the french imperialists retaliated against guinea for its decision to leave the french union by destroying everything and anything from railroad ties to light bulbs that the guinea people might be able to use to develop their country nkrumah responded by sending millions of dollars in aid and ghana and the republic of guinea united to form the nucleus for a union of african states thus in action and not just in words kwame nkrumah in power dedicated all the resources he could muster to the cause of panafrican unity and the continental struggle against colonialism no wonder therefore that to this day the leaders of such progressive african nations as guinea tanzania and zambia refuse to recognize the counterrevolutionary military regime which now claims to rule in ghana the recent political history of africa can be divided into two main phases which obi b egbuna president of the universal coloured peoples association the british black_power organization has called bg and ag meaning before the emergence of ghana and after the emergence of ghana respectively frightened by the specter of ghana independence the british french and belgian imperialists devised a new strategy of giving political independence to other african nations after a period of negotiation to ensure their continued dependence upon the mother country as a result in the s dozens of other african nations have celebrated their independence each enjoying all the trappings of sovereignty in the form of black presidents black parliaments black judges and black policemen but in most cases as the handbook makes clear this independence is only a sham independence since economic power remains in the hands of international finance capital and each nation is too small to be much more than a supply depot to these international corporations legally and politically these nations have sovereignty and independence but in fact they are dependent neocolonialism has taken the place of naked colonialism all over africa these independent nations continue to struggle on each one separately in a pathetic and hopeless attempt to make progress while the real obstacle to their development imperalism mainly in its neocolonialist stage is operating on a panafrican scale before the african people can defeat neocolonialism they must rid their minds of the geopolitical map of africa which the imperialists drew up at the berlin conference of in place of this map with its little red green blue and yellow pieces each representing a sphere of influence carved out by the various imperialist powers for their own purposes african freedom fighters must substitute a new panafrican map based on the conception of the armed struggle which is now necessary to liberate the entire continent of africa on this liberation map there are only three kinds of territories liberated areas contested areas and enemyheld areas liberated areas are those which having achieved some political independence through the mobilization of the masses make themselves into a base or beachhead for advancing the liberation of other areas which are contested or under enemy control contested areas are those ruled by weak puppet governments and where the revolutionary forces are wellorganized and so close to seizing power that the government is only superficially in command enemvheld areas are those like south africa where the police state nkrumah stresses the need to clarify the goals of the revolution the nationalist phase is a necessary step in the liberation struggle but must never be regarded as the final solution to the problem raised by the economic and political exploitation of our peoples he points out the danger of unity for the sake of unity in fact the oau organization of african unity is in danger of developing into a useful cover for the continued sterile action of conflicting interests the only difference being that in the context of one big brotherly organization reactionary tactics are camouflaged and applied through all the subtleties of negotiation he calls for a political party linking all liberated territories and struggling parties under a common ideology he insists on the equality of women women may join the training centers on the same basis as men and be eligible for the same responsibilities and authority in this period when the black movement in the united states is searching for clarity and direction it can derive inspiration and guidance from an african leader who at every stage of his political development has made public the principles by which he has guided his actions james boggs undoubtedly one of the most dramatic events to occur within the last few years has been the emergence of the black_panther party as a moving force within american society the black_panther party as is generally known was founded in oakland in by huey p newton and bobby seale the oakland panthers derived their name from the black_panther party that was organized in lowndes county alabama by the students nonviolent coordinating committee sncc the purpose of the sncccreated black_panther party was to challenge the legitimacy of the racist political structure in lowndes county this was to be the first programmatic expression of the ideal of black_power as defined by sncc using the black_panther party as its vehicle sncc confined itself to educating and organizing the disenfranchised blacks in lowndes to the importance of the vote in the local primary election in sncc unsuccessfully ran an entire slate of black candidates in opposition to the democratic partys lilywhte slate of candidates obviously influenced by these developments newton and seale felt that a similar operation was needed in the urban ghettos of the north the major distinction however was that they saw the need to organize black people around the issues of selfdefense and police brutality rather the vote as a result the black_panthers have now progressed to the place where they emphasize a total workers revolution in america rather than the simple acquisition of group political power in limited area where blacks happen to be in the ma jority as the panthers view it it i no longer a question of reforming th democratic or republican party or of creating a few more jobs in the major corporations for qualified blacks but of completely liberating black people from the racist oppression and economic exploitation ink herent in the american system this light it was only a matter of time before the inevitable revealing in side expose of the panthers was written gene marine senior editor of ramparts magazine has undertaken this task in his work plainly titled the black_panthers bantam marine has sought to capture in print the flavor of the panthers cataclysmic impact on the contemporary american scene marine somewhat apologetically reminds the reader in the beginning of the book that he is a white man seeking along with the rest of white america to learn just what makes these young outspoken black jacketed young black men and women tick as marine puts it i try to be sympathetic to anything i want to understand and write about but the more i work on the subject the more i know that sympathy is not my primary feeling deep in my white possibly racist probably unrevolutionary heart i am afraid of the black_panther party it is fairly certain that the black_panthers will not provide these readers who think of themselves as politically aware with any new facts or insights into the workings of the panthers marine though does present a systematic and concise recount of the panthers past activities the author step by step details the important events in which the panthers have been involved he also gives a wellbalanced look at the personalities involved such as newton seale and eldridge cleaver who the general public has come to intimately associate with the panthers marine however while honestly trying to state the panther case has not attempted to probe at any depth the ideological currents that have produced an organization like the panthers he also does not adequately discuss such questions as what are the historical precedents for the establishment of such a group what are the implications of revolutionary black nationalism as opposed to black cultural nationalism what are the main theoretical distinctions between the panthers and other supposedly militant groups such as core and the nation of islam do the panthers genuinely represent the feelings of the black masses in addition to these questions there are of course many other aspects to the panthers that marine has neglected to touch upon marine as the typical groping white radical cannot really be blamed for any of the books shortcomings in these areas he is white it is difficult if not impossible for a white man any white man no matter how sympathetic to the black struggle or how radical he may profess to be to really understand the complex aspirations of black america the problem for the white writer is doubly compounded when one adds to this scheme the ingredient of a black group that talks and acts as if it hates every value and institution in american society the problem here is even more confused when one considers the myriad of lies and distortions that the racistcontrolled mass media has foisted on the american public about the panthers not to mention those other groups that are demanding basic changes in the american social order little by little though the word is slowly getting out to the masses of people that they too are being victimized by a corrupt and repressive system the black_panthers if nothing else is a positive contribution to those forces that are trying to clear the obstacles blocking the path to black liberation for this reason alone i recommend for those trying to grasp the meaning of present day events that the black_panthers be checked out for as cleaver has warned if youre not part of the solution youre part of the problem earl ofari when i think of the w home town of my youth all that i seem to remember is dust the brown crumbly dust of late summerarid sterile dust that gets into the eyes and makes them water gets into the throat and between the toes of bare brown feet i dont know why i should remember only the dust surely there must have been lush green lawns and paved streets under leafy shade trees somewhere in town but memory is an abstract paintingit does not present things as they are but rather as they feel and so when i think of that time and that place i remember only the dry september of the dirt roads and grassless yards of the shantytown where i lived and one other thing i remember another incongruency of memorya brilliant splash of sunny yellow against the dustmiss lotties marigolds whenever the memory of those marigolds flashes across my mind a strange nostalgia comes with it and remains long after the picture has faded i feel again the chaotic emotions of adolescence illusive as smoke yet as real as the potted geranium before me now joy and rage and wild animal gladness and shame become tangled together in the multicolored skein of goingon as i recall that devastating moment when i was suddenly more woman than child years ago in miss lotties yard i think of those marigolds at the strangest times i remember them vividly now as i desperately pass away the time waiting for you who will not come i suppose that futile waiting was the sorrowful background music of our impoverished little community when i was young the depression that gripped the nation was no new thing to us for the black workers of rural maryland had always been depressed i dont know what it was that we were waiting for certainly not for the prosperity that was just around the corner for those were white folks words which we never believed nor did we wait for hard work and thrift to pay off in shining success as the american dream promised for we knew better than that too perhaps we waited for a miracle amorphous in concept but necessary if one were to have the grit to rise before dawn each day and labor in the white mans vineyard until after dark or to wander about in the september dust offering ones sweat in return for some meager share of bread but god was chary with miracles in those davs and so we waitedand waited we children of course were only vaguely aware of the extent of our poverty having no radios few newspapers and no magazines we were somewhat unaware of the world outside our community nowadays we would be called culturally deprived and people would write books and hold conferences about us in those days everybody we knew was just as hungry and illclad as we were poverty was the cage in which we all were trapped and our hatred of it was still the vague undirected restlessness of the zoobred flamingo who knows that nature created him to fly free as think of those days i feel most poignantly the tagend of summer the bright dry times when we began to have a sense of shortening days and the imminence of the cold by the time i was my brother joey and i were the only children left at our house the older ones having left home for early marriage or the lure of the city and the two babies having been sent to relatives who might care for them better than we joey was three years younger than i and a boy and therefore vastly inferior each morning our mother and father trudged wearily down the dirt road and around the bend she to her domestic job he to his daily unsuccessful quest for work after our few chores around the tumbledown shanty joey and i were free to run wild in the sun with other children similarly situated for the most part those days are illdefined in my memory running together and combining like a fresh watercolor painting left out in the rain i remember squatting in the road drawing a picture in the dust a picture which joey gleefully erased with one sweep of his dirty foot i remember fishing for minnows in a muddy creek and watching sadly as they eluded my cupped hands while joey laughed uproariously and remember that year a strange restlessness of body and of spirit a feeling that something old and familiar was ending and something unknown and therefore terrifying was beginning one day returns to me with special clarity for some reason perhaps because it was the beginning of the experience that in some inexplicable way marked the end of innocence i was loafing under the great oak tree in our yard deep in some reverie which i have now forgotten except that it involved some secret secret thoughts of one of the harris boys across the yard joey and a bunch of kids were bored now with the old tire suspended from an oak limb which had kept them entertained for awhile hey lizabeth joey yelled he never talked when he could yell hey lizabeth lets go somewhere i came reluctantly from my private world where you want to go what you want to do the truth was that we were becoming tired of the formlessness of our summer days the idleness whose prospect had seemed so beautiful during the busy days of spring now had degenerated to an almost desperate effort to fill up the empty midday hours lets go see can we find some locusts on the hill someone suggested joey was scornful aint no more locusts there yall got em all while they was still green the argument that followed was brief and not really worth the effort hunting locust trees wasnt fun any more by now tell you what said joey finally his eyes sparkling lets go over to miss lotties the idea caught on at once for annoying miss lottie was always fun i was still child enough to scamper along with the group over rickety fences and through bushes that tore our already raggedy clothes back to where miss lottie lived i think now that we must have made a tragicomic spectacle five or six kids of different ages each of us clad in only one garmentthe girls in faded dresses that were too long or too short the boys in patchy pants their sweaty brown chests gleaming in the hot sun a little cloud of dust followed our thin legs and bare feet as we tramped over the barren land when miss lotties house came into view we stopped ostensibly to plan our strategy but actually to reinforce our courage miss lotties house was the most ramshackle of all our ramshackle homes the sun and rain had long since faded its rickety frame siding from white to a sullen gray the boards themselves seemed to remain upright not from being nailed together but rather from leaning together like a house that a child might have constructed from cardsa brisk wind might have blown it down and the fact that it was still standing implied a kind of enchantment that was stronger than the elements there it stood and as far as i know is standing yet a gray rotting thing with no porch no shutters no steps set on a cramped lot with no grass not even any weedsa monument to decay in front of the house in a squeaky rocking chair sat miss lotties son john burke completing the impression of decay john burke was what was known as queerheaded black and ageless he sat rocking day in and day out in a mindless stupor lulled by the monotonous squeaksquawk of the chair a battered hat atop his shaggy head shaded him from the sun usually john burke was totally unaware of everything outside his quiet dream world but if you disturbed him if you intruded upon his fantasies he would become enraged strike out at you and curse at you in some strange enchanted language which only he could understand we children made a game of thinking of ways to disturb john burke and then to elude his violent retribution but our real fun and our real fear lay in miss lottie herself miss lottie seemed to be at least a hundred years old her big frame still held traces of the tall powerful woman she must have been in youth although it was now bent and drawn her smooth skin was a dark reddishbrown and her face had indianlike features and the stern stoicism that one associates with indian faces miss lottie didnt like intruders either especially children she never left her yard and nobody ever visited her we never knew how she managed those necessities which depend on human interactionhow she ate for example or even whether she ate when we were tiny children we thought miss lottie was a witch and we made up tales that we half believed ourselves about her exploits we were far too sophisticated now of course to believe the witchnonsense but old fears have a way of clinging like cobwebs and so when we sighted the tumbledown shack we had to stop to reinforce our nerves look there she is i whispered forgetting that miss lottie could not possibly have heard me from that distance shes fooling with them crazy flowers yeh look at er miss lotties marigolds were perhaps the strangest part of the picture certainly they did not fit in with the crumbling decay of the rest of her yard beyond the dusty brown yard in front of the sorry gray house rose suddenly and shockingly a dazzling strip of bright blossoms clumped together in enormous mounds warm and passionate and sungolden the old black witchwoman worked on them all summer every summer down on her creaky knees weeding and cultivating and arranging while the house crumbled and john burke rocked for some perverse reason we children hated those marigolds they interfered with the perfect ugliness of the place they were too beautiful they said too much that we could not understand they did not make sense there was something in the vigor with which the old woman destroyed the weeds that intimidated us it should have been a comical sightthe old woman with the mans hat on her cropped white head leaning over the bright mounds her big backside in the airbut it wasnt comical it was something we could not name we had to annoy her by whizzing a pebble into her flowers or by yelling a dirty word then dancing away from her rage revelling in our youth and mocking her age actually i think it was the flowers we wanted to destroy but nobody had the nerve to try it not even joey who was usually fool enough to try anything yall git some stones commanded joey now and was met with instant giggling obedience as everyone except me began to gather pebbles from the dusty ground come on lizabeth i just stood there peering through the bushes torn between wanting to join the fun and feeling that it was all a bit silly you scared lizabeth i cursed and spat on the ground my favorite gesture of phony bravado yall children get the stones ill show you how to use em i said before that we children were not consciously aware of how thick were the bars of our cage i wonder now though whether we were not more aware of it than i thought perhaps we had some dim notion of what we were and how little chance we had of being anything else otherwise why would we have been so preoccupied with destruction anyway the pebbles were collected quickly and everybody looked at me to begin the fun come on yall we crept to the edge of the bushes that bordered the narrow road in front of miss lotties place she was working placidly kneeling over the llowers her dark hand plunged into the golden mound suddenly zingan expertlyaimed stone cut the head off one of the blossoms who out there miss lotties backside came down and her head came up as her sharp eyes searched the bushes you better git we had crouched down out of sight in the bushes where we stifled the giggles that insisted on coming miss lottie gazed warily across the road for a moment then cautiously returned to her weeding zing joey sent a pebble into the blooms and another marigold was beheaded miss lottie was enraged now she began struggling to her feet leaning on a rickety cane and shouting yall git go on home then the rest of the kids let loose with their pebbles storming the flowers and laughing wildly and senselessly at miss lotties impotent rage she shook her stick at us and started shakily toward the road crying black bastards git long john burke john burke come help then i lost my head entirely mad with the power of inciting such rage and ran out of the bushes in the storm of pebbles straight toward miss lottie chanting madly old witch fell in a ditch picked up a penny and thought she was rich the children screamed with delight dropped their pebbles and joined the crazy dance swarming around miss lottie like bees and chanting old lady witch while she screamed curses at us the madness lasted only a moment for john burke startled at last lurched out of his chair and we dashed for the bushes just as miss lotties cane went whizzing at my head i did not join the merriment when the kids gathered again under the oak in our bare yard suddenly i was ashamed and i did not like being ashamed the child in me sulked and said it was all in fun but the woman in me flinched at the thought of the malicious attack that i had led the mood lasted all afternoon when we ate the beans and rice that was supper that night i did not notice my fathers silence for he was always silent these days nor did i notice my mothers absence for she always worked until well into evening joey and i had a particularly bitter argument after supper his exuberance got on my nerves finally i stretched out upon the palette in the room we shared and fell into a fitful doze when i awoke somewhere in the middle of the night my mother had returned and i vaguely listened to the conversation that was audible through the thin walls that separated our rooms at first i heard no words only voices my mothers voice was like a cool dark room in summerpeaceful soothing quiet i loved to listen to it it made things seem alright somehow but my fathers voice cut through hers shattering the peace twentytwo years maybelle years he was saying and i got nothing for you nothing nothing its all right honey youll get something everybodys out of work now you know that it aint right aint no man ought to eat his womans food year in and year out and see his children running wild aint nothing right about that honey you took good care of us when you had it aint nobody got nothing nowadays i aint talking about nobody else im talking about me god knows i try my mother said something i could not hear and my father cried out louder what must a man do tell me that look we aint starving i git paid every week and mrs ellis is real nice about giving me things shes gonna let me have mr ellis old coat for you this winter god damn mr ellis coat and god damn his money you think i want white folks leavings god damn maybelleand suddenly he sobbed loudly and painfully and cried helplessly and hopelessly in the dark night i had never heard a man cry before i did not know men ever cried i covered my ears with my hands but could not cut off the sound of my fathers harsh painful despairing sobs my father was a strong man who would whisk a child upon his shoulders and go singing through the house my father whittled toys for us and laughed so loud that the great oak seemed to laugh with him and taught us how to fish and hunt rabbits how could it be that my father was crying but the sobs went on unstifled finally quieting until i could hear my mothers voice deep and rich humming softly as she used to hum to a frightened child the world had lost its boundary lines my mother who was small and soft was now the strength of the family my father who was the rock on which the family had been built was sobbing like the tiniest child everything was suddenly out of tune like a broken accordion where did i fit into this crazy picture i do not now remember my thoughts only a feeling of great bewilderment and fear long after the sobbing and the humming had stopped lay on the palette still as stone with my hands over my ears wishing that too could cry and be comforted the night was silent now except for the sound of the crickets and of joeys soft breathing but the room was too crowded with fear to allow me to sleep and finally feeling the terrible aloneness of am i decided to awaken joey ouch whats the matter with you what you want he demanded disagreeably when i had pinched and slapped him awake come on wake up what for go way i was lost for a reasonable reply i could not say im scared and i dont want to be alone so i merely said im going out if you want to come come on the promise of adventure awoke him going out now where to lizabeth what you going to do i was pulling my dress over my head until now i had not thought of going out just come on i replied tersely i was out the window and halfway down the road before joey caught up with me wait lizabeth where you going i was running as if the furies were after me as perhaps they wererunning silently and furiously until i came to where i had halfknown i was headed to miss lotties yard the halfdawn light was more eerie than complete darkness and in it the old house was like the ruin that my world had becomefoul and crumbling a grotesque caricature it looked haunted but i was not afraid because i was haunted too lizabeth you lost your mind panted joey i had indeed lost my mind for all the smoldering emotions of that summer swelled in me and burst the great need for my mother who was never there the hopelessness of our poverty and degradation the bewilderment of being neither child nor woman and yet both at once the fear unleashed by my fathers tears and these feelings combined in one great impulse toward destruction lizabeth i leaped furiously into the mounds of marigolds and pulled madly trampling and pulling and destroying the perfect yellow blooms the fresh smell of early morning and of dewsoaked marigolds spurred me on as i went tearing and mangling and sobbing while joey tugged my dress or my waist crying lizabeth stop please stop and then i was sitting in the ruined little garden among the uprooted and ruined flowers crying and crying and it was too late to undo what i had done joey was sitting beside me silent and frightened not knowing what to say then lizabeth look i opened my swollen eyes and saw in front of me a pair of large calloused feet my gaze lifted to the swollen legs the agedistorted body clad in a tight cotton night dress and then the shadowed indian face surrounded by stubby white hair and there was no rage in the face now now that the garden was destroyed and there was nothing any longer to be protected mmiss lottie i scrambled to my feet and just stood there and stared at her and that was the moment when childhood faded and womanhood began that violent crazy act was the last act of childhood for as i gazed at the immobile face with the sad weary eyes i gazed upon a kind of reality which is hidden to childhood the witch was no longer a witch but only a broken old woman who had dared to create beauty in the midst of ugliness and sterility she had been born in squalor and lived in it all her life now at the end of that life she had nothing except a fallingdown hut a wrecked body and john burke the mindless son of her passion whatever verve there was left in her whatever was of love and beauty and joy that had not been squeezed out by life had been there in the marigolds she had so tenderly cared for of course i could not express the things that i knew about miss lottie as i stood there awkward and ashamed the years have put words to the things i knew in that moment and as i look back upon it i know that that moment marked the end of innocence people think of the loss of innocence as meaning the loss of virginity but this is far from true innocence involves an unseeing acceptance of things at face value an ignorance of the area below the surface in that humiliating moment i looked beyond myself and into the depths of another person this was the beginning of compassion and one cannot have both compassion and innocence the years have taken me worlds away from that time and that place from the dust and squalor of our lives and from the bright thing that i destroyed in a blind childish striking out at godknowswhat miss lottie died long ago and many years have passed since last saw her hut completely barren at last for despite my wild contrition she never planted marigolds again yet there are times when the image of those passionate yellow mounds returns with a painful poignancy for one does not have to be ignorant and poor to find that his life is barren as the dusty yards of our town and too have planted marigolds the louis theatre opened its new season last weekend with the monster and no use cryiri two plays showing different aspects of the black revolution the monster a one act play by ronald milner depicts the dilemma of black students on the nations campuses here they must confront a professional negro and deal with him if they are to realize any selffulfillment they devise a strategem to make the professional negro reveal his true self he is the dean of the college by day he walks with the blacks talks the talk dresses in their style and wears a natural wig by night he sheds this and goes into his otner bag white one brother discovers this with a number of other brothers and sisters and plans a solution to the problem presented by this dangerous duality and duplicity as staged by pemon rami at the louis this play achieves the desired results in the opening weekend however it suffered from some technical drawbacks mainly lighting one whole circuit went out the acting could be improved and it no doubt will be as the play runs raybon myers playing ali the leader of the revolutionary students must be credited with a fine performance the rest of the cast was only adequate for the opening milner once again demonstrates his deft touch he is a remarkable playwright the dialog catches the mood of the movement and the characters are as beautifully drawn as one could expect in such a short offering black theatregoers will remember milners whos got his own it has enjoyed successful runs in new york los angeles and at the louis in chicago no use cryin is bill harris first olay to be produced it shows that he las an ear for the speech of black people this is a fulllength play though rather short as plays go the entire play is set in the living room and kitchen of a black factory worker in a northern city the family consists of a father mother a teenage son a teenage daughter and a preteen son this family suffers from an identity crisis nobody can identify with father he in turn is frustrated in his efforts to provide his family with lifes luxuries which he was denied his frustration is exemplified by his drinking wasting money and bullying his wife and children his main line of reasoning runs a son should be more than his father he constantly replays his childhood for his children his oldest son meanwhile completely rejects his fathers notion of what constitutes manhood he is not content to be a secondclass citizen he lets this be known by striking out against anyone who tries to put him into this category this lately has been mainly his employers and the police the daughter is a student with heavy interest in black history and culture she wears her hair natural to the chagrin of her father the younger son identifies very closely with his sister the mother is rather docile trying hard to keep her family to the second annual conference of african and africanamerican studies in the undergraduate college will be held

dates from tombstones he splashed through mudholes and puddles peering into the darkness finally he saw a city of light and walked there he was standing in a crowded night club an orchestra blared and laughter rose in the smoky spaciousness of the highceilinged room all the people were orientallooking the women wore red chinese dresses and the men wore black flowing robes he walked among the cluttered tables searching for his mothers face at the back of the room he came to a small dimlylit bar there were six bar stools all unoccupied his grandmother stood behind the bar grinning toothlessly and wiping a crystal goblet he sat down the old woman placed a clean towel on the bar before him and then she reached under the bar and brought forth a golden machete she gave the machete to him he wept he was a small boy again a brown lamb child with a rainbow mind scrambling for love and a tender patontheback he was cold again afraid and earthbound full of frozen rage tonguetied and trembling he was shushed tweeked crooned to kissed nuzzled and clucked and shoved into a corner his mother took his arm and led him to the door opening the door she pointed out into the black night and said little nigger get out of here he was sitting in the front pew of the church everyone was singing precious lord the pulpit was made of gold the preacher rose and stepped forward to the pulpit the singing stopped as the preacher started to pray one of the deacons started to chant the spiritual leaning on the everlasting anns other voices joined in the singing the slowly increasing rhythm of the singing began to move him and he started to sway from side to side and hum all his fears vanished and he felt joyous and deliriously happy he ran forward and fell before the pulpit crying loudly i repent i repent the singing stopped the preacher stopped praying the room became quiet as he rose and turned to see the congregation stand up the people wore halloween masks and stood mute and frozen he held out his arms to them speechless and silently imploring their forgiveness he was naked and standing before the electric chair which was painted orange the death chamber was pale and empty but above him in the gallery sat all the oriental people from the night club they rose en masse pointing to him and screaming kill kill he stepped up on the small platform and sat down a hooded figure came forward and adjusted straps and buckles around his arms and legs the room turned blue then purple then blue again and finally blackness came he needs these rotten monotonous days he must never forget them must never forget the pain the silent aching pain of black life in the slums he must never forget the hunger and the shame his suffering must not be unlike the suffering of his slave ancestors his anguish must now give birth to beauty and pride kill him crack his black skull is he no less the man for all his faults and highyellow skin than his african forebears is he less a man than the white rapists who stole down into the slave compounds through midnight shadows to brew the wide spectrum of bastard offspring destroy his family unit hide his history much of it is your own history your violence is manifested in his behavior for you are he and he is you the pnk dream the city is rosy pink from the moons midnight glow a running man sprints across an empty street stopping before the ywca entering the building he dashes into the girls dormitory and with a gleaming machete disembowels a sleeping virgin clutching the girls bleeding heart he runs out through a rear door and melts into the jungle as he lopes through the sweltering jungle foliage african drums resound in the night locusts cling to his damp black back and murmuring watusi children shout simba simba as they dance around his fallen gasping body he crawls to the witch doctors hut still clutching the bloody heart the traffic light dances up and down and noises from the traffic stream echo his airy dreams he leaps aboard the clanking trolley car vibrating from shinbone to shoulder he angles his tall frame into the hardbacked seat beside the pinkcheeked white girl whose muskscented perfume invades his breathing he fulfills his need to be punished and says hello white girl she is dollfaced with a button nose and from her poreclain ears hang jade earrings her ruths curls thick and electric frame her blue eyes which dart birdquick and fearful in curious captivity his nearness his black male nearness rasps on her dainty awareness he forces her into conversation flushed with an urge to be hated daring her refusal needing her disdain and contempt her tender neck blushes red as she smiles heroically opening the closed areas of her face she becomes a beautiful black girl stamping her tiny foot she screams for attentiona pregnant sheba in a tenement trap she turns white again her face pinched and hard from too many orgasms she shouts get the torah get the book he does not answer staring into his empty wine glass seeing the bizarre mau mau rites the senseless assassinations and the quizzical look on his mothers face the pregnant blackwhite girl strides toward him raising her skirt certain of her feminine magnetism he falls to his knees the room becomes a cathedral a smil ing priest touches his shoulder and blesses him the christ statue is a black christ as it smiles down from the rood strains of ave maria drone softly and shafts of sunlight crisscross the rooms quietness he counts the shadows that loom across the empty lonely room quiet earlymorning hours fill the hourglass slowly and sleep will not come to him above him in another tenement flat a strident voice cries out from the terror of nightmare and frustration he turns to his small radio jiggles the red dial searching for a connection with the real world hunger and need make a poet of him oh pauline where are you baby how long must i yearn for your soft embrace i am a wounded tiger trapped and caught in steel and concrete ripped open and bleeding in the darkness i need you now as i fight my way through these murky corridors i need to touch your breasts your lips you are my invisible venus lost somewhere in the streets waiting to be slain by the ticktock beat of blues and rainyday sadness the death dream running from dark shadows in san francisco he stopped and kissed an old flower woman bought roses from her and ran across the golden gate bridge shot and bleeding as he ran he shouted im guilty guilty do you hear save me save me the old woman saintly in her ancient sadness wiped away his blood and made the sicn of the cross she gathered up her flower box and moved on into the stygian night he framed his tearstreaked face against the windowpane rubbed his swollen wounds and heard the plaintive wail of a crapshooter bet i hit somebody fade me he heard the peal of cathedral bells calling the faithful to worship the sleeping girl naked and lying facedown on his bed groaned and murmured as wispy shadows weaved dark patterns about the room he looked down at her exposed flanks curved and symmetrical and they reminded him of the bomb restins somewhere in a silo threatening the unborn future while furtive dynamiters were creeping into black churches to spew their death and ignorance across the face of the world he stumbled into the small kitchen and slumped down at the table he started to write on a note pad he felt a thundering pumping in his veins eyes apop he felt himself soaring into a glittering humming nothingness he felt himself reaching high for a soft kiss from eternity the naked girl padded into the kitchen to find him slumped across the table he had written two lines on a tablet the girl picked up the note pad and read dear world light a firecracker and explode your fears lets all go to mississippi and vote for albion midnight we are mere organisms wreathed in the flowers of fate and folly pawned to the mystical future tainted

monuments in sandboxes and swing from tree limbs in the sunlight sfc ae the black dream the brick street in front of his mothers house was red bright red and shining with the baked redness of autumn trees lined each side of the street but they seemed suspendedfloating above the flowers and shrubbery of the square neat lawns a brilliant orange sun sped across the noonday sky moving easttowest and westtosouth never still his shadow danced around him as he ran stumbling down the street shouting father father he sat crosslegged in the basement wine bottle in hand his blind friend howard reclined on the linoleum carpet humming the blues and scratching himself the house shuddered violently and split open they floated above the shifting scene giddily reaching for the flying debris his mother ran across the undulating lawn calling to them he sat in the last pew over the heads of weeping mourners he could see a bier surrounded by flowers many of which were limpid and bloodstained canada lee stood in the pulpit reciting elegy written in a country churchyard an invisible choir sang a dirge as two nude african girls appeared at his side and escorted him down the aisle to the coffin he looked into the coffin and saw himself he screamed as he gazed down at the lifeless man lying in the lush grey casket the death figure was dressed in african ceremonial robes and a shrunken chrysanthemum was clasped in its lifeless hand a howling chinaman draped in a torn white sheet and hood crashed through a stained glass window he was shouting dirty communists rotten anarchists people screamed and fell to their knees as the death figure floated up from the coffin slowly as he watched himself float above the howling people he saw the chinaman fling gold coins among the frenzied mob the floating cadaver drifted out the stained glass window s v v his jungle is one of rotting paintchipped buildings subdivided and dotted with countless little storefronts where dusty darkness invites

caint take you there aint nuthin in chicago a monkeywoman like you can do the white dream the room is circular with a high mirrored ceiling the windows extend from the ceiling to floor each bordered with gold and white drapes the walls are white and their roundness gives him an odd feeling of shifting dimensions in the middle of the room is a large white round bed upon which lies a young nude black woman she is lying on her back breathing rhythmically with her arms flung akimbo she turns over and her dark muscular form is in stark contrast with the rooms brightness there is no other furniture the windows seem sealed how did he enter he walks around slowly watching the nude woman she stirs looks at him and smiles he stares up into the mirrored ceiling and sees her body reflectedbut not himself he searches the mirror for sight of his own image as desire creeps down into his loins he yells where am i wheres my reflection he claws at the air seeking some tangible reason for his absence in the mirror seeking acknowledgement of his existence the voluptuous black female roots herself in the middle of the round bed crooning softly sweetie you didnt make it you just didnt make it he rips away his clothing tearing it wildly from his body naked he stands with arms outstretched staring up into the ceiling he sees only the woman he turns to face her wanting her to see him to see his maleness and rising desire to realize the reality of his presence he leaps upon the bed prepared to drive her mocking laughter from the room as he reaches out to grab her the room darkens and she becomes a large green and yellow boa constrictor the snake begins to weave its head hypnotically he throws himself backward choked with fear he feels himself caught and gripped in the hands of his mother and father who shove him forward into the coiling grip of the serpent he croaks in wordless terror as he is enveloped within the icy coils which slide and move smoothly around his body from somewhere outside the room he hears the tinkle of glasses and sounds of people laughing and talking as the coils tighten nausea boils up in his throat darkness descends he is alone and shivering the bed is empty the room has become glowing red the ceiling is now transparent exposing a clear blue sky spotted with occasional fluffy clouds he crawls to the edge of the bed and finds himself hovering over the edge of an exploding world with the burgeoning of v unct black studies courses vv a all over the country thanks to the forceful and resourceful efforts of the black community there comes a need to assess and place the works of the black writers of immediate concern is the evaluation of those works now in paperback which are or will be of particular use to school and university teachers one of these is the novel beetlecreek by william demby now in paperback from avon books already we have had an assessment of the novel by robert bone in his the negro novel ii a merica rev ed new haven yale university press i would tend to disagree with this critics overemphasis on the existentialist nature of this interesting work and instead i would like to stress its human content biographical details supplied by bone p have some bearing on the novel william demby was born in clarksburg west virginia in the heart of the mining region which provides the setting for beetlecreek his education at west virginia state college was interrupted by two years of army service in italy on his return he was able to finish his degree at fisk university thanks to the gi bill he graduated in being interested in art as well as literature he returned to italy to study at the school of art at the university of rome where he has remained to write screen plays for roberto rosellini his recent novel the catacombs new york random house strikes one as reminiscent of the fellini world of roman society of deeper significance dembys creative writing contributions to the fisk herald while at the university have a cosmopolitan strongly gi antifascist flavor for example in an undergraduate story published in december and called saint joey a white teenage gang led by a religious fanatic decided to murder an old recluse who has upset the racial mores of the community the antecedents of beetlecreek are obvious in beetlecreek the gang becomes a negro one the old recluse turns into bill trapp a white living on the edge of a negro community the nightriders which the visiting pittsburgh youngster johnny joins is fascist in its fanaticism and sadism and has sufficient motive force to make johnny turn from his new friend bill only to return as a crafty enemy while understanding the relations between the life and the art of demby robert bone overstresses the existentialist core of beetlecreek judging by his criticism the novel is an elaborate framework for the main characters to ask themselves the question what do i want of life and then because they have no positive goals the attempts at assertion following the questioning lead only to their own destruction without doubt this kind of patterning is apparent in the story but ones interest is absorbed far more by the unusual situation of white recluse bill trapp living as the white minority in a negro settlement and more especially by the very human way in which the recluse tries to break through the barriers a lifetime had erected and which kept him aloof from human companionship in the last analysis beetlecreek is a human document not an existentialist one to substantiate this last point one may first assemble the existentialist evidence of robert bone p and then show how the novel goes beyond this philosophical base in its impact at the beginning of the novel bone explains bill trapp terminates years of solitude and thus displays the celebrated courage to be of french existentialism set against this striving for life is the deathliness of the beetlecreek community conveyed through the barbershop crowd narrowness and defeatism the funeral scene shallowness and hypocrisy the persecution of bill trapp cruelty the community is a ghost town in a more profound sense than its having exhausted its coal deposit for bone the plot itself revolves around the frustrated negro artist david with whom john is staying the boy is meant to be only a shadow of his host although it is hard to see how this description fits one so lifelike continuing the existentialist explanation bone shows that david is trying to break out of the stagnation of beetlecreek by attaching himself to a childhood sweetheart who is visiting the town but she has the death kiss of the big city upon her for a moment he makes the right choice by supporting bill trapp against the prejudices of the community but he gives in before the mass hysteria of the other townsfolk john who has left his sick mother in pittsburgh is lonely like david but one feels that bone is overstressing the likeness when he equates the adult loneliness of david with that of the boy john also supports bill trapp until he later betrays him under pressure from the nightriders gang the similarity with davids betrayal seems merely situational unless one wants to fit everything into an existential framework bones summing up of the affinities between the two cases seems farfetched in the light of the evidence he states it is true the existentialist definition of evil above all of david and johnny who suffer their creative powers to be perverted rather than endure a spiritual vacuum p but the boys humanity is being squeezed out by bones cerebral interpretation not by the actual story for instead of being an existential cutout johnny appears in the story as a very real human being in order to put the philosophical base in the background where it belongs one should note the evidence in beetlecreek that makes it stand as an ordinary story without the props of existentialism the picture of the old recluse at the start trying to open the chrysalis of solitude is not overpainted nor superficially rendered always when he looked in the mirror his eyes were different sometimes they peered from out of the broken glass asking an unanswerable question sometimes they were angry and damning sometimes they were sullen and brooding too often they were the eyes of a dead man jellied and blank william demby beetlecreek new york rinehart co p when johnny johnson invades the loneliness of may farm the old man is spurred on to companionship he ran to the mirror and looked at himself he tried to smile for years and years he hadnt washed his teeth he found a broken piece of comb and tried to do something with his hair he was conscious of a change of life in him a change that seemed to have come suddenly but he knew was prepared for years before p meanwhile in the town mary davids wife is having her own battle with a selfimage this character is consistently portrayed as truly feminine in her hopes and fears her life centers around the womens club of her church and her animosities center around mrs tolley the president she imagines herself standing in front of the ladies presiding over a meeting as if in shame for what she was doing she pulled the blankets over her face to hide the grotesque expression of dignity she had shaped her face into imagining herself in a black dress saying to the ladies this meeting will now come to order p throughout the novel marys anxieties concerning her standing at the club and for her stall at the upcoming parish fair afford an extra human background to the main plot as the novel closes david is eloping bill trapps cabin is on fire but mary is basking pleasantly in selfadulation after the success of marys bestest gingercake stall to see john and the recluse merely as existential figures is to miss the warmth of feeling displayed by the old man towards the boy and the latters own troubled reactions towards bill trapp the old man centers his return to companionship around the young negro every morning found him up and about long before dawn he was restless and spent his time doing unnecessary things he mended the traps and pruned trees working always near the road hoping to see the colored boy hoping to see any human walking towards his place p eventually he is accepted by the townspeople because of his generosity and he appears among them as a pied piper hordes of children ran shrieking up and down the street he tucked in his belt straightened his hat and boldly began to walk past them p johnny on the other hand is torn between a poetic world in which he sees all nature and all men as kind and the other world of harshness but solidarity in the gang true in the end he succumbs to the pressures of the gang and obeys the summons to bring forth the gasoline that will destroy trapps home but his previous mixed feelings are very much those of the young adolescent they do not need the existentialist philosophy to prove them true demby writes well of this younger consciousness from the time john shows compassion for the beetle to the time when the youth feels that other irrepressible feelings are stirring in him everything he did was frozen out there in front of him so that right after he did it he could look at the action examine it and measure it and say to himself how funny it was and wonder if it was really he who had done it p david the frustrated artist has similar troublings of spirit in which the consciousness feels that other forces are beginning to stir and black enameled death that he had seen the funeral of mrs johnson of beetlecreek represented everything of beetlecreek and was like the restlessness and dissatisfaction of the birds only inside him swarming and swooping inside him filling him with vague fear and shame preparing him for something telling him warning him separating him from the things that were happening around him apart from him pulling him along towards things that he could not see or know p but one does not have to see both john and david as examples of the same existentialist patterning in demby both survive as human beings even the subsequent betrayal of davids renewed artistic yearnings is not to be seen as caused by some inhuman force crushing him the author uses a convincing irony to show davids being trapped by his own aspiration not surprisingly the artist david finds beetlecreek a womb in which one is suffocated and this feeling of being trapped throws him upon edith in his frustration he sees her as different and really alive but his charged emotion has caused him to misjudge the situation as demby implies at the very end of the novel when david is eloping with edith she barks at him once inside the coach in a dry scraping voice dont always be so goddam loveydovey he has given up one painful situation for another sufficient evidence has been introduced to show that the human content of beetlecreek far outweighs the existentialist patterning that is brought in by bone as interpretation let us begin to be honest with each other by first being honest with ourselves there is no precedent for revolution in this country among blacks we of us are a revolutionary party and we have come to set a series of precedents we have decided that we must first deal with the cultural revolution others have disagreed with it the disagreement has not disappointed us emotionally however ideologically the position and opposition to the cultural revolution in time and context tends to be incorrect we have said before that th red book is better read it has no relevance if we never read enough to refer to it intelligently it is mao the master who hat taught us weapons are an important factor in war but not the decisive factor its people not things that are decisive the contest of strength is not only a contest of military and economic power but also a contest of human power and morale if weapons are not the most decisive factor but people then what are we to do with weapons and what path must we pursue with the people us has said and continues to say that the battle we must fight now and always is the battle for the minds of black people and if we lose that battle we cannot hope to win any other battle therefore the slogan pick up the gun is simply a slogan not a program or an ideology nor a value system that would make us victorians for if mao is as correct as those who refer to him would have us believe then what we should concentrate on is not the weapons but the people how can we win the people that is the question it is not a question of how can we kill the enemy for the people must decide that that is necessary themselves or the vanguard will vanish and the revolutionary party which has placed itself in a front position will fall flat on its face and history will hide all of them if we concede that mao is the master and revolution is the reality then words are wasted on discussions of weapons for as mao says again although barehanded the masses can subdue the enemy and then he goes on to say in our daily life is there any object that cannot be used to kill the enemy or any type of action that cannot reduce or destroy his fighting strength since the principal function of an armys weapons is to simply destroy the enemy and or reduce or destroyhis fighting strength therefore we must win the will of the people so that they will have the will to be a nation or the first stage of national development is a cultural nation ie a group of people with a common value system that gives us the will to be together to share and fight together and to seek the sovereignty as a political nation so that we can defend and develop ourselves with national effectiveness the problem with most people who do not understand cultural nationalism is that they see cultural nationalism in terms of a narrow definition of culture which deals with the arts whereas we of us which is a revolutionary party with a correct revolutionary ideology seek culture as a total value system and institutions to maintain and develop that value system it is no accident that mao says to the chinese that they must combine nationalism with internationalism for in developing it further he says that only by fighting in defense of china during the revolution that they could achieve national liberation and then make it possible for other people to achieve their national liberation therefore we see it as a mistake to make a distinction between cultural nationalism and revolutionary nationalism when nationalism today by its very nature has to be revolutionary if it is for liberation from the colonial power which rules a peoplebecoming if liberation is the chief goal as all wouldbe revolutionaries repeatedly reveal to us then any movement toward liberation puts one in conflict with the people in power and that conflict creates the context for the revolution but what must be understood is that no one can save us but ourselves we must speak for ourselves we must develop our own ideology as we of us have done in terms of kawaida every revolutionary struggle has proved that you cannot import revolution again it is mao who tells us in the fight for complete liberation the oppressed people rely first of all on their own struggle and then and only then on international assistance because revolutions are similar but at the same time time and circumstance bring about differences and not paying attention to differences will ultimately lead to defeat one last reference to mao is appropriate in terms of his concern with the chinese maintaining their culture we have said that mao has made marxism meaningful only by absorbing it and then transcending it that is why we know marxism is for the western people not black people too he said in the new stage that even in relationship to marxism we chinese must adopt a national form before we can find marxism useful and we should never subjectively or mechanically apply it let us stand as a people first speak our own language develop and reinforce our own culture and revolutionary ideology and make revolution rather than references to other peoples revolution the red book would never be relevant if mao had not won and we have always thought that he has done himself a discredit by calling himself a marxist and the young chinese proved this by calling themselves maoists we of us understand that the revolution can only be made when the people desire that they are a people and want to make it and culture is the cement that binds blacks together therefore it is absurd to make a distinction between cultural nationalism and a suprastructure for all different types of nationalism since culture is a total value system including religious nationalism political nationalism artistic nationalism and even what may be called atavisma return to the past because one cannot deal with the present and refuse to face the future this is the year of reconstruction let us reconstruct labeling our brothers will not leave us with fewer problems the enemy seems to endure in spite of the debates i but if we as revolutionaries surj vive by that very survival we prove that the enemy is not invincible young james alan mcpherson might rejoice in the fact that a man is defined not by what he says but rather by what he does the short stories collected under the title hue and cry little brown and company leave little doubt as to what mcpherson can dohe can write short fiction as well as anyone living in america who is under and make all the more inane his dust cover utterings see october negro digest about trying to keep the color part of most of them far in the background where these things should rightly be kept in the very first of his stories a matter of vocabulary a tale out of what obviously is the authors background mcpherson tells us with rare tenderness how he learned about being black and that sense of blackness is not absent in any of his stories where in the honesty of the telling it is expected to be found indeed as revealed in a story called private domain mcpherson knows something of the exasperation and the futilityof trying to flee from ones blackness but i suspect that his selfimposed estrangement from black writers of his own generation has left him believing that someone would deny him the right to speak also of the identity crisis peculiar to young whites in america which he does remarkably well in the very same story anyone who has sat in morning court in an american city will recognize the old men in the second row in mcphersons story an act of prostitution as a perfect metaphor for the millions upon millions of good citizentype americans who never fail to be entertained by their countrys absolute lack of moral authority mcpherson tells his story with a hand restrained in such a way as to prevent the reader from divorcing himself from the cruelty of its characters it is a story about the powerless at the mercy of the powerful but it does not neglect to demonstrate how a showing of power by the former can quickly alter the style as well as the behaviour of the latter for most of us a lifetime will be too short a period in which to see all the lonely people so clearly as mcpherson sees them but on the other hand neither will most of us throw off the chains that keep us from admitting as mcpherson has admitted that all the lonely people are ones self it is the story of a young man who does not find in his being a user of women a reason for feeling morally superior to a weak and altogether pathetic homosexual he suffers therefore no less for his inability to let himself be used by the desperate man than he does upon refusing the sexual advances of a girl for whom he had selfishly made plans before discovering her to be unattractive at the beginning of the story the young man deceives one woman into believing that he wants her in order to get away from the homosexual she had only been a convenient and manly excuse for getting out of that shop without having to give an aging fairy specific reasons why i would not have a scotch with him perhaps the american male in his terror has come to view woman as nothing more than an object through which he might escape facing himself and other men a mystery at the bottom of which might rest the key to the american females fastgrowing determination to be something other than a woman all of which suggests a state of affairs about as sad as mcphersons gracefully told story in which the character is forced in his flight to take satisfaction in a certain affirmation of something a certain pride a sense of some small and sensual accomplishment a solo song for doc is the story of something old something dying and about the people who however unrecognized invested it with a flavor and a style without which it would have been something quite different and who moreover loved it even as they came to hate and fear it and know that it like them had had its day it is about the railroad and the black men who ran on the road finally it is about america in the writing of this story mcpherson makes it unmistakably clear that he has acquired keen and reliable insights into the lives of the masses of black people who go day after day year after year to those unspeakable jobs where they perform in such a way as to appear fairly content with the rules and the rule of the white man his however is the insight of one who knows that what they feel in their bones is not easily measured by their appearance it is of course an insight the full value of which will not be realized until the architects of the revolutionary vision have begun to listen to the people with an ear half as good as mcphersons james alan mcpherson is a craftsman who writes with authority about this america and the people who live and fight and grow dull and die here he has experienced this country and its people rather widely in a short time his writing ought to be celebrated for the clarity with which he comments upon the quality of american life which our best vision would have us avoid mcpherson writes with a quiet power that rips away at the minds deeply buried illusions and works its way into the soul like tears of humility understatement in his hand is as revolutionary in its way as was truth in the mouth of malcolm in his title story he speaks of a black girl being married by nature to a cause and i for one hope that he will consider his own words for i see no rational reason for him to deny that he is a black artist volume of black artists on art is an attractive production editors samella s lewis and ruth g waddy two enterprising west coast artists have gathered a group of artists of varying talents and viewpoints in the covers of the first real attempt at the firstclass framing of black artists in a book since cedric dovers american negro art c the book is very now and very conscious of the mood among the bulk of todays black artists and intellectuals concern about the present moment and black consciousness in fact animates the book there are photographs of some of the works of the artists featured in the book but there also are statements from the artists about their motivations their impulses and their craft in her introduction miss lewis a member of the faculty at california state college dominguez hills outlines the context of the book a truly valid system of aesthetics should be derived from the culture of its inhabitants and should reflect the prevailing spirit of the times in a manner that involves all groups residing within the society this direction would provide for a concept of relationship that would include both commonalities and differences since it is the difference that sharpen or give vitality to the commonalities it would seem that the necessity of a culture to accept and respond to such diversities is a requisite to creative production many pages could be written concerning art and its relative importance from a cultural standpoint it can be briefly stated however that the control of this cultural empire is and percent from the white group this is not because whites are more cultured but because they control the economy and consequently dictate the specific aesthetic standards miss waddy speaks to another aspect of the same theme art is not an intellectual exercise approached through structural learning emotions styles and practiced in museums galleries and private collections art is spiritual the primary function of which is for the benefit growth and improvement of the human animal the artists are quoted as to their views on art and some of them of course are out there on cloud nine holding forth with cliches and irrelevancies some like david p bradford have joined cold reality and beauty into a theory of black art a black art must have the rhythm freedom and excitement of a john coltrane solo as well as make a statement to its viewer mr bradford says black art must be folksy and natural by this i mean it must derive from pure talent and not from the arrangement of light bulbs and tin foil for the experience of black folk in america have been a folksy experience and black people the world over are close to nature and the natural process of things in nature mr bradfords work is presented in color as is the work of a number of the artists represented in the book there are photographs of all the artists plus a brief biographical statement about each of them in the back of the book since the book is billed as volume the assumption is that a volume or volume will follow in such a case the complaint that the editors have been narrow in their selection of artists would not be valid there is however no indication anywhere in the book as to whether there will be other volumes or when or what area the subsequent volumes will cover it is hoped that future volumes will pay attention to the dozens of superb artists in such cities as detroit chicago philadelphia new york and washington dc volume of black artists on art seems to place emphasis on artists in the locality inhabited by the editors the book is designed by howard lee it is published in two editions a hardcover and a paperback by ward ritchie press of los angeles riverside drivehoyt w fuller im done crying by louanne ferris as told to beth day m evans and company is primarily a story of a black woman whose energies are spent in providing for her family and in proving herself worthy of the vocation she has chosen the author has presented miss ferris story in an alive hardhitting fast paced manner in which no words are wasted the events of louannes teenage marriage early pregnancy and semidesertion by her husband are related in plain lan guage when louanne becomes the sole support of her two sons she finds employment in a big city hospital as a kitchen aide and from that moment the bulk of her story is devoted to exposing the deplorable conditions in the institution she does this in a rather methodical manner beginning in the kitchen and proceeding through to the various wards the emergency room the operating room and the morgue in each instance her observations and descriptions of conditions seem brutal but are in most cases pathetically true the city hospital as an end of the line institution must admit anyone this includes the victims of abortions the junkies and the cats who get knifed every saturday night the malpractices the misjudgments and abandonments on the part of its staff are clearly spelled out by miss ferris as she progresses with the aid of a seriously dedicated but roughmannered registered nurse kilpatrick from kitchen aide to nurses aide to practical nurse to miss ferris a particular job regardless of its title is to be performed cleanly efficiently and with concern for the patient unfortunately she meets with indifference and all too often hosility on the part of her coworkers in her efforts im done crying is more than an exposure of hospital negligence it is also a commentary on urban ghetto life characterized by narcotics the numbers racket and illicit sex these conditions and their existence in the hospital environment presents an angry but interestholding plot characterizations are sensitively presented the reader is introduced to some dedicated persons such as dr durand who had the roar of a lion but sincere concern for all patients and contempt for staff malpractices the inspiration which miss ferris receives from nurses kilpatrick and lome offers an infinitesimal degree of brightness to a somewhat hopeless situation miss ferris story is quite aptly titled she was done crying after she had held many dying patients and after she had seen her son die from a then incurable kidney disease her determination and consequent survival offers a degree of hope to others like her this is a disturbing story but one which will be read and reflected onjo hudson
the impotent talk endlessly of power beyond talk we do nothing i do not trust fervor fer vor is the preferred weapon of the impotent we know who we are where we are were slaves caught in a world constructed against us we know what and where we wish we could be it would be good to live masters of our own selves in a world weve constructed to meet needs of our own the disaster of the black man lies in the fact that he was ensla ved but behind us our past has been an endless disaster our present is sheer impotence and ahead of us even fools have begun to see destruction the black man has no ontological resistance in the eyes of the white man overnight the black man has been giv en two frames of reference within which he has had to place himself his metaphysics or less pretentiously his customs and the sources on which they were based were wiped out because they were in conflict with a civiliza tion that he did not know and that imposed j itself on him the catastrophic drift could be stopped if we could think clearly about where we are decide where we want to be then act to move ourselves from here to there but thought is difficult talk is easy decisive action is impossibly hard and talk is so beautifully cool thats why the hottest sou food is never in short supply its brand name is bullshit in a week of days we do our ordered bit to keep this white world going above us above our people weekends we meet to trade bold lies about our freedom lost and found our power lost and found our femininitv our mas mf culinity whether they were ever lost before they were found above all we talk of our identity also lost and found anv boastful kind of talk just so long as it keeps us from having to look into the nausea the uselessness the impotence of these our lives at the risk of arousing the resentment of my colored brothers i will say that the black man is not a man our enslavers assure us weve been free these many years one of us looking far into this world were bound in and deep into his own soul came up with the truth another murderous white lie the white man in the capacity of master said to the negro from now on you are free we are not free we re not even able to achieve our humanity says fanon were damned souls aborted creatures suffering in hells created by white people to sustain their crass heaven the central fact of our lives the central statement in all of fanons work is simply this were slaves the black man is a toy in the white mans hands until weve looked hard at this fact not as a metaphor not as some poetic figure of speech but as a rockhard statement of what we are we cant even begin to understand fanon and without understanding him well never get where we need to go we may move without him but only blindly wasting energy if this coherence is not present there is only a blind will toward freedom with the terribly reactionary risks which it entails our enslavers have found a new sport these days they speak of our anger black rage is a marketable passion now slickly packaged after hot processing then advertized and hustled through exclusive middlemen a while back the going commodity was black nonviolence and the cats hustling that were priest priests not prophets prophthe settler keeps alive in the native anger which he deprives of outlet the native is trapped in the tight links of the chains of colonialism the natives muscular tension finds outlet regularly in bloodthirsty explosionsin tribal warfare in feuds between septs and in quarrels between individuals ets die lean railing against their peoples suffering fighting fate priests have always managed to live well off that suffering times have changed though our slavery hasnt a new breed of priests psychiatrists have sprung up not to live off the collective pain of whole congregations but to deal in individual suffering in all commercial privacy money continues to change hands from sufferer to soothsayer but now its not a collection its a fee in place of holy scriptures to keep the faithful good and blind there are profane scribblings aimed boldly at the marketplace offering the exciting experience of black suffering to enslavers so hardened they need this splashing in someone elses blood so they can feel alive in our haste to join the scramble for the gold they drop we have forgotten rage is not the disease not even the only symptom but one among an infinity of symptoms at their root not on the marketable surface lies the real sickness we are a people destroyed a conquered people conquest is a violent destructive happening it turns the conquered into broken pliable things objects upon which the conqueror acts handling shaping manipulating them a manichean world fanon calls it strange new word but check it out it describes the universe we live in its a persian idea meaning a never ending conflict between light and dark the idea has a simple moronic appeal light is good darkness is evil from this everything follows automatically whatever is light in color is morally good everything dark is bad its a perfect descrip tion of the kernel idea around which all white culture is constructed it is the primary idea white men have worked so aggressively and so long to impose on the entire world it is the governing rule of our slave lives today the most important effect of the success of this idea is this all white people are born with inherited advantages on which to construct their lives all black people are born with inherited disadvantages they must spend time overcoming if theyre to have any kind of existence at all life in this our world is arranged with this main concern how whites can keep and increase their advantages and at the same time keep us so tied up in our disadvantages we cant do anything but suffer impotently this is the tone of life wherever the dominant power is white in america latin and anglo all over africa in those parts of asia still under white western power in australia that the original process of our conquest was violent and destructive we all know by now the destruction of africa the killing of our people the scattering of part across the earth to build a material heaven here for white christians and jews the rest remaining slaves in our homeland working to make a better life for europeans we know of all that violence this european opulence is literally scandalous for it has been founded on slavery it has been nourished on with the blood of slaves and it comes directly from the soil and the subsoil of the underdeveloped world the wellbeing and the progress of europe have been built up with the sweat and the dead bodies of negroes arabs indians and the yellow races but after this first knowledge we risk a dangerous ignorance our conquest was not a momentary act of violence that staggered our ancestors alone and then was ended our conquest was only the beginning of an endless violence our present existence is this violence continued sharpened and refined institutionalized and made such a permanent part of our lives we often suffer it without being able to understand or even notice it were things not human beings we have dreams of the human beings we could become but this western world is built to crack our dreams and wishes to break us down till our best desires shrink and vanish to be replaced with the small mean hustling ways we use to survive personally from one slave day to the next at the risk of arousing the resentment of my colored brothers will that the black man is not a man it is a world constructed to keep us slaves eternally this world in which our enslavers pursue their peculiar happinesses with such deadly ruthlessness and we learn to make adjustments to constant pain apartheid is not some sickness peculiar to the white south african soul it is the whitest most brilliant expression of western judeochristian values in africa wherever the word of white westerners is law life is arranged so white people experience it as a blessing and it hits us with the force of damnation whatever could not be molded to the shape of these their values white people in their attack on the world have simply killed south africa has a racist structure now i shall go farther and say that europe has a racist structure genocide is not a twentieth century german invention it is the root of white western values everywhere the exact basis on which white civilization rose here in north america in south america in australia in africa it is the prime method for keeping western values alive in vietnam today except the boers the americans are the only modern nation that within living memory has completely driven the autocthonous popula tion off the soil tha t it had occupied in this connection it is worth noting that the carbs experienced the same fate at the hands of french and spanish explorers and slavery isnt something we suffered accidentally and which white people stopped when they saw it was bad it is simply the destiny of all people living under white mans rule if weve grown up thinking apartheid was some special abomination in a far off place that genocide was one mad germans game and that slavery ended when some lying white man said it did its because white civilization lives on many kinds of violence and were victims of that special violence meant to kill the mind in this fanon was no exception bom in on the small french west indian island of mar tinique he grew up in a world so messed up with white western values he didnt fully realize he was black until adulthood as a youth he was clearly convinced he was a frenchman his delusion of belonging in a white french society should not be strange to black people who still consider themselves americans fanon as a young man merely went along with certain assumptions we still consider normal the west indian does not think of himself as a black man he thinks of himself as a west indian the black man lives in africa so deeply did he believe these assumptions in fact that during world war ii when the germans conquered france fanon just seventeen and quite unaware of his own slavery went off to europe to fight in defense of french freedom have remarked that certain things surprised me whenever there has been any attempt at insurrection the military authori ties ha ve ordered only colored soldiers into action they were tmen of color who nullified the liberation efforts of other t men of color the war apart from hastening his maturity generally brought him into contact with people and situations that filled his mind with questions provided him with a few answers and a multitude of hunches to work on the most important of these questions and answers came from his encounter with the reality of africa under european rule military service gave him a chance to observe western civilization in action as it affected the arabs of north africa west indians fighting on the french side and senegalese soldiers also in the french army later he was to remember wondering why the french were so concerned to indoctrinate arab africans against black africans and vice versa and why white officers always sent in black soldiers to kill other colonial peoples fighting for their freedom some ten years ago i was astonished to learn that the north africans despised men o f color it was absolutely impossible for me to make any contact with the local population i left africa and went back to france without ha ving fa thom ed the reason for this hostility with the end of the war fanon went back to france registering as a medical student at the university in lyon he had always been an intense kind of person and as he grew this quality did not disappear it got deeper realizing he lacked that cold steadiness of nerve he would have needed to be a surgeon he chose to specialize in clinical psychiatry he had no difficulty qualifying fanon who was not one of the breed of supernegroes who do fantastically well against black competition but are content to sink with a grateful sigh into mediocrity once they bump into whites his was an active intelligence that grew more alert when faced with aggressive whites instead of getting paralyzed life at the university in lyon seems to have been pleasant enough for fanon he did not suffer for lack of personal friends he married a french girl and answered suspicions that he was making a sick choice by declaring he was going into marriage with both eyes wide open the truth of that remains a private matter but its worth noting that his wife continues to live in algeria as a citizen it was she who in june in response to the french philosopher jean paulsartres antiarab proisrael position after the israeli attack ordered sartres preface dropped from all subsequent printings of fanons most important book the wretched of the earth wish to be acknowledged not as black but as white who but a white woman could do this for me by loving me she proves t h a t i a m worthy of white love i he nigerian civil war nrl represents one of the j ii r most significant active symbols of the african strugge or a larger measure of self determination and unification of the exploited people of the nonwhite world being pursued today baldly stated the nigerian civil war represents the confrontation between the positive need for unity in the national politics of africa and the temptation to seek to continue the subservient status of the continent through the fragmentation of its parts the tragedy is that this confrontation is not as openly ideological in terms of white versus nonwhite interests in nigeria as it was in the congo but the fact is that at an even more profound level than in the congo this is the true nature of the forces that keep the nigerian civil war going the federal government of nigeria has waged a most benevolent war against the forces of division ever since this is a fact that must not be lightly passed over i have worked in war zones for more than a year now and have been an eyewitness to the fantastic restraint of the federal troops what is happening is quite the opposite of naked howling savagery painted by secessionist propaganda had the surface quarrel that gave rise to the crisis remained the only issue in the war reconciliation might very well have been effected within a few short months of the start of the war but if we look back quickly on the way in which the crisis was brought into being we will discern that these deeper influences were at work every step of the way postindependence nigerian politics like postindependence politics in most of africa were largely controlled not by the desires of the masses but by the manipulations of foreign power politics and international economic interests in order to ensure the preservation of their interests the large powers with economic interests invested in the nation as well as those with economic prospects in view in the nation sought to woo and to win the allegiance of the nations rulers the pressures brought to bear on the leaders of the young nation in this way led to the inevitable result of alienation between the masses who were led and the leaders who were supposed to lead corruption and disregard of the basic democratic principles of political action became the norm one industrialist an englishman whose factory employed more than nigerians in enugu before the war admitted to me that in the postindependence political era just before the crisis broke his benevolence exercised a measure of control over local politics according to how many jobs he would promise to certain supporters of certain candidates an oil executive a dutchman has told me that similar influence was wielded by his company in port harcourt while this syndrome which was widespread in the nation was not the only factor responsible for the breakdown of the democratic experience in the nation it is symbolic of the type of influence which foreign interests wielded in the political life of the nation at the same time the nigerian army was undergoing a process of change and growth having only been handed over to the full command of nigerians in it must of course be remembered that african armies are for the most part inheritors of the colonial military tradition of oppression rather than protection the change to an army of protection and defense from that of an army of oppression must give rise to traumatic problems especially within the officer corps the army has to identify on a benevolent level with people whom in its initial stages it was employed to coerce thus when as a result of the machinations of the politicians who sought to remain in power by cultivating the support of the nations economic enemies the gulf between the nations people and its leaders grow so wide that a full scale civil crisis was precipitated the young officers who saw in the ills of the nation the ills of their army sought to remedy both by attempting to eliminate in one stroke retrogressive elements in the military and political institutions in the nation tactical errors brought down the first attempt in january the coup did not give rise to a government led by those who started it instead it had the effect of eliminating a sector of the political experience of the country without being able to replace it with the planned political alternative hence it soon became obvious after the january coup that the governmental direction forced upon the new leaders was for the most part directed by the sentiments of the coup leaders who were then in prison or in hiding and had no real basis in any long term decisions taken by the new leaders of course such a situation was bound to lead to dangerous ambiguities in the process of political existence and identity in the nation and in the struggle to grasp the very ideals of the men whose incarceration had brought them to power the new leaders especially the southern hierarchy led by major gen johnson ironsi seemed to be indifferent to some of the most blatant betrayals of those same ideals in the execution of the january coup the most tragic of these was the fact that owing to previously men tioned tactical errors the ibo political hierarchy was virtually untouched by the events of january while the north west and midwest lost nearly all their most prominent and active leaders naturally the increasing trauma of tribal and intertribal suspicion raised by this situation was ripe field for the nations enemies they did not hesitate picking the lines of weakest division the foreign jackals moved in early they sought and in some cases found willing listeners in all sections of the country among the new leaders as well as among the people they concentrated particularly on the east and the north in the east they spoke of northern domination of the troop force of the army as a potential threat to the south in the north they spoke of eastern domination of the key posts in the officer grades in the army as being a continuation of the evils that should have been destroyed by the january coup what they were in fact doing was reading the already outlined ambiguities of the situation and heightening them along unnatural lines being fully aware that the new government was insecure in its directives because it was a government by default they felt that they could stave off the eventual correction of the january mistakes which would give rise to a truly national government working for the selfsufficiency of the community and against the continued ascendancy of external interests in the economic life of the nation tragically this trick worked to an extent and a line of suspicion was drawn between even the younger officers in the army the insensitivity of the ironsi regime to this problem was remarkable if the realities had been realised early enough and the ironsi hierarchy had been able and willing to take the drastic step of honoring the ideals of the young january coup leaders then the july mutiny would have been staved off but this did not happen the july mutiny however was the best thing that could have happened at that time because it succeeded again by default in placing the issues of division squarely before the nation ironically just as the january coup could be said to have failed so can the july mutiny be seen as a failure neither action resulted in its primary aim but remarkably the failure of the july mutiny seemed to give rise at last to a government that was prepared to honor the ideals of the first coup when major general yakabu gowon stepped in to quell the mutiny he did so with a full understanding of the native grievances of the mutineers for this reason he did not seek to berate them but rather to soothe their feelings and to promise that if given a chance he would head a national government that would seek to correct the grievances that they sought to eliminate by violence in a peaceful manner obviously such a promise was not in the best interests of the nations enemies and what is more the implied government would obviously be forced to review the basic causes of the alienation of the governed from the governing in an effort to heal the breach now it became necessary for the foreign interests who were the driving force behind the continuation of this alienation to step up their efforts to maintain a position of strength in nigeria by finding and supporting any internal movement that might promote division we can now only speculate on the reasons why this search bore greater fruit in the east under lt col odumegwu ojukwu than it did in the rest of the federation under major general gowon while both are young men one ojukwu had been openly contemptuous of the mutineers in july while the other as has already been pointed out was courageous enough to admit that native grievances existed but to express the opinion that such grievances could not be remedied by the method chosen it is therefore not surprising that ojukwu should have felt that his own stand which he was not prepared to change would not be popular within the framework of a reconstructed government that based its premise of justification on the recognition of the verities inherent in the grievances exposed by the july mutiny thus it was that right from this point in an effort to gain some semblance of legitimacy for his own stand ojukwu found it necessary to overplay the essence of ethnic divisionalism present in the upheaval and to project this essence upon the national situation in such a way as to impress foreign groups with the hysteria of purported genocidal persecution given his peculiar histrionic and oratorical talents it is not surprising that he was highly successful but his success was also to a large measure predetermined by the fact that his stand suggested division and was therefore sympathetic to the dilemma of the foreign interveners whose interests were being threatened by nigerias thrust towards selfsufficiency at this point with the above outline as our guide we must examine the present state of affairs in the light of its internal shape and effect one of the first things that major general yakubu gowon tried to do was to bring about a reconciliation of the divisive forces within the army these efforts were supported at the highest level by the senior officers of every region except the east as a result a deadlock within the army developed and the last and most publicized attempt to break it was the aburi conference which took place in ghana in it must be pointed out that this conference came after ojukwus highpowered drive to ethnicize the social problems of the nation in keeping with his july stand had culminated in the muchpublicized killing of several thousand people of both eastern and northern origins in the north and in the east thus it was that aburi which should have been a military conference was really a political confrontation however treating the crisis on the military level only enormous concessions were made to ojukwus stand it was agreed that for an undefined interim period troops would be confined to their regions of origin this might not seem in the best interests of the principle of unity in the nation but as has been said before major general gowon had pledged to settle the critical situation by methods of peace and he seemed prepared to compromise his own position of power even to achieve this however immediately after ojukwu returned to enugu he met with his advisers and some foreign sympathizers and announced that the stage was now set for the final thrust to division it now seems most likely that this remarkably insidious conclusion was prompted by the fact that even before deciding to go to the conference ojukwu had been in touch with his foreign backers and had been promised their unqualified support in the event of his deciding to pull out of the federation after this last ditch move it even seems likely that none of the western powers who were then observing the nigerian situation closely were sure that the degree of rapport reached between the different parties at that meeting could actually be reached ojukwu was aware of this and did everything he could at that meeting to maintain the state of deadlock when he was unsuccessful in this he found that the only chance of success for the force of division lay in ignoring the very points that he had won in the meeting and going ahead fullsteam towards his goal of a separate nation this surmise is borne out by the fact that his own eastern advisers were wary of his proposed trip to aburi feeling that just such a degree of rapport might be reached his trip to aburi was undertaken in an atmosphere of the closest secrecy even at the point of his departure from his regional capital enugu aburi was the greatest surprise that ojukwu and his foreign supporters ever had but it is interesting to note that the first signs of division in the ranks of his native advisers especially in the military forces appeared immediately after the aburi conference and culminated eventually in the death of two of the guiding lights of the original january coup major nzeogwu ibo who was the most idealistic and fearless initiator of the original effort in january was taken out of the jail in which he had been placed by major general ironsi and forced to lead secessionist soldiers at the early battlefront near nsukka there he made an attempt to escape from the rebel side into the nigerian lines but was shot by a nigerian sentry whose alertness played no truck with political ramifications to this day senior officers in the nigerian army lament this misfortune the other highly idealistic ibo officer major emmanuel ifeajuna who sought to effect reconciliation after the aburi conference was executed for his pains by col ojukwu in enugu in september just before enugu was liberated by the federal troops but all this is a bit ahead of the sequence of events the nigerian developments following the aburi conference featured major general gowons repeated pleas for another conference to iron out whatever differences might have given foreign interests a loophole for influencing col ojukwu to ignore his most concrete gains furthermore the redeployment of troops according to their regions of origin was started but had to be halted when it became apparent that another clause of the agreement eschewing violence as a solution for the crisis was not apparently sufficiently engrained in the actions of and principles of the secessionist army commanded by ojukwu since they were then discovered to be involved in large arms deals through the agencies of such nations as portugal and south africa it was at this point that the lagos government led by major general yakubu gowon decided to turn its efforts to some of the more profound political decisions necessary to secure the future stability of a united nigeria the problem of minority ethnic groups seeking a measure of autonomy through the creation of separate states within a unified federation of states forming one united country had been for a long time one of the most pressing political problems in the nation as has been said before because of the insidious influence of foreign politics on the political life of the country prior to the military era this was one of the most vocal and visible symbols of the alienation between the masses who sought this type of unity and the politicians who sought to subjugate the labor and political forces represented by these demands in order to control the flow of foreign wealth stolen from the nation into their own pockets the federal government under major general gowon addressed itself to this problem with remarkable zeal and after a series of pulsating meetings in lagos it was decided that eight new states should be created in the nation bringing the total to this had the effect of equalizing the ratio of mass representation on the councils of central government in the federation and thus ensuring the almost immediate elimination of domination from the top which ojukwu professed to fear however when the minority forces in his own region welcomed the lagos move ojukwu prodded openly by foreign backers refused to heed their demands for a rethinking of his position in the crisis and instead declared immediate secession from the federation thus coercing more than six million of the people under his nominal rule into a state of seige these are the facts of the start of the war and they form the basis of any true understanding of the present state of the crisis that of a benevolent civil war waged from a position of unity by the federal military government of nigeria and resisted from a position of division and neocolonialist support by the secessionists led by odumegwu ojukwu all that i have said so far is a prelude to the message that i wish to impart to all black activists on the side of the forces that seek selfsufficiency and consequent self determination for black men within the nonwhite community of this world we cannot in the light of the true political implications of this war afford to make decisions or utterances harmful to the cause of unity in this nation or helpful to the forces of division in it to do so will be to condone the intervention of our emotional and economic enemies in any internal and fraternal quarrel that we might have as i said at the start of my message the nigerian civil war is one of the most significant symbols of our struggle against such intervention today the secessionists have of necessity to seek such intervention in the form of socalled aid in this light ojukwu has addressed his wonderful sense of drama to dramatising the emotional issues involved and the ethnic divisions in the country in an effort to raise the bogey of genocide and starvation as his last ditch justification for promoting the division of this nation having impressed these lies upon the moral vanguard of the neocolonial forces through agencies of religion and relief he has succeeded in sustaining his rebellion by having arms and foreign currency procured for him by these white agencies under the pretext of carrying out humanitarian duties two examples of the way in which this is done will suffice to expose the true nature of the secessionist rebellion since the socalled biafran currency is not negotiable by virture of lack of material solvency the secessionist regime obtains foreign exchange by having some of these white agencies pay the amount of money meant for the purchase of local foods into foreign banks the foods are then bought from the farmers in the rebel areas in nonnegotiable currency and given to the relief organizations arms bought in switzerland france and the u s are flown to a central pool in lisbon from where they are flown by quota to sao tome a portugueseoccupied island off the nigerian coast out of which relief organizations flying to the rebel areas operate from there they are put into relief planes along with an equivalent weightload of relief materials to be flown to the rebel areas where such planes are not allowed to land unless radio signals from sao tome indicate that the proportion of weapons to food being carried is correct these are only two of several such devices employed by the rebel regime in pursuing its aim of perpetuating division in nigeria we cannot afford to lose sight of the fact that the nations engaged in ensuring the workability of such devices are nations dedicated to the external subservience of africa and the black race to their own burgeoning economic ascendancy i have written this as an appeal and explanation black brothers working in their various ways towards the ideal of unity and unit strength for our people in several parts of the world have written asking me to clarify for them my own relationship to this crisis in this black nation because i am here you black brothers have cited my earlier writings on the subject of black force black unity black love these are the issues at stake here and only the unity represented and pursued with benevolence and dignity by the federal government without pandering to foreign sentiments can achieve the forward movement of these issues in this crisis i can only hope that this small attempt at clarifying the position will convince you that i am working towards those same ideals that we have spent so long so much of our racial lives crying for the war is nearly ended today i work for the federal government in enugu i am involved in helping to repair the bruised feelings of ibos whose leadership betrayed them into this disaster from my vantage point i can swear by all that is sacred to our cause that the nigerian army works even harder at this than it does at the business of fighting a fraternal war notwithstanding the impression given by secessionist propaganda directed by european publicity experts and which panders to the popular european belief that all black actions are savage actions the area now held by the rebels is infinitesimal the two states in the east which were created out of the minority areas there are completely free of the secessionist army reality and reason demand that in these lights those of us who are africans born outside of africa should now address all our efforts and selves to supporting nigerias cause the unity of blackness and the dignity of man wherever we are whenever we can i have lived in both worlds black and white north and south i lived in bedfordstuyvesant in brooklyn in watts in the detroitinner city and worked as a secretary in a variety of law offices usually temporary jobs which covered a great deal of law as it is practiced now after living in ann arbor for two years and becoming somewhat acquainted with the intellectual elite of michigan i am convinced that the perception gap is a fundamental factor in the racial crisis making it impossible for wellmeaning whites to begin to cope with problems which we all now realize are decisive for our future there are i think two fundamental causes for the perception gap first of all it is difficult for is very foreign to their own experience they tend to project the framework of their own thinking and experience to the life situation of other people and cannot perceive a world which is very different from their own second people tend not to perceive things which are very unpleasant upsetting and undermining to their security to understand to even state the extent and forms of exploitation to which blacks are subjected in this country involves perceiving a very unflattering picture of the state of the nation given this perception gap much of what is said about the racial crisis brilliant as it may be in terms of internal logic even when it is sincere rather than manipulative is alienated from reality and many of the programs funded expensive as they may be solve nothing the unconscious assumption behind these programs is a liberal illusion the liberal assumes that his own wealth and status is due to his virtues rather than to his privileges and from this false assumption flows his solution to the crisis remake blacks so that they become as much like whites as possible like god making man in his own image these efforts produce a thin stream of verbose aggressive efficient automatons who are placed at certain points in the structure where it is convenient to show a black face the cost of buying off militants goes up otherwise nothing changes the problem is whites even scholarsexperts on the race crisiscannot admit to themselves a simple fact which every poor black knowshas to know from daily if not hourly experience blacks are pushed to the wall because the black community is ruthlessly exploited by parasitic elements in the white community through legal semilegal and illegal means and these parasitic elements are bolstered and protected by the institutions of our society generally whatever is corrupt in the united states is multiplied and magnified to the point of grotesqueness in the black community what the french historian francois chevalier calls the law of the strong operates because blacks lack wealth power and influence they are least able to defend themselves the crucial problem is to pinpoint the legal and illegal mechanisms by which the black community is exploited and to destroy them thereby bringing about an essential redistribution of wealth and power in favor of the black community at the expense of the parasitic elements in the white community much can be accomplished through direct community action many changes are beyond the control of the black community and involve changes in local state and federal laws dealing with for example credit insurance taxation appropriations health and welfare crime and punishment as well as changes in the structures of municipal government i will briefly outline several of these parasitic mechanisms and make proposals for their destruction credit a prime target of the detroit riot was the easy credit store especially the furniture store aside from looting and arson notes of indebtedness were searched out and destroyed by the rioters the credit problem is agonizing blacks have great difficulty getting credit when they get it they pay huge interest rates usury laws do not apply to consumer credit stores which offer credit to blacks stock highpriced shoddy goods for which they deny responsibility once the contract is signed aside from consumer credit finance companies pawn shops and illegal loan sharks who collect with the gun charge escalating interest rates if pawned articles are lost or stolen the pawn shop is not legally responsible in a city like detroit where there are a handful of big employers workers live in a state of urban peonage working endless hours in a vain effort to stay on top of a hopeless accumulation of debts collection practices are barbaric collection agencies harass workers at their places of employment threatening their jobs in most states including michigan a workers wage can be seized for debt this practice is called wage garnishment at most places of employment including the auto plants a worker loses his job and is blacklisted if his wages are attached twice i would suggest a fourpronged attack on the credit problem legally restrict interest rates in consumer credit license and inspect the practices of stores doing business in the black community revoking their license for overcharging and denying responsibility for defective goods restrict collection practices outlaw wage garnishment make it illegal for a creditor or collection agency to harass a worker at his place of employment make it illegal to fire a worker for nonpayment of debts make lowinterest or interestfree loans available on the basis of need through government funds credit record or the filing of personal bankruptcy would be irrelevant to obtainina such loans imprisonment for debt when i was working for a law office in detroit a black factory worker came in with summonses to appear at the same time before two different judges on nonsupport charges for two illegitimate children in detroit an illegitimate child costs the father a month minimum and a legitimate child obviously one of the reasons for the high illegitimacy rate this man also had a wife and two children by her his story was six months before he had been working obediently in a factory when he was arrested for failing to pay traffic tickets since he could not pay them he was imprisoned for days he lost his job because he went to jail and had been unemployed for several months he had recently found another job but meanwhile he had fallen behind in his child support payments the lawyer asked him how much money he had he had but he left it with his wife to buy groceries in case he went back to jail the lawyer wouldnt take his case because he had no fee to give him this story illustrates a problem we have debtors prisons in this country full of mostly black men who are unable to pay their way out perhaps it is reasonable to put a man in jail if he is able to support his children and refuses to do so but to present a poor man with the choice money or jail when he has no money is barbaric i propose a sliding scale for traffic tickets so that the amount paid for each offense is in proportion to income fines should be minimal for people with low incomes end all forms of imprisonment for debt make the amount of bail bonds proportionate to incomehousing i would like to tell you about my own experience withhousing in detroit i moved into a furnished apartment which i rented by the week in a slum neighborhood on the east side the outside doors were badly hung from the frames and they would not close the wind blew snow into the apartment the wiring was so bad that if you touched the walls you got a shock waste water backed up into the kitchen sink when i complained to the health department the response was unless it is unsafe or unsanitary we cant do anything about it the landlord made a habit of coming into the apartment while i was working and abusing my son pulling the plug out of the refrigerator and doing other presumptuous things after he pushed my son down the steps one day i went to the police station to complain the police had to ascertain my social standing before they knew how to respond the first thing they asked was what kind of apartment i lived in the address whether it was furnished or unfurnished and if i paid by the week or by the month since it was furnished and i paid by the week that meant i had no rights at all they treated my complaint like a big joke and said its his building he has a right to do whatever he wants in it because i complained about conditions in the building my rent was substantially increased and i was given an eviction notice home ownership in itself is no solution once again the real estate racketeers create an expensive restricted market for blacks to buy homes then they profit again from barbaric practices when it comes to financing the purchase of a home i will cite my experience working in a real estate office in bedfordstuyvesant these brokers were buying very old dilapidated houses for about cash they made no repairs they just smeared cheap paint and laid cheap linoleum down then they arranged a discounted first mortgage from the bank for substantially more than the original purchase price they had already made a good profit then they sold the house with the first mortgage from the bank collected a down payment of to and put a second mortgage which the real estate brokers held of to the purchasers were paying to for the houses payments came to around a month which involved several members of the family slaving for years at lowpaying jobs to meet these payments and the homeowners are then at the mercy of crooked housing inspectors home improvement racketeers etc etc i remember an old lady who made her living scrubbing floors who came in apologetically to make the payment on the second mortgage she was two days late because she had been sick the real estate agent put his arm around her shoulder and patted her saying thats all right granny we knew you would pay my proposals are outlaw real estate agencies and brokers home improvement and construction companies should be carefully licensed legal fees scheduled work inspected for quality and home improvements financed at low interest rates through antipoverty funds criminal penalties for fraud in home improvements should be enacted apartment houses should be transferred from private ownership to cooperative ownership with individual titles to apartments allowing the occupants to deduct interest payments from their federal income tax low interest loans for purchasing homes with no down payment should be made available according to need rather than to credit standing the object is to eliminate private landlords real estate brokers and home improvement racketeers schools there are battles going on now especially in bedfordstuyvesant over community control of the schools let me explain to you once more from my own experience why i strongly favor dismantling the big city bureaucratic control over the school system and placing control in the hands of the community my son went to the fourth grade at a public school in detroit that was quite a school the children were not allowed to play on the playground since it was used as a parking lot for the teachers cars the patrol boys and girls were required to report their friends for playing on the playground one of the teachers was shaking down the kids for money he was furnished with indigent supplies for kids who couldnt afford them which the children had to buy from him for a day or they got a grade of zero the principal would not allow the children to bring their own supplies to class because she thought it was not neat for children to walk down the hallways carrying school supplies thus the teacher shook down the kids the big kids shook down the little kids the little kids shoplifted to get money etc etc the teachers maintained order by hitting the kids with a wooden paddle my son does not believe that his teachers have a right to hit him and when he was threatened with a beating he stayed home i got a call from the truant officer told him the whole story about the school and he got very agitated and said things like oh so you dont like the detroit public schools and ive worked in this neighborhood for years and no one has ever complained to me about the school and menacingly those are very serious charges even coming from children and if i were you i would complain to the school board i explained that i already had also that was moving out of the neighborhood because of the impossible conditions in the school he insisted that i tell him where was moving to and what school my son would be going to i declined to furnish that information the response of the principal was no child has ever been mistreated in this school they are all perfect nothing is ever wrong and if you complain you might get locked up or have your kid locked up after the july insurrection we drove past the school hoping it had burned down the teachers cars were still parked on the playground the signs saying no ball playing allowed were still up the only change was the fence was about ten feet higher to keep the kids in during class time and to stop them from destroying the school after school hours in his third book of poems dont cry scream brother don vs d lee urges us to know nothing less than the real enemy the real enemy one way to really appreciate what a lifesaver this kind of knowledge can be is simply to ask the question what could serve us as a blacker test for recognizing our real leaders our real sources of information insightselfassessment and direction we as black people cannot pay enough real tribute enough real attention to our real black leaders for the seriousness with which we check them out as well as preserve and keep them on our course is a clear measure of the seriousness with which we take ourselves and our efforts as a people to get out of this white prison were in the story of the games the real enemy runs on us to separate us from our own strength is not a very bad way to check out our real history in this place and furthermore nothing reflects the story of the need for solidarity more vividly than the story of black writers black literary history is loud and endless with scenes of brothers and sisters stripping each other of their arms while at war with the real enemy i saw this suicidal conflict in a very dramatic and instructive context just this past semester among black students in my english composition and literature classes at the university of wisconsinmilwaukee the two black warriors who got stripped were marvin x and jimmie garrett their plays take care of business and and we own the night the vitally black liberation lessons to be learned from them both were lost in the fury of a loud and false dispute which of the two plays was revolutionary that both were and continue to be was an answer that was quickly lost on most lord the warriors argued each other down and really went into an act ripping and slashing and nearly trampling all over the varying substance for black salvation which they should have been gathering and cherishing and recultivating towards their own black growth and their own black awareness what was lost is the simple fact that both writers are revolutionary because they are deadly serious about black unity both were looking at some of the major things that work against the efforts to keep black families together the chief conflicts concerning father and son and mother and son marvin x looks at the disastrous consequences of such a split while garrett examines one of the primary causes a white set of values joe simmons and his father never talked to one another about anythingnot even sports by the end of the play he is determined never to make that fatal mistake with his own children in garretts play johnny had to fight his mothers worship of whites at home as well as the real enemys police forces in the streets where he dies with the pale knowledge that his own mother was incapable of looking upon him her own sonor any other black manas a man now these black playwrights and their plays constitute a sort of revolutionary teamwork a very crucial and singular division of labor and what confused many of my students about the revolutionary nature of both plays was their preference for one form of revolution physical combat over another and less spectacular form they mistook the least visible for the least real but while its true that johnny and lil t and the rest of the brothers pitted body against body arm against arm concrete weapon against the government weapons of the cops they were just as concerned just as determined to pit their consciousness against the white consciousness of people like johnnys mother the acquiring of a black sense of purpose is the real rebel featured in marvin xs work though the primary business which joe simmons takes care of is the achievement of a new sense of duty as a black son and potential father he and his running buddy wes also take on the cops who nearly ran them down and over after a party we witness two different kinds of resistance at work both of which are seen as necessary to our black survival brother marvin isnt offering us both only to have us choose one the bargain is simply three black lessons for the price of two he isnt saying choose but see check out the connection between the arm that resists and the consciousness that resists black liberation depends finally on black commitment which in turn depends on black consciousness on black understanding understanding depends on knowledge or information which in turn depends on communication especially communication of the information that can only be transmitted from the old to the young remember joes problem he didnt dig his old man enough to speak to him there are times when i cant speak a positive word for eldridge cleaver especially whenever i recall the game i caught him running on readers which means us in an uncommonly vicious assault on james baldwin you need only open soul on ice to see what i mean there are a number of other places in that remarkable book where the real enemy rules supreme by using brother cleaver as a tool for cutting down the informationpacked lifeline connecting us to the thirties and forties of richard wright and chester himes and langston hughes the forties and fifties and early sixties of gwendolyn brooks and baldwin and malcolm_x instead were hooked up with some fantasy place were hooked up to dim twisted confuseblackpeople words featured in such pieces as the primary mitosis and convalescence and to some extent the white race and its heroes these are for the most part tributes to dream to wishful or incoherent thinking in a book that is otherwise notable as much for the downtoearth clarity of cleavers views as for his stunning language even though on first reading cleaver struck me in the main as the most incredible stylist since baldwin and jones the fact that his ideas were also an extension and elaboration of theirs was not altogether lost on me for instance much of the burden of soul on ice is given over to the conviction that american society is run by intricate lie machines on every level of public life intricate lie machines that produce deliberate confusion among the people here we have at least the sound black forehead of a sound black leader coming into view of course the suggestion that there are talents that precede cleavers talents that elaborate positions cleaver himself is able to stand and build on would be pretty hard to find in a piece like his notes on a native son his description of himself as one of a generation of baldwin readers like myself is truly an absolutely hypnotic tribute to baldwin his picture of him as a wright reader as a person who actually knew wright personally in the late forties when he was going through his own early paces as a writer is another affair this connection between the two so alive with lessons for anyone concerned with the inevitable writergeneration gap is in cleavers hands simply unrecognizablewhen it is present he doesnt depict these two writers as significant steps in a common thrust but as two detachable halves of the moon we are to use only one half of their combined light here take the wright side just throw baldwin and his perfumed prose over the shaky bridge into the watery darkness where rufus floats right where he done got drowneded and in another country at that but we want both brother cause both belong to us every bit as much as you cleaver do and allah would never forgive us for accepting such a selfcrippling selfblinding bargaineven from a brother don l lee had told me about cleavers article on baldwin long before i ever heard of the brother probably before i even heard of ramparts i had checked out calvin herntons double job on baldwin though in his white papers for white americans so by the time soul on ice came out i was ready to go into my act the result was a piece called incest for brothers this defense of baldwin though deadly earnest was no starched sheetpulling exercise it was a whole lot of writers fun it was one of the most liberating experiences ive ever gone through as a writer it was a real breakthrough for in order to bring my rescue plot off i had to break away from things i admired most about the baldwin essay for my purposes the finely graded sense and elaboration of the baldwin sentence just wouldnt do only cleavers own surrealistic sweeps would work so i took cleavers name calling attack as my rescue model as i tried to indicate before the stunning defiant verbal acrobatics of the cleaver style were not lost on a styleconscious dude like myself baldwins best qualities are based in large part on controlled utterance on the precise and exact elaboration of an idea or sentiment while the panther brothers sweep comes in part from the flair and very earthy resources of a brother jumping bad i also anticipated the incorrectness of the current dictum among the panthers which holds that fire cant be fought with fire that you have to use water to put it out no good i understood part of my mission using just the opposite principle baldwins mode of clarity would not work would not penetrate the lively but hysterical nonsense that paraded through cleaver and hemtons makebelieve but deadly play at critical analysis the only precise way to handle those shapeless semifreudian puddings was to resort to a farce of my own what does a baldwinite know about farce i knew what mrs rothenberg my cool advanced expository writing teacher taught me only a few months before reading cleaver she introduced be to mr jonathan swift and what did she hip me to about that irish cat why the use of what white english departments call a persona jesse b simple is a black persona a bar i stool philosopher a real character invented by brother langston hughes as a fabulous mouthpiece who were the makebelieve characters i invented to reply to cleaver and hemton why brothers eldridge and calvin along with uncle richard and father baldwin though i was offended by the namecalling tactics of the two brothers that wasnt the point of my dispute with them what truly angered me was this if youre going to write about another brother especially writers like wright and baldwin why not do so in a way that makes theour lifeline between them and us more clear not more pale more visible not deliberately hidden and more secure not shaky we are a desperate people and when you disguise the nearest exit the clearest way out youre not only being frivolous youre being a real black criminal black leaders not only need to be recognized by black people and celebrated they also need to be taken seriously once theyre spotted they need for their own collective welfare to be looked at and listened to ruthlessly close we cant afford anymore never could white divide and conquer bargains if cleaver cant help us toward the most rigorous selfexamination and selfcriticism when he opens his mouth to us as a writer then we have every right to view his mouth as a weapon turned against his own people now since baldwin is quite a veteran of disaster a man like cleaver himself and huey newton who has known very precious few survivors in this place the presumption never entered my mind that i was defending baldwin he can look after himself well enough a little panther namecalling or a lot shouldnt shake him too much harm it is we the people who have been turned upon and messed with who dont need our vision tampered with but expanded and deepened enlarged in the same way as is the case when reading cleavers lazarus come forth or on becoming or the christ and his teachings we are a desperate people looking for a way out of this prisonplace and nobody knows this better than brother cleaver himself we need our black artists to help us see ourselves see where we are where weve been where were headed baldwin no less than cleaver can show us this we need both and then some we need to see baldwins real weaknesses in order to see our own just as we need desperately to dig his real strengths and our own its a white game to discuss a black artist with the purpose of disguising and discrediting what hes really saying and we expect white lie machines like the whole white mass miscommunications networks including white publications to misuse and mangle the clear black voices that are saying things the black minds that are organizing things for our mutual benefit but can we afford to take the works of our own less than seriously look at them without raising real questions and real issues can we afford the game of pitting our joe simmons against our johnnys who would deny that we need to dig the issues and dilemmas the marvin xs and jimmie garretts create for them and us so that we can check out how theyre dealt with or not dealt with since the plight upon a black stage is simply our own beyond racism by whitney m young jr mcgrawhill book company is a curious book for two reasons first a heavy despairing hand wrote it it unfolds all of the brutalizing horrors of the black ghetto in cold sparse prose that seems to float somewhere between frigid clinical accounts and terse newspaper reporting mr young documents the hell of the young black child presents convincing data and details on the miseducation of black youth and simply lays before the reader the black mans political emasculation and economic exploitation these are harsh words how much more bitter are the lives that these words describe yet the black mans story is being told every day in every medium and in every kind of voice ranging from violent hysterical bellowstorn from the bowelsto the cold statement of fact and appeal to reason mr young chose the latter to make his point perhaps that is what is frightening about his book hp seems to be delivering the benediction in a way the final act is really over no it hasnt been lived but we all know it by heart and when we hear whitney young saying unless we can devise ways to admit black people to full participation in the social political and economic life of the larger society the bitterness and despair of the impoverished black masses will bring about the destruction of the cities we know down deep we fear when we close our eyes we see our cities settling into waste lands but black folks are indeed a strong people they are a people that survived years of criminal oppression we arise daring to hope the second curious aspect of this book is that it has a profound yet subtle and contagious hope in its lean lines ive never been so aware of both emotions in reading a book he quotes frederick douglass and raises pride and hope for in douglass we see the black mans complicity in his own hell and his salvation if there is no struggle there is no progress those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground they want rain without thunder and lightning find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both item by item area by area whitney covers them all from education to employment from police brutality to discrimination in housing and with the innocence of the youth of today he proposes he tells america what it can do to right its wrongs many of the proposals i have discussed arc practical ones which could be implemented tomorrow if america really wanted to use its resources in a rational manner to create an open society these are embarrassingly naive words they are uttered in simple honesty and seemingly with a simple faith whitney young sweeps me along with his quaint openness i say yes it really could if it wanted to yes if america wanted to and here lies the rub the jaded soul suspects the worst the despair and hope that spring from beyond racism reveals a great deal about mr young and perhaps a little about the black spirit the justified castigation and utter condemnation of america by blacks are matched with a deep faith by them that the american society can become an open one extending to all the economic educational and social opportunities now set beyond the prospects of most blacks if a revolutionary lacks this faith then he is confronted with alternatives that should lead him to a foreign land since there is little chance for a real revolution of flesh blood and steel here without a doubt the most militant revolutionaries will adamantly deny this faith but find themselves hard pressed to explain what all of their violent words are about and minor defensive actions forecast if not a faith that by some shout words and shock america can find its way to make good at long last on a promise it made to oppressed peoples this blend of despair and hope are what make mr youngs book a curious offering perhaps the black mans faith in america may be the faith by which america saves herself in addition to faith the author has a straightforward message he wants america to develop an open society a vision of an america that glories in diversity and respects the unique contributions and traditions of all of its people the open society will unite whites and blacks in true equality banish poverty rebuild the cities in greatness and he has practical suggestions for accomplishing these goals community control is suggested as one step toward rebuilding black communities the argument is persuasive certainly the evidence seems quite clear that black people are less tolerant with extremists than whites community control is nothing new most white suburban communities control and direct their local school systems and it is considered a good thing the argument that community control will perpetuate segregation is brushed aside for the ghetto has never known integration in the first place besides it is deeply dishonest to criticize community control solely because blacks want to accept a white decision not to integrate and extract from it the power and benefits that come from controlling ones schools economics and politics but again all of this logic tells just one thing the issue has never been community control the issue is racism mr young wants the highest level of government involved in the effort to habilitate america he suggests the appointment of an executive vice president for domestic development concerned with the poor and the plight of the cities it would be the responsibility of the executive vicepresident to coordinate a national effort to rid the land of poverty and to rebuild our dead cities hopefully the working poor the aged and the unemployed poor would be provided with economic security local state employment services would be transformed into national computer she kept on rereading the letter stop runp ning even nonthink ing

outside had dared them to leave as warmly dressed as they were and the snow had won the battle because hadnt they decided to stay until it had subsided and then they could freeze their way home in the slosh without having to cope with the sleet he had sipped drink after drink and she had not seemed to drink much of anythingnot even water they would talk for a while then he would go over to the window and look at the snow then get back to his drink and shake his head a little as if he were in deep thought it was after one of those trips from the window that he had said but the tide wont subside you cant sidestep so rage and blaze they burnt the mask and left the hue blue after the red blaze so with the mask gone we dance and laugh less and less and the world is blue but you cant stay blue though nor sing the blues any more she had wondered if he were slightly insane this young man talking like some kind of mystic as he talked more and more seemingly more to himself than to her or the other woman she had felt uneasy particularly if he looked at her but then again she had thought whatever he looked at he didnt seem to see he seemed to be looking way beyond it he had gone to the window again then came back and said it has subsided now ill see you home if you dont mind he had paused for a while then addressed his drink as usual young lady your little bottoms up before we leave the two women had tried in vain to suppress their almost embarrassed smiles it was cold and sloshy outside when he hailed a taxi she had wondered if she was doing the wisest thing by letting him see her home she wanted to be with him because she was intrigued by the way he talked but she was at the same time afraid to be with him because she thought he might be insane and if he were there was no telling what he might do for no reason she was conscious of she believed there was warmness and a kindness about him while this was going on in her mind a taxi stopped for them and when he opened the door of the car she just went in as though she were doing something she had no control over very much like ones actions or behavior in a dream he went in after her and started talking you know the best thing youve got going for you is that you have not lost your mask but it is walled in now she believed more and more that he was more than likely insane what is this mask thing you keep talking about thats what im talking about you dont know it because you have been taught not to but why do you think you do some of the things you do for instance here you are you do not really know if you should let me see you home or not you are afraid of me and you are not afraid of me your better judgment tells you not to do it but in spite of that for whatever reason you have let me see you home how do you i mean unh it is written all over your face again she wondered she was quiet for a while she wondered if he had some power some kind of extraordinary sense of perception which enabled him to see things going on in her mind without her saying them where are you from she asked him and she wondered why she had asked the question sun valley he said sun valley seemingly more as a reflection than as an answer to her question a long time ago your tribe did too thats where your mask comes from the sun still shines over the valley but most of the masks are obsolete or veiled and chaos and confusion abound in and around the people the taxi stopped at her address she realized at this point that she wished the ride had been longer if he was insane in some kind of way she thought there was some sort of method or order to it he scribbled his telephone number and gave it to her thats in case you want to call me some day the taxi took off to take him home he has some nerve she had thought what made him think she would want to call him but she didnt throw away his number the following day it snowed some more then it stopped and the temperature plummeted to below zero a wind arose and raged and howled in the streets and the citizenry for the next few days like an army losing morale retreated more and more indoors in the daytime the sun went on its way across the city like a teasing woman indiscriminately exposing herself but not yielding to anyone and balese kept thinking about reaitse particularly when she looked at the sun that gave off no heat was he somewhere looking out some window what would he be saying about the sun in that weird way he talked she wanted to hear him talk she called him i hope he doesnt think l would be interested in dating him or any nonsense like that she thought as she dialed his number hello unh reaitse this is balese we met at yea i know im glad you called i was just thinking about you and o damn she thought he does have some silly notions after all he must think hes got a good line talking all that weird abstract nonsense o unh you know i was calling to thank you for taking me home the other night yea yea i know that but like i was saying i was just thinking about you and the imprisonment of the mask in the name of some silly god who doesnt even have respect for life you are a funny man sometimes but the world is even funnier he went on talking he told her how in sun valley centuries ago the people had used masks to study human nature the mask was never a reproduction of the human face in the mask the face was transfigured to enable men to delve deeper into inner man in their language also the people never spoke directly about a thing they spoke around it so that it stood out more clearly then some day another tribe had come in from the sea at first the sun valleyians had thought these people might be some gods or ghosts and they had given them food and presents to make them feel at home as it was customary to treat peaceful strangers or to make peace with them should they be some angry gods or ghosts systematically the strangers from the sea had destroyed the ways of the people of the valley they had imposed their gods and their traditions on the people of sun valley they had cut up the land as they pleased deposed the kings of the valley and held the sun valleyians in bondage and now we laugh less and less he said finally and you do not even have memories of tales told by the fireside then she had known he was not insane but why the hell couldnt he talk straight about things talking like hes telling some fairy tale to some little child like that the conversation had gone on much longer than she had imagined it would she was somewhat puzzled and happy when she found him conversant with whatever she brought up for conversation they planned to get together in a few days and they did for the next few weeks they saw each other often mutual attraction developed between them or they grew into it they loved each otherthey felt and believed crazy woman hed think about her some day we might even get married months later they moved in together planning to get married they enjoyed each others company and had no significant disagreeable arguments that is until the day he told her they were almost complete strangers because she was perhaps unwilling to demolish the walls in which she was imprisoned are you high she had giggled thinking he was not serious no im low mama and the world is a blue mess im not your mother yea your biggest problem is that you are not anythings mother you do not even mother your ideas or mode of living whats that got to do with us being strangers the walls around you and the shadows prevent you from seeing anything as it really is including you you are not even in love with me you are in love with what you think i ama necessary distortion because you see me through the eyes of some woman you dont even know nor understand through the eyes of everything that denies the validity of your very existence you must be out of your mind she tried to control the flow of anger churning in her the problem with you is that you are so afraid you always settle for the most convenient answer and if there is no convenient answer you run like i said before you must be out of your stupid mind you see thats what i mean you even use anger as a means to run away but look acceptance thats where it has to start no not anger acceptance you have to realize and accept that most of the things you learned before we met the complex set of symbols you use to perceive the worldwere an attempt to bury you if you could look at it without pitying yourself and accept it then vomit the crap wed be getting into something thats what i mean when i tell you to break down those silly walls and unveil your mask because that other mask you wear every morning is a lie you smear all that junk on you to hide the real you its not the smear thats in question its the implications of the thing and when i point that out you rage or call me insane and she raged too this time more than she had ever raged before she raged so much that she left and rented a room at the ywca sleep teased her but would not come to her bed that night not only was she still exasperated she had not slept in any bed without reaitse in quite a while for the first time in her life she could hear the eerie stillness of the night when the city was asleep finally as the sun approached the eastern horizon pushing the dawn before her balese fell asleep regret accompanied reaitse that night and anguish sneered at his mind accompanied by drops of despair threatening to engulf and occupy his heart but no tears son dont cry he mused worlds full of stale tears and pain and those havent solved a single problem yet no balese i am not at wor with you all im saying is when you mistake artificial light for sunshine you are in danger woman and woeeternal unity of opposites you do not try to shut your eyes to the existence of things balese whatever things unless you want to dig your own grave i know your heart wants to strive but the walls but how expect me to watch you sinking low even in goldplated mud and just let you go when things dont jive together when you cant dance and even the air sticks a poisoned finger at your song it is time to create new wombs for a rebirth and come bursting out on the other side of time dancing laughter out the wilderness he couldnt fall asleep at the break of day he went to the beach he had always loved to watch the unrestrained movement of the waves as they leapt to caress the rocks this time he could not bear it they made him miss balese even more he went back home as the city was beginning to bustle deaf to the noise of man and machine balese woke up too late to go work but she really didnt care she hadnt planned to go anyway she called at work to report she wasnt feeling well after a quick shower she went out for a cup of coffee she was no longer angry at reaitse she thought about how happy they were together most of the time and when they were happy he was oceans of fun she smiled to herself remembering a conversation some day they had been discussing their immediatefuture plans when hed said some day ill take off to the sun with my son he loves to play with the sun how come he believes hes a god like the sun what are you not telling me do you have a son or something every day gives birth to him i see him in your eyes too youre a funny man sometimes she went back to the ywca and called reaitse hello lostandfound he teased her the words pulsed with a monumental love and she knew it he didnt wait for her to ask any questions baby let me try to explain a few things we live in a filthy world when that comes up to the surface and you see it it shakes up your inner stability because you dont want to accept that it is really that filthy im not coming back then i think you should wait and check things out thoroughly before you take a plunge like that you might regret it you might not be very happy why would i not be happy after taking the plunge why is die plunge not happiness when the filth of the world is not immediate you are happy happiness meaning what relative amount of enjoyment of life or existence out of becoming aware of things in the world you mean more than that what kind of happiness then well lets see explained by the absence of other things at midnight dying to get home instead of some hotel by yourself giggling and fooling around like a baby thinking of things that are not frustrating what ever do i think of that is not frustrating a number of things as simple as for instance looking forward to a vacation but is that happiness only because you are there its not always things but ideas your ideas concerning certain people even me you how my presence physically or in your mind how physical sexual no just being at the same place at the same time doing what doing nothing isnt that sexual if you want to limit it to that but i thought it was much more than that ill be right home she felt so much stronger than she could remember ever having felt before she didnt know why or how but this conversation had left her feeling strong enough to do anything she desired to do and right now her number one desire was to be with reaitse she had left the ywca and gone home to reaitse never again to leave because of a disagreement they were married a few months later and they could say they were happy and they would not be telling a lie occasional disagreements were there but then whose household is without those now there she stood looking at the letter reading and rereading it as though it were all in a dream perhaps it was hadnt it been that very morning that they had been so happy just before she left for work she had asked him reaitse can you be anything you want to be no baby you can be only what you really are if your life is an attempt to be reasonably happy and at peace with other men and nature why because you live under the sun you are a funny man she said getting ready to leave you know you had a funny dream last night he said what

the wrong black man from rumor and inaccurate newspaper reporting from the oppressive claustrophobic heat of a florida midsummer and from the irresistible orgiastic wave of rage and destruction that

had set foot on algerian soil it had been a brief visit a stopover on a voyage south to the new republic of guinea in algeria was an armed camp with the french colonial masters firmly in control soldiers and gendarmes were everywhere arms at the ready and many of the public buildings were protected from guerilla assault by layers of barbed wire i had entered the city from the liner foch with two young africans one from abidjan the other from brazzaville and we had moved about with relative freedom until we reached the famed casbah the incredible labyrithine quarter made famous over the world by hollywoods film algiers starring charles boyer and hedy lamarr the armed guard at the entrance to the casbah politely but firmly turned the three black visitors away offering no explanation beyond the simple statement that entrance was forbidden the africans having no urge to defy the guard suggested that we move on which we did ending our tour at one of the many sidewalk cafes which dot the citys main arteries however when the young africans returned to the foch i set out again to find access to the casbah and finally succeeded by simply walking past a french guard as if he had no right to challenge me inside the quarter i found it impossible to dispel the aura of mystery and the vague suggestion of danger this was after all simply a community of peoples with customs and a lifestyle different from my own and it was merely insulting of me to adopt toward it the attitude of disrespectful westerners capitalizing on the difference to give an impression of evil in paris an algerian friend had given me the name of a young freedom fighter in the casbah and set out to locate him the search led to a little a rab kiosk deep in the middle of the casbah where a group of hardbitten men finally encircled me then hassan the young man whose name had stepped forward i was on trial who was i where did i get his name what did i want how did i get past the guards into the cash ahthough frightened had only admiration for the cold nononsense manner in which the arabs confronted me i explained simply and honestly how came to have hassans name and how i managed to enter the casbah and they believed me the tension was relaxed they laughed they invited me to the home of one of the men where we drank coffee and talked of african liberation afterwards they walked with me down a twisting street to the entrance above the great plaza we said goodby as i strolled out a guard stopped me he asked for my papers and i showed him my american passport what was i doing in the casbah he asked didnt know that it was closed to tourists and that it was dangerous but msieur said to him mustering my best french i am a black man the algerians have no need to harm me we are fighting the same war woodie king jr has told me that ed bullins is leaving for algiers tomorrow we sit eating sweets and drinking coffee talking of black quartet the four plays woodie is producing across the street at the little gate theater i am pessimistic he is optimistic the previews open a few days away the run begins july he feels the plays still will be running in september doug turner ward comes in his play reckoning opens in september at the negro ensemble company theater i think four years ago at the new school for social research richard gilman said black playwrights were incapable of producing mature drama ward was there silent the headline in the arts and leisure section of todays new york times proclaims from the black experience a new kind of theater and the roads now lead to algiers there is a connection between the sudden explosion of black drama on the stages of america and the staging of a panafrican cultural festival in algiers what richard gilman was saying of course is that black playwrights are unimportant because they do not speak to white america in the terms the cadences and with the substance white america demands of them the proponents of black drama say simply that they speak on their own terms in their own cadences and with the substance of their own lives and experiences and to hell with the richard gilmans of this world and in algiers the black world mounts a resounding support to the black dramatists with real power behind them black writers will be free only then a moment ago in the savarin cafe the incredible fact confirmed the americans have landed on the moon the americans have landed on the moon it is not merely that i cannot get with this adventure that i do in effect resist it it is also at bottom that i wish it were not an american feat they are planting the american flag on the moon claiming the moon disclaimers of possession to the contrary notwithstanding perhaps in simple truth there is no people anywhere any better qualified technologically or emotionally suited for preeminence in the exploration of the cosmos but i have grave fears for all the worlds if this means they will be at the mercy of the american mentality how can the third world winby playing the power game or by setting the two monster nations against each other the air france airliner finally lifts off the ground minutes late for which the captain apologized over the pa system in three langauges time it is in keeping here we go into the fog out over the atlantic gaining or losing time i am never sure which in the six hoursplus journey to paris already one of the stewardesses has come to ask me if i am not someone she remembers from a previous flight quite recent i smile and say no it is possible of course that she was on the flight from amsterdam to paris last may but i think not i dont even remember if i flew air france in in and yes but she would hardly remember that far back it does not matter i am always being mistaken for someone else i dont understand it perhaps it has something to do with time and place perhaps i am someone elsesitting aboard the caravelle waiting for the plane to take off for algiers the french ground crew is still fussing with the plane in the bus riding from the terminal to the plane i watched the faces and the attitudes of the french and algerian passengers the french are still the rulers haughty remote the algerians remain the ruled the mark of oppression is there the docility the herdinstinct the absence of confidence the deference and all the algerians are in shirt jacket tie the key figure the wispy little frenchman wearing kid gloves in midjuly looking down his nose at the algerians the quintescent colonialist an insignificant man elevated to importance by the fact of his europeanness among the barbarians and i think it is always so the colonist rules with the complicity of the colonized why should these algerians tolerate a creature like the frenchman an academic question in dakar the black intellectuals play at being french you should come and live here your pace is too swift in america you could have a villa servants and the squalor of the medina the algerians are wearing french clothes there are none of them in boubous or jellabas how do they feel about their traditional dress they are probably very much like the african evoluesexcept that even the most europeanized black africans occasionally will wear boubous dashikis and agbabas and black americansthose who want most to be american are terribly threatened by dashikis they accepted the nehru suits and jackets and some of them even wore the mao shirts but dashikis thrust upon them images they cannot yet accept how they welcomed the tom mboya article chiding black americans for seeking to identify with africans by affecting those symbols of african povertysandals and dashikis the white press of course gave wide coverage to what was intended as a slap in the face to the black nationalists but as usual neither the white press nor its sycophants the black integrationists have much understanding of the black consciousness movement the spiritual identification with africa and the third world has little directly to do with literal emulation of african clothing and customs it has more to do with a rejection of things western spirit in the east but the fact that mboya seemed not to know the difference tells a great deal about mboya and his apparent suggestion that africans want to and shouldadopt european style clothing seems almost naive nothing seems sillier than africans racing around in all that heat wearing shirts ties and suits to say nothing of shoes and stockings why shouldnt they wear boubous sandals and dashikiswhich are perfectly suited for the climate why should affluence and sophistication be equated with the wearing of the impractical clothes of europe watching the thousands of algerian young men thronging the streets they are everywhere in noisy groups sitting on curbs standing at bars and bus stops simply roaming aboutone is impressed with several facts first of the utter waste of potential manpower and political power harnessed the energy of all these youths could transform algeria into an important country and possibly a wealthy one also one is aware of the absurdityno the monstrousnessof such a handsome and vigorous people being ruled all these decades by the french and beyond that of course one considers the absurdity of the white races long hegemony over the other races of mankind and finally in the streets of algiers one understands the outrageousness of little israels successful defiance of the entire arab world one acknowledges of course israels great debt to america for her success the problem of all the worlds underdeveloped people is highlighted here properly politicized indoctrinated in an ideology which would mobilize both their sense of racial pride and their sense of destiny the young men of algeria could literally overrun israel trample it to death the afroamerican center is for all practical purposes intent merely a showcase for the black_panther and for all party eldridge cleaver handled himself very well indeed at the press conference today kathleen cleaver very pregnant looked lovely she was subdued wifely stokely carmichael was in the garden of the hotel st george talking with charlie cobb and the washington d c delegation when we junius griffin and i returned stokely has behaved with maturity refusing to allow the press and provocateurs to draw him into a nonperformedproductive feud with cleavers forces cleaver also has commendably although the two men have some fundamental disagreements they seem to understand that no real purpose can be served in airing these differences before the world and mostly antagonistic press the world still belongs to the white man though decreasingly so they move about with assurance and control which the formerly colonized peoples have not yet mastered in their bones and which consequently they emulate rather clumsily but emulation is the key what they need is their own style their own approach what is most important about the presence here of eldridge cleaver and stokely carmichael lies in the movement toward unity of all african peoples the political implications of their reception on this continent are profound two of the revolutionary leaders of the american blacks exiled for their beliefs and activities have found refuge in africa defiance of the great economic and military power of america raymonde and jean briere and his wife on monday that makes a total of five familiar faces from dakar in the lobby this morning the pretty little black american girl from milwaukee valerie stopped to chat she is it turns out making it on her own working with the horace jenkins filming crew and accepting the patronage of an american lady she lives she says in paris and came down to algiers on a fourthclass boat there is another pretty little black girl down from paris she was imported for the cast of hair took a few days off three of the young people manning the black_panther party exhibit indicated that they now use paris as headquarters a healthy trend young blacks increasingly prowling the world traveling not only will broaden them it will make it all the more improbable that returning home they will adapt to the role america has designated for them the group from washington has a certain quiet endearing style balanced without illusions but not without humor charlie cobb reports that the bookshop is finally in the black jean wheeler smith who has been working on a novel indicates that she is wrestling with the project im not sure i know what a novel is jimmie garrett looks more like everybodys goodnatured kid brother than a playwright and there is vinie burrows a startlingly beautiful woman with her nineyearold son and fouryearold daughter in tow why isnt she better known why dont black americans pay homage to their own she has been invited to eastern europe but she has not been seen in chicago i have been told by mme briere that her husband jean the haitian poet is busy writing a poem to be dedicated to president hourari bournediene and i do not wish to disturb him and yet i feel it important that he know of the presence of two members of the new generation of black american writers and that they know who he is and so i introduce him to ed bullins and don l lee thinking of jean and of amadou mahtar mbow who also is on the terrace with his wife raymonde and their son it occurs to me that the black world is a far more complex and integrated one than we sometimes realize jean for example is in exile from haiti living in senegal where he is a key member of the cultural arm of the government and his wife is americanborn senegal haiti and america are linked in them with the mbows another country franceis brought directly into the linkage raymonde is haitian i met her in when she and mahtar visited her sister mme raoul beauvoir who lived in my building in chicago she was educated in paris where her father still lives and where her son is in school mahtar comes from an old and respected senegalese family once based in ancient st louis at the northern tip of the country when i first went down to senegal for a stay of several months in december mahtar and raymonde were teachers in the equivalent of a special american high school there was considerable feeling among black educators in the country that mahtar should have been president of the university of dakar but that institution wasand iscontrolled by europeans leopold senghor was aware of the popular sentiment favoring mahtar apparently for he later elevated him to minister of education i do not know what combination of forces or events prompted president senghor to switch mahtar from education to culture perhaps the continuing unrest in the university which is pressuring for africanization of the university but mahtar is in algiers as minister of culture and of course as leader of the senegalese delegation to the symposium a personable and intelligent man with no illusions at all as to what africa must have and of what will be necessary to get it jean briere informs me that mercer cooks wife vashti who i first met in dakar when mercer was ambassador died several months ago in washington not only that but he says that mercer is with his son in chicago i come all the way from chicago to africa to discover that is language the only barrier to closer ties between the afroamericans and the algerians watching stokely carmichael moving about the terrace and the gardens of the hotel chatting with old friends and with representatives of african governments i think that perhaps at long last the era is ended wherein the boldest and most imaginative of our young black men are predoomed to an early death or to eternal crippling by imprisonment all perceptive black americans know that american prisons are filled to overflowing with some of the finest minds and the most aggressive spirits from the black community but their very ingenuity and vitality of course insured their defeat in a racist and repressive system like americas such men are indeed great threatsnot to the precious american law and order of course but to american duplicity and conspiracy against equal opportunity and justice the list of villains who are in fact black heroes is long el hajj malik el shabazz marcus garvey angelo herndon paul robeson eldridge cleaver leroi jones in the past strong black men who defied the system had no place to go once the forces of repression cornered them and those forces tragically include those moderate negro leaders who always can be trotted out as examples to the black community of what an acceptable negro ought to be but now the black worldand increasingly portions of the third worldis the new refuge the game stokely has elected to play is no less dangerous in africa than it was in mississippi but then stokely knows that very well he has walked openeyed into his new adventure the stakes are very large indeed and all the world knows that the cia plays for keeps those who respect stokely will be pleased to know that he wears a new maturity and wears it well he lives now in a remote villa in the mountains in the interior of guinea where the climate is mild and he works closely with deposed kwame nkrumah in the former rulers campaign to reclaim his position of leadership in the country he led to independence when will stokely return to americawhen i have accomplished something worthwhile is his answer the days of innocence when thousands of bright black youths put their faith in sncc seem eons away not a mere three or four yearsthe site of the festival symposium on african culture its reality its role in the liberation struggle in the consolidation of african unity and the economic and social development of africa is this sprawling sumptuous complex on the sea kilometers from algiers the conferfence center is an integrated unit with one of the pleasantest auditoriums i have ever seen fully equipped for simultaneous translation of speeches into three langauges french english and arabic it sits on a hill above the splendid white beach and a score of huge villas stretch out beyond the complex was built for a major united nations conference two years ago there are shops several restaurants a security center a press center several luxurious lounges a postoffice the speeches are boring perhaps the collected papers will make a book of some interest but there is no fire no inspiration they are all diplomats the spokesmens countries are all dependent upon the colonialist powers for crucial aid and so they are wary careful very intellectual and general in their attacks and condemnations the real talk the meaningful dialogue is being held where it is being held at allin the hotel rooms over dinner at the hotel allite and the st george in the two or three posh restaurants around the city the exception to the general blandness of the speeches was understandably the address by the representative of the democratic republic of vietnam vice minister of culture haxuantruong he dealt even the speech of alex la guma the exiled writer from south africa seemed pale and full of cliches and yet it was a real speech dealing with the oppression of the nonwhite peoples of his homeland what will all the talk availfor that matter what will all the dancing on the stages and in the streets availwhat africans need are guns and the will to use them is it true as president boumediene said in his opening address that culture is a weapon in our struggle for liberationwell of course i think it is true the people will not demand guns and they will see no need to use them until they understand who they are what their possibilities are and the forces which stand in the way of their realizing their potentialities i do not regret not having seen all the theatrical presentations and the dance troupes most of them i saw three years ago during the first world festival of negro arts at dakar they are delightful but they become monotonous after awhile when reginald wilson of detroit and i went up to the museum of fine arts to see the special exhibition of african art we ran headlong into african bureaucracy and pageantry we could not see the show until after the dignitaries had arrived and been escorted through although we arrived at the appointed time however the exhibition at dakar would be extremely difficult to match the arts and crafts exhibits in the university center in town were generally absorbing the stuff shown would sell well in shops in america i went again alone into the casbah which no longer seems even mysterious the people no longer feel shut off from their own city it belongs to them i bought five dinars worth of candy and tried to distribute it to the children but so many of them descended upon me with such fervor that i realized that it was a mistake a friendly arab rescued me and to show his thanks for my kindness to the children insisted that i be his guest for drinks at a cafe at the base of the casbah ted joans was a discovery i have known of the mans work for a number of years but meeting him was a joy marvin x has written of don l lee that don is a poem ted is a poem a warm unaffectedbut tremendously affectingman as free as a man is likely to be it was fun tramping over algiers with ted and don and michele russell watching ted in his enthusiasm and guilelessness being as alive and open as a child i missed the meetings with a fatah the single group present more popular with the hordes of algerian youths than the black_panthers but i went down to see their headquarters they are indeed heroic figures they apparently are particularly interested in making contact with the american blacks and vice versa a fatah is stronger than any arab government strong enough to cross all the frontiers to command the sympathy of arabs everywhere it is both comforting and unsettling in the struggle to come will there be a force in the black community able to excite that kind of support dissidence a meeting of writers is called by joseph o o okpaku editor of the americanpublished journal of the new african literature and a handful of writers and interested persons show up i have not much time for i want to talk with mahtar mbow before i leave the city okpaku is concernedand rightly so i feelabout the irrelevance of the presentations at the symposium he talks of the writers descending upon the club des pins in a group seizing the mircrophones and proceeding to deal with real revolutionary ideas and means none of the american writers are present perhaps they have not heard of the meeting there is an american girl from new orleans who is working with some international agency in monrovia i ask her if the liberians are still behaving like bad caricatures of white american stereotypes of africans and i suppose that i pressure her into some admission that in some cases it is true they still dress up in full formal regalia in all that stifling heat she says but she likes the country john d a okai the ghanaian writer is there i do not tell him that i have seen his poem in the new issue of african artstarts dafrique because i do not remember what it is about and cannot truthfully say whether i like it he does not seem stuffily british it is good to observe but i find myself wondering why he is living in london the question is dangerous i know from experience and i have no right to ask it and yet being concerned as i am with the acquisition of power in all of black africa i am always disapproving unfairly or not of the bright and talented africans spending their energies in europe and america janheinz jahn his friend ulla and his elder son are present i do not tell jan that the new york times has asked me to review his new book new african literature a history of black writing for i am not certain i have time to read the book and write the review by the august deadline there is a south african present a colored who identifies himself as a writer but i do not ask him to repeat his name unlike okai he seems veddy veddy british and i find with regret that i am depressed about the whole assembly and have no wish to get involved i find myself supporting the idea of dissent from the formal papers being presented at the symposium and yet i wonder what resonance can be achieved by the objections these people will make are the black africans and the algerians reaching out to touch each other today chatting with ben enwonwu the nigerian sculptor the impotence of africa was brought home to me anew enwonwu is growing old he speaks now of all the old onesof langston hughes and paul robeson and peter abrahams one dead one quite seriously ill and one in quiet exile in the hills of jamaica enwonwu is serving his country diligently at the festival not missing a single session although he is obviously tired and wishes to relax more important still he is so busy at home with matters of official government concern that he has no time to create and what is an artist who cannot work he wants desperately to be free and yet a sense of patriotism drives him on with his mundane chores but he is disheartened at the same time by many things at home he seems not to be sure that his countrys leaders are certain of the path they have taken or that they are fully conscious of the terrors which have been unleashed in the taking of that path and he is heartbroken about the treatment of wole soyinka the great playwright who is going blind in prison like most of the rest of the world enwonwu cannot understand how his own country can be party to the cruel punishmentperhaps the destructionof one of its leading artists but the detainment and treatment of soyinka illustrate the precariousness of political power in africa and if political power is so uncertain is to be so jealously guarded how can the government turn its full attention to the acquisition of economic power which alone will bring about the true liberation of africa i am thinking now of the evening in detroit after my return from guinea in entertaining my friend fred hart williams block club with my photos and artifacts from africa the forced expressions of enthusiasm from the polite middleclass ladies the uneasiness provoked by the lecture and finally the little canadianborn man whose parents had fled slavery in kentucky to the free soil of canada turning impatiently flush with the success he had made of his life in america saying we are not africans look at us we are as much white as black and dont tell us about colonialism we read the papers we see television we know how most of the people in the world live and we are much better off it was a terrible moment but it has passed fred hart who was embarrassed by his old acquaintance would be proud of the new crop of young blacks moving out over the african continent to find and enrich their past to nourish their roots but more than that of course so much more the new ones have no hunger to be embraced by america they will surrender no portion of their dignity to that passion they have turned eastward toward the spirituality and the peace of africa and the orient their natural sphere it is not simply courage which permits them to say no to america and her values it is also a recognitionboth guttural and instinctivethat the emptiness of those values lead only to death africa is both the old world and the new boumediene knows that kwame nkrumah knows it julius nyerere knows it patrice lumumba also knew it it is a dangerous knowledge epilogue we are aboard the air france caravelle flying north over the mediterranean toward europe junius griffin tries to pay for champagne with leftover dinars and the french hostess tells him we dont accept algerian money i am not annoyed the positive feeling toward the festival and all that transpired there in the anomalous white facaded city now fading in the blue african mist cannot be ruined by the arrogance of frenchmen why do i feel positivei suppose the feeling has as much to do with the relative efficiency of the algerian handling of the difficult business of processing housing and managing the sudden deluge of thousands of visitors as it does with the conviction that the elusive and somewhat enigmatic hourari boumediene will lead his country toward true independence and power there were frustrating moments i admit but the algerians were generally accommodating congenial understanding and considering that they had no experience in mounting and conducting an event of so monumental a magnitude their performance was superb i find that i have no reservations about the countrys internal political situation it is a revolutionary government and even the detainment of ben bella while regrettable can be explained in that light what of ben bella i asked young abdul the hotel guide he is well msieur it is a question of the security of the revolution i did not ask of moise t shorn be for that might have been interpreted as an accusation and tshorn be was not worth the semblance of concern the benedict arnold of the congo the quisling of africa it is of course a question americans will ask ignoring the implications of the denial of leroi jones right to leave the country the cia it is always an interesting game at gatherings of disaffected blacks to speculate on the identity of the american agents and some grow paranoid in the process labeling innocents all in the game in the taxi hurtling through the mrv ing streets en route to the airport i noted that i had not seen a single train in a week even though had been whisked in test pilotstyle along the corniche adjacent to the tracks several times i was thinking of industry there are many factories the french les piedsnors invested much of themselves in the usines around the lovely country and one understands why they held on so tenaciously but that is in the past algiers is moving forward and with defiance and she wants to take the rest of africa with her godspeed

this is the heaviest work a poem one page ahhhh man consider people feed and clothe them in the beauty of god that is where its at and yeh man do it well incredibly well black poetrywhere its at in the amount of black poetry being published we have also seen a change in style and subject matter at this point being written that is to say all brack poets dont write the same kind of poetry or all black poems aint the same kind they differ just as white poems differ do and ju st as white poems come in sonnets ballads or whatever i have attempted to place all black poetry in several broad categories all of which have variations on the main form very few poems are all one type or another it is possible and probable that a poem will be three or four different types of poetry at one time that is a signifying poem will be a teachin spaced py ramid poem here are the main head mgs signifying a open b sly c with or about teachin rappin coversoffa rundown b hipto c digupdcoatpull spac ed spiritual a mindblower fantasy b coolout bein selfreflective a upinself b uptight c deajinswingin love a skin b space spiritual c cosmic ancestral shoutin angrycathartic a badmouth b c f acetoface two faced warningconfrontation irony jazz a rifiin b cosmic trane c groun ded lewis du wah a ditty bop b bebop pamid getting us to gethe i buildingnationhood some of these categories are self explanatory and familiar most poems as previously stated fall into more than one category which to my way of thinking attests to the flexibility of black writers unconsciously i think poets fall into their bag or bags and it is no discredit to a writer if he chooses to deal with only one form or two or three however a black writer will be classifiable in at least one of these categories although it is conceivable to me that black writers are creative enough to uncover forns which are yet to be acknowledged we will know if the writing is black briefly i am going to give examples of several of the headings and then devote a large amount of discussion to signifying poetry since it has reached an exciting unprecedented level of sophistication in the written word the teachin poem is a poem which seeks to define and give direction to black people the two examples chosen and quoted in part here are ronda daviss towards a black aesthetic and barbara mahones what color is black if tomorrows black poetry will not explain what is but be it then pens will be electric with feeling igniting and the paper shall become the poet and the poets shall be earthclouds and mahone black is the color of ronda davis my little brothers mind the grey streaks in my mothers hair black is the color of my yellow cousins smile the scars upon my neighbors wrinkled face the coversofj rundown hip to dig up or coatpull are basically the same type of poem so the terms can be used interchangeably there are many many examples of this kind of poem today for example cleveland webbers poem from his recently released book of poetry afica africa afica in america the people are in all the areas we occupy little parts of air telling little lies taking little trips at least days a week or don ghetto streets get empty while internalized in a suffering too old to l lees poem on nigerian unity the pig be is little niggers killing little niggers the weak against the weak the ugly against the ugly these poets hip you to something pull the covers off of something or run it down to you or ask you to just dig it your coat is being pulled the spaced poem is very beautiful and many black poets after writing a lot of signify ing coversofj or shoutin poems find that an inner calm becomes and inherent in that a mystical and positive way of looking at the black mans relationship to the universe ameer baraka leroi jones has a poem called black people this is our destiny and i quote from it here we go to meet the realization of makers knowing who we are knowing how to live and what life is we must spin through in our seven adventures in the endlessness of all existing feeling all existing forms of lif e the gasses the plants the ghosts minerals the spirits the souls the light in the stillness where the stortn the glow the nothing in god is complete except there is nothing to be incomplete the pulse and change of rhythm blown flight to be anything at all vibration holy nuance beating against itself a rhythm a playing reunderstood now by one of the st race the primitives the first men who evolve again to civilize the world the space d poem returns to the spiritual wisdom of our egyptian african forefathers returns to the natural laws the natural state of man before subhuman massacres spaced poems say that our ancestors are in the air and will communicate with us as is the case in jones no matter no matter the world is the world a broke dead genius moved on to dust will touch you one night and the stacked dust of a gone brother will hunch you some father you needed who left you we speak of the vibrations positive and negative and we believe again in what we have never truly deniedthe power of nommojuju and the collective force of the positive spirits moving in time with the universe in our poetry we sing of sunra and coltrane and their lifemotion which is sound the new black poets believethatwe are the seventh dimension as the seventhsun son they further believe in the overallimportance of the astrologicalsigns of people the writer is sagittarius no the dream is to utilizeour beginning to conceptualize and direct a black endthatisas beautiful as our beginning the mindblower poem may seem similar to the spaced poem but the two are not to be confused there are basic differences mindblower poems seek to expand our minds to break the chains that strangle them so that we can begin to imagine alternatives for black people they seek to ridicule and mutilate that which may have formerly been esteemed often these poems predict an awful or glorious future and are gorier than the spaced poem sometimes the a w ful predictions are for black people oftener for subhumans larry neal in his book black boogaloo in an untitled poem says we gathered in the open place piled their symbols one on top of the other their flags and their death books took their holidays rolled their platitudes into nice burnable heaps gathered and piled this stuff from the stink pots of the earth which they have made so in the distance their cities burn we piled their histories skyward with destruction acknowledgement to our ancestors and gods then we light it singing by contrast is jewel latimores folk fable but the niggaswadnt hip wadnt hipped until they was copped too to work in the mines on the moon the ships had promises had names that all the niggas knew names like jesus heaven freedom to take the niggas to a new world when they was shipped to the moon mainland sold to companies who was bidden while the chasemanhattan bank supervised the auctions or ebons poem the statue of liberty has her back to harlem two other alternate titles excluded isaw them bayonet her spine and pin her th birthday to a cross whereithung dank and slimcy it hung like stagnant death in shallow pools vomiting blood on poets and mothers and flower children surely he was talking about them and he is a master of the gory every poet has written a bein poem in fact most poets start off writing them just writing about the way they be they friends be they lovers be the world be an example presented here is one of my own from my book songs of a blackbirdits me bathed and ashy smellin down with revions aquamarine me with my hair black and nappy good and rough as the ground me sitting in my panties itsme inthe sky where pharoah and coltrane playing and its me screammmmmmmming into the box and the box isscreammmmmmmming back inkuluse karma and allpraise is due allah we are now getting more more more lovepoemsfromaboutblack men and women such is this fragile jewel of barbara mahones the poem with your permission combines skin space spiritual aspects as they should besmooth surf aces are easy i would rather deal with what moves you explore the fire and texture of your soul with your pert nission i would chart a course across your skin and travel all day all night up and down that rocky road and one black warrior william wandick writes spears of honey my eyes took your slender fingers dreamed on them they thinned imagination to a queen called shebanefertiti deeming you royalnessmakinga fetish of your hand and there are love poems for all black people such as ronda daviss poem about the wine dipped woman and we need more and more more the shoutin poem is perhaps at this time the most familiar to us all for awhile it seemed to be the only kind of poem being written it usually tells the subhuman off or offs him with word bullets an example of the fa cetoface poem which is an aspect of the shoutin type is one written by sonia sanchez in her hardhitting book of poetry h omecominggit the word out now to the manboy taking a holiday from murder tell him we hip to his shit and that the next time he kills one of our blkprinces some of his faggots gonna die a stonecolddeath yeah the last category with which i will deal briefly is the two fac ed poem as kids we used to call a person twof aced if they grinned in our faces and talked about us behind our backs in poetry this concept takes on similar but broader meanings for example i will use my poem you name it will write about things that are universal so that hundreds maybe even thousands of years from now white critics and readers will say of me here is a good black writer who wrote about truth and univesal topics i will write about people who eat as it was in the beginning i will write about people who sleep s now i will write about people who fuck and ever shall i will write about babies being born world without end i will write about black people repossessing this earth ahmen iwould hope that everyone who reads the poem catches the two facededness irony implicit in the theme signify ing poetry holds a specialfascination for me probably because icould notcan not signify and have always admired those who can from a literary point of view it is a significant exciting aspect of todays poetry iknow and you know that we have always signified on the corners in the poolrooms the playgrounds anywhere and everywhere we have had the opportunity we sig with somebody about somebody and if we cant be open about it we sig on the sly langston hughes character simplesignified with his landlady his partners his girlfriend everybody and richard wright deals it in black boy however to my knowledge no grotlp of black writers has ever used it as a poetic technique as much as todays writers it is done with polish and the audienceslove it too much signifying can be negative ithink however most of todays poets are very conscious of how important positive vibrations are and few have carried signification to an extreme in the main it is being used for constructive destruction a quick or lengthy look at the poetry of don l lee nikki giovanni or sonia sanchez shows that these three poets signif y with their readers and the objects of their poems signify fuh days wallace for president his mamma for vicepresident don l lee andmemorial the supremes cuz they dead soniasanchez or nikki giovanniever notice how its only the ugly honkies who hate and of course the master of it all ameer baraka leroi jones on wigs starter why dont you take that thing off yo haid you look like miss muffet in a runaway ugly machine imean like that signifying is a way of saying the truth that hurts with a laugh a way of capping on shutting up someone getting even talking bout peoples mammas such its a lovehate exercise in exorcising ones hostilities its a funny way of saying something negative that is obviously untrue like you look like you been whupped wid uh ugly stick or saying something that is negative as niggerstanding on the corner thought him was cool him still standing there its winter time him cool signifying is very often a bloody knife job with a vocal touch it moves in progressions sometimes and it is both general and specific in black boy by richard wright we are taken through a dozens scene or signifying scene to me they are the same and each phrase is labeled in terms of its significance you eat yet uneasily trying to make conversation yeah man idone really fed my face casually i had cabbage potatoes confidently i had buttermilk blackeye peas meekly informational hell iaint gonna stand near you nigger pronouncement how come feigned innocence cause you gonna smell up this air in a minutes a shouted accusation nigger your minds in a ditch amusingly moralistic ditch nothing nigger you going to break wind any minute now triumphant pronou ncement creating suspense yeah when them blackeyed peas tell that butternilk to move overthatbuttermilk aint gonna wanna move and theres gonna be war in your guts and your stomachs gonna swell up and bust climax as you see every line leads up to the cap the final one and the last statement is based on a reality that all blacks know peas buttermilk cabbage potatoes will cause you to fart it is a fourtofour balanced way of mak ing love to while poking hurtfun at ones self and ones lifestyles a great deal of what todays poets do is hit run signifying or another way of saying it spot signif y ing that is they do not usually sustain the length of a standard signifying circle but they are traveling too fast they hitand keep on moving to the next pointyo mamma your daddy too or booing senator ribicoff no pretty man himself but at least out of the beast category nikki giovanni the poets signify withabout a whole lot of people in one poem hitting one then another and usually though not always one theme holds the poem together when two people signify with each other one feeds the other for progression dramatic buildup to impact but the object of ridicule doesnt have to be around or vocalresponses can be imagined or drawn from the poets own experiencesyou followed him niggers all of youyes you did isaw ya implied response no i didnt don llee now because signifying often contains such a broad base of truth it has been known to cause in fact it is famous for causing a fight or a death it can get too down too real so true and personal it uncovers too much if the signif yer can really get down and in grammar school the last word was yo mama is uh man the second party who cannot move his tongue to balance the scale may use his fists to do so or his knife or both and it is a matter of pride no black person wants to be sigged about or capped all over no black person can listen to some jignifying without responding in some way it pulls us in and we identify with the bad signifyer obviously this style of poetry has the power to involve black people and to move them it is a familiar mover and is probably the most dynamic type of poetry i have mentioned up to now itrust thatihave initiated here arather complete incomplete picture of where black poetry is at some may quibble with the actual attempt to i label what black writers are doingothers may take issue with the labels i we do not it cannot be said too often want subhumans defining what we be doing there is no human reference point and objectivity does not really exist in criticism there is perhaps reason tempered by a good strong sense of what is reasonable what is fair ultimately ones lifestyle is his point of view black poetry is becoming what it has always been but has not quite beedand we have love and the spirit of our ancestorsto guide us good evening regal lady what can we do for you queens are a bit out of date these days replaced as it were by a royalty of spirit so though you are queenly indeed we cannot crown you ruler of a realm however there are few other roles you cannot play upon lifes broad and varied stage what is your fancy is it something unpretentious but highly essential such as housewife nurse secretary teacher or is it somethingmore complex and challenging physician for example or attorney at law or scientist or actress or artist we are preparing the way for youfor it is our pleasure as well as our duty to do soand in return we ask only this of you honor your past treasure the words of playwright lorraine hansberry have sustained one of the most heroic resistances to tyranny in the history of man and carry with you into the next generations that certain dark joy celebrated by writer lerone bennett jr that rich ineluctable fruit of africa which gave sustenance and vitality to your forebears during the races long bitter sweet travail

nineteen hundred and sixty nine over p million americans of crrs rm african descent still ix fincj themselves occupying space in a foreign land a land that is alien to them and even though they know it is alien to them they are still crawling for crumbs refusing to accept the inescapable fact that we are not wanted here because we are not needed here unfortunately black actors belong to and are a part of that same oppressed minority there is nothing they can do about this fact the choice has been imposed upon them by racist white america so it would seem that they would all immediately join some black organization and begin to work side by side with their other brothers and sisters toward building a black nation the signs are all around us america is erupting its splitting at the seams but rather than face m this reality black actors continue to keep on pushing trying to reach the top obsessed with the ideal of making it yet when a select few do reach the top they find it is somehow still the bottom because white people are still running the show so they wrap their troubles in a sack of dreams and keep on keepin on each day swallowing another lie dying another death trying to adapt to this mans culture a way of life that is directly opposed to their very existence they refuse to believe that they have bought a lie the myth of the american dream that perversion which says one nation under god with liberty and justice foi all to some degree this would have been true if the wording had been slightly changed to one white nation under one white god with liberty and justice for white folks only but somehow the forefathers neglected to include this most important fact you see everything white people do or have ever done culturally socially economically and politically has been solely to perpetuate their power andor to maintain the status quo history proves this to be so so it behooves us all to stop struggling and to decide now who we are and what we are the hand is on the gate we are at war in this coun try and we cant continue to aimlessly wonder around in negro confusion searching for a perverted dream these are the cold faced facts make up your mind do you continue to help the man help himself or do you go back and begin to help your own to help themselves and we can only help our own by first ripping ourselves away from that american dream somehow black actors shy away from this decision because they see in this choice the necessity of giving up something precious rather than gaining something vital they see in this choice a denial of some material comfort which they now afford or hopefully someday will be able to afford they are stuck with a slave mentality and would somehow rather let white people continue to take care of them giving them jobs and telling them how when and what to act they seemingly have so little confidence in themselves as black men and women that they refuse to break these ties they are afraid to stand up and accept the responsibility of controlling their own lives and providing work for themselves so instead they go around spouting universal phrases of humanity which will allow them to maintain their solo position in the unchanging system if they would just sit quietly and ask themselves how do i see myself in relationship to my physical surroundings brother leroi jones answers the question very simply slave or free black or white eitheror there is no in between but many brothers and sisters because of their basic feeling of inferiority refuse to accept this so that they continue to operate out of a negro bag its as if they see themselves in a grey world an assimilatedintegrated world but the assimilation of something is the complete destruction of one thing for another thing when you take on the other thing you also take on a different name and consequently you are not the same thing anymore you have forgotten the first thing in order to become the second thing so when it all boils down you are still left with two choices black or white because for black people to view the world through greyintegrated eyes is really the same as viewing it through white eyes theyre simply straddling the fence occupying space theyre neither one thing nor the other theyre immobile indefinite and indecisive and more important their silence is an endorsement of white power and to be black and to endorse white power is a very dangerous position to take because they are then working directly against their people if they would appraise this situation properly they would see that this condition occurs because of an insatiable hunger for personal power and recognition a thirst for authority and dictatorship which stems from the need to constantly prove themselves prove that they exist so it seems that everyone wants to be the master and no one wants to be the slave but its not about me and i anymore its about striving toward nationhood and peoplehood its about bridging the gap between niggernegro and black its about unity which is the only solution to our struggle for liberation unity means working together all our forces and resources co operatively to build and develop black institutions institutions which will hopefully begin to blacken all the whiteness we find ourselves surrounded with everyday so the next question becomes how can we do this and still survive again the answer is unity once we begin to think collectively we can begin to bring about a change change suggests revolution and revolution is a very frightening word most socalled black actors dont fully understand the depth or the meaning of this word nor do they understand the seriousness of their plight so they refer to themselves in meaningless nonpolitical and romantic terms constantly appearing and posturing on television rapping and chitterchatting about some phase of blackness or making pseudomilitant statements in magazines and newspapers concerning the emergence of this new phenomenon called black theater consistently associating the word with community theater which in turn means nonprofessional or amateur theater well i hate to shatter their illusions but the very words black artistblack theater inherently have political connotations and black artists can no longer divorce themselves from this issue no more than they can continue to divorce themselves from their people if black theaters are to be at all valid they must meet the psychological needs of all black people they must bring the people closer to an awareness of who they really are they must be used as a tool to strengthen and to build enlighten and to elevate and they must be totally run by black peopie who view the world blackly and in order to view the world blackly you must first decrude yoursif that is purge yourself of all those years of white indoctrination and white ideology living black then becomes a full time job because to live black is to think black to think black is to feel black to feel black is to act black to act black is to know black to know black is to build black and to build black is to be black just as there are churches on every corner there must be theaters on every corner theaters which will put into practice the principles of blackness theaters run by black artists who with all their beings will create black forces forces which will help tear down the walls of western rigidness and sterility forces which will lead black people out of bondage theaters which will pour out new images new symbols new patterns of thought theaters which will clear away all the old dehumanizing forms of cliches that for centuries have blocked the way we must place our energies in a new direction a direction whicn goes out instead of up leading us back to our original sourceand at the very core of that source is a spiritual tradition black theaters must portray these people so that they can see themselves in all their glory and once again walk proud praising themselves and their blackness biack people are a feeling peopie a sincere sympathetic and giving people a soulful people full of love and vitality a people with a conscience and this conscience must permeate black theaters everywhere well it seems that black artists have a tremendous task they must consciously and willfully commit themselves to change and this commitment must stem from a deep compassion and love a love that is so moving so charged with emotion that it will destroy any and all evil evil that blocks the way and keeps us from building a more beautiful and healthy world a world where black people can love laugh and sing again black artists must sing new revolutionary songs songs which will force black people to turn into themselvesinto the really real of themselvesnot the full fearing fear of themselvesnot the confused cagingcage of themselves not the aimlessaim of themselves but the fieryfire of themselves the sparklingsparkle of themselves the manwoman of themselves their voices must help black people stretch outpull in transcend step out of that narrow western concept of themselves that way of life that is killing the real self of themselves their voices must change the myself of themselves into the ourself of themselves let these images drip down for the us of ourselves giving strength and determination to all those who are a part of the us of ourselves let these images roll out into the real world giving guidance and direction but first black artists must show the real of themselves to themselves before they can teach the world to sing again do it quickly time is running out plays with themes about black people p sprang up all over new york during the past year however this activity is not to be confused with black theater which is still going through hard times struggling to gain a foothold in black communities if black theater is that theater written directed produced and financed by blacks located in black areas and geared to black audiences then few plays of the last year qualify they were mostly located downtown and designed to attract that theatergoing we shall overcome blackandwhitetogether crowd the most ballyhooed play to open this past season with a black theme was howard sacklers the great white hope the stillrunning broadway hit is based on the life of former heavyweight champion jack johnson and gives veteran actor james earl jones a vehicle for a bravura performance a black person attending the play had best keep in mind that this is a white mans version of jack johnson just as william styrons book is a white mans version of nat turner take a hard look at it forgetting all the rave reviews and see that many of the old stereotypes creep through for instance johnsons white woman is sanctified and idealized to the heavens while his black woman is depicted as a constantly nagging shrew be aware that the real jack johnson married three white women with at least one rumored to be a whore another play wellreviewed by new yorks white liberal audience is big time buck white supposedly a satire on the shenanigans of black militants what it turns out to be is a white author creating amos n andy images of black men to the immense pleasure of his predominantly white audience honey man weasel hunter rubber band and jive get those names spend the first threequarters of the play shouting signifying shuffling and cussing about how to divide up the antipoverty money they belong to an organization called beautiful allelujah days bad everyone is waiting for buck white and when he came out during the last quarter of the play i hoped that he would bring order to the chaos instead he evasively answered questions from the audience some of whom were plants i never knew whether he was serious or just putting everyone down the answers were usually uninformative and irrelevant to the rest of the play big time buck white has no meaning for black people a satire on some of the absurdities of the more rhetorical militants we may need but a satire on black militants by a white writer we can do without the next major opening was ed bullins in the wine time at the new lafayette theatre in harlem in this play which depicts a day in the life of tenementdweller qiff dawson his wife his nephew and assorted neighbors bullins proves that he is our top playwright his characterizations of the black urban poor are without par today cliff is a harddrinking shell of a man whom the oppressive system has beaten down despite his tough talk he has decided to escape into his wine bottle his defeat is not yet total though and he halfheartedly tries to encourage his nephew ray to break out of the oppressive cycle the two chief flaws of wine time are a somewhat abrupt seemingly forced ending and the lack of one character to suggest concrete ways for the entrapped black poor to break the vicious cycle a community theater assumes this responsibility it is hoped that bullins future plays will do this wine time is a good play and gave the new lafayette theater a good vehicle to launch good black theater in harlem much further downtown the douglas turner wardrobert hooks negro ensemble company nec started off its new season with ray mclvers god is a guess what harshly criticized last year for not doing a play written by a black american playwright nec this season scheduled four such plays unfortunately their first offering proved a disappointment god is a guess what is a cute piece of trivia about an attempted lynching of a virtuous negro jim by two southern rednecks jim has faith that his god will rescue him from the evil whites and sure enough he does just before the dastardly deed is completed god bursts on stage not black not white but a suavely neutral gray proceeding to deliver long and profound monologues on brotherhood there had been a little snap to the play before god appeared but after his entrance it was all down hill the play was oldfashioned and resembled something that a local high school drama class would love to do in fact mclver wrote it as an exercise in a college drama class years ago its production was a waste of necs talent and i hope that their subsequent productions will be more challenging these are ceremonies in dark old men by lonne elder iii which deals with a harlem family an evening of one acts a program of plays drawn from the black experience and man better man by earl hill which is set in the west indies another interesting play is the believers directed by barbara ann teer currently shown off broadway which gives highlights of black history through the use of music in january robert riches message from the grass roots ran at the james weldon johnson theater arts center in east harlem based on the life of malcolm_x it covered a year period of his life what we get is a white playwrights interpretation of what he wanted malcolm to be not the forceful black nationalist which brother malcolm was riche almost made him into a minor martin_luther_king jr the play did contain a strong performance by dennis tate as minister william malcolm he has a striking facial resemblance on stage and the voice imitation was almost perfect leroi jones spirit house players are still active in newark using the theater to increase the black consciousness level of newarks black majority it is hoped that this in turn will help to achieve the political aim of electing a black mayor in another active local group is the afroamerican studio for acting and speech which is headed by ernie mcclintock performing only on weekends they did highly competent productions of amen corner moon on a rainbow shawl and black nativity this group has survived over a year in harlem with no foundation or city financial support they are deserving of support from those who endorse black theater the east wind cafe is another harlembased enterprise which provides an outlet for black arts devotees mostly poetry readings are held there but anyone who has seen what black poets are into know that this is true black theater besides the plays mentioned above black performers are in several nonracial shows on and off broadway these include hello dolly hair boys in the band and riot a yearold black musician harold wheeler is the or w chestra conductor for the hit musical promises promises it would be a mistake to assume that all this activity signals an upsurge of black theater as critic clive barnes of the new york times so loudly proclaims except for the new lafayette the spirit house and the afroamerican studio none are located in black communities and except for these three none operate out of a philosophy of cultural nationalism true black theater is still in dire need of support financial and otherwise from those who yearn for the development of a strong and viable ethnic theater chicagos south side center of the performr ing arts under the rm guidance of general f rji i i manager ted ward produced two plays during included were a month run of wards prizewinning reconstruction drama our lari and ronald milners whose got his own the milner play closed after a week run due to illness of one of the principals the south side center has an enviable location in the heart of the south side ghetto and could develop into an important black cultural institution housed in the louis theater a former movie house on east th street with a capacity of more than the center plans a season of original plays by black playwrights for scheduled for production are ted wards candle in the wind a bill of three oneact plays wards whole hog or nothing ron milners the monster and the penny game by chicago playwright james blackwell also scheduled is the spook who sat by the door a stage adaptation of chicagoan sam greenlees novel of the same title the play was adapted by greenlee and melvin clay of the living theater greenlees novel has been rejected by major american publishers but was scheduled for publication in london this spring the spook who sat by the door has as its theme a black revolution which begins on chicagos south side we intend that the south side center of the performing arts reflect and interpret the lives of the people of the surrounding neighborhood said ward we welcome greenlees play because it does exactly that ted ward has a long and distinguished background in black theater and was one of the founders of the negro playwrights company in harlem in association with langston hughes paul robeson and richard wright in wards play our lari was winner of the theater guild award and was subsequently produced on broadway ward is recipient of numerous awards among them national theater conference awards for and and a guggenheim fellowship in muring the last year ttx the free southern jljf j theater has undergone os a significant solidification of structure and financesso that now the future of the souths only black touring theater can be said to be quite secure plans have been finalized for the sixth southern tour beginning in april in new orleans under the directorship of gilbert moses one of the founders of the troupe in the company will perform a repetoire of east of jordan a full length play by evan walker and a second evening of several short oneact plays slave ship by leroi jones riot sale by ben caldwell roots by gilbert moses and happy birthday jesus by valerie ferdinand of the writers workshop in new orleans consisting of approximately actors and five apprentices the company will tour four to six months depending on funds covering louisiana mississippi alabama georgia and texas john oneal now free from alternative military service as a conscientious objector resumes duty as producing director roberta jones coordinates fund raising and financial affairs as associate producer in new york thomas dent is assigned to the community writingacting project as associate producer in new orleans brock peters assumed chairmanship of the board of directors in november new orleans community workshops early in the company decided that the idea of a performing touring company was not enough to insure that the free southern theater would develop viable roots in the south to an extent the idea of the fst perpetrated imported art which though it hoped would be relevant to the needs of the black communities where it played did not have the advantage of developing out of the communities themselves for this reason it was decided that a community workshop program would be started in the community where we domicile ourselves new orleans which would be equally as important as the professional touring company carmel collins and eluard burt helped to develop community projects in and early which resulted in wide participation in the extremely exciting and successful first afroamerican festival at dillard university in february included was a workshop production of an original oneact play the smokers by charles self a promising young new orleans writer since then the community program has concentrated on a combined actingwriting workshop with quality material from new black writers as its objective this workshop recently produced a page magazine of explosive and probing poetry gumbo and plans several issues to follow the next issue will concentrate on new orleans that rich cultural gumbo of irresolvable contradictions by the summer of the workshop hopes to produce a packet of six to eight oneact plays which the touring company and other black groups can use the actingwriting workshop is just one objective of the new orleans community program on the drawing board are plans for projects which utilize the talents of new orleans musicians a community newspaper and workshops in dance and current events nevertheless it is the task and role of the actingwriting workshop to begin producing new material for the black stage material which utilizes all of the many rich and heretofore unexploited possibilities of black culture looking ahead so we look with anticipation toward a new southern tourall the familiar places laurel hattiesburg jackson west point prairie view holmes county bogalusa tuskegee sunflower etc and some new ones like empire la in plaquemines parish deep in leander perez country on the river bank its an exciting time in the south the publicity and focus is all northern ghetto right now but for three years black people in southern communities the movement came to then left almost as suddenly well these people havent been sleeping theyve been slugging it out by themselves slowly and undramaticallybut its been their show and the changes one realizes are here to stay dig that we are on the move in mississippi that in dead ole new orleans three black oriented community theaters have sprung up in the last year nat turner dashiki the place shreveport has a new community theater so does san antonio jackson miss will have one soon to be able to play in these communities to offer them something which they in turn will turn into their own conscious weapons developing their own strong black community voicesthis is the measure of the thrill of touring again as the key thrust of the fnr foregoing reports on black theater across the land is that black theater still is searching still gathering its forces still languishing in a state of hope and pregnancy despite the emergence of an exciting new talent like ed bullins the undoubtedly great potential of black theater in america remains as yet unrealized which is not entirely negative there must be time for the new voices to gain their strength the process of weaning is not yet complete the influence of the american commercial theater in particular and of western theater tradition in general hover heavily over the new talent perverting it when not strangling it too often the older voices are too fundamentally entwined with the dogma of the past to speak with relevance to ears attuned to the present and the newer fresher voices have not yet found the form with which to force the final breakthrough the young playwrights whose work was brought before the public in the special issue of the drama review edited by ed bullins was proof enough of the new spirit and of the great potential and the new paperback anthology which bullins has prepared under the bantam label will extend this young people like edd johnson of new orleans a writer with the nat turner theater and carolyn rodgers of chicago a writer with the obac workshop are stretching their imaginations and coming up with exciting ideas for the black theater and of course the leroi jonesfounded theater of reality at spirit house in newark continues to experiment occasionally touring the campuses at the invitation of black student groups black theater continues aborn ing then but in the meantime black people are involved increasingly in some theater activity in the principal population centers of the country during the past year in new york for example a number of productions featured black performers among them poetry and folk music of american negroes in central park with roscoe lee browne ellen holly cicely tyson amanda ambrose josephine premice gloria foster and leon bibb riot with margo jefferson and tony harrington jr a play brought to the broadway united church of christ by the om theater workshop of boston christophe at the brooklyn academy of music with j a preston and marilyn berry the cuban thing on broadway with jane white big time buck white transported from watts with dick williams arnold williams and ron rich americana pastoral at the greenwich mews with marcella lowery ron oneal and louise stubbs cities in bezique at the public theater with paul benjamin joan harris and cynthia belgrave god bless at the yale repertory theater with carl lee message from the grassroots at the james weldon johnson theater arts center with dennis tate as malcolm and walk down mah street at the players theater with kenneth frett and lorraine feather the new lafayette theater and the new heritage repertory theater in harlem were joined by the national black theater workshop inc under the direction of the dynamic barbara ann teer also its founder in february miss teer reported the following we are in the first phase of our program training the company we have spent the last five months experimenting with new techniques of working and are developing totally new and different methods of communication our goal is to establish a black art standard the first word deleted from our theatrical vocabulary was the word actor we have declared ourselves liberators keeping in mind that before we can psychologically liberate black people we must ourselves first be liberated in order to do this we have had to expose and analyze all our niggernegroness because liberators must first be strong wholesome positive africanamericans completely committed to revolution and revolutionary black art we have therefore through a process of decruding ourselvesthat is cleansing our minds so that we can change images reappropriate values and constantly strive to reaffirm our spiritual essencebecome revolutionary black artists the national black theater workshop inc is aiming at a major production for this spring officers of the theater with miss teer are larry neal charlie russell bill strickland velma banks and shirley mckie the negro ensemble company downtown opened in february with ceremonies in dark old men a play by lonne elder iii of the nec staff the play was received with guarded enthusiasm by the new york times drama critic clive barnes it was the second play of the necs second season by a black american writer the first play was ray mclvers comedy god is a guess what which was mentioned in the new york report by peter bailey out in chicago black theater fared less well even by second city standards and expectations sam greenlee mentioned ted wards theater and plans in the chicago report but did not emphasize that oscar brown jr and jean pace were being sought as the leads for his own play the spook who sat by the door an adaptation of his novel of the same name published in march in england miss teer has agreed to direct mr greenlees play if her prior commitments permit ann mcneil doggedly continued with the obac drama workshop aided by a loyal core of actors and supporters which include young bill eaves clarence taylor len jones and harold lee harold johnsons group was working at press time toward an opening theater in los angeles presented a happier picture even if a less black one harry e dolan director of the douglass house founda tion reported that the group was remodeling its theater which will be the first significant development to come out of the revolt in watts and more significant it is the first real thing of black development mr dolan said that the theater would use material from outside the community as we did with big time buck white which has a white author three other plays were scheduled for production house divided by jeanne taylor the pet shop by cal wilson and pornoff by elvie whitney we also will be doing a play by myself entitled nat turner a far different one from that william styron farce the confessions of nat turner mr dolan said the acting company includes bill jackson sonara mckeller quincy troupe charles thomas and james jackson the studio watts workshop under the leadership of james m woods and the direction of melvin longmire now has apprentices connected with the workshop according to mr

playwrights with works by ed bullins ben caldwell evan walker joe dyer and jimmy garrett scheduled van tile e whit field founder of pasla is concerned with new forms and new means of exploring and dramatizing the black experience in this connection the companys repertory includes a compilation program called give me back my drum which tells of the black mans original method of communication in mother africa the drum the program begins with the joyous message of a successful hunt being transmitted throughout a village via the drum there is rejoicing and a feast then the message of the drum changes theres a warning sound there is terror a ship is approaching a ship carrying white men who will ultimately enslave the people of the village the drum becomes hysterical the white men capture the people there is a woeful sound narration written by mr whitfield describes the plight of the black man rendered communicatively important in a land of no friends pasla also performs an anthology of black writings a compilation of scenes from plays by black playwrights improvisational drama and a program of black folklore which includes the acting out of african folktales pasla is seeking funds to renovate its theater the inner city cultural center iccc and the house of respect which is affiliated with the douglass house foundation are active in los angeles as is the ebony showcase in detroit the concepteast continues its spark in the community but much of the theatrical energy has been directed to other outlets actress sylvia king for example keeps busy reading black poetry with groups performing before school and university audiences and on television programs in washington d c the arena stage theater has attracted some of the best local talent from the black community in new orleans the nat turner theater black theater for black people struggles toward solidity and permanencehoyt w fuller it must have been two or three years after high school or at least two or three years before collegethere was a five years gap for methat i found langston hughes i didnt find him in high school or college in the high school that i attended especially the american literature classes black writers were foreign black poets were nonexistent in my college they were ignored during the fifties when i came of age discovering searching groping for identification teachers often turned me on to robert lowell vachel lindsay eugene oneill william faulkner robert penn warren mark twain henry james hart grane and of course ernest hemingway they were described as true american writers because they were white born here or wrote here there was no labelling of langston hughes as american because in his poetry and prose there is a deep and abiding love for this country as well as for the black man in this country i found langston hughes during my intense study of the black theatre i discovered theatre in the five year gap too dr alain locke discussed black writers in the collection thirteen plays for the negro theater it is one of the earliest published anthologies of plays about black lifestyles i wish i could find that book he mentioned how langstons plays had received praise at the karamu house theater in cleveland langston led me to other black writers black institutions he led me to richard wright crisis magazine james baldwin ralph ellison w c handy mercury magazine even to carl van vechten from articles and books i found that he was a poet short story writer translator and adaptor i exhausted myself in the library reading langston hughes soul gone home at least times a good job done times early autumn one of the most beautiful short stories in american letters two or three dozen times poems weary blues a house in taos to ive known rivers montage of a dream deferred so i was aware of him long before i met him similar i am aware of god of pushkin if only i could have met them it was the newspaper the negro newspaper announced that langston hughes would be coming to detroit given the key to the city and would be escorted from the airport by police motorcade downtown to the citycounty building our new city chief mayor jerome p cavanagh would then present the poet with the key to detroit on the afternoon of the following day after he had received the key ronald milner a writer friend called me he had met langston and he had impressed langston my friend wanted me to go with him that very afternoon and meet langston hughes are you available man he asked langston was staying at the parkshelton in the art center section of detroit equidistance from everything downtown westside eastside it seemed that all my artsycraftsy friends knew him yet before the negro press announced his arrival i assumed no one knew him because no one ever mentioned him or his work however he was a celebrity among the blacks ie the factory workers the car washers the day workers domestics bartenders they knew one of his poems or one of his short stories or one of his plays or some of simple they had read in the chicago defender margaret danner the poet and a dear friend to detroit artists and writers had introduced ronald to langston so naturally respect and aspiration for langston grew because i knew then that the man had to be real one can determine the effect of a man by the ones who love him so it was with langston hughes before i met him at about that time we were involved in something in detroit called for nothing better black discovery we had built our own theater called concepteast margaret danner had opened boone house for poets henri king had opened the contemporary art gallery and both tony brown and richard henry brother imari started publishing little magazines we had a lot of things to talk to langston about would he listen had the new mayor and the middleclass negro doctors and lawyers cornered him on this detroit visit the first thing he did on my arrival at the hotel was to offer me a drink i refused i dont drink what a writer and director dont drink then he smiled the cigarette with the ashes not falling sort of blocking some of the smile how can i describe that smile have you ever studied the mona lisa draw in a cigarette with ashes langstons smile would create the same effect he told us how swinging the suite was man wish l had one of these permanently this is something isnt it wow hey they gave me the key to the city he started looking for the key but evidently had misplaced it brought me in by motorcade wish i had the money they spent on me and we all broke up laughing he was real later that evening he spoke for arthur coar local director for the association for the study of negro life and history the organization founded in the twenties by carter woodson also one of the first men to hire langston he and i talked again that night i told him how much i liked his short story early autumn he told me to look him up if i came to new york i talked of the conditions of the black man in the theater i do remember he gave ronald milner a copy of his plays dont you want to be free and soul gone home and we tried to get a cast together to do a reading of his poetry and the two plays but he left two days later before we could get the actors parting he said something like its kinda hard to get colored people together but once you got them well and he smiled that smile preoccupied with his packing in early i moved to new york i found the opportunity via rev malcolm boyd and his play study in color i called langston after about a week of the cruelties of new york city hi woodie he said come on over how is ron did he finish that big book he lived in harlem on th street in one of those beautiful brownstones i had trouble finding the house i searched around and finally i asked a policeman yeah the poet he lives in the next block his office was on the third floor it was filled with books by black writersfiction and nonfiction from blacks the world over most of the books had some personal identification for him because langston had helped in getting them published or had written the introduction or had helped the writer when the writer was beginning the first thing he said i read that story beautiful light and black our dreams in negro digest its good i didnt know how to respond i do remember there was a long pause he did not fill the pause he made me fill it i started explaining the story gaining confidence as i talked suddenly i realized that we were talking man to man not student to teacher or student to great artist we talked about the works of other writers particularly ron milner that big big bookis it really going to be pages malraux ellison sandburg whitman wright and dostoevsky i found he never talked about his work instead he gave me copies of his book including the autobiography the big sea autographing it in large bold green ink strokes especially for woody kingwith a hearty welcome to new york sincerely langston hughes harlem u s a april on my leaving he invited me down to the greenwich mews theaters sanctuary to see his play jerichojim crow in that brief visit langston hughes as he must have done with many other black artists opened himself and thus accepted me and listened to me i dont think i had talked to any artist as i talked to him yet the meeting was brief less than two hours but this is a long time for a busy writer within the next year we met often he invited me to other plays recommended me for parts i even read for his play prodigal son in october of i invited him to the opening of ron milners whos got his own at american place theater i was directing it as a workinprogress he was eager to see milners play he liked its construction but he felt that boy tim jr is awfully mad they better not put a white character on stage talking about negroes that way theyll get picketed our next meeting was in cleveland ohio at karamu playhouses golden anniversary i had been invited out by the theater department i didnt know langston would be there but i did know they would be doing his play simply heavenly as fate would have it we all stayed in the same hotel and since it was some distance from the playhouse we shared a cab langston malcolm boyd frederick oneal sidney lanier its something of an event to have langston back rowena jelliffe remarked on the opening panel langston hughes was karamus first playwright away back when it supported the gilpin players his play little mam received wide acclaim at the karamu playhouse on the panel discussion that included the above mentioned participants he did not put anyone down he praised leroi jones as one of the finest young writers in the theater he felt leroi jones was equal to the best of the th century poets at this point leroi was catching hell from the white press because of his black arts repertory theater while we were in cleveland talking about theater new york was in the midst of the now famous black out most of the new yorkers decided to remain an extra day in cleveland until it was over thus i had an opportunity to continue my dialogue with langston about poetry and the blues he knew of my interest in the blues we had certainly talked about it enough so much that i thought he was bored with it i told him what i wanted to do take his first book of poetry the weary blues adapt it to the stage using the prose and poetry from that first book to his last set it in harlem and add w c handys blues as an integral part since he and handy were saying the same things he liked the idea the possibilities he even gave me a few more copies of his work the idea would be to follow a young black american from a storefront church through the harlem streets and finally to the foreign soil of some distant land an american soldier protecting this country from his death the cleveland visit brought langston and i even closer if only for a fleeting moment now i would be able to adapt his work with his consent and his help for two months i worked off and on with him we agreed that no corrections would be made until i finished a first draft in march of i gave him a third and final draft of my adaptation of the weary blues he made large bold corrections and additions in the perennial green ink and returned it to me in april i went to his home again to pick it up you did it he said yes it took a lot of research i said man you got work in schomburg nobody ever heard of since i wanted to use something from the old mercury and opportunity magazines i didnt want you to use any piece that was dated thats the only thing i was afraid of he said people find the skeletons in your closet they dont understand they get uptight i knew exactly what he meant i had been tempted to adapt a huge fulllength play between the countee cullens library and the schomburg collection i compiled enough material for a dozen full length plays when i started cutting material from the scottsboro boys as it appeared in theater news a piece that was good and fitted weary but outdated i knew i had found a spine for the play agitprop theater of the thirties did not fit the theme we had set for the weary blues he gave me his corrected copy of the weary blues with it was seven new poems that he felt should be included plus a new play mother and child i directed it at the american place theater about a month later while he was in dakar he had marked the script appropriately large green arrows indicated where the new additions should be placed then it was off to dakar for the first world festival of negro art for langston he sent me a post card then in august he called to let me know he was back in new york for a minute whats happening with weary blues good news we have a production at the lincoln center museum and library series sponsored by equity library theatre the weary blues opened at the lincoln center in october of for a limited engagement it was packed every night langston was there almost every night he would give a little chuckle every night because i had mississippi john hurts got the blues and cant be satisfied at full volume to put the audience in the right mood before the play he brought a lot of black guests he also helped cast the play by securing the services of miss theresa merritt i remember after the performance the actor robert hooks invited us to his apartment for drinks it was a lively evening and as i remember it langston only stayed a minute but he did want to come by to tell all the young performers how much he enjoyed the play and the direction in which we had taken his prose and poetry he was especially pleased with eleo pomares beautiful junkie dance and norman bushs preacher and cliff fraziers hustler it was a strange evening after langston left we spent the remainder of the evening quoting and reciting his poetry you see langstons leaving never meant that he was gone he always left something behind for the black people he was always busy he had a lot of things going works not yet completed publishers after overdue manuscripts i always dreaded the thought of dropping in on him i would often wait until ronald milner came into new york so that we could both spring ideas which always meant a long and rewarding evening for me in december of his secretary novelist lindsey patterson called and told me that langston hughes was busy but that he wanted to compile a book of short stories for little brown and company did i have anything of course i sent him the story that he liked from negro digest beautiful light and black

and happy end ing it was one of those cold evenings threatening rain i dont remember exactly what we talked about i do know i had given a friend who was starting a magazine langstons private telephone number and i was afraid he would not approve of it he was annoyed about it i told him i had tried to reach him by phone to tell him he would get this call but that his researcher raoul abdul told me he was out he was with friends in the restaurant so we didnt talk much i thought he would never talk to me again i told him i would call him but he said he would be away until the middle of february and would call me when he returned he did call he wanted me to adapt his collection on jesse b semple to the stage are you interested drop by this evening old boy we have a producer for the fall

from the first chicago defender article to the final new york post article in addition he wanted to know if i could do it by june because the producers stella holt and francis durcker would have to read it he also told me they had alvin ailey set to direct it i remember telling him it would be ready by the middle of may after reading the material again i told him what i wanted the character to cover the time of action and of course the place harlem usa we both got excited talking about what should be done with simple it would be set in the night since the black ghetto usually comes alive after dark simple would be allowed to move freely in the chaos of existence he would desperately search for some order in this chaos always explaining searching hoping in langston hughess dialogue langston hughess poetry showing how white folk is the cause of a lot of inconvenience in my life how they steal piece of him how his moral and religious faith in others save him from total destruction i finished the play simples blues on april langston called me april from the hotel wellington at the time he was working on a project for harry belafonte he moved into the wellington because there he could get away from the phone it also gave him a chance to read the play immediately he liked the play but he felt it had too many characters it would cost over the producer had only for the two plays ask your mama and simples blues we had some cheese dip he and raoul abdul had wine with theirs and ordered me coke i suggested that he should eat better we laughed we felt we had a hit if stella holt

go there again and again and each time come away the better for it i was introduced to the amen corner in by owen dodson head of the drama department at howard university of washington d c ten years would pass before i would be privileged to amplify those luminous words upon the stage words capable of enlightening and encouraging us to bridge the gap of our crisis in black and white a crisis of understanding it would wait upon mrs maria cole to sponsor its broadway appearance in the distance between my first reading of the amen corner and its presentation prepared me to confront the challenge of its form and content after thirty years of work and study in the theatre i found it necessary to examine the causes of our social pathology symptoms of which seemed to be the subject matter without end in every medium of mass communication the time had come when the questions that itched my conscience could no longer be scratched away by reasoning why in a great society of many different cultures was there imaged no acknowledgement for the culture of the negro where were the demonstrations of the reality of integration in society why were there no black faces in commercials on tvdid not the black customer pay the same advertising tax why even in the great war epics were there no images of the black soldiers who gave their last full measure on those distant battlegrounds a couple of latins died there too where amid the many forms and techniques of stage screen tv communications was the negros point of view expressed concerning and promoting his own understanding and acceptance of himself questions concerning how to communicate respect of self and wellbeing prerequisites for respecting others it seemed to me that answers could and should be discovered and developed in the theatre vhich is the most personal the most intimate and the most direct means of communication i determined to produce the amen corner baldwin wiser than his knowledge had written the amen corner in a flush of inspiration which drove him past conventional forms of dramaturgy those forms and techniques have evolved from and are sustained by a conglomerate of european cultures which have historically done injustice to the negro baldwins play images the negro as he sees himselfnot consuming his genius protesting against invisibility or the myosis of others who are unable to see his total humanity this is the communication from an uncommon point of viewof a people who have known the range of wretchedness denial and abuse and who have hidden from these words and other labels of pain and hurt which have been their lot in the amen corner they are seen emerging digging themselves outachieving their realization of self inured to the disease hate but not victimized by it it is truly representative of a negro folk art serious and genuine as harold clurman has stated the presenting of the negro in his total humanity should concern the producers of theatre cinema and television communications and our critics as well the fundamental spiritual characteristic of a people cries out against suppressed into conformity with the standard a standard which has no criteria concerning the image of those characteristics manifested in their universal being the communication of the ethnic life of the negro is of profound significance at this time negroes are people very human beings who must integrate themselves through the acknowledgement of their own culture before they may be equally represented or integrated into a society of many different cultures the interchange of respect and selfrespect is the valuable aim and purpose of culture it is reciprocal and selfsustaining the interest increases with its being spent the amen comer is something of human value which becomes of greater human value as its distribution increases it is the meaning of compassion made manifest that seeing and feeling from anothers point of view their trials and triumphs as human beings searching to find the meaning of their existence in our human predicament there is no screaming or cursing or spitting back of hate the play is an affirmation of life an affirmation of value and an affirmation of the universality of man it is the negro from his point of view concerning and promoting his own understanding and acceptance of himself after the ultimate expression of

with leslie uggams in the broadway production hallelujah baby is a young man in his early thirties as with most actors he has found the road to success through a maze of personal sacrifices and multiple disappointments the daily struggle to achieve accompanied him as a young child in washingtons black ghetto in high school in acting school in philadelphia and finally into the theatrical world of new york critical acclaim and national recognition were gained by hooks for his performance in the offbroadway production of leroi jones dutchman in many theatre people befriended hooks during his successful rise as an actor and producer for example joseph papp founder and director of the new york shakespeare festival cast the talented actor at a crucial point in his development he was offered the role of king henry in the mobile theaters production of henry v which toured throughout new yorks five boroughs during the summer of this theater unit was created to supplement productions at the delacorte theater in central park the permanent home of the shakespeare festival since the traveling theater introduced livedrama to many people for the first time actors and audiences came together in a fresh stimulating manner rewarding to both only within recent years has the company employed a number of nonwhite actors reflecting the various ethnic groups in new york city as the popular theater the festival has a critical responsibility to the multiracial community that supports it through city taxes and small individual gifts integration on the basis of talent has consciously been pursued by producer papp and greatly influenced his decision to secure hooks for the title role of henry v he remarked in an interview i dont think he is a great actor but he is growing as an actor in many ways he fulfilled the obligations of the part with distinction and a great deal of dignity i think he brought something to the play the white actor would not bring his own understanding of power in his special way this did not distort the play but on the contrary illuminated certain aspects of it at the time for a young leading man with a fair command of the language and a certain amount of emotional reality he did very well even though he brought some colloquialisms which think are domestic they added something here and there this statement attempts to clarify papps choice of hooks for the role and to illuminate the positive values he felt were forthcoming because of this choice several program notes under the caption about the play offer some indication of interpretation the story of henry v is a universal story of a ragged sick and hungry army plunged into battle against fresh and overwhelmingly superior forces both in numbers and in arms the emotional impact of the play is to be found in the audiences identification with the underdog in this case the english soldiers and their king it ends with the summation although the play is a paean to the glory of england it transcends flagwaving and is transformed into a statement of triumph for all ragged men fighting everywhere against impossible odds as a practical man shakespeare is not above propagandizing the prowess of england as an emerging world power through the heroic achievements of a popular monarch but as a playwright he transcends the plot for a higher purpose which though romantic in essence bears universal significance a sense of mysterious power guiding and directing causes of righteousness many things happen in the pace of a production which an audience never notices things that are immediately apparent in a close reading or analysis of the text for instance many of the lines in shakespeares better plays have an articulated energy uncommon to contemporary drama the richness of imagery and the accelerated delivery of dialogue makes it almost impossible to assimilate the total experience at a single performance an additional problem confronting american audiences is the highly figurative language used in shakespearean drama a catalogue of meaning common to playwright spectator and actor is necessary for total comprehension and enjoyment of period drama being twentieth century audiences we must make adjustments to the emotional association and sensory impressions common to the theatrical language of the elizabethan age for greater comprehension and enjoyment we expect the playwright to provide us with experiences that are more dynamic more objective and more coherent than the contradictions of actual experience it is therefore the responsibility of a director to discover the authors intent and to recreate this ordered experience without augmentation or distortion this particular production placed emphasis upon elements of spectacle such as a handsomelymounted stage sumptuous costumes physically attractive actors exciting and realistic sound effects and movement patterns of choreographic dimensions comic scenes were broadly exaggerated yet imaginatively staged however they were out of balance in proportion to their significance within the context of the play such corollaries as language used and poetic imagery projected were often distorted henry as a man and henry as a metaphor lacked syntheses in this production critical comments of hooks performance are vague and contradictory a statement such as king henry was especially good combining fiery grace with an almost tragic sensitivity contradicts with mr hooks strains a little and wears a perpetuallyworriedangry look as if the cares of knighthood and the demands of the role were a little beyond him add to this statement it took courage on mr papps part to put a negro in the role of henry v and one has a collective opinion of the new york press it undoubtedly takes more than almost tragic sensitivity and courage to achieve a high degree of competent acting be it shakespeare or shaw of particular interest to me was the performance of ellen holly as well as that of robert hooks she had been cast in the role of the princess of france and displayed the type of wit and style demanded by her high comic role hooks as henry was not totally convincing as the mature and farsighted statesman a seasoned warrior a dedicated religious man speeches of lyric quality were within hooks technical and emotional range when the heroic language became intense and saturated with emotion he sounded like a sophomore playing hamlet and badly the appearance of this black performer in a major shakespearean role seems to offend john simon drama critic of the hudson review papps casting policy is attributed to laudable integrational zeal and hooks is criticized not for artistic competence but because a black monarch supposedly negates the lifelikeness of the play papp comments whenever you do a classic you recreate life in the terms that now exist both politically and socially if you try to reproduce a play the way it was done originally it becomes a museum piece you have to draw from what exists what exists in new york and all throughout the world are different colored people and you cant deny their existence these two men agree on an essential point that an additional comment is made when a black actor confronts an audience in a role regarded traditionally as white papp feels that such an innovation allows an audience to watch the production in a more interesting manner if the actor is talented harold dewindt who stage managed the production observed negative reactions on the part of some white spectators to the initial appearance of hooks as henry these reactions obviously stemmed from psychological associations of having previously seen or certainly imagining only a white actor in the role when an initial reaction becomes a psychological hangup it is impossible for some spectators and evidently some critics to witness a play without imposing subjective feelings attitudes and perceptions upon it indiscriminately an individual can iimit and in some cases destroy an art experience by applying predetermined political and social references upon a play and upon performers who exist momentarily within the play historically henry v was an english monarch of the blood he was neither black nor yellow shakespeare as playwright has created a character who functions as man and metaphor fact and fiction and the play attempts to define mans basic instincts for domination conquest and survival integrated casting may perhaps work better in plays that are less historical or symbolic it may be that more sophistication is essential for spectators to be able to recognize the universality of human problems while disregarding color certainly the theme of sixteenth century english selfdetermination and nationalism alluded to by shakespeare is the same as that expressed by many contemporary black dramatists who are attempting to define the world in their own terms robert hooks as actor producer and black man is committed to the black arts movement which seeks a solution to the schism that exists between art and action in our society the unequivocal decision that ultimately faces every black artist is whether it is more rewarding to move delight and instruct black people in an allblack theater or whether it is better to accept the limited types of roles offered in the commercial theater and neglect black cultural expression hooks reached a decision four years ago with the creation of a group theater workshop that he cofounded with barbara ann teer he still considers this project to be his greatest achievement the group began with seven talented young blacks seriously interested in acting hooks modest manhattan apartment served as a studio during this early period but rapidly became too small as the group enlarged today the group theater has expanded to become the negro ensemble company with its own playwrights directors and choreographers a grant of from the ford foundation was largely responsible for this rapid growth and a recent gift of from the same foundation gives some indication of the success this theater has enjoyed in its short history hooks chose the framework of black theater in which to express his creative energies because it attempts to resolve the antithesis between the aspirations of art and the actions of men it is at the funcitonal level between art and action that drama is vita and relative whether white american producers directors and audiences can interact with the complexities of human experience that unfold through the dramatic process is highly questionable if they are unwilling or unable to extend themselves beyond considerations of color and there is strong negative indication that they cannot then black artists must separate themselves completely from an institution that in theory and practice denies restricts and destroys black creative energy and selfdetermination through l t ward the his four characters in the baptism leroi jones dramatizes a dichotomy in attitudes tochurch among black people conservative acceptance is reflected in the minister and the old woman militant rejection is embodied in the homosexual and the boy the sacrosanct yet worldly minister filthy with success epitomizes the status quo of low income black churches he plays his role of spiritual leader and soul saver seriously so seriously in fact that his potential as a community leader is obviated myopically he focuses on the minute activities of his congregation becoming little more than an expert voyeur and singer of banalities he confides to the homosexual i smell your lovers and pray that you be redeemed i bathe them in my holy water and they are as baptized children and when the old woman swoons in a semierotic state he pronounces solemnly she has swooned in the service of the lord the hypocrisy of the minister is revealed in his dress and his high appraisal of himself the homosexual comments enviously and contemptuously you are filthy with success you religious motherfucker who may i ask is your tailor in the midst of a slow dance the minister dedares with candid egoism i fuck no one who does not claim to love me you the homosexual are less selective in the minister also is a reflection of the matriarchal inclination of black lowincome churches despite his egotism which is somewhat juvenile he accepts the directions of the old woman without reservation both when she decides that the boy is christ and later when she decides that the boy should be killed for lying the dominance of the old woman augmented by a chorus of young sleek village types of women dramatizes the strong appeal the black church has for black women in it are found many emotional outlets and a sense of control which is psychologically gratifying significantly the energy of the old woman is concentrated in a fierce righteousness an emotioncharged vindictive will to serve god in a fervent expression of this will she cries out i cast the stone because of your sons virtue to root the sinners out make a list lord make a list of them and ill root them out and cast them in the pit it is she who denounces the boy and causes him to seek baptism and later it is she who demands his death when the boy asks forgiveness she screams blasphemer you spilled your seed in prayer you sacrificed these vestals to your lust you should die die and the women in a choral response call upon god may our true husbandtobe castrate you with his lightning liar devil these words of the chorus raise another aspect of the black churchbehind the hysterical domineering woman hovers the shadow of the black mans failures and the trauma of the separated black family lacking a secular husband the black woman waits and trusts in her husbandtobe and invests in his sexual potency he thus becomes the big stroker of the universe who popped us in those various hallways of love but the feverish eroticorighteousness of the church is not sufficient to hide the materialistic influences which have pervaded it these influences are cuttingly commented on by the homosexual who represents a free thinking intellectual point of view christianity as a doctrine of love is defunct in white america overruled by the protestant ethic consequently the militant thinker rejects the church and turns to the political arena the homosexual therefore demands let it be politics or shut up and when he learns that the boy is christ he asks lemme see you turn this place into the white house or something cool like that aware that the village girls supposedly escapees from a materialistic hell pray for a new doll and a monopoly set and an fm radio and a picture of monk the homosexual tells them devout citizens stop it go home to your radios he also makes several references to sports suggesting that in white america and parts of negro america the world series is taken more seriously than the sermon on the mount with tongue in cheek he gives himself pseudohonors by proclaiming i be willie mays of the queers by his references to sports the homosexual expresses his consciousness of the pastashumiliation for the black man he chides the old woman for singing that old nigger song and delcares that he will not be limited to tiny nigger songs paradoxically the homosexual is the freest most loving of jones characters he only tries to save the boy and he alone possesses a true joie de vivre as he says the pride of life is life and flesh must make its move i am the sinister lover of love the mysterious villain of thought i love all things as they are issued from you know who god if anyone in the play has soul it is the homosexual it seems that jones is indicating christianity as a debaser and distorter of the black mans psyche an impediment to black unity and black understanding and this indictment reaches a climax in the character of the boy after an initial denial the boy finally reveals that he is christ by then the woman and her followers and the minister are bent on sacrificing the youth his pleas for understanding are totally disregarded as the group whips itself into a righteous frenzy chanting we must cleanse ourselves you must be sacirficed at this point christ negates his mission by taking arms a long silver sword he will not be a savior of those who possess no charity no humanity no love wielding his sword in selfdefense and anger he shouts there will be no second crucifixion the attitude of jones christ is symbolic of the new direction in black thought and feeling the name is black_power the message is there will be no second enslavement whereas in the baptism one sees the turning point of a people assuming that christs rejection of his mission represents the black mans rejection of nonviolence in the toilet a personal dilemma is presented ray foots an intelligent sensitive young black man finds himself caught between the demands of his black friends who subscribe to a code of violence and those of his white friends who relate to one another in more socially accepted ways the setting of the play has a sinister symbolism the high school latrine is described by playwright jones as a large bare toilet built of gray rough cement there are urinals along one wall and a partition separating them from the toilet must resemble the impersonal ugliness of a school toilet or a latrine of some institution a few rolls of toilet paper are spread out on the floor wet through the actors should give the impression frequently that the place smells this place of course is really the nether world of the american society it is one of the sewer system and the city dump necessary but impolite to mention it is the underside of our crisp cheerful bureaucratic fagade and the assumption is that here if anywhere one can relate to another without the mask the plot is simple rays black friends have discovered a love letter written to him by one of his white acquaintances ray has scheduled a meeting in the latrine in which with the blacks as spectators he will beat the white boy james karolis and save his honor when the play opens a few of the spectators are waiting in the latrine for foots to bring karolis in evidently class is in session and they are waiting for it to end jones dramatizes the code of violence of these young men by showing how they speak to one another that is constant signifying on each others mothers and girl friends and how they express themselves kinesthetically shoving boxing wrestling pretending to play basketball together fearlessness and agility are prized ora the loudest crudest and least sensitive of them often brags about how fast he can run and how well he can crush another cat they all feel disdain for karolis because he is slightly built and eventually ora jumps another white boy donald farrell one feels simply because he appears so vulnerable when foots enters karolis has already been brought in by two boys his condition is rather pathetic karolis head is hanging and he is crying softly and blood is on his shirt and face although he hides it foots reaction is one of horror and disgust he conceals his feelings by continuing to play a gruff role and by using the language his black friends expect of him his first question is what the hell you hit him with ora a goddamn train foots reveals his difficult position to the audience when he explains why he is late for the confrontation that goddamn van ness had me in his office he said im a credit to my race he said im smartasawhip and should help him to keep all you unsavory elements in line the audience must assume that foots is an aboveaverage student who gets on in the white world of the high school as well as he does in the black cunningly however he laughs as he mentions the principals words and even imitates him so that it will appear that he takes none of the white mans premises to heart karolis condition causes foots to hesitate he had not anticipated the extent of the violence his friends were ready to indulge in foots tries to squeeze out of the situation by saying he cant beat anyone who is already sprawled on the floor but at this point farrell white makes the mistake of commending foots for his decision by saying i sure am glad somebodys got some sense here at this foots gets angry and demands that farrell leave farrell then wants to know what is so important that foots has to revenge himself on an already defeated person then one of the blacks laughingly tells farrell about the letter the response is an interesting one a letter oh ray come on why dont you come off it this suggests that foots has revealed something about himself to the whites which the blacks were unaware of it is a subtle hint which is missed by the boys in their efforts to get rid of farrell after farrells departure karolis staggers to his feet insisting on going on with the fight to everyones amazement he gets the best of foots and when it seems that karolis is going too far ora and the rest of the crowd jump in to aid their man karolis is beaten and left alone on the floor during the fight with foots karolis reveals everything he admits sending the note you have to fight me i sent you a note remember that note saying i loved you the note saying you were beautiful not only did he send the note foots himself responded to karolis advances ill fight you right here in this same place where you said your name was ray ray you said your name was you said ray you put your hand on me and said ray and finally as he is being punched in the face karolis manages to say no no his name is ray not foots i love somebody you dont even know this last statement by karolis is the theme of the play when he says i love somebody you dont even know he is referring to a sexual aspect of rays personality but i think it can be taken in a racial context also foots dilemma is the dilemma of the integrationist to what extent do you profess and abide by the mores of your socalled subculture and to what extent do you accept the dictates of the suprasociety which is also a white society at one time one would have said that foots was trying to rise above a subnormal perverted culture today we know that violence is a legitimate way of life for those who have been violated psychologically economically socially and physically in the conclusion foots has not resolved his dilemma he has remained hostile to karolis before his friends but after they leave he returns and stares at karolis body for a second looks quickly over his shoulder then runs and kneels before the body weeping and cradling the head in his arms n his first book the crisis of the negro intellectual harold cruse critically examined the intellectual history of the afroamerican in the twentieth century it is not at all surprising then that the collected essays published three years later than originally intended under the title rebellion or revolution morrow now provide us with the recorded intellectual history of one black american harold w cruse all but two of these essays have been published previously over a sixteenyear period beginning with the daily worker in through studies on the left liberator presence africaine the new leader and from les temps moderne an essay printed in english for the first time in he reviewed the movie king solomons mines pointing out its exploitative and imperialistic significance the early cruse essays typical of a young writer contained a naivete in style and tone it seems that since that time cruse has given considerable thought to marxism as practiced by blacks and whites alike in their treatment of the black mans struggle for selfdetermination in the united states the path from my very first articles to the crisis turned out to be a road years long but i didnt know that then in fact i had no idea where i was headed but as each year went by i saw the road leading deeper into a peculiar kind of american cultural sickness hence in response to julian mayfields criticism cruse is indeed engaged in an ideological crusade but not for the sake of egotistical satisfaction these articles and essays were all derived from my great need to interpret what i perceived as a unique interplay of political economic and cultural factors at work behind the various freedomseeking fronts of the black movement factors which needed what camus once called a theoretical frame in devoting all these years to the task of what i judge to be a rational inquiry into certain disputed facts of our reality i persevere in the hope that i have helped to make the future of the arts more relevant and secure i believe that the only antidote to the present irrational thrust toward social oblivion is more rationality whether one agrees or disagrees with cruse is not the concern of this review rebellion or revolution is testimony to the evaluations set forth in the crisis a book so controversial and challenging that it has been the subject of conferences and symposia and has solidified friendships among us even while opening the closet doors but cruse would prefer that we evaluate his ideas judgments and dialectical method instead of himself the cruse approach is essentially marxist by an afroamericans cultural views indicated in its tone that the writer was certain of his commitment to a cultural rehabilitation in the outlook of black america by the marxian dialecticism and cruses frustration is much more noticeable as his prose assumed a clarity often tempered by a sharp wit as of early the dialectical process literally had jelled and was second nature to his perceptions and their analyses cruses technique involves a review in historical perspective of black intellectuals and their respective ideas and tendencies juxtaposing them against each other observing their opposites and similarities and perceiving them as historical antecedents to the contemporary scene the cruse approach has been influenced not only by marx but also more or less by lenin stalin eduard bernstein camus and c wright mills although cruse would claim none of these as a particular intellectual godfather in his approach he has evaluated what he calls the contemporary programmatic crisis through a systematic treatment of socialistic theories and tendencies which he clearly explains despite entertaining seemingly contradictory principles besides the introduction the essay behind the black_power slogan is the other previously unpublished commentary it was originally prepared for and subsequently rejected by the socialist scholars conference of and its point of departure is the uncertainties of the biack power conference in newark during the summer of the same year cruse by the way has had an ideological war with white marxists and communists particularly with the noted authority on black history herbert aptheker and the younger selfacclaimed jazz authority frank kofsky white marxists cannot see blacks as a nation and their europeanbased theories are totally irrelevant to the american situation yet it is the black marxists whom cruse feels are the most irrelevant political animals of our times who paradoxically are the only blacks who have any firm theoretically oriented longrange commitment to socialism the wilkinses youngs kings sncc core the black_powerites the urban guerrillas etcnone of these has any longrange commitment to socialism the heart of cruses uneasiness is that he perceives uncertainty in the meaning of black peoples use of the term black_power in that the black movement suffers from historical discontinuity the resolutions of that particular conference show a revolutionary posture which is aimed synopsis linda is the secondyoungest in a household of three generations of women her mother alma is defeated at early middle age having twice in her life sought happiness with men who fathered her three children and having lost lindas grandmother is a woman of stronger fiber but bitter long separated from her own husband almas father and suspicious of all men because of her own experiences and the experiences of her daughter lindas grandfather also is a defeated man like so many black men of his generation who turned to drink because of the pressures in the white world which would not let him live and function as a man linda is in love with donald a bright young man who wants to be a writer and she spends much of her time at home fantasizing about donald and their future together linda is teased and tormented by her older cousin nora and by the neverending cynicism of her grandmother linda wants to believe in donald she wants to believe that he can overcome the traps which destroyed her grandfather and which forced her own father to abandon her mother in the two scenes which precede this excerpt from the long oneact play linda has been cleaning the house in anticipation of donalds visit at the same time arguing with her cousin and grandmother and daydreaming mr milner has titled his play the warning a theme for linda it is a oneact play in four scenes two of which are published on these pages performance of the excerpt in any manner is expressly forbidden without permission from mr milner or his agent james forman in bringing to light the story of sammy younge sammyyounge jr grove press undertook a task which for some time now has gone begging seemingly because of a marked indifference on the part of those who are involved in what has been loosely labeled the movement forman through the medium of print has sought to do what many in the socalled vanguard of the black liberation struggle have only talked about and that is to pay homage to the movements dead by keeping alive their memory as a consequence what emerges in this work is a very profound and moving political biography which is in fact one of the first of its kind to appear in the literary genre of the as yet embryonic black liberation movement in america the prime significance of formans book lies not in the notoriety of its subject character the usual motive behind the writing of most definitive biographies but rather in the contemporary import of the political message in its content the story of sammy younge is at once both a chronicle of the developing roots of todays radical awareness exhibited by the black college student and an insightful look at the inner political trends which have shaped the newfound outlook of snccan outlook which in little more than two years has caused sncc to view itself as a human rather than civil_rights organization dedicated as such to third world liberation and black_power the book for the most part is constructed around a series of interviews and conversations gathered by forman and an ad hoc committee set up to publish sammy younge sammy younges parents along with close friends and associates which include such notables as stokely carmichael and willie ricks have combined here to convey their impressions and feelings of sammy and the movement as it developed around tuskegee sammys home perhaps the singular most distinguishing feature of the book is the refreshing attempt forman has made to reveal sammys personality too often in similar works there is a serious drawback in the manner in which a characters personal life style is illuminated many figures emerge simply as a set of cold descriptions to be considered for the moment by the reader and later forgotten sammy younge on the contrary here can be seen for what he was a sensitive black man who experienced and felt all the hurts and joys as well as inner conflicts over girls school and society incidental to an average life it is later related how sammy unable to resolve the many contradictions that daily face every black person living in racist america sought outlet for his tensions and frustrations in drink and fast cars nonetheless sammy although only years old and living with one kidney already had deeply involved himself in political organizing and defense of the black community this at a time when most black people were busy cursing malcolm_x for advocating independent political struggle and black selfdefense as stokely remarked sammy just before he was murdered was seriously considering the formation of a black_panther party in his home county sammy continued to move along this line despite the many doubts and misgivings that had begun to grow in his mind over his ability to continue to function in the movement however as is made clear it was too late for sammy to turn back for he had already become a marked man bad nigger in the eyes of tuskegees white and black which too had a vested interest in the maintenance of order and stability establishment from this point it was only a matter of time before the inevitable happened according to forman the murder of sammy younge by a white gas station owner and the subsequent acquittal by an allwhite jury momentarily had a sobering effect on tuskegees black bourgeoisie it served to bring them to the realization that what happened to sammy could just as easily have happened to them for it is a welltested truism by now that no matter how much money or power a black man in america has hes still a nigger forman with this view has fittingly chosen to title the chapter that deals with sammys actual murderthe death of a myth sammys death also had an effect on the student community at tuskegee university it forced many black students there for the first time to reevaluate some of the goals and ideals of the university itself in fact a large number of the black students there who had been hitherto uninterested in anything other than getting the piece of paper and moving on to the american promise of money and status themselves became committed to the liberation struggle a struggle which in the neardecade since four black students from north carolina a and t college sat down at a segregated lunch counter in greensboro in has steadily progressed in scope today of course the demand is no longer the narrowly defined objective of integration as san francisco state college and columbia university have shown black students are demanding that the university and thereby american society since the university is in reality only a microcosmic extension of this society be transformed into a genuinely free institution for all rather than simply an academic brainwashing factory sammy younge who was described by forman as the first black student to die in the black liberation movement then represents in a very real sense every black student in america in the end therefore on the strength of sammys commitment and vitality to the freedom of black people rests the strength of formans bookearl ofari in the past two years several welldocumented soberly approached books have been published which tell how minorities in general and how black people in particular are routinely brutalized by the nations police of course for black people mexicanamericans and puerto ricans there is nothing new or revealing in these books the books are designed for the enlightenment of the white reading publicor for that segment of it which does not automatically approve whatever the police do against black people or hippies or those with the wrong color or ethnic background the big blue line coward mccann by ed gray was one of the first of these books published long before the chicago confrontation of august when the bullyboys of mayor richard daley demonstrated for the whole world the kind of viciousness of which they are capable mr grays report dealt not only with police violence against people in the streets but also with the collusion between the policemen and the courts and the police practice of beating up whomever offends them and then charging the victim with resisting arrest both police power pantheon by paul chevigny and the people and the police mcgrawhill by algernon d black cover much the same ground as the big blue line but with added dimensions of the three books police power is probably the most direct and the most infuriating mr chevigny a staff attorney for the new york civil liberties union writes out of firsthand experience his book which has the subtitle police abuses in new york city grew out of two years or investigation of cases involving the police and ordinary people most of them black and puerto ricans all thiee books deal in various degrees with the police personality the mental bent and psychological hangups which too often transform men entrusted with maintaining lawandorder into mere brutes with guns and nightsticks the documentation speaks for itself mr black by the way was chairman of the new york civilian complaint review board which the politically powerful new york p ironically less than a year after william styron defiled black history with confessions of nat turner frank yerby has published a novel which will test the objectivity and the sincerity of those critics who defending styron proclaimed an authors license to interpret the personality and the culture of historical figures of a different race judas my brother dial yerbys twentysecond novel tells the story of a jewish youth sensitized and alienated by his belief that he is illegitimate blessed with a hypnotically forceful personality wealthy friends and credulous audiences he accomplishes miracles in addition to those which biographers invent for him after persuading himself that god has appointed him to exemplify righteousness as a sacrificial lamb he suicidally provokes hebrew and roman authorities into executing him when they finally do he dies in despair believing that god has slaughtered him this of course is the story of the carpenters son yeshua ha notzri known to contemporary americans as jesus of nazareth i suspect that this novel will disappoint the yerby enthusiasts who have not already been dissuaded by the cost of his recent works some may be shocked by the obviously controversial theme especially since yerby in his first years of glory an nounced that a novelist had neither responsibility nor right to meddle with the prejudices of his readers other enthusiasts may be disappointed by the diminution of sex and by the limited appeal to sadismonly one gang rape in pages the reduced quantity however does not lower the intensity in fact yerby exceeds his earlier horrors when he describes the suicide of a prostitute who rips herself open from the navel to the womb and when he recounts in tortuous detail the process of death by crucifixion judged according to literary criteria judas my brother is not exceptional even for yerby the main plot is too familiar it is the story of the loves and other adventures of nathan bar yehudah who marries yeshuas younger sister yerby writes sentences as crudely as usual and his penchant for interpolating foreign terms continues to be annoying the minor plot is more unified than usual only because the gospels furnished yerby with a tightly knit wellconstructed outline nevertheless although he may disappoint enthusiasts and literary purists yerby has developed his most significant themean interpretation of the greatest story ever told troubled by the discrepancies and contradictions which are obvious to anyone who compares the four gospels yerby searched through other historical materialsespecially the antiquities of josephus visited the original locations studied aramic and hebrew and familiarized himself with hebrew ritual in order to present an accurate account he has not always succeeded for example in an unnecessary effort to explain each miracle he occasionally has resorted to melodramatic contrivances more absurd than any propagandists romancer could have devised furthermore he sometimes annoys by thrusting his fictional characters into some of the more familiar incidents of the new testament one is hardly prepared for the reappearance of a fictitious prostitute as the woman whom yeshua or jesus saves from execution by stoning occasionally yerby arbitrarily discounts familiar stories for example he ridicules the legendary flight into egypt by advising credulous readers to ask miriam mary whether she knows anything about that country nevertheless serious consideration must be given to much of the material which yerby has documented with pages of footnotes for example he has argued persuasively that jesus was not born in bethlehem because at the supposed time of his birth there was no census which would have compelled joseph to go there yerbys attitude towards the different gospels diverges from scholarly tradition he has paid little attention to the estimate that mark was probably the earliest ignoring the possibility that matthew was written by a churchman concerned with establishing ritual and justifying the legend he dismisses matthew as a fool to be valued only for his exact transcriptions of the words of jesus he has drawn heavily on luke who admitted that he was merely retelling what was popular tradition among later christians and even though he has borrowed material from john yerby has served humanity by proving repeatedly that john was a remarkably imaginative inventive and skillful storyteller who knew little about hebrews and less about palestine probably the section deserving the most intensive study is yerbys account of the last supper the trial and the crucifixion if his explanation of the disappearance of the body from the tomb disappoints those who believe in miracles it is at least valuable in pointing up what is clear in the gospelsthe fact that for a significant period of time no one guards the tomb this sketchy summary may suggest that frank yerby has gleefully written sacrilege to the contrary yerby actually seems to love mary and jesusas human beings not as gods as he says he has nothing to report about the virgin mary for his subject is the human miriam mary who solves first the problem of persuading her husband that he fathered their eldest son and later as a widow solves the problem of rearing a family which includes an itinerant son who damages the familys reputation by wandering around the countryside preaching and continually provoking authorities yerby also admires and pities yeshua a phenomenal personality destined to become an ironically tragic figure because in his name men persecute by violence to enforce the lesson of love and mercy which he taught in the sermon on the mount yerby even sympathizes with lovestricken gullible judas who receives no money for his betrayal and who lives to old age burdened with the memory of that betrayal yerby does not condemn the human beings who suffered the sorrows that shaped the legend instead he attacks the pauline myth which rooted in pagan tradition has been used for almost years to delude and destroy godly men this book then climaxes the theme which he formed in the saracen blade and developed further in an odor of sanctity although some of yerbys interpretations may be questioned his book should stimulate a reader to question the myth and to seek his own answers judas my brother should be read by everyone who professes to be a christian for a change a yerby novel is worth darwin t turner he raw pearl harcourt brace world isnt necessarily the jewel it could be the story of the life of pearl bailey and if it were you may not go completely wrong if you possessed it miss bailey did us all a great service by writing the book herself she is no writer but she is a rather fabulous person who has tried to honestly evaluate her life as she has seen it over some years negro autobiographies are always frustrating because we lead frustrating lives unless we or someone else fictionalize there is always going to be a certain level of drag repetition and rationalization because even the most successful of us always carry a sign on our backs saying for a negro which is of course a circumvention of the level of our success this frustration and rationalization shows clearly in miss baileys autobiography it could not be that she was just talented she must surely have beenstill be aware of many people who are as talented as she but not nearly so successfulher own brother the one and only bill bailey is one exampleyet she made it and they didnt she ascribes her success to faith in god and while we would never quarrel with her faith we are aware that many people who are just as talented have just as much faith and still are not as successful because the society in which we live is built on limited demand we recognize that miss bailey was as aggressive as all hell and pulled no punches climbing to the top she was hesitant to put it that way she was afraid of her father competitive with her brother and abused by her first husband we could conclude that with the exception of don redmond she had negative relationships with black men her subsequent happiness with louis bellson must have had some relationship to that an autobiography is by definition limited to the view of the person writing it yet we wish she had given a little more thought as to just why her relationships were as they were she appears to love her children and only two other people louis and peetney redmond peetney is her lifelong friend and seeing the genuine affection that miss bailey holds for her is necessary to an understanding of the pearl but a climb to the top isnt necessarily geared to finding and making friends miss bailey has a delightful way of climbing over someone then saying but i think they have respect for me everybody has respect for a conquerorthey won didnt they but not affection miss bailey has peppered her book with little poems by friends thoughts she has jotted in poetic form and prayers she has loved her famous stage asides appear also although on stage they are witty while in written form they have a tendency to border on moralisms which are more sickly than cute but the raw pearl has something to offer and if one has a determination to read it one may find it quite interesting the most explanatory statement in the book isnt a comment at all but a picture next to page with the word pappa that says a whole lot about the pearl and may possibly relate to its rawness nikki giovanni the jewelers eye g p putnams sons a collection of pieces by william f buckley jr is subtitled a book of irresistible political reflections to the white liberal american mentality buckley is indeed irresistible perhaps owing to among other things the way in which he fills the white style vacuum they call him charming moreover unlike the typical conservative buckley meets the qualifications of the liberal establishment having read all of their literature and is respected by them as an intelligent man thus buckleys rejection of the liberals cannot be dismissed by them as crude as in the case of the great masses of their countrymen but is instead curious and no matter that he never tires of chastizing them buckley presumably is as content as the liberals with the arrangement if for no other reason than that his metaphors would be wasted on a conservative audience reading buckley now and then occasionally viewing him in debate one might find oneself at once outraged by his audacity and yet a victim of his wit sarcasm and endless syllabizing one might in fact come to think of him as nothing more than the most articulate spokesman for the other argument rather than an evil man buckley seducing weaklings on tv may perhaps be more entertaining than the commercials or the corny white actions on other channels however in the course of reading an entire book of his opinion there is little that would distract one from his worldviewa view of the universe that excludes all but affluent white westerners from the family of man buckleys is a holy war no less fanatic than the crusades in which anyone who would shudder at the thought of a world ruled by the strategic air command it is already a fact is beyond god was it karl barth who said that anticommunism as a doctrine is as dangerous as communism understatement scolding schlesinger fulbright and other harmless liberals who are distinguished from him more as a matter of aesthetics than ethics as william stringfellow once noted concerning the difference between northern and southern white men buckley might leave the impression of a con man but deadly buckley more a madman surfaces when the people under attack are sartre susan sontag stauchton lynd and others who are not satisfied to dismiss the crimes of the west as something apart from its cultural legacy one neednt labor over the chasm between buckleys point of view and the interests of black people it is as though one has been asked by the chief of police in a mississippi hamlet what are you doing here at the conclusion of a piece on the newark rebellion buckley advises a little hard labor on history and morality and the causes of the rise of civilizations and the fall of civilizations bill buckley suffering from moral infancy thinks himself a civilized man but the future of civilization is of course not dependent on eloquence and money alone the jewelers eye as a reflection of its author is unimaginative and depthless leaving one not allured but in the very worst sense boreddavid llorens even since the publicae tion of the report of js the presidents commission on the causes of civil disorders racism and racist increasingly frequent and justified use while the usage of these two terms may have a cathartic effect on the oppressed the terms have seen black american they may also serve to take the place of critical thinking human beings seem to prefer to name things rather than to think about them and consequently to talk about things rather than to do something about them effective action depends on accurate knowledge about phenomena however and not on descriptive labelling since the fundamental issue facing black americans today is survival in its most literal sense namecalling activities are best left to children and to enemies the hour is too late and the situation too critical for honkybaiting necessary as such activity might have been in the past what then are the priorities related to survival first and most important black americans must learn to reorient their thinking from what can be termed dependency analysis of their situation to an interdependency analysis of it for example to describe low educational achievement among black children as the result of dependent on racism is to engage in dependency or cause and effect analysis a better explanation one more attune to modern scientific thinking is to describe such phenomena as not only the result of one or more phenomena but also as the cause of these same phenomena thus it is just as meaningful to talk about low educational achievement as the cause of racism as to describe it as an effect the meaning of this statement will be made clearer i hope in the subsequent paragraphs white largely liberal thinking has brainwashed us all into believing this for example if education is increased income will increase and if income is increased better housing will ensue etc such thinking is strongly dependencyoriented and while it lends itself neatly to prepackaged programs to help the disadvantaged it cannot deal with social reality the fact of the matter is that the problems facing black americans are infinitely more complex and are related to systemic social forces and not due to a group of elements which operate independently of each other to adequately deal with these forces necessitates a radical break with traditional modes of thinking most white people are incapable of making this break it is becoming increasingly clear that the countrys last source of originality as well as creativity lies within the black community it is necessary for black americans to examine american society as a system a social system can be defined as a group of people in interaction with each other any social system can be described in terms of its subsystems and components the city of philadelphia can for example be described as a social system subsystems of the system might include the various sections such as north philly west philly etc a component of the north philly subsystem might be a particular street or neighborhood there are several facts to recognize in the analysis of social systems a systems are dynamic ie they change through time b they operate according to certain rules and c a change in one element of the system has an effect on the totality of the system social systems operate by means of communication the communication of information is the social cement of all human societies information includes much more than just newspaper or television content however information is anything which people or systems use to make decisions these decisions may range in triviality from what tie shall i wear to what is the most feasible way to move large numbers of black people into concentration camps information is the crucial type of input into a social system in much the same way as electricity is a crucial type of input into a stereo or hifi system once a system has some source of input it transforms this input in such a way as to produce a certain output the output of a stereo system is music the output of many social systems are certain actions which people transform the information input into outputs ie who the decisionmakers are depends on the system in question in a typical school for example a principal may produce the outputs these outputs may take the form of firing of certain teachers the input might be the hiring of others thus it is possible to conceive of people eg teachers as constituting information the hiring of certain teachers makes it possible to fire others and viceversa people attempt to change systems when they perceive the outputs of the system to be detrimental to their interests to most black people in america the outputs of relevant systems are detrimental bad housing bad business prac tices bad schooling bad press treatment bad jobs etc are all outputs of specific social subsystems it is not surprising that the focal point of demonstrations and insurrections has been on these outputs nor is it surprising that such activities have failed the reason that they fail is that in all systems there is a direct relationship between inputs and outputs and it is useless to focus on one set of factors while ignoring the other in other words there is feedback see diagram between information outputs and information inputs ie the effects of certain decisions has subsequent on the type of information input into the system thus to return to statements made earlier the effect of racism low educational achievement is also the cause of racism racism is thus a system input the relationship between inputs and outputs is not a onetoone relationship ie if we know what went into a system in the way of information we still could not be exactly sure what would come out in the way of actions the inputs into a system are transformed or worked upon in the production of specific outputs these transformation activities are performed according to certain implicit and explicit rules the explicit rules are usually written in the form of charters bylaws constitutions etc an explicit rule in a school system for example might be as follows all students must pass fourth grade reading test x before promotion to the fifth grade on the national level an explicit rule is that no one should be deprived of the right to vote because of race religion or national origin in most social systems however explicit rules are less operative than are the implicit ones implicit transformation rules are those cultural beliefs values and sentiments which guide most human behavior thus while many white people will give lip service to the explicit rule stating all men to be equal they will operate under the implicit rule that black men are not equal to white men whatever set of rules a system or a systems decisionmaker operates under they play a part in determining the outputs of that system thus to transform a system it is necessary to not only change the inputs and outputs of a system but to also change the rules governing the operation of the total system this latter change is the most difficult of all for it involves convincing people black and white who believe the world is flat that they are fundamentally wrong such perceptions of reality are rarely changed short of some kind of revolution thus to the extent that black people engaged in boycotts and other activities directed at system inputs we are involved in an economic revolution to the extent that activities are focused on system outputs we are involved in a political revolution and to the extent that we are engaged in changing the implicit rules governing system operations we are involved in a cultural revolution and as harold cruse has noted all three revolutions are mandatory racism is best defined as a cultural sentiment or belief regarding the inherent inferiority of nonwhites it is less an individual characteristic than it is a system or societal one there will always be racists but there need not always be racism systems differ with respect to the degree that they depend upon racism for their functioning virtually every social ss tem in the south would disintegrate if racism were to disappear overnight in the north however there are other sources of system input and racism is more of a reserve source in any case racism as a sentiment pervades the entire culture north and south east and west the differences occur in the uses to which it is put in terms of system functioning the function of boycotts is to cut existing sources of system input while most uses of the boycott have been in relation to systems which depend on money as a source of system input it should be clear from the discussion above that economic boycotts are but one of an infinite number of ways to prevent information flow when students at columbia university brought the system to a grinding halt they were engaged in input disruption it should be noted that all actions designed to cut off system input need not be violent the differences between a liberal a radical and a revolutionary can be defined in terms of the price each is willing to pay for the cutting off of information input into an illegitimate system people who refuse to pay taxes to join the army to pledge allegiance to a flag to vote to provide census information are all performing the same function viz they are refusing to supply input to the system if enough people perform these functions over a long enough period of time the system will disintegrate the question of tactics in the black liberation movement concerns these very issues the question of foreign intervention in the internal affairs t of underdeveloped countries has long been a bone of great contention but the question of what constitutes the underd development of a nation impresses a far greater influence on nat ure cf this intervention than is commonly understood given the natural disparities in economic existence in the modern world it is only to be expected that the large nations whose existence is to a great measure determined by their ability to ensure that development in the socalled underdeveloped nations proceeds at a pace dictated by the assurance of continued prosperity for themselves would view intervention in the internal affairs of the weaker nations as a primary objective on both political and economic grounds the reality of the present day standards of developed existence is that the white nations are the developed nations because the nonwhite nations are forced by circumstances of time and lack of technological breadth to supply the basic needs for their continuing prosperity this constant and regular outflow of basic property saps the nonwhite nations industrial and economic energy and produces an enormous disparity between the nations will to self determination and its ability to realize self determination taking the above generalities into consideration it is not hard to discern the need for and the advantages of a drive towards a greater unity of spirit that would give rise to an exchange of resources among the international groups that make up the underdeveloped world it is at this point that one should begin to examine the peculiar role that the afroamerican community has been forced into in this ideological breakdown of national interests the afroamerican community and by this i mean africans born and living in communities in all the americas exists within and supplies a large percentage of the labor force that produces export material in the american sector of the economic community of developed nations but the afroamerican has never beenand will never beallowed to participate in the policymaking base of the developed communitys existence by the very nature of his involvement with a past that holds as its basic standard the most obnoxious institution and symbol of the history of whitenonwhite relationships slavery as an industry the afroamerican is a continuing predicate of revolution within the developed community he is an alien in his land but knowledgeable about its mores he is by the very nature of his emotional loyalties the most advantageously placed member of the underdeveloped community for make no joke about it afroamerica is as ruthlessly exploited even in its ephemeral geographical existence as any of the more concretely recognizable nations of the underdeveloped world not only her labor resources but her resources of will and incentive are disestablished by the very nature of the surroundings in which they are called to function because the native history of afroamericas presence coincides politically with the colonial or subservient history of most of the underdeveloped nations her historic place in the present coincides with the dynamic meaning of the postcolonial drive towards self detemination that represents the positive side of the underdeveloped presence and role in modern political life emotionally the realistic desire for the vague but firm value freedom binds the afroamerican to the african or asian mass at the root point of their present respective existences it is now that we should begin to examine the role of method and ethnocratic identity in modern politics in an effort to justify the involve ment rather than intervention of afroamericans in the problems and successes of africa spirit as method the method of making any alliance subservient to its creative outcome must involve the activation in practical terms of subjective principles such abstract values as brotherhood must be understood in terms of beneficial interchange thus black brotherhood that seeks to bridge the barriers created by centuries of enstrangement and even more forbidding worlds of immediate existential in temperament and experience must be understood as ethnosocial expression with practical advantages again the most public and manifest expression of this phenomena must be seen in the possibility for an appeal to emotional pride that is common on extraracial grounds that predicates a promise of future selfdetermination of spirit for afroamerican and african alike when the late malik el shabazz malcolm_xand may his soul rest in peacesaid that the problem of euroamerican exploitation of afroamerican resources should be taken before the united nations he visualized the afroamerican stand not as a new divergence in that extensively fragmented juggernaut but as an integral and cohesive agent of action within the already firmly established revolutionary wing of the afroasian bloc this vision was not the result of a dream but was in fact a vision of reality for if afroamericans can ever begin to fight against the inequities of their internal position on the same terms of international intercourse that other underdeveloped and economically exploited communities do then the settlements that they extract must of necessity have similar international results and implications this would in itself be the first step in the conscious involvement in african problems and successes blanket name affairs of the afroamerican community that is predicated by personal involvement in specific african situations by afroamerican individuals a genuine honest and nonpatronizing interest in and decision to aid or at least lend service to distressed or beleaguered africa by afroamericans is in all simplicity a great blow for the cause of freedom of self determination for the afroamerican community for by this interest or decision the signal is given for the judgement of and evaluation ofthe afroamerican communitys destiny in world terms rather than in narrow neocolonial formulas of need vs want later we shall outline the virtues that might be considered basic tenets of the method implied by this intimation but from this general structure the question of ethnocratic identity as a positive force must evolve in the establishment of this argument the ethnocratic principle the ethnocratic principle is the principle that recognizes in a common ethnic identity the possibility of a collation of strength rather than a vague intimation towards superiority ethnic superiority is a false direction both politically and structurally but creative and dynamic political strength can be established on the basis of ethnic unity the resultant elite is an ethnocracy the causes and effects of such an establishment of ethnocratic principles can only be evaluated in terms of positive beneficiary action and analyzed in terms of active results thus it is that the emotional experience of the afroamerican community can be transformed without the added benefit of history into the modern bridge between the unconscious exploitation of resources that indicates the style of modern underdeveloped existence and the desire to determine the value and utility of such resources that indicates the confines of the underdeveloped communitys dynamic ability to fulfill its drive to self determination the characteristic malaise of the century is a natural attainment in the existential experience of the afroamerican an acquired taste in the existential experience of the modern african this malaise created by the awareness of abundance and the waste of human material in a plethora of wars and crises arising as often as not out of vague and nonideological stupidities that pass for political disagreements between developed communities has touched the afroamerican as a participant slave but has only touched the african as a conscripted servant here the african advantage compliments rather than overshadows the afroamericans desire to create a history outside of the history that created and continues to mould him in short a movement away from the emotional malaise of his native communitys status quo attitudes the conscriptee status must be forcibly revoked by the african the afroamerican has been a member of the conscripting force and so has intimate knowledge of its establishment and inner motivation but he has never beenand will never bea manipulator of energies within the conscripting force the desire to escape from the membership of the conscripting force is in him similar toand even more overwhelming watts vs sharpeville mandela vs el shabazz thanthe africanasian desire to escape the conscriptee status the above is only one of the huge and looming shadows of ethnocratic justification evolving from any dynamic examination of a possible afroamerican comity with african political realities today but it is the most patently symbolic and at the same time realistic reflection of the true nature of the enthnocratic and revolutionary relationship that can be established out of the quality of brotherhood between these two member communities of the underdeveloped world it is an awareness and recognition of the international crosscurrents of attitude and social stance that binds african and afroamerican experience in a comity of loss and hope that will be the final and most creative point of establishment for the basic unity of spirit that may eventually give rise to a broadbased african community that includes without second thought africans in and from the americas the root of awareness what we should now consider is the root of such awareness and the various moot areas of its beginning for any such awareness to take positive emotional and plastic ideological form in terms of national and or economic policies the patent humanistic elements of the overall theme of brotherhood unity and freedom must be examined and not underestimated programs of development in which afroamericans may be invited to participate in africa must have as their root the principle of mutual and voluntary access to knowledge thus gained rather than the principle of mutual economic hoodwinking which underlies most present day expatriate advisory programs but the quality of sacrifice demanded in terms of misconceptions on the part of the host and guest must include the sacrifice of broad areas of preferable error in the relationships between strangers in other words the afroamerican must seek to understand the african as an estranged brother rather than as an exotic host and the african must seek to comprehend the vital changes that his brother from the americas has undergone once the afroamerican working in africa for african causes understands that these causes are his own and the african working beside the afroamerican in africa understands that only the unimportant factors of time and geographical distance have served to alter the existential experience of his guest truly dynamic styles of cooperation will come into effect it is in this area of understanding that even emotional history becomes economic understanding because in the process of understanding the changes wrought in the spirit of his enslaved brother the african is understanding the true attitude of the white comity of nations towards his own dynamic existence this without the pain at the same time in understanding the dynamic existence of the african as an immediate lifereality rather than as a strange and somewhat quaint abberation the afroamerican is unconsciously reevaluating his own source of history and his own present being in the establishment of a third world force out of this awareness several subtle differences in programmatic behavior must be developed the afroamerican fighting with the angolan or rhodesian freedom fighters is fighting to free the nations resources for the nations good and this rather than the salary received must be his root drive he must not be a privileged soldier must be willing to take must insist on taking a salary commensurate with that paid his angolan and rhodesian brothers the afroamerican who possesses particular technical skills or technological knowledge and who is invited toor volunteers towork in african technical programs must not be a mere replacement of his likely white adviser predecessor who more often than not had merely engaged himself in days of sweat and nights of liquor in the club feeling particularly justified if he was a good one that he had come out at all to help the natives at a cut in salary forgetting always that his overseas allowance invariably raised his actual financial gain way above what he could have had by remaining as an obscure artisan in his own ultra technological society the afroamerican must involve his heart in the most prosaic forms of technical advisory posts in which he serves in africa and must be willing to eschew must insist on eschewing the principle of the overseas allowance this is merely another polite term for increasing the outflow of the underdeveloped communitys wealth the afroamerican whose involvement in african affairs has influence on political trends must seek to be as critical without fear or hypocrisy as he can be the african whose workmate is the afroamerican in such a situation must not be any less critical brotherhood cannot be built or sustained on the gloss of hostguest politeness the critical relationship at this point we examine the nature of criticism as an aspect of discipline in human relationships criticism comes to full fruition not merely as an offspring of understanding but mainly as an evolution of feeling it is here that the organic youthexperience of both africans and afroamericans must come into recall minor anthropological figures of this century have had a field day pointing out the superficialities of the african connection across the atlantic and positing these superficialities as profundities this fallacious attitude has had an almost disastrous effect on africans and afroamericans alike who seek the easy way to identity but on the much more hidden level of ethnocratic growth much less has been either understood or written some contemporary political writers have pinpointed the growth of the mass awareness of africa on the part of the afroamerican community as having burgeoned with the spate of independence movements in africa that accompanied the downrush of european colonial fortunes in africa after world war ii but such writers are patently wrong the mass awareness of africa among afroamericans grew steadily and on a broad proletariat front ever since the earliest years of this century the marcus garvey syndrome although to a great extent confused with many of the minor anthropological fallacies mentioned before created at least a foundation of thought for possible politicaland therefore ethnocraticcooperation on the basis of a unity of spirit brought about by a unity of cause then in the late forties and early fifties what was added to this evergrowing proletariat conviction was the reciprocation of articulate feeling from african leaders that began to be known on foreign campuses where such leaders had either studied or were still students but active when such leaders returned to their homes and spoke of this kinship the words rang truer in the ears of the middleclass afroamerican community than they had hitherto when only the low class were associated with such sentiments in the late fifties and now in the sixties out of this new legitimacy has grown the articulate revolution of the middleclass youth whose public power is considered more dangerous to the status quo than was the power of the proletariat mass which could always be suppressed and was not the least of the agencies of danger involved in this new growth of understanding between the articulate elite of the afroamerican youth vanguard and the revolutionary community in africa is the fact that the afroamerican youth is able to marshal and consolidate emotional and even mystical ties of blood into concrete as well as abstract political formulas and thus to further legitimize the drive of the community away from the euroamerican status quo towards the revolutionary spirit in africa which in itself seeks to negate european and euroamerican exploitation of noneuropean resources thus the afroamerican has become a named danger in the very midst of the force that his will seeks to negate this precarious situation is what then forms a further basis of critical justification for the afroamericans involvement in the affairs of african nations he understands what it is to be threatened by white prosperity and is critical of any underdeveloped community which allows complacency to destroy the nervous urgency that is established in him on the other hand the afroamerican can be overwhelmed by this need for urgency and can go too far in trying to bring home the need for this urgency to the more relaxed and less pressed african community he often sees in black and white to the exclusion of strength and expedience it is on this level that his african brother is often critical of him these critical areas must not be allowed to grow into antagonistic forces but must be deployed in terms of constructive exchange the afroamerican whose involvement in africa carries him into the very midst of controversy must cultivate discretion as a political style he must not seek office and must rarely turn it down when offered either act can tear away the curtain of discretion when called upon to sacrifice his comfort or his life he should do so in silence he must not aggravate national disagreements by siding openly with those who take traditional stands of hostility within the community but he must not be afraid to take his stand on national issues with the group that seems to understand the international implications which implications are responsible for his own justification best of all even then his stand must be firm but discreet publicity must devolve on the work done by him rather than on the fact that he is doing the work for this era the afroamerican must be the sacrificial african for upon his effacement rests the reunion in spirit cause and meaning of the construction and reconstruction of an african revolutionary drive with international terms of reference what is more the african will to self determination can infect and sustain the afroamerican will to uncompromising survival only if and when the afroamerican community establishes itself as an integral part of the african community in spirit and direction these are facts of the heart more than that they are circumstance of reality contrary to the popu ar belief held by li many black people torttsfl da black inen dd not initiate the black liberation movement in the s just as the concept of blackness is not solely a product of the current mood of afroamerica the ideal of black_power is neither new nor originally conceived the struggles that have occurred whether in watts or ocean hillbrownsville should be viewed as only an extension of the black struggle for human dignity which first took shape when proud african warriors threw themselves over the sides of european slave ships rather than submit to the degradation of slavery or rebelled aboard the slave ships as was the case with joseph cinque who freed the black warriors aboard the slave ship amistad in however more important the th century saw the greatest prolonged surge of black radicalism america has ever experienced many of the demands black people are beginning to raise today historically are directly traceable to the freedom struggles waged by black people in the th century in respect to todays call for armed struggle voiced by many black militants the th century began in a prophetic manner in gabriel prosser skillfully planned one of the first organized black slave rebellions in america gabriels plans were upset only because of a gigantic rain storm which washed out many of the roads in the area and treachery within his ranks uncle toms are also not a new development as a result gabriel was caught and he along with other black freedom fighters was summarily executed although in this instance and later with the abortive rebellion planned by denmark vesey in in south carolina black revolutionary violence was thwarted the lessons learned from these experiences were not lost in nat turner in virginia organized a tightknit cadre of slaves into a disciplined fighting unit turner then proceeded to stage a protracted uprising against the neighboring white planters before turners rebellion was suppressed more than white people were killed turner vesey and prosser although the best known early practitioners of revolutionary violence were by no means alone in their stress on armed struggle as a tactical weapon in the fight for black liberation numerous other slave rebellions both recorded and unrecorded took place throughout the south at the same time the sentiment among black people toward armed struggle was not exclusively confined to the slave south in in boston david walker wrote a position paper on white america this later became popularly known in literature as walkers appeal in it walker openly embraced the principles of armed struggle for black people as walker put it it is no more harm for you to kill a man who is trying to kill you than it is for you to take a drink of water when thirsty the view expressed by walker was quite widespread among black people however much hidden as a matter of record little more than a decade later a national negro convention meeting in buffalo new york in came within one vote of adopting as the conventions resolution a speechcall to rebelliondelivered by a then little known presbyterian minister henry highland garnet garnet stirred the participants of the convention with these words let your motto be resistance resistance resistance no oppressed people have ever secured their liberty without resistance note here that garnet wasnt talking about resistance to slavery alone but to oppression all oppression in his speech garnet also praised the fighting spirit of turner vesey and cinque garnet in effect became the first black leader in america to call for a national liberation struggle nonviolence and moral suasion the tactics then advocated by most abolitionists both black and white were not in garnets vocabulary it is interesting to note that frederick douglass at this convention led the opposition to garnet douglass remarked that there was too much physical force in the address and the remarks of garnet without a doubt garnet as an historic figure deserves much closer attention largely neglected by history garnets ideas clearly conform to many of the feelings held by blacks today garnet was in every sense a visionary of his times garnet unlike many of todays socalled black revolutionaries did not merely talk about armed struggle this was exemplified several years earlier in when garnet and some friends were attacked by a white mob while attending school in new hampshire garnet then only and suffering with a fever managed to beat off the attackers with his shotgun after a pitched gun battle in addition to this garnet at the same national negro convention became one of the first black leaders in america to call for the establishment of a national black press which would be solely under the control of the people of color this as garnet saw it would be an effective means of both promoting black unity and of attacking the institutional oppression from white america garnet also was very international in his outlook fluent in german and french he traveled to england in on a lecture tour sponsored by a british labor society from there he attended the world peace conference held in frankfurt at one time he was also the american delegate to the world antislavery convention as is apparent from this garnet like douglass needs to be resurrected from history and given his proper reward as a valiant black revolutionary for if frederick douglass is the acknowledged forefather of the civil_rights movement of the early s then henry highland garnet should be equally acknowledged as the forefather of the current black_power movement in the subsequent years garnets influence on the american political scene continued to grow in john brown who was so inspired by garnet that he had his call to rebellion speech published at his own expense attacked the federal arsenal at harpers ferry this of course directly precipitated the civil war it is also known that at least five black men fought with brown at harpers ferry two of them shields green and john copeland were browns closest confidants copeland captured with brown is reported to have stated on his way to the gallows if i am dying for freedom i could not die for a better cause i had rather die than be a slave over a century later h rap brown would express a similar sentiment no slave should die a natural death alongside armed struggle black men then were beginning to think about a rediscovery of their brutally severed african cultural ties martin delany a black physician was the prime th century mover behind the movement toward black cultural nationalism delanys emphasis on black awareness was so strong that frederick douglass was once prompted to say i thank god for making me a man simply but delany always thanks him for making him a black man delany as a serious student of african history and society laid much of the groundwork for the latterday backtoafrica separatist movements quite significantly delany was the first black leader to formulate the concept of selfdetermination which is so much a part of todays black struggle in delany wrote every people should be the originators of their own designs the projector of their own schemes and creators of the events that lead to their destinythe consummation of their desires also the interest in black history and black studies a major demand of black students today began to gain momentum among black people in the mids in william c nell a black abolitionist wrote one of the first black history textbooks in it nell detailed the exploits of black men who fought in the war of independence and the war of another black leader john rock along with delany gave major expression to the beauty and power of blackness in a speech in commemorating the boston massacre rock said white men have no room to taunt us with tamely submitting if they were black men they would work wonders but as white men they can do nothing rock in his speech went on to extoll the physical features of black people the fine tough muscular system the beautiful rich color the full broad features and the gracefully frizzled hair of the negro similarly the present cry for black control of the black communities has deep roots within the black experience the legitimate desire of black people to own and control the institutions that directly affect their lives was first given formal expression during a national negro convention held in rochester new york in the convention went on record calling for a national council of the colored people attempts also were made during this convention to form committees on protective unions and business relations both measures were designed to speak directly to the need for black people to control the economies of their communities in conjunction with this the convention called for the establishment of black educational and training institutions and a black library within the black community as the convention noted when we are called upon to consider the subject of education with reference to ourselves and to ask what kind of an institution would best benefit us the answer comes in the light of the announced doctrine namely one that would develop power and that kind of power most essential to our elevation as can be seen not only are the proposals that came out of this convention farsighted and in some respects exceedingly contemporary but the fact that black people were able to convene in such a manner is strongly reminiscent of todays black_power conferences in the year period from to there were at least four national negro conventions held since there have been three black_power conferences all were national in scope and allblack in character it should be understood that this all too brief overview of th century black radicalism is in itself incomplete there were numerous other black men many lost to history who were engaged in constant struggle against the forces of american oppression there were black men such as charles langston who in a speech in seem ingly anticipated malcolm_xs famous dictum by any means necessary when he said i have long since adopted as my god the freedom of the colored people of the united states and my religion to do anything that will effect that object or black men like william wells brown leroi jones th century literary predecessor who as one of americas first black playwrightwriters adopted black themes in his works with this historical backdrop one can recognize that black radicals such as web du bois william trotter marcus garvey malcolm_x and stokely carmichael who were to come later simply made modifications on the foundations which the early black radicals laid therefore in any future discussion of the historic development of the black liberation struggle in america it is hoped that the th century will be remembered as the era that gave formal birth to black_power gegeographically harlem lies within manhattan between g y the rivers and north of the park yet it seems to be its own p reality an inner reality encased in a larger outer reality manhattan the other world left and right south and north rises the wall impassible four poets from four diverse parts of the world all hear harlems heartbeat the spanish poet federico garcia lorca with gypsy blood running in his veins came from granada and heard the rumored frenzy of harlem ah harlem in disguise ah harlem menaced by the tribe of headless dresssuits your murmur comes to me leopold sedar senghor with the night of senegal in his eyes evokes harlem harlem i have seen harlem harlem claude mckay too coming from jamaica and nostalgic for the warm tropical island sees and hears the halting footsteps of a lass in negro harlem when the night lets fall its veil i see the shapes of girls who pass and the poet langston hugnes wno came to harlem from missouri knows harlem and is harlem i feel and see and hear harlem i hear you hear you hear mewe twoyou me talk on this page the four poets identity with the near you hear mewe twoyou me talk on this page for they all sing and in their nocturnal symbiosis tell of the prostitution and the living in harlemcreate four shadows of harlem garcia lorca in his poem the king of harlem dramatizes the frenzied anguish and the chlorophyll hopes of harlem leopold sedar senghor in new york conjures up the phantasmagoria and tattoos out its rhythmical throb in his lyrical rhapsody claude mckay in his harlem shadows with deep pathos wearily laments the prostitution of harlem ah heart of me the weary weary feet in harlem wandering from street to street and langston hughes the poet of harlem wryly humorously if not sardonically bebops the deferred dreams of harlem four poets in impressionistic tones the flitting shadows of harlem life externalizing or internalizing its rumor but since this rumor reaches manhattan all of the poets speculate upon the infusions the coursing or simply the flow of blood between the divided siamese twins manhattan and harlem garcia lorca admonishes harlem that blight and deception will be a consequence of the hasty desire to merge with new york the blood is coming the blood will come by roof and shed everywhere to burn the chlorophyll of the blonde women take flight take flight past the corners hide in the highest story for the pith of the forest will penetrate every crack to leave in your flesh the light trace of the eclipse and a false sadnessthe discolored glove the chemical rose senghor on the other hand urges new york to drink vivifying blood from harlem new york i say to new york let the black blood flow into your blood cleaning the rust from your steel articulations like an oil of life givingyour bridges the curve of the hills the lianas suppleness langston hughes neither admonishes nor urges he knows that for better or for worse they are joined as the poem theme for english b illustrates you are white yet a part of me as i am a part of you thats american sometimes perhaps you dont want to be a part of me nor do i often want to be a part of you but we are thats true as i learn from you i guess you learn from me so even if emphasis is on harlem the interrelationship of manhattan and harlem is constantly thematically projected by the poets how then do the poets present the outer reality for which as garcia lorca puts it mulattos pulled rubber hoping to reach the white torso for claude mckay that outer world is stern and harsh inflicting deprivation on harlem and bringing about the degradation of its people ah stern harsh world but to garcia lorca and leopold sedar senghor the outer world does not inflict wounds on harlem in itself it is afflicted like harlems the dreams of manhattan are deferred dreams the vision which both garcia lorca and senghor conjure up of manhattan is unlovely unwholesome a picture of stagnation and rot amidst its startling scientific thrust in stark colors garcia lorca writes of the insomnia of manhattan in the wards are people staggering and sleepless like late survivors of a bloody ship wreck and senghor cries out insomniac nights o nights of manhattan tormented by fatuous fires while the klaxons cry through the empty hours the poets see the fatuousness the emptiness the hollowness in life in new york they speak too of the unwholesomeness of relationships sometimes the coins in furious angry swarms sting pierce devour abandoned children in a transferred image of shipwreck and abandonment senghor picks up the theme of dark waters both see pollution present in manhattan the images become grey and dark in antagonistic terms which emphasize the unnaturalness of phenomena in manhattan lorca depicts a hurricane of dark doves dabbling in rotten water in senghor all the birds of the air fall suddenly dead below the high ashes of the terraces the girth of science too pollutes creating from the natural a metallic unnaturalness science is without direction and so obfuscation follows light is buried among the links of noise in a shameless challenge of unrooted science consequent on unrooted science is that artificiality which senghor makes patent in the first part of his poem new york in broken antagonistically stark lines mouths become lipless girls legs almost turn to nylon no tender words hard cash buys artificial hearts and all around them the poets find the rigidity of steel girders which by extension moves into the rigidity of feelings things and emotions lack the softness of the curve and so senghor marooned in manhtattan moans the nostalgia of childrens hands and mothers breasts seeing only the hard anguish which stifles creativity thus from the painters palette sprout not things that grow but things that are ossified and dead the painters palette flowers with crystals of coral the poetic vision of new york to garcia lorca and senghor is one of pollution and sterility fraught with hopelessness and anguish dawn comes no one receives it on his mouth for here no morning nor hope is possiblethere too in manhattan in the outer reality beyond the walls of harlem dreams are deferred and lorca reiterates the american girls bore in their bellies children and money bags and the boys hung swooning outstretched on the rack of the waking yawn another part of the deferred dream comes together to form the total the montage of a dream deferred for those people from harlem who have gone to the outer world fleeing the bitter dream of harlem though they seem to have achieved success they too hughes ironically suggests live a deferred dream and the one who has moved downtown from bebop to bebach misses harlem on sunny sunday afternoons when the kids look all new and far too clean to stay that way the preceding quotations reveal all the tenderness and lova which hughes feels for harlem and because of this feeling of tenderness and love when hughes conjures up the nightmarish quality of harlems dreams deferred his tone becomes bitter and sardonic though always wryly humorous for more often than not there is no sunday best in hughes montage of a dream deferred there is not the sheer delight of being wrapped by harlems neon lights or of dancing in a warm embrace with harlem as in manhattan dawn is hopeless and awakening is darkened by the shadow of an unfulfilled past and overcast by a cloudy future the dance then becomes only a drugging hiatus all these are but hallucinations where temporary technicolor lights shine on the nightmare of a dream deferred sex too enlivens a dull existence lights up the night of hughes harlem montage with a witty banter that highlights this problem hughes jibes by question and answer jibe and jive from bebop to bebach upbeat to downbeat hughes recreates harlem in all its social dimension reveals its hopes and frustrations its laughter and tears he depicts too a careless bebop insouciance a nonchalance a careless disregard with which many cats in harlem coolly view legal institutions and jailings in that ooppopada is all the flinching laughter everpresent in montage of a dream deferred hughes presents harlem bebop boys and girls together in the gutter and claims that to rise out of it to not have the dream deferred to achieve anything at all requires a morethanhuman effort in montage of a dream deferred the pulse beat of the poem the tempo constantly increases as we move from dream boogie boogie am through ladys boogie through blues at dawn through dream boogie variation to nightmare boogie there is the tingle of a tear the trilling the treble whirling of a treble and it looks as if the musicians eyes are teasing pain but sometimes we sense in the bass notes of the boogiewoogie rumble an ominous note langston hughes does not explicitly answer the questions as does garcia lorca in the king of harlem hughes and garcia lorca the one from harlem and across the park the one from granada and across the seas two poets who felt and wrote about their solitude at columbia universityboth foresee an ensuing confusion if a dream is too long deferred garcia lorca in his long poem objectively dramatizes with elemental motifs the frenzy and confusion which he senses throbbing in harlem the poem externalizes barrenness and sterility anguish and violence ruin and chaos both people and phenomena all are disturbed frenetic the picture is unrelieved the shadows are deep and dark here there is none of the humor or sardonic laughter of langston hughes none of the fantasy of senghor or the evocative pathos of claude mckay the poem opens with a series of four graphically elemental slashes hard brush strokes which are repeated throughout the poem and present a totally stark and lovely canvas the king of harlem is raving his subjects are weeping the children pursue their little cruelties the landscape scurries away in dread throughout the poem the kings delirium the kings obvious powerlessness evoke the uncontrolled weeping and confusion of his subjects whose anguish and stifled violence reach out to the poet and the poet cries outthe imprisoned bloodthat too as it seeks an issue any issue to the outer reality may bring with it selfdestruction and emptiness may find only the blood that speaks by a thousand roads death powder dusted ashes of nard the blood from commingling with landscape from living in the daggers thorn in the heart of landscapes now takes on added fury and power and is rusting the careless tradewind in a footstepmelting the butterflies on the window panes and the wind in its turn takes on the fury of the king of harlem becomes a wooden south wind which in this picture of total confusion and destruction in which eyes of crocodiles are gouged out squirrels are beaten in frenzy in which moths and butterflies are smothered and beatles are drunk in this picture of violence the poet asserts that it is necessary to kill the goldenhaired whisky seller for the king of harlem to chant with his full choir like hughes but more explicitly garcia lorca repeats that the dream that is deferred too long may explode but the poet sees the explosion as endemic to the outer reality which has its own confusion this is the same wise silence which the dancer in claude mckays the harlem dancer keeps as she proffers her body to prostituting glances there is none of the harshness of garcia lorca in these poems of mckay neither is there the ironic laughter of hughes there are only bare shadows and painted prostitution mckays harlem dancer evokes all the nostalgia of distance and of deferred dreams in contrapuntal tones the poet reveals the two distinctive ways of seeing the dancer to the applauding youths and their prostitute compaions the dancers perfect body awakens desires and highpitched laughter they only see the externals of movement and body the poet however lyricizes the dancer whose outwardly perfect form is heightened by her silent resistance to prostitution to me she seemed a proudlyswaying palm but others who have to prostitute themselves bodily are not as resilient as mckays harlem dancer in his harlem shadows the figures of the girls are thinly clad they are not swaying palms but rather uprooted wandering and weary here the poet conjures up the mood of unending hopelessness of unending weariness on and on throughout the night the feet go trudging here there is only a certain amount of tramping in a dream deferred there are no undertones of the bass beat of the marching feet of hughes in the harlem dancer even though her dancing for her livelihood seems as unending as the trudging of the feet there is a sense of otherness and escape she is almost through a transmigration of feeling theres a certain amount of escape in a dream deferred in mckays harlem shadows the figures that flit through the dark streets are timid fragile almost on the verge of being consumptive phantoms conversely in the harlem dancer the picture of the dancer is that of a beautiful black woman upon whose swarthy neck black shiny curlsluxuriant fell in langston hughes the faces the figures who rumble through the night possess shadow facesin the shadow night momentarily however the poet transforms his usually shadowy faces into those found in the poem the harlem dancer and hughes will dance with you till daydance with you my sweet brown harlem girl in garcia lorca there is no transformation in the shadows the darkness of the shadows is unrelieved the night has no portals in your night face up no blush there is no harlem dancer rather there is frenzy in the dance the wind ruptured the veins of the dancers in senghor harlem night is transformed into a fantasy one can almost hear hughes says take it away senghor senghor picks up and we hear the notes from mckays harlem dancer the sound of blended flutes blown by black players upon a picnic day and senghor proclaims i have seen them preparing at flight of day the festival of the night i proclaim there is more truth in the night than in the day the wind is not an element of destruction the shadows have taken on strength night a positive force where the feet of the harlem dancer are charged with earth rhythm and the poet rhapsodizes harlem harlem i have seen harlem harlem a breeze green with corn springing from the pavements ploughed by the bare feet of dancers ft differing from garcia lorcas the king of harlem phenomena in senghors poem are not jarring elemental and destructive the wind does not rupture the veins of dancers it becomes a lifegiving breeze green with corn phenomena do not jangle they harmonize into ballets of lilies and fabulous masks even though in harlem senghor finds licentiousness and violence the mangoes of love roll from the low houses under the police horses hooves even though there is bacchanal where there run down the sidewalks streams of white rum and streams of black milk in the blue haze of cigars the scene is carnivalesque it does not contain the sterility and barrenness which we noted in the outer reality where the poet senghor found no well or pasture but rather encountered blue metallic eyes and frosty smiles the poet had cried out to the outer reality insomniac night o nights of manhattan these nights become purified in the poets vision of the inner reality harlem where the curative elements of manna and hyssop flow nightfall is the pure hour when god sets the life before memory germinating in the streets in those streets of harlem senghor like lorca feels the anguish of harlems blood garcia lorca had cried ah harlem harlem harlem there is no anguish like your shuddering blood within the dark eclipse senghor had echoed listen new york listen to the muted anguish of your tears falling in great clots of blood c to the anguish garcia lorca had coupled a garnet violence senghor allied to the muted anguish a brazen male voice a vibrant oboe voice this is the voice which senghor urges new york to listen to a voice which might bring a harmony which might bring about a time of signs and reckonings when the outer reality manhattan and the inner reality harlem become a chorus blending their voices and so the harsh visions of the outer reality proffered by garcia lorca and senghor the four shadowy visions of harlem evoked by our four poets may be reconciled senghor invokes new york to listen to the far beating of your nocturnal heart rhythm and blood of the drum drum and blood and drum garcia lorca admonishes the shadowy figures in his king of harlem not to remain the ivory salamanders in the cleft of the night but urges them to if mankind survives faraway generations will wonder what i america was likenot because america is now great or powerful but because it is the vast laboratory where one ispaicqsiis most pr f und experiments in the history of human life is still taking place the subject of the experiment is the negroa hypothetic average of the american black manand the object of that experiment is the identification of those characteristics and methods by which men might achieve humane survival in the face of demoniac obstacles it is a hopeful assumption that the experiment is presided over by some cosmic force kindly disposed toward our earthly race a force into which our forthcoming adventures on the moon and other planets might give us some unexpected insight america then has been a metaphor to mankind while it has been both a time and a place for the evolving spirit of the black man torn from africa stripped of ancestral culture family affections and many hopes and after two and a half centuries of slavery thrust suddenly into a complex industrial society while mankind has watched this black man from a distance coming closer largely through books motionpictures and radio and television programs conceived mostly by white men the black writer has lived the metaphor he has known america with an intensely prophetic vision inaccessible to the routine mechanics of the historian and other scholars the most subtle insights of the black man have daily preserved his sanity and optimism in a brutal environment of irrational color prejudice if it is true that the best writers of black america like the best writers of any society are among mankinds most sensitive beings it follows that their best literary creations are a universal resource of thought and feeling precious to the world what these writers have had to say before therefore is authentic commentary upon the willingness and capacity of the united states to function for its black citizens as a civilized nation black america has more than lived up to its social contract paying its way through the thankless toil of its ancestors in bondage through the largely unremembered blood of its sons in every war and through its monumental patience from the days of the slave drivers lash to the present decade of the assassin and the spy it is the determination of white america that raises doubts verification continues that the nation is grappling with a historic sickness but nations like individual men do recover if they have the will to surviveand if the abuses of the laws of being have not been so enormous as to invite an irreversible doom a word of caution must precede even a brief glance at years of negro literature especially since the phrase protest literature has obscured the whole tradition the black writer like the unappeaseable old captain ahab in melvilles moby dick paces the deck of his memories wearing an ivory leg to replace the one bitten off not by a whale but by an agent of a force capable of greater evil and like old ahab walking on life and death and unable to forget the malice and the challenge of the white whale the black writer inevitably walks on one leg of death and unforgettable anguish and on another leg of life and hope readers must not approach the writings of a black man then expecting to categorize them neatly as social protest for the black writer has achieved a marvelous equilibrium in balancing himself on both legs the mere fact that he must walk at all explains his literary attack against conditions that would keep him forever crawling the fact that he must walk like a man but at his own pace and with his own stride demands diversity in content and style conceding at the outset a limitation here that barely allows drawing aside the curtain on a literary scene of real magnitude i choose three important literary formsthe novel the short story and the poem to convey a glimpse of black writers views of america searching the records of novels written from the beginning of that tradition through one can find about published by negroes ranging from william wells browns clotel or the presidents daughter in to frank yerbys prides castle in before the harlem awakening of the s which is a focal point in the development of negro literature black novelists began their evolution in artistic sensibility and political sophistication of the two novels that appeared before the civil war clotel combines some of the facts of slavery with rumors of president jeffersons amours with negro women the second one is interesting for its early analysis of racial prejudice in the north there followed a year lapse in the production of novels by negroes an apparent example of the effect of the ascendancy of force in contemporary events on creative human energies the civil war and the reconstruction period were the oppressive factors in this instance in the last years of the century only six novels by black writers appeared and of them only two merit special attentionattention unrelated to their small artistic value frances e w harper was the first negro to write a novel about the reconstruction period her novel lola leroy shares its bit of historical value with paul laurence dunbars the uncalled worthwhile for its autobiographical references between and years which include primarily the vast migrations of black people from the south as well as world war i the most important novelists were charles w chesnutt dunbar w e b du bois and james weldon johnson as novelists they anticipated the literary themes of the harlem awakening or as men they personally influenced the leaders of that movement chesnutts the house behind the cedars began the serious treatment of the theme of negroes passing for white dunbars scenes of gay lowlife in harlem in the sport of the gods forecast famous novels of the s du boiss scholarly novel the quest of the silver fleece brought a new factual political sophistication into the narration of racial struggle for he explained how the cotton industry affected washington politics northern industrialism and southern prejudice james weldon johnsons novel the autobiography of an excolored man which directly influenced five or six novels of the harlem awakening freed the negro novel from its dependence upon southern and other american scenes for his cosmopolitan novel was set in europe as well as in the north also his treatment of negro life and music in new york was transitional other black novelists of the period whose names are less well known now have the historical distinction of being the first to write novels totally or substantially on the following themes black nationalism negro pioneers in the west negro war veterans and the great migrations to the north novels by at least eight black authors of this period developed the washingtondu bois controversy which argued the relative merits of the policy of racial submissiveness followed by booker t washington and the policy of aggressive militance exemplified by dr du bois this controversy was simultaneously carried forward in autobiography short fiction poetry and drama the novels published during the harlem awakening of the s are less important than the phenomenon of the decade itself its social glamor and artistic vigor have never been equalled the several causes of the harlem awakening therefore are significant first negroes who became soldiers abroad or migrants to the north learned that all people with white skins were not prejudiced and that freedom for black people within the american system of government was possible second the emotional dazzle and racial appeal of marcus garvey with his black dolls black newspaper black steamship line and black god stimulated authors as well as the poorer negroes garvey pulled together several strands of negro philosophy the selfreliance of booker t washington the militance of du bois and the emerging selfpride of black people third a new interest in afroamerican history was stimulated by publications that followed the creation in of the association for the study of negro life and history and similar interest in african painting and sculpture was encouraged by the revolutionary discoveries and work of picasso of the art collector paul guillaume of the art critic guillaume apollinaire and of several french painters composers and writers fourth there was the attraction of harlem itself the home of the garvey movement and of the most powerful negro organizations magazines and newspapers most of the negro writers and artists who were to achieve fame before came to harlem during the s harlem was also an attraction to whites a fact which was the fifth cause of the harlem awakening some whites who visited nighttime harlem merely wanted to forget the war and to engage their new freudian awareness by escaping into exotic black cabaret life other white visitors were serious writers and artists such as theodore dreiser and george gershwin white readers unable to go to harlem night clubs could feel their attraction by reading the primitivistic works of eugene oneill sherwood anderson waldo frank and especially carl van vechten whose controversial novel nigger heaven was very popular there were a few other causes such as personal relationships between black and white writers examples were the business and literary associations with white writers experienced by claude mckay james weldon johnson and langston hughes consequently leading national publishers who seldom handled books by black authors before the s began to recognize both their merits and their commercial possibilities the final overreaching cause of the harlem awakening was the steady decline in the popularity of the late booker t washingtons shameproducing conciliatory philosophy giving way to the assertive pride of what was called the new negro langston hughess statement of has often been quoted as the manifest of this new negro in his essay entitled the negro artist and the racial mountain hughes declared we younger negro artists who create now intend to express our individual darkskinned selves without fear or shame if the white people are pleased we are glad if they are not it doesnt matter if colored people are pleased we are glad if they are not their displeasure doesnt matter either we build our temples for tomorrow and we stand on top of the mountain free within ourselves out of this creative upsurge came a dozen or so black novelists among them at least three who deserve special mention du bois mckay and nella larsen each publishing a novel in the same year du boiss dark princess treating a group of african and asian revolutionaries explored the negroes plight in its worldwide setting mckays home to harlem with its colorful violent depiction of harlems lowlife and underworld was probably the most popular novel of the decadeits sequel of the following year entitled banjo even more dramatically used the european lowlife of the marseilles waterfront as a setting for the clash of negro and white attitudes nella larsens novel quicksand dealt with questions of morality and color prejudice by converting them into passions in the breast of a neurotic woman of mixed parentage also in there appeared a novel important for its inauguration of satire into the tradition rudolph fishers the walls of jericho in the subsequent decades of the depression at least three separate influences marked negro literature first the proletarian ideology encouraged by national introspection urged american writers to use art as a weapon in the class struggle the black writers racial pride that characterized the harlem awakening therefore was in the s some times merged with the proletarian insight that a workingclass hero fighting industrial and propertyowning tyrants deserved a place in literature second that racial pride was in the s given extra intellectual depth by essays in new journals such as the journal of negro education founded in and the negro history bulletin founded in black peoples civic and higher educational institutions also increased their emphasis upon racial history third the governments federal writers project which gave many black authors literary work to do during the depression sponsored serious regional and historical studies that provided both facts and inspiration the novels published during the depression encompassed at least seven types and some of these novels were the first of their kind the first type was the war novel represented by victor dalys not only war the earliest negro novel about world war i the second type was the novel of folkways which was practiced by zora neale hurston george wylie henderson and george w lee hendersons ollie miss was about sharecropping and lees river george was about a legendary racial hero a mississippi college student named george who planned to free his race from oppression the third type of novel was the historical novel best represented by arna bontemps black thunder on gabriel prossers slave rebellion of the fourth type might be loosely called the proletarian novel forcefully represented by the short novels of richard wright collected in the edition of uncle toms children the fifth type was the college novel originated by owendell shaws greater need below which explored life in a southern negro college the sixth type was the family history initiated when waters edward turpin published two novels these low grounds in and o canaan in the former traced four generations of family life and the latter covered one generation of the chicago experiences of a family from mississippi the seventh and final type dealt with migrant workers william attaways let me breathe thunder influenced by steinbeck was concerned with white boys trapped by the fate of migrant field hands perhaps only four or five of the odd novels of this decade would repay close analytical study such as bon temps black thunder hendersons ollie miss and the work of zora neale hurston but the tradition of the negro novel was gaining solid substance in the publication of one great novel wrights native son had the impact of a national event unforgettable in its variety of indications literal allusive metaphorical and symbolicalof ways in which the sensitive black protagonist is doomed before birth in his struggle toward human selfidentity native son stands alone in literary history world war ii itself had a less profound influence on the negro novel although the war did force advances in civil_rights those advances culminated in supreme court decisions favoring social justice in interstate travel housing voting and education presidential executive orders ended segregation in the armed forces and made the gesture of ending employment discrimination by firms having government contracts but while negro soldiers abroad were absorbing a new cosmopolitanism that would widen the themes of novels they were deeply aware of the nazilike attitudes at home which caused riots in both harlem and detroit in in the s then the followers of wrights literary example were urged on by at least three forces by the emotional magnetism of native son itself by racism in the national environment and by the naturalistic tradition already famous in the novels of dreiser dos passos and farrell wrights followers however did not share his genius their work is best represented by chester himes if he hollers let him go and by willard motleys knock on any door himes battered his raceccnscious protagonist thoroughly before letting him ecape into military service motley borrowing wrights main plot rather than his intentions gave a naturalistic picture of the defeat of his young italian hero the most ably written novels of the decade did not depend upon native son william attaway in writing blood on the forge improved upon turpins earlier account of migrants by adding symbolism and deeper realism attaway treated the deterioration of three kentucky brothers working in northern steel mills two other superior novels were written by women ann petry and dorothy west the formers country place employing symbols and metaphors reminiscent of the work of nathaniel hawthorne explored the declining yankee traditions of a connecticut town dorothy wests the living is easy satirically condemned the harmful behavior of middleclass negro bostonians struggling to escape their racial heritage because of unrestricted length and relative freedom of style in the novel one can assume that its fullness of negro expression has been limited only by the imagination and skill of the novelists as a group one must of course always keep in mind the inhibiting effects of unimaginative publishers perhaps then a notion of black writers views of america before can be gained by the addition of less detailed references to short stories and poetry the first short story published by a negro was frances e w harpers the two offers it praised a white woman who was an antislavery crusader between that year and the two most important short story writers were chesnutt and dunbar both men but especially chesnutt had to consider white magazine readers accustomed to degrading or simpleminded stereotypes popularized by such white writers as thomas nelson page and joel chandler harris chesnutt whose publisher did not reveal his racial identity for about a dozen years explored the following themes color prejudice folk negro psychology and southern hatreds that cause both subtle and brutal injuries dunbar more so than chesnutt created simple negro characters who spoke plantation dialect but he also deviated into such themes as negro leadership and negroes problems in industry and education between and george marion mcclellan and joseph s cotter took advantage of the groundwork laid by chestnutt and dunbar mcclellans volume of stories was noteworthy for its study of the disadvantages suffered by negro women cotters work began the emphasis upon sordid realism in negro experience during the harlem awakening three short story writers predominated jean toomer rudolph fisher and eric walrond toomer wrote uniquely poetic stories about idealistic young people fisher writing while practicing medicine turned out prizewinning stories published in atlantic monthly and other distinguished magazines walrond reared on the island of barbados wrote a volume containing vivid morbid pictures of human deterioration in the tropics the tropics also provided the setting for half of the twelve stories in mckays volume of the early s although these storiesas well as the remaining ones which were about harlemnarrowed their main interest to sexual intrigue and color prejudice it was langston hughes and richard wright however who led the short story writers of the s hughes explored new depths of common negro urban life with humor and satire as well as with bitterness wrights work powerfully dramatized the ways in which southern black people both young old were brutalized the best known other short story writers of the depression were the following john f matheus rudolph fisher zora neale hurston arna bontemps and ralph ellison the s brought more writers of short fiction to public attention the best being ann petry chester himes frank yerby and john henrik clarke ann petrys work appeared in the anthology best american short stories of himes by had published ten stories in esquire alone and clarke wrote stories while starting a career as editor book reviewer and essayist the destiny of yerby whose early stories show that he might have become a follower of wright was changed by the popularity of his novels although these writers placed their stories in firstclass traditional periodicals they found special encoragement in new negro magazines for example negro story in its spring issue alone published two stories by ellison two by himes three by hughes and several others by minor authors black poets who deserve a booklength history of their own were first represented by three slave poets lucy terry who in wrote verse about an indian raid by jupiter hammon whose work appeared in and by phillis wheatley who after her original publication in imitated alexander pope and received much acclaim in england the next poet of historical consequence was george moses horton the title of whose volume the hope of liberty indicated his purpose in writing it the book did not bring horton enough money to purchase his freedom but it did secure his reputation as the first slave to use poetry to protest his bondage he was also an early stylist in the humor and satire that were increasing in american literature fifteen years after the hope of liberty frances e w harper the bestknown negro poet of the s preserved in her poem the slave auction a generalized picture of the grief of black families callously divided and separately sold on the auction block negro poets in the second half of the nineteenth century generally fit either a precivil war or a postwar category the prewar poets were usually conventional versifiers demonstrating that they were cultured americans deserving firstclass citizenship their names are minor in negro literature the postwar poets however thrown into the literary war started by irwin russell harris and page had to choose between striking down or humanizing the stereotypes popularized by those white founders of what has been called the plantation tradition the postwar poets as diversified then as black poets are today were divided in their choices albery a whitman chose to strike the stereotype down sounding sometimes like spenser byron or tennyson and sometimes like whittier or bryant whitman used both negro and indian themes to picture black men as heroes the rise to fame of paul laurence dunbar just before has been called the most important event in the history of negro literature but when americas leading critic william dean howells praised dunbar without racial condescension the poets public image as a writer of negro dialect was also confirmed howells praise ironically trapped dunbar in the shadow of the plantation tradition he is not usually associated with poetry written in standard english which is the kind he most often wrote the lyrical poems that he preferred are not forgotten but he is famous for his dialect poems and for such sternly racial poems as we wear the mask dunbars contemporaries who worked with less originality in the dialect tradition are little known today between and black poets remained divided into two main groups that approximated the earlier categories first those who imitated past english and american masters and second those who claimed the heroism and rights of negroes or sympathetically pictured their folk ways the first group achieved a literary detachment from the racial repression and violence of their own times representative of their work were the lyrics of william stanley braithwaite the charming verses of benjamin brawley and the nature poetry of george marion mcclellan the second group which includes du bois fenton johnson and lesser known figures breathed into their poetry the anger they felt in the midst of racial abominations du boiss vehement poem a litany at atlanta an outstanding example was written on the train he was riding to investigate the atlanta riot of the black poet and college teacher margaret walker commenting on the wealthy white patrons who financed some of the poetry writing of the harlem awakening observed that they did so as a fad to amuse themselves and their guests at some of the fabulous parties of the twenties the poetry itself however was usually serious and volumes of permanent value were written by james weldon johnson claude mckay countee cullen and langston hughes johnsons best poetry especially o black and unknown bards and his book of freeverse poetic sermons gods trombonesretained the eloquence and rhythm of important predecessors without depending upon dialect mckay an intense poet who seemed to one of his firends to have a furnacelike fire within him wrote excellent sonnets and lyrics that were angry but artistic expressions of negroes many discontents his book harlem shadows represents his best work his most famous poem is the sonnet if we must die which is so eloquent in its insistence upon negro resistance to tyranny that winston churchill appearing before a joint session of the american congress quoted the poem without naming its author to inspire americans to enter world war ii countee cullen who said that he wanted to be a lyric poet like john keats but who responded more and more to racial injustice as he grew older had the gift of making the ordinary seem beautiful a classicist at heart cullen wrote remarkable sonnets his first volume entitled color was his best his own favorites among his poems appeared posthumously under the title on these stand langston hughes whose most famous poem the negro speaks of rivers was published when he was composed two outstanding volumes during the harlem awakening the weary blues and fine clothes to the jew also in the s hughes who was to remain the most important innovator and experimenter in all of negro literature initiated the practice of reading poetry accompanied by music in addition he introduced the pattern of the blues into poetry hughes was the first poet to picture black people regularly as merely people and to find permanent human and literary worth in such lowly negroes as porters bootblacks and field hands two other poets who were important in the harlem awakening but who did not then publish volumes were jean toomer and arna bontemps the black poetry of the s shows two tendencies regionalism and a sometimes classoriented social criticism thus exhibiting both the concentration and the expansion of racial thought characterisic of the decade the best volume sterling browns southern road reflects the regional and slaverytime studies fostered by the federal writers project as well as lingering garveyism and the historical awareness promoted by new negro journals and organizations a new poet frank marshall davis published black mans verse and am the american negro volumes filled with harsh criticism on the other hand black labor chant a book by another new poet david wadsworth cannon jr who died while a doctoral student at columbia university reveals negroes expanded vision of themselves as part of the workingclass which should unite before names now well known were being heard melvin b tolson robert hayden owen dodson and margaret walker among their socially realistic early poems were at least two that would become prize winners margaret walkers for my people and tolsons dark symphony in the s three poetic modes were dominant the lyrical the experimental and the racial the lyrical tradition always carried forward by the very nature of poetry was maintained principally through volumes by hayden tolson and braithwaite the experimental tradition on the other hand represented a delayed response on the part of black poets to the stylistic freedoms that other american poets had taken between and that is the free verse imagism and other techniques used by walt whitman and emily dickinson by french symbolists and by spanish modernists hayden belonged in this tradition as did dodson and a few others the racial thrust almost as natural to black poets as lyricism was continued by davis and hughes and was joined by a newcomer gwendolyn brooks her second volume the pulitzer prizewinning annie allen showed a flair for symbolism and experimental syntax hughes halfway through his long career was especially effective with his satirical poems in shakespeare in harlem and with his humorous but biting madam to you series in oneway ticketa his experimental inclination continued in his topographical poetry in oneway ticket as well as in his blues and jazz verses between the eighteenth century and then black writers of fiction and poetry have suggested such a complex varied picture of america that no single impression emerges nevertheless a brief synthesis of their common evolution might simplify that picture before the civil war they mounted their attack on slavery and northern prejudice after the war through reconstruction and until some black writers replaced the stereotypes of the plantation tradition with heroic figures or with humanized folk negroes while other writers either turned to the psychologcial and economic effects of racism or imitated english and american masters between and certain subjects received original or increased attention especially those reflecting new political and societal insights during the harlem awakening black writers became less selfconscious more cosmopolitan more satirical and they composed some of their finest poetry during the depression several new types of novels appeared common negroes were used more respectfully in literature and social criticism indicated the writers widening knowledge of racial history between and while native son was firing the imagination of many black authors a few writers of fiction turned successfully to the use of white protagonists and new england settings and a few poets taking late advantage of liberating techniques merged racial experience and experimental style with brilliant results black writers views of america are the aggregate unmanageable total of their literary works showing that intellectual unity would be unnatural showing too that the phrase the negro is an illusion the country has violated nature itself by refusing to recognize actively the individual differences among its black citizens in the face of white americas continual blindness negligence and hostilitymitigated far too seldom by the decencies of individual white peopleit is the artistic personality especially that is flooded with revulsion negro literature is the record not only of that revulsion but of the irreducible will of black america to preserve a sane and sensitive existence through every means known to civilized man cjr a senior in business management at tuskegee institute is concerned with the essence of the lives of ordinary black people he says that he is interested in conveying the beauty of black people as they interact among each other my photos show the reality of poverty of beauty of gentleness of warmth and of blackness his photos have appeared in jet magazine the washington post the washington daily sun and campus digest the young photographer is preparing a photoessay black people in america mr higgins is the son of jet magazines senior editor the book is a novelpoem sarah e wright wastes no words she is clear she is precise and she uses her technical capabilities to infuse and successfully a lifeflow between the characters who live inside of this childs gonna live lawrence delacorte and her readers and successfully more than a lifeflownearly a transference of presence all of which makes reading the beautiful experience it can be mariah upshur is a black woman concerned with survival for her children and the movement of the story of mariah her husband jacob their children living dead andabouttobeborn centers on her anxious impassioned desire to take them out of the wasted land of death in which they live mariah and her family live vividly as the reader feels into their minds sister wright avoids none of the conflicts of black marriage black family life and her insights are relevant for now even though the setting is the depression years strong parental figures are worked throughout the story there is incest and the weaknesses which give rise to it themes of superstition undercurrent motivations for mariah and they do not really conflict with the strong reality of her christian religion but are interwoven and absorbed and traditionally so with her rational beliefs when i began the reading of this book i was tempted to feel that this is a womans book but it is not it is a book for black people and it is that because of the fullness with which sarah e wright has given us the panorama of a black family over several generations who have owned their own land and have been gradually losing it to a local white family as the story is created mariah discovers the reason for the loss and also discovers the blood relationship between the two families there are themes which all black people are familiar with the personal conflict between black and white the struggle for economic independence the parental will for security for one s children the guilt from infidelity with concommitant selfpunishment and conscience flagellation but these themes are not tired in this childs gonna live they are rather alive and challenging and involving as the pages are turned it is a creation well worth reading it has power and it lives and flows on october in the small town of brundidge alabama i was christened alexander by my parents james lucus and annie marshal bell this information was related to me by my grandmother who reared me from a baby both my parents died before my third birthday other than the fact that they both died young my mother from a chronic illness and my father from an injury suffered while serving in the second world war there is little that i know about my parents for some reason my grandmother never talked much about them and for the same reason perhaps i never asked many questions before my ninth birthday we moved to troy alabama another small town twelve miles north of brundidge there i grew up and lived a very normal childhood by my seventeenth birthday i was already a rapist a high school dropout a threetimes jailbird and well on my way to the reformatory school i hated and feared the world and felt that the world hated me how i came to that state of being is a long and complex story however i have always felt that the early death of my parents had much to do with the problems that i encountered during my adolescence at the date of my birth my grandmother was over fifty years of age had reared a large family mostly as a widow and was tired the task of adequately caring for a male child without the assistance of a man would present a difficult jobeven for a young woman for my grandmother the task was impossible in the streets my running pals were neighborsguys whom i had known most of my life and felt that i could trust two of them were my cousins sonny and love who were brothers the third one we called peanutthe joke around the neighborhood being that peanut had small dried up balls which resembled a pea of the three of us love was the oldest the strongest and the wisest peanut sonny and i always looked up to him as our hero and protector and during all those years that we were together i dont think love ever disappointed any of us whenever we would get into trouble after acting toughwhich we did often enoughlove would come to our rescue and our foe would always reconsider love as they say had a reputation peanut the youngest of the group was an amusing character of highly imaginative spirit who constantly sought adventure i find it very difficult to describe sonny except to say that he was cunning and he was loves brother it was peanuts love for adventure which led to my first encounter with the police it was saturday morning and a doublefeature was playing at the pike theater neither of us had any money and we both wanted to see the flicks as usual peanuts imagination came to the rescue the solution to our problem was simple we would steal iron from one junkyard sell it to another junkyard and with our earnings we could attend the movie it sounded easy enough to me ill never forget the shocked and disappointed look on my grandmothers face when she saw me standing in the doorway trembling tears pouring out of my eyes and knots swelling on my forehead where i had been beaten with a billy club with the burly white cop holding me by the collar of my shirt and blurting out indignantly auntie we caught this here rascal stealing iron if you wanna get this little thieving bastard back you better follow me down to the station in the following years i had many encounters with the police but i never hated any cop more than i hated that big dumbfaced bully that dragged me in guilt before my grandmother for many years to follow it would be difficult for me to live with her both of us would be tortured by a sense of failureour failure to understand each other the ironstealing episode was my first encounter with the cops but it wouldnt be my last during the following month i became totally disgusted with what might be referred to as the systemthe school the teachers the students the whole bitand began to hang out with love and sonnypeanuts iron stealing experience having slowed him down considerably at the house of a group of young ladies who were notorious for their charm the casey house became a place of recreation and a refuge there we drank booze gambled made love and ate and slept in a relaxed atmosphere by this time i had intellectuallyif not emotionallyrejected the moral standards of my grandmother and society in general the caseys home served as a source of inspiration to my rebellious attitude the happiness that i witnessed there confirmed my belief that many of the moral standards of society are not only useless but that in many cases they are a hindrance to the common good as for the casey girls i believe they are some of the finest people i have ever met but as with most black people in troy as with sonny love and me they were caught in a world of despair and as with most black people in troy they sought a means of escape but what made the caseys different from other blacks is that instead of seeking refuge in the church they sought relief as they saw fit one of the things i admired most about those girls was that during our many years of association i never knew or heard rumor of them having relationships with white men a phenomenon which occurred frequently in troy even among the high class negroes the caseys were black women nearing my fifteenth birthday i had completely quit school the immediate money in the streets as well as women and booze coupled with my dislike for authority were all factors which influenced my decision to become a dropout but perhaps the strongest persuasion was my knowledge of what happened to other guys who had their high school diplomas most of them seemed to be in worse condition than i the best that a black high school graduate in troy could hope for was a a week job as a delivery boy for a drugstore was aware of the fact that it was possible to make more money than that in one night on a billiard table or in a dice game i was convinced that the time one put into getting a diploma wasnt worth it however a series of events were to occur to change my opinion on october five days before my sixteenth birthday love sonny and i were confronted by an angry cigarchewing tonguebiting bill casey the indictment was seriousrape the night before sonny and i had gotten drunk from homemade whiskey while at the casey house bills woman came looking for him appearing highly drunk and highly sexy sonny suggested that if she couldnt find bill we would be glad to act as substitutes bessie mae said something to the effect that only bill could satisfy her we proceeded to prove her wrong at first everything seemed to be going fine sonny held her legs while i screwed i held her legs while he screwed and bessie mae seemed to be getting a kick out of it herself boastfully joking as we wrestled with her on the bed that she was too much woman for both of us then suddenly before we knew what was happening the house was full of buckeyed males pulling out their rods and hopping on bessie mae realizing that the situation was out of hand the two of us wished her good luck and made a fast exit stage right when bill learned that a train had been pulled on his woman he pretended to be fiercenot that he ever claimed to love her or anything like that his ego had been hurt as usual love came to our rescue and as usual he was persuasive billwho had a lot of respect for loveagreed not to press chargesprovided that we pay him a small fee and agree to stay away from the casey house we agreedtemporarily anyway approximately two weeks from the date of our meeting with bill i found myself picking beans on a small farm a few miles north of orlando florida my grandmother had somehow learned about the episode with bessie mae and i found it a little too uncomfortable at home the sense of disappointment and failure that existed between us had deepened to the point that she seemed to have developed an accusing indifference which was expressed in an ivegivenuponyou attitude the silence was too tormenting it buried me in guilt i had to escape i borrowed a few dollars from love a few from sonny and went south why i went south i dont know there has always been something downward about me my money gave out before i reached orlando so i said goodbye to the greyhound and started hitchhiking after walking for what must have been a couple of hours i came to a truckstop with a sign in front of it which read bean pickers wanted a basket i had never picked beans be fore but i was well familiar with the cotton fields of alabama besides i was broke and getting hungry for the first time in my life hard work was unavoidable i worked three weeks on the bean farm during which time i slept in the cab of a van i was the only black in sight my coworkers were white rednecks from the appalachian area of alabama who seemed to delight in having a strange black creature in their presence they assured me that no blacks were allowed where they came from they were very nice to me while working on the bean farm i did more thinking than i had ever done before it was obvious that i wouldnt last long picking beans it was late in august and all the beans would be harvested within a couple of weeksthree at the most after carefully pondering my fate i came to the conclusion that the best thing to do was to return home and reenter school i began to understand that the poor and uneducated would always be at the bottom level of a capitalistic society just like the poor rednecks in the field with me and the poor blacks back home i hated the system but i would try to use it besides i was lonesome i missed love and sonny and the caseys all the people and things at home i missed my grandmother fate was on my side the next day i caught a ride on a van all the way to bainbridge georgia that night i was picked up by the bainbridge police and spent hours in the bainbridge city jail i was thankful compared to the slanted seats of a van the cell bunk felt good from bainbridge i caught a chicken truck to dothan and from dothan i rode with a minister to troy i returned home and reentered school but instead of getting better things got worse i found it difficult to adjust to the authoritative atmosphere of the school the freedom and dangers of the street had made me somewhat of an independent and aggressive person i resented being told what to do how to do it and when and where to do it my instructors sensed my rebellious attitude and hated me i hated them even more i was sure that my experience in the streets had given me a certain awareness of life that many of them would never obtain as i reflect on those days i sometimes think my instructors knew this to be true maybe thats why their dislike for me was so great they found my constant questions on morals religion and race frustrating there were no answers in the instructors manual my problems at home werent getting any better either the tension between my grandmother and me reached its climax i ended up in jail on a disorderly conduct charge at this stage in my life i was years old for some reasoni find it less painful not to ponder the matter my grandmother withdrew charges from that point on my situation seemed to change for the better while in jail i made one important decision if i was to survive in this world would have to discipline myself i realized that it was much easier to make a decision than to execute it but i had to try things began to go my way the following year i joined a school organization known as the new farmers of america nfa an agricultural organization for black male students of the south the school director of the nfa mr julius kennedy is one of the few high school instructors i ever respected kennedy was a big man lie encouraged me to stay in school and as a result of his inspiration i participated in many nfa activities winning state and national honors my success with the nfa greatly increased my prestige on the campus the ds and es which i had been receiving in certain classes turned into as and bs even my problems at home tended to decrease i could sense a feeling of pride for me in my grandmother during my senior year in high school i felt myself slowly pulling away from the old crowdlove sonny peanut and the caseys we still hung out together at times but my class work i had a lot of catching up to do the nfa and a parttime job kept me busy ive never learned to like the system or institutionalized ways of doing things but by my senior year i was determined to attend college had nipped on the wine of success and i wanted a larger drink however the decision to attend college meant i had to work twice as hard as before i didnt have any money and my grades werent that good yet i had two aces in the game the first was my nfa record the second was mr julius kennedy they both came through on september entered through the college gates of the pride of the swift growing south to have the veil of ignorance lifted from my head i had a lot to learn it suffices to say that my general impression of the pride was sickening that impression has never changed approximately four months after i entered college a fellow student jimmy strong was shot in the back by a white service station operator because he sought to use the white restroom the college family marched in the rain while the murderer went free i repeatthe atmosphere was sickening a few weeks after jimmys death i received a telegram from home love was dead he had been knifed to death in a dice game the ironic connection between the death of jimmy and the death of love hit me like a stone jimmy was a college student love barely had an elementary education jimmy was of a middleclass family many times love had worked in the cotton fields while hungry jimmy had a working knowledge of political and racial concepts love understood the primitive law of the jungle the law of survival yet they shared one thing in common which outweighed all their differences they were both victims of a white racist society i marched for jimmy i wept for lovenot the strong proud and commanding love the love who was always seen by those who never really looked but the love who was seen by those who knew his mercifulness carol held her report card firmly in one brown hand and clung to the tall wire fence with the other peering through the spaces at the men working in the sun most of them were shirtless and sweat glistened on their backs and stained their pants as they carried their boards from one place to another making them into giant standing xs a drop of water trickled down one side of her face and dropped inside the collar of her apple green dress she clutched the report card her first a little tighter she hadnt waited at the flagpole today for sylvie now that she had completed kindergarten she felt that she was too old to be escorted to and from school so she had walked on alone feeling maturity on her like a coat of shiny paint that announced her new standing to everyone she passed she had intended to rush home before sylvie who lived next door could report her missing but she hadnt been able to resist stopping to watch the banging the lifting the excitement of a building growing she hoped that it would grow into a toy shop like the one downtown with the little player piano in the window or an ice cream store with hundreds of flavors to choose from two of the workmen standing a little apart from the others had stopped working and were talking carol watched thembig men with big frowning facesstraining to hear what was being said but their mouths moved silently like television when the sound was off their heads jerked as they stepped closer together and she could hear their voices now low and rumbling like a storm coming up then rising into a booming clap of thunder what you call me the man spoke the words slowly through his teeth his wet black chest shining like the seals carol had seen at the zoo you heard me i said nigger the other mans face was splotched with red and pale pink as if it had been pinched in certain selected spots and the thin mouth curled and twisted around the last word nobody nobody calls me a nigger curling and twisting his thicker lips pushed out the same word yous a lousy nogood nigger a few curious passersby stopped at the fence and the other workmen began to move toward the argument but too slowly to stop the black man as he picked up a board and smashed it against the pinched face man again and again until he fell to the ground with blood popping out all over and even afterward it seemed to carol that the first blow had thrown a switch to change the action from slow to accelerated motion so that now the workmen ran stiffly back and forth like windup dolls bending over the man on the ground and yelling at the other man who waved the bloody board in an angular circle in front of him and shouted stay away from me over and over in a hoarse voice by now a crowd had gathered at the fencelatecomers eager to hear the details and early arrivals eager to share their various versions there was a lot of gasping and several oh my gods and one tall man gently pushed carol away and carefully blocked her view she went as far as the other end of the fence and squeezed between a woman in a pleated skirt and a teenaged boy neither of whom paid any attention to her when the sirens approached the police cars screaming the ambulance hummingthe workmen backed off from the man still swinging the board his whole face was twisted now as only his mouth had been before and the policemens guns went off as the arm was swinging upward stopping it high in the air and reminding carol of the game of statues she had played at recess with patty and janet the police ordered the crowd away and most of them left though reluctantly carol headed down fourth street toward home again taking care not to invoke bad luck by stepping on the lines in the concrete her dress stuck to her back and her stomach felt funny she whispered nigguh nigguh to see if it made her lips curl she wondered what it meant carol baby it was her mother swooping down on her like a plump angel in a frilly apron she threw her arms around carol and squeezed her i heard the sirens and i thought and then angrily why did you leave sylvie im all right mama im big now carol said she was concerned that some of her friends might have seen her mother outdoors hugging her as if she were a baby her mother took her hand and carol had to trot to keep up with her when they reached the house her mother frostily sent her upstairs to change her clothes in her room she kissed jenny the redcheeked doll lying in the middle of the bed then changed into her yellow shorts and white blouse removing the green ribbon that held her short pony tail it didnt match she wishedagainthat her hair would grow long so it would swish from side to side and hit against her face as did the girls in the television commercials and so she could tie her own ribbons in the top drawer of the dresser she found a yellow one and holding it in one hand and jenny in the other went down to the kitchen her mother was in a better mood she kissed carol after she tied the ribbon and carol kissed her back enjoying the warmth of her mothers soft arms now that she was in the house and regretted having upset her mother mama whats a nigguh carol asked her stomach still felt a little fizzy so she only nibbled at the coconut cookies her mother had placed on the table for her she saw her mother pull the inscrutable secret face over her usually expressive one and realized that an answer would not be forthcoming she decided immediately that she wouldnt ask her father when he came in from work because although she had not yet figured out the correlation she knew that the questions and incidents that caused her mother to wear the secret face always angered her father its just a word baby her mother said finally nothing for you to be worrying your little head about finish your cookies so you can watch television carol took jenny with her into the living room to watch cartoons but found it hard to concentrateshe kept seeing the mens faces and the blood and hearing the shouts and sirensthat word it was the power of the word that frightened and fascinated her whether it was a malediction hurled with a pointing finger by a pinkfaced sorcerer or whether it was an attack by a black giant upon anyone who dared to use the forbidden word made no difference either way it was the word itself that held the power to transform a man carrying planks back and forth into the thing with the twisted face carol remembered the day not too long ago when her father had become so angry that hed smashed the glasstopped coffee table with the big orange ashtray he had been pacing the floor shouting about an electrician screwing in light bulbs and her mother had tried to comfort him dont worry so much about it honey shed said we cant change things thats the way they are carols father had picked up the ashtray and turned toward her mother then back to the coffee table and hit it generating cracks that travelled across the sheet of glass in intricate patterns since that day her father had been very quiet almost as if he were not really there when he talked to carol or laughed at one of her jokes she had the feeling that he was looking over her or beyond her at something far away but her fathers anger she knew had been about his job and some other things that she didnt understand not just one word she wanted her brother robbie to get home from junior high school he almost never failed to answer her questions when he had the time a commercial had replaced cartoons on the television set and it was the one with her friends in it the one about toothpaste she loved the glow in the little girls faces the silky beauty of the swishing hair and the swinging skirts she loved them all with the hope that one day she would be surrounded by them or people like themshiny joyous people and she would live happily ever after robbie slammed the front door and the small number of times his feet touched the stairs on the way up told carol that he was in a hurry she took jenny and scampered up the steps behind him hi shorty robbie said without stopping to look at her he was pulling baseball gloves shoes socks and bat from under the bed where you going carol asked where does it look like i want to ask you something not now he said pulling on his sweat socks im late i saw a great big fight and the police and everything she said rushing the words robbie looked up from tying his shoe what happened he hit him with a board because he called him a nigguh oh robbie jerked the shoe string what does it mean robbie he straightened up slowly carol saw his nose wrinkle and his eyes were blinking the way they did whenever she had asked a truly difficult question its its a bad name that white people call negroes what are negroes the word sounded familiar but she couldnt remember where shed heard it before people with brown skin like us you and me and mama and daddy and our friends well what are white people she asked puzzled as to who was left people with white skin they dont like negroes you always see em on television and downtown and like jenny well yeah only jennys just a doll after robbie had left to play ball carol went to her room and pulled out her toy chest she opened it and placed jenny face down in the bottom letting the pile of blocks and plastic chairs and books slide down on top of her she wondered if blood had popped out all over jenny she went to the mirror and examined her reflection dark brown face edged with tiny stubborn balls of hair short stubbly pony tail barely extending past the yellow ribbon she pulled off the ribbon dropping it on the dresser picked up her comb and took it downstairs to her mother mama will you plait my hair her mother took the comb smiling indulgently as she sat down on the sofa baby i thought you liked your pony tail carol sat on the stool at her mothers knee not any more she said perhaps the complexity of most west inl dian societies is very obvious because of the icqpttunisti heterogeneous nature of their composition aldous huxley in the introduction to alfred mendes first novel on trinidad entitled pitch lake observed that the islands mixed population was a gift to any novelist it was its variety of races religions and economic classes that prompted him to make such a remark west indian novelists have certainly not failed to exploit this gift of variety in the caribbean in order to fulfill their purpose as writers take almost any novel of recent years and you will find that whether the scene is set in one of the islands or on the mainland territory of guyana it is the unusual variety of social forces that gives paradoxically both a peculiar and a universal significance to the human drama depicted edgar mittelholzer was almost obsessed with the fact of ethnic confusion in the life and death of sylvia and a morning at the office even in the novels of wilson harris who can hardly be regarded as a social novelist one finds that the six peoples of guyana form the groundwork of his theme as treated in his metaphoric saga from the palace of the peacock to tumatumari although guyana and trinidad are the clearest examples of multiracial populations most if not all west indian societies are composed of the same four basic elements race religion education and money these determine the nature of what grantley russell a character in the life and death of sylvia describes as the complicated social setup in georgetown positively astounding how life goes on at all there are the whites in an exclusive little corner of their own then the highc coloured coloured in various compartments according to good better and best families with money and quality of hair and shade of complexion playing no small part in the general scheme of grading take two steps aside and youre up against the east indians in another cluster with a hierarchy of their own ranging from ricemiller to barristeratlaw and doctor and then down to busdriver chauffeur provisionshopkeeper and sugarestate coolie stumble around and youre face to face with the chinese either shopkeeper or business man stagger off a pace or two and youre sniffing at the portuguese split up into rumshoppawnshop class and professional man class and bigbusiness class my god if it isnt bewildering russell the expatriate englishman married to an illiterate guyanese in his stumbling staggering be wildering vision can hardly be said to hold things in a steady focus his impression is therefore naturally one of senseless confusion but even in a sober clinical analysis of racial types presented in andrew salkeys the late emancipation of jerry stover the impression remains of strains and tensions in the wouldbeemancipated jamaican elite from the bondage of race and colour in chapter four he provides the pedigrees of the chief characters who are a cross section of negro inidan chinese english jew syrian and carib the nature and action of religion vary with the particular history of colonization and immigration in the individual territories where the population is predominantly christian differences between protestants and catholics may come to the surface in times of crisis there is a legion of protestant sects and syncretistic cults in a number of west indian societies the extreme emotionalism of some of these religious bodies derives from african sources for example that of the shouters in trinidad is a legacy from the shango worship of the yoruba of west africa the religious fervor of some of these unorthodox sects and cults is sometimes exploited by demagogues for political ends as may be seen in v s naipauls the suffrage of elvira in guyana and trinidad the majority of east indians are hindu or muslim by religious persuasion naipaul deals mainly with the hindu community in the mystic masseur and a house for mr biswas in the former he studies the astuteness of ganesh the mystic masseur and selfcreated pandit in manipulating the rivalry of hindu groups to get himself finally elected to the legislative council of the island in a house for mr biswas naipauls satirical references to indians converted to christianity for material advantage are unmistakble but he seems to disregard the advantage of christianity as a liberating force from race and a step towards the intermarrying of indians and others in naipaul the hindu religion functions mainly as regards namegiving initiation marriage and death it will be observed that ganesh uses the bhagawat devotional readings and its feasting as a means of gaining favour with the hindu electorate the symbols of indian dress are similarly used by ramsumair ganesh for rising to the position of an executive member of the legislative council when he can safely doff the trappings of hinduism and bask in his european suit as g ramsay muir mbe as naipaul points out towards the end of the novel such a career as that of the mystic masseur would not have been possible without the advantages of the grammar school education for which his father could afford to pay education is the chief aid to social mobility as both xavier and jagabir in mittelholzers a morning at the office realize xavier is black but he knows that a black man can be mayor of port of spain tiger in samuel selvons a brighter sun too knows that the light of learning will show the way to progress and selfawareness many a west indian novel is in one way or another a commentary on the kind of education that makes a west indian into a g ramsay muir mbe or a mr indarsingh bachelor of arts of oxford university london england or perhaps something better than either of these now that there is a university of the west indies the universal bilingualism of the educated west indian fluent in the idiom of the people whether called creolese or by any other name and having also at will a conscious control of standard english is more often than not a sign of the dichotomy of culture that is due to exporting british education to the caribbean complete with bat and ball h o patterson shows this to be true in the case of alexander blackman the chief character in an absence of ruins nourished on just william cricket and celtic melodies blackman comments with nostalgia memory becomes the vehicle merely for the empty shells of melodies for the recollection of a friend who never existed for the odd blindly obeyed commands of a game i used to play for a child who used to walk from street to street and dream of other places of friends he did not know of heroes he did not understand of the adult he would one day become the adult whom he is now who dreams vainly of the boy he once was who used to dream so much the tension between the peoples idiom and the language of education is apt to cause a disintegration of individual personality and to widen the rift between the working class or peasantry and the middle class a combination of educational and economic factors seems to aggravate racial and color differences thus causing political fissures in the state the late emancipation of jerry stover shows the jamaican population falling into two main camps the voice of the people supported largely by the middle class and the just proletarian destineers to which the working classes belong these two parties represent the government and the opposition there is also the third minority nonpolitical group the rastafarian brethren the three groups are described by jerry as thieves on all three sides opponents on two and everybody rassing around and aspiring to middle class status jerry stover has just obtained his alevels and is a recruit to the civil service but he is unwilling to conform to the respectablility of the middle class to which he belongs he chafes against the routine of the service is oppressed by the claustrophobic atmosphere of island society and as an apparently irrational gesture of defiance he dedicates himself to debauchery with his fellow middle class termites pledged to undermine the establishment at heart jerry feels the futility of his way of life and a visit to the dungll turns his attention to the needs of the rastafarians with whom he identifies himself after resigning from the civil service he takes up his residence in the squalor of the rasta with the intention of helping to educate them and support their cause for rehabilitation but not for emigration he is joined by a fellow termite the nearwhite mason who is an oxford graduate their rastafarian interlude which begins in lent is an experience of shared communion between all classes and colors the rastafarian brethren in this way become for a time a symbol of the search on the part of all the characters for selfintegration and social unity peace and love the novels of salkey and patterson reveal a genuine desire to enter into the experience of the rasta cult since the brethren are a concrete manifestation of the social malaise in the west indies and also a symptom of the universal unrest typified in the characters of jerry stover and alexander blackman the rastafarians emerged as a social phenomenon before the passive beatniks of america or the activists of black_power roger mais so far ahead of the times wrote a perceptive and significant novel about the true ideal of the peace and love cult in brother man it is an ideal however overlaid in the popular imagination by the caricature of the rastafarian dream of a return to a romantic africa and betrayed by the inconsistent behaviour of adherents of the cult it is obvious that the emancipation of jerry stover and mason is one from traditional values and conventional ways of seeing things but their emancipation fails to bring lasting satisfaction salkeys gratuitous moralising on the frustration of the termites takes this form they all knew it in themselves some of them were willing to continue as they had been deluding themselves contradicting their hopes the others were frightened and panicstricken both sides were without a palliative they knew that black seal bad rum was never intended to be effective both sides were without a plan for their spiritual reclamation jerry and mason had claimed the dungll in desperation but they had not worked out a personal programme in terms of their claim they had not willed themselves to a balanced and precise attack on their weaknesses and cruel excesses they secretly feared a concerted voice a possible remedy they had no private philosophy no binding discipline no real faith in anything all they had was their freedom an emancipation that had come too late they had not had the time and the kind of society in which to use it intelligently to benefit from it to build on it it had come all at once in a frightening lump it had a tired colonial shape there had not been the time to divide it up to live with it to transmute it to put it to work for themselves and their islands destiny both salkey and patterson explicitly state that at least part of the reason for the failure to realize a sense of personal or national identity is the fact that west indian society lacks a true cultural heritage of its own there is what patterson calls an absence of ruins associated with the crum bling empires of the historic past in spite of his initial cynicism with regard to political parties and social reform jerry stover does try to commit himself to the rastafarian cause but alexander blackman in an absence of ruins does not wish to be committed to a world not worth winning when lloyd says we are black men in a white civilization and whether you like it or not youre committed to the freedom of your race blackman replies i dont want to spend my life being a negro or being a jamaican or being a socialist or a capitalist or what you like if you must know i simply want to be me to be what i am and that alone takes a lifetime of knowing avoiding involvement with society he ends by being an outsider without identity among the london crowds like ellisons invisible man in new york pattersons character laments an absence of ruins wilson harris strives to reconstruct from the history of guyana a present that contains all time and space associated with the caribbean yet the metaphysics of these two writers complement each other the former seeks fulfillment in the wholeness of the individual being through the negation of everything else the latter aims at the transmutation of all experience into the identity of the individual being when the writers at a recent conference of caribbean artists were being called upon to declare themselves unequivocally in their writings on the side of nonwhite minorities harris made a courageous defence of the noncommitted artist however to see his novels as unrelated to the human predicament of today is to misread him though not obviously engage like several other west indian novelists he is none the less engaged in the same quest for individual and national identity but a national identity that does not violate any human values in his recent novel tumatumari occurs the significant phrase immunity from race which is achieved by the anoni im uymous dead to achieve nity from race the chief characters have to absorb in their individual life the personalities and experiences of all the races of all the periods in the history of guyana the decimation of the amerindians and the slavery of negroes equally form part of the legacy of ruins on which to build the present the violation of cultures was the hidden reality of history itself upon which all things were converted and built and which one sought to fashion under the name of economic selfrighteousness and selfsufficiency though the drama of harris novel is played out against the guyana landscape the message is universal to expiate the past one must evoke from the depths of ones own complex psyche all the cruelty inflicted and all the suffering endured by all the races of mankind only in this way will selfawareness come and coming engender a sense of the sanctity of all life the west indians depicted in these novels strive to break through the old barriers of insularity and to cross the frontiers of hinterland fastnesses maybe there are important political implications in this fact the history of the black man in america has been one of end i less struggle against the forces of racism oppression and exploitation yet today years after the enslavement of our fathers we remain still on the fringes of society as a despised deprived decitizenized minority no longer held in physical bondage yet bound nonetheless by a history of social economic and cultural oppression which has been just as damaging in its effects as physical enslavement malcolm_x once said that nobody can give you freedom nobody can give you equality or justice or anything if youre a man you take it if you cant take it you dont de serve it the history of mankind amply demonstrates the essential truth of this statement the early american settlers did not wait for the british to give them their freedom they rose up and took it the natives of algeria and kenya and nigeria got their freedom not by asking but by acting and so it has been with oppressed people throughout the world the tragedy of black people in america is that we have never as a people risen up to demand our freedom and today we remain as enslaved as ever our lives and destiny controlled still by the descendents of those who a century ago decided to free us this freedom upon close examination however turns out to be highly illusory for it is generally known that that which the master gives he also can take away perhaps more so than in any other period of history black people today under stand and accept the essentia truth of this statement throughout black america there is the growing realization that black liberation can only be effected through black initiative on this there is no disagreement but how is this to come about what is required by what means are we to gain our freedom black_power vote power dollar power gun power black capitalism black nationalism reform the system overthrow the system under whose leadership core naacp urban league black_panthers us black community development the republic of new africa black economic development committee to begin to answer this question we might first stop to consider what do we mean by freedom the term is at once both complex and simple it is used both in an absolute and a relative sense on the one hand it refers to an ideal state in which men are free to pursue their interests and live their lives maximally unencumbered by external forces and power and on the other to certain specific rights and privileges to which all men are said to be entitled by either measure the freedom of the black man in america has been severely circumscribed for well over years before black people possessed few if any rights and while the emancipation proclamation freed the blackman from physical bondage it left him politically socially economically and culturally enslaved consequently the struggle for freedom since that time has moved on many different fronts following a variety of strategies and tactics all ostensibly concerned with bringing about the ultimate liberation of black america under the leadership of such men as w e b du bois a philip randolph james farmer martin_luther_king jr and many others important political social and economic gains have been made unfortunately the great majority of black people have failed to benefit from these gains thus disillusionment in the civil_rights movement began to appear in the mids with an increasing call for newer more militant strategies for the liberation of the masses ol black people and responses have begun to take shape in the hearts and minds of the ghetto and campuses across the nation as more and more of our youth begin to hear and to understand the teaching of men such as malcolm i say that you and will never get our freedom nonviolently or patiently or lovingly we will never get it until we let the world know that as other human beimis have laid down their lives for freedomand also taken life for freedomthat you and are ready and willing and equipped and qualified to do the same there are many who believe that the black_power movement represents the final stage in the black mans centuriesold struggle to free himself of white domination and oppressiona struggle that began with the first african warrior who chose death over slavery and has continued up through the urban uprisings of the s as noted the struggle has been marked by a variety of different strategies and programs the bootstrapism of booker t washington legal persuasionism of the naacp emigrationism of marcus garvey moral persuasionism of martin_luther_king jr and the early followers of core and sncc and most recently the black nationalism of malcolm_x and his numerous followers and disciples what then is the black_power movement and how are its goals and strategies distinguishable from those of other movements since the summer of when the term was first given public currency by stokely carmichael of sncc black_power has come to mean a host of different things to different people and organizations as first projected it constituted a denunciation and rejection of white liberal leadership in the civil_rights movement and a break with the philosophy of nonviolence it also signaled the rejection of integration as a primary goal and the assertion of a new black pride and identity challenged to go beyond sweeping generalities and to identify its program black_power advocates in sncc and core began to talk in terms of black people controlling the politics and economics of their communities sncc set out to organize an allblack political party in lowndes county alabama core a series of farming and business coops in mississippi and other states in the south early confusion over the meaning of black_power developed because of the failure to distinguish between black_power as a philosophy and strategy on the one hand and as a particular set of social political economic and cultural programs on the other there was never any real doubt among early advocates as to the meaning of black powei as a broadly defined strategy for change the central concern was and still is black people acquiring and exercising power in behalf of theii own interests or to put it simply black selfdetermination as a strategy black_power is applicable at least theoretically to a full range of social economic and political objectives it is not inherently socialistic capitalistic nor welfaristic its true ideological base is neither socialism capitalism or liberal welfarism black_power as a strategy of blacl selfdetermination is philosophically rooted in the unique psychosocial condition of the black man or in short in the collective black com sciousness as such black_power is a call to black people to rediscovej the richness of their own possibilities to open themselves spiritually morally and psychologically to the true meaning of their lives as expressed in the black mans own unique historically evolving culture implicit within the philosophy of bjack power is the ultimate creation of a more humane and just society whether such a society can be best realized under the capitalist socialist or liberal welfarist system is the point around which the debate has been joined black social scientists intellectuals and students of society in general have an important role to play in this debate granted the primitive state of knowledge in the social sciences and the overriding importance of ideology in the movement the black social analyst still has a responsibility to help sharpen the issues and weigh alternatives and in so doing assist in the making of decisions that are consonant with the goals of the movement the remainder of this paper constitutes an effort in this direction in the three years since the proclamation of greenwood black_power strategy and philosophy has been aligned with three more or less distinct ideological frames of reference assimilationism pluralism and nationalism the first is delineated in black_power and urban unrest by nathan wright chairman of the national black_power conference formed in and may be characterized as the assimilationist view the second is set forth in stokely carmichael and charles v hamiltons book black_power tne politics of liberation and may be characterized as the pluralist view the third is described in the works of a number of writers including leroi jones ron karenga eldrldge cleaver and most importantly malcolm_x and is generally characterized as the nationalist view the assimilationlst view of blaok power dr wright describes black_power as a short tenn strategy for ultimate integiation into the mainstream ol american life the reason this has not occurred according to this theory rests in the black mans failure to develop the kind ol group solidarity thzat made it possible for the early italian jewish and irish immigrants to enter the melting pot racism is recognized as a fact of american life but this can be overcome dr wright argues by a more equitable distribution of power among whites and blacks a situation which whites will be willing to help bring about once they understand that it is wot only morally right but in their best interest to do so blacks should band togefner in their own organizations under their own leadershi p and initiative and developand implement programs that not only meet their immediate material needs but also contribute to their selfdevelopment and growth into maturity whites should help to encourage this by sharing more equitably their power and resources this accomplished blacks will then be able to take their rightful place in the mainstream of american life the pluralist view of black_power according to the pluralist view american society is composed of a variety of different ethnic and interest groups all competing for various goods and services these groups operate not in accordance with what is good for the society as a whole but according to what tends to maximize their own interests the black man has been at a severe disad vantage in this process historically because he has lacked a sense of ethnicity or group solidarity it is necessary then for black americans if they are to compete on an equal basis with others to come together and build a common power base from which they can more adequately represent their social political and economic interests black people are said to possess a culture that is distinct and separate from that of other ethnic groups wbite racism has resulted in the denial and destruction of that culture which black men must now undertake to revive and restore to its natural and proper place in their lives until black people do this tlbey will remain in effect an underdeveloped semicolonized people assimilation into white middle class america should not be the black qnans objective rather his goal should be an effective share in the totai power of the societyimprovement in the political and economic st atus of black men is dependent upon the complete revision of the economic and political institutions in this society the nationalist view of black_power the nationalist view holds that the position of the black man ini america is that of a colonized people in a fundamentally racist society that is unwilling fund unable to change the only salvation for t o black man therefore is to band together throw off white oppressioiji by whatever means are necessary and proceed with the building of hiu own society separate and apart from that of white america the new black society will be built on social economic and political values which are different from and superior to those of america and western civilization before proceeding with a closer look at the above interpretations of black_power it should be noted that there is little disagreement among the three on the core meaning of the concept that is that black people should develop a greater sense of group solidarity and racial pride that the achievements of the civil_rights movement have fallen short of benefiting the masses of black people that organizations and institutions in the black community should be controlled and directed by blacks that white racism constitutes the core of the black mans problem that the black freedom movement must be led by blacks that black people have the right and the responsibility to defend themselves against violent attack and that black_power is sought not as an end in itself but as a means to the liberation of black america differences revolve around the way in which the ultimate goal is defined and the tactics by which liberation will be achieved it is not altogether correct to refer to the above views just outlined as theories of black_power to do so would imply that a lot more serious effort has been devoted to the study and analysis of the movement than is actually the case in the three years since greenwood the most penetrating study and analysis has been attempted by carmichael and hamilton in their book black_power politics of liberation and even though this book falls short of articulating a truly comprehensive revolutionary concept of liberation it goes well beyond the nontheoretical somewhat preachy effort by nathan wright jr in black_power and urban unrest dr wright incidentally has turned out an even more disappointing statement in his latest book let us work together robert allen in a pamphlet published by the guardian press in dialectics of black_power identifies and discusses briefly what he detects as five approaches to black_power allen however makes the mistake as i have suggested above of confusing the philosophy of black_power with particular political and economic programs several white writers notably arnold berman christopher lasch g and arnold schuchter have attempted to deal with the subject but have only succeeded quite unexpectedly in demonstrating the thoroughness of the white mans ignorance of the true inner meaning of black liberation schuchter provides a brilliant analysis of the problems of contemporary america but arrives at the pitiful conclusion that black freedom depends on white power at any rate it should be clear that the black liberation movement if anything is concerned with social change of a very fundamental sort as such it becomes important for the move iment to define with some degree of precision what it intends to change to what and how or in other words to develop a theory or set of guidelines by which the black mans ultimate liberation in america will be accomplished the importance of this point has been urged by such writers as harold cruse james boggs and most recently by lerone bennett jr in a brilliant analysis of the movement in the august edition of ebony magazine a theory of social change should set forth at least three things the structure and dynamics of the situation in which change is sought or is occurring the nature and character of the change that is sought or is occurring and the process by which change is to be sought or is occurring the question now becomes to what extent do the three positions noted above begin to deal with such matters first of the three the assimilationist view espoused by nathan wright and others would appear to be least concerned with bringing about significant social change to the degree that social change implies basic institutional change the assimilationist is not concerned with changing the basic values of american society but with gaining greater participation in the existing social economic and political institutions on which these values are said to be based in this respect black_power assimilationists in actuality operate within the tradition and philosophy of the now moribund civil_rights movement the goals are essentially the same only the strategies have changed for this reason it is questionable whether the assimilationist view can be appropriately included in the confines of a philosophy that clearly seeks to transcend the integrationist reformist civil_rights movement of the s and s at first glance black_power politics of liberation might seem to argue a strictly pluralist point of view close reading of this book however does not support such a position christopher lasch in one of the earliest attempts at an analysis of the black_power movement takes carmichael and hamilton to task for failing to note and deal with the contradiction between the pluralist perspective and the colonized people analysis which lasch says the authors attempt to treat simultaneously in their book actually laschs criticism is based on a serious misreading of carmichael and hamilton true the authors discuss similarities between the black mans efforts to build a power base within the black community and those of earlier european immigrants along the same lines they also call attention to the pluralistic basis on which american political life is organized but nowhere do they suggest that the ultimate aim of the black_power movement is to gain black group integration into the existing pluralistic structure of american societ rather they seem to state very clearly that the organizing of a stroi black political and economic base is a necessary preparatory move towa the ultimate liberation of afroamericans from the control and domin tion of the mother country although not explicitly stated the unde lying tone and intent of carmichael and hamiltons analysis is clear nationalist for this reason it is perhaps more logical to include tl views advanced in their book within the larger framework of natio alism rather than in a separate and distinct category which as we find close analysis does not seem to be completely warranted we are le then with two rather than three organizing frames of reference assimil tionism and nationalism black nationalism far from constituting a single undifferentiate phenomenon encompasses a variety of meanings some of which m be stated as follows emigration back to africa establishment of a separate black nation within the geographic confines of the usa the position of the black muslims ac the republic of new africa the organization direction and control of all institutions in tl black community in accordance with the prescriptions and pe spectives of a separate and distinct black culture this is sa to be the main thrust of black_power politics of liberation constitutes the pluralistic position very often unstated of nume ous individuals and organizations the eventual creation of a federation of citystates politicalt controlled by blacks throughout the usa apparently the pos tion of national core s e anderson identifies what appeal to be two orientations in this group those who envision tl american politicoeconomic structure as legitimate and thus see to enter it by initially withdrawing and building the blackenir cities into politically and economically quasiautonomous cit states destined to vie for influence and control of white america capital and resources and the other group being those wfc believe black cities can be simultaneously independent of tl american politicoeconomic structure and also exist within it i as noncapitalist communal enclave the building of a sense of ethnicity and cultural unity amor black americans with little or no real concern for the remakir of the basic institutions and values of the society an essentially apolitical position attributed by some to the cultural nationalists as a group the overthrow of capitalism and the building of a socialist society those who hold this view seemingly fall into two groups the first see afroamericans as the revolutionary vanguard that will ignite the long predicted proletarian overthrow of capitalism with blacks assuming an equal part with white allies in building the new society this approximates the position of the black_panthers the second group envisions a new socialist society organized and controlled completely by blacks this view is set forth in the black economic development committees black manifesto announced earlier this year how then do black nationalists view the black mans situation today the following statements based on the thoughts and ideas of numerous proponents of black nationalism attempts to answer this question a black nationalists see america as an essentially racist society bent on pursuing a policy of systematic exploitation and oppression of its black population beginning with the introduction of slavery in the s and continuing virtually unchanged through the next years although occasionally modified under pressure at home and abroad eg emancipation fepc the supreme court desegregation decision etc racism still constitutes the chief defining characteristic of race relations in this country today its practice is not limited to any one area of social activity it is rooted systematically in the policies practices values norms and standards of american society its role in the shaping of americas economic political and cultural institutions has been of central importance in short racism far from being a marginal or isolated phenomenon is in fact endemic to the american way of life its removal therefore necessarily implies changes that go to the very heart of the countrys existence eg capitalism representative democracy etc the country however despite its growing public condemnation and disavowal of racism is adamant in its opposition to any attempt to effect fundamental changes in its basic economic and political institutions consequently black people as a group are left locked in a position of virtual peonage b up until recently black men have mistakenly relied on the gooc will and moral consciousness of white america in their fight for a bettei life in so doing they have found that the small amount of progress they have been permitted to make has been at the expense of their identity and sense of worth in order to move ahead and gain acceptance in the larger society black americans have been forced to deny and reject their own racial and cultural heritage and to accept the implied superiority of the white mans culture and ways of doing things the resultj ing pattern of selfhatred aided and abetted by white racism has served to destroy social cohesion in the black community and thereby to restrict its capacity for effective group action contrary to the generally held belief this is not a society of individuals but of separate ethnic and interest groups consequently the philosophy of individualism as promoted both by the liberals and conservatives in this country has had the effect of retarding the growth and development of the black population c the oppression of the black man in america is part of a longstanding pattern of oppression directed by whites against the nonwhite people throughout the world the same forces that operate to keep the black man in this country in a subjugated semicolonized state are also responsible for the subjugation of the oppressed people of africa asia and latin america the decolonization struggle in these countries and the black liberation struggle in america are part of a common effort to defeat a common enemy d the american class system supports and perpetuates racism which in turn constitutes a vital factor in the growth and development of that class system each supports and feeds on the other for example middle class suburbia is substantially the product of racist policies adopted and pursued by the american government and society the socalled american dilemma described by gunnar myrdal does not in fact exist it is not in the interest of america to extend complete freedom justice and equality to the blackman to do so would undermine or radically alter the fundamental basis on which the society is organized e the american philosophy of the pursuit of economic activity for selfish gain is destructive of the well being of society as a whole and the well being of black people in particular it operates to keep the masses of black people in a permanent state of impoverishment and to keep black people divided one from the other while the key to our liberation rests in unity f the accepted channels for inducing change are heavily biased toward the maintenance of the society as it exists these channels almost always operate in the interest of white america and seldom in the true interest of black america such changes have been brought about through established procedures and have produced little or no improvement in the position of the masses of black americans small gains registered during the last years have only come about because of internal and external pressure brought to bear against the american government contrary to what the country wants to believe of itself and what it would have others believe of it america is not and has never been motivated in the main in its dealings at home and abroad by moral or humane considerations public and private responses to the plight of the black american far from being humanitarian or beneficial have resulted in deepening the slavelike dependency blackmen have suffered since gaining their freedom in this in brief summarizes the black nationalist view of the social order in which the afroamerican finds himself today the social analyst presented with this description naturally wants to know what evidence exists to support its validity the most readily available evidence of course is written in the daytoday lives of this countrys million black citizens beyond this documented support exists in the work of numerous reputable students of american society the compilation and analysis of this material is a task that warrants the attention of black liberation theoreticians and i for one hope to deal with it in the near future to complete this paper however i would like to turn now to a description and discussion of the stated goals of black nationalism what are the goals of black nationalism what aspects of the present social order does it seek to change the answer to this and related questions of course may be found to some extent in the black nationalist analysis of american society from what has been said earlier about the variety of meanings attached to the philosophy of black nationalism it follows that no uniform agreement exists on the specific endgoals of the movement to reiterate some advocates see the establishment of a separate autonomous black nation within the confines of the u s as the ultimate goals of the nationalist movement others are thinking in terms of developing a federation of municipal governments that are expected to come under black political control during the next to years still others talk in terms of maximizing black control of the social political economic and cultural institutions in areas where blacks constitute a majority a fourth goal is said to be concerned with promoting cultural and ethnic unity among black people without primary regard at this time for the achievement of black political or economic autonomy with the possible exception of the last mentioned group all black nationalists reject americas economic and political instiutions as inimical to the interests and liberation of black americans some speak in terms of socialism as the alternative others of a still to be defined cor munalism no one has been able thus far to describe in detail ti operation of proposed alternative economic systems or how they mig coexist within americas present capitalist system the one exception this might be the black_panther political party which openly embrac the socialist philosophy preached and practiced by mao tse tung i china for the panthers the question is not one of coexisting wil capitalism but of replacing it altogether with socialism the saw can also be said about the goals of the black economic developme committee which as set forth in the black manifesto envision a blad takeover of the entire country and establishment of a socialist societl for the most part black nationalist economic alternatives have bed largely piecemeal shortrun reformist proposals designed to broada black participation in the existing economic system for example cor has developed a community development corporation proposal the in tent of which presumably is to establish black control over all fund coming into the black community it is far from clear however thj such a program is likely to do much in the way of establishing economl selfsufficiency in the ghetto or in a yet to be established separate blad nation perhaps in this idea we can begin to see the first move towarl the development of a new economic system that might be described a communal capitalism numerous other questions come to mind fq instance what kind of educational system will the new nation set ud how will it deal with the problems of juvenile delinquency drug addij tion illegitimacy alcoholism and broken homes in raising such quej tions the purpose is not to challenge the viability of the goal or to caj doubt on the possibility of building a viable new nation the purposl is rather to face boldly some of the difficult issues and problems thl movement must inevitably confront and deal with in the years ahead obviously detailed final answers can not be worked out a priori to sud gest as much would be unrealistic but now is the time to begin thinkin about such matters even as we prepare for the day of our ultimat liberation to repeat what are the goals of the black nationalist movement first let me suggest that it would be helpful to approach the subjec from the point of view of immediate intermediate and ultimate or end goals earlier i noted what may be described as six types of black na tionalist endgoals none of these common reason tells us are likely t be achieved overnight the question then becomes what are the im mediate and intermediate goals or objectives that must be achieved ii order to take the movement from where it is today to where it hope to be ultimately or to put it another way what are the necessary immediate and intermediate goals on which the achievement of the movements endgoals logically rest it is to this critical question that i would now like to turn first black nationalism in america no matter the specific form it takes is revolutionary in that it opposes and seeks to alter the basic values and institutions of the existing social order whether stated directly or not revolutionary intent is an integral part of the goals and philosophy of the black_panthers the republic of new africa the black student union movement and cultural nationalist groups such as those led by leroi jones and ron karenga without fail black nationalists are concerned with black political economic social and cultural selfdetermination a goal which is not likely to be peacefully granted by white america such is the case regardless of whether the aim is to establish a separate black nation or to take over control of the schools or businesses in the black community this is not to argue that the realization of black nationalism in this country necessarily implies the exercise of armed force or violent strategies in some cases armed conflict will be inevitable in others highly probable in either case black nationalism as a revolutionary movement demands if anything maximum unity and social cohesion rooted in a consciousness of common purpose and social need as defined by black nationalist philosophy this i submit is the central defining condition around which immediate and intermediate goals of the black nationalist movement must be developed the tragedy of the black man in america is that over the years he has come to identify with and to accept those aspects of american society that constitutes the prime source of his degradation and oppression selfcentered materialism colonial welfarism gradualistic reformism and cultural assimilationism to mention but a few the acceptance of these values has undermined and all but destroyed the blackmans capacity to see understand and act in behalf of his own best interests while at the same time it has kept him permanently immobilized outside the gates of affluence in a perpetual state of false hopefulness it is this condition that black nationalism must alter on its way toward creating the requisite degree of revolutionary black consciousness among the masses this means developing programs and activities that expose the falseness and exploitativeness of the countrys class system that encourages black people to go beyond the crippling strictures of liberal reformism and to challenge in radically new ways and forms the conditions in which they find themselves that promote a greater sense of ethnic cooperation and racial communalism these are offered not as concrete programs which clearly they are not but as standards by which to measure the value or utility of the shortrange program proposals and action plans if it hopes to gain and maintain a sense of relevancy the movement must speak to the concrete needs of the people as they are experienced today but the challenge is to do so in a way that is likely i to heighten and not retard the growth of revolutionary black consciousness among the masses of black people examined in this way programs such as those promoted under the label of black capitalism or those which directly or indirectly contribute to the growth of elitism in the black community clearly constitute a hinderance to the black nationalist liberation process whether programs such as model cities antipoverty community health or even cores community development corporation ultimately serve to hinder or to help the process depends largely on the revolutionary consciousness of the black leaders who are a part of such programs the potential is there what is required is the revolutionary will to capitalize on it thus citing colonial welfarism a category under which most of the above noted programs fall as destructive to the liberation process is not to suggest that all welfare programs are to be rejected automatically what must be rejected however is the underlying philosophy that encourages docile slavelike dependency among the people who are intended to benefit it would be tragic however if the movement had to depend on government funded welfare programs as its only or prime means of reaching the people fortunately there are others outstanding among which is that of political action organized and unorganized cultural activities represent another moving on to a third major question that any theory of social change must inevitably address itself to how or by what process will the black nationalist movement achieve its objectives here we must consider each of the forms of black nationalism separately as alluded to earlier organizations such as the black_panthers and the republic of new africa see armed revolution as a necessary and inevitable part of the liberation process the panthers envision a proletarian overthrow of the capitalist system the republic of new africa foresees widespread guerilla warfare initiated in the south and spreading to the populous cities of the north some who envision the creation of a federation of cities under black control stress political organization and political action others emphasize cultural regeneration and cultural revolution outstanding among the former group is core and among the latter such groups as those led by leroi jones and ron karenga revolution armed political and culturalis the principal means by which alternative forms of black nationalism hope to effectuate the goals of black liberation the success of each as already noted will depend substantially on the achievement of a condition of revolutionary readiness among the masses of black people or at least a significant minority thereof it is possible that this will come about through the organized efforts of activists in the nationalist movement or as a reaction to stepped up repression of the liberation movement in general or in response to unforeseen development on the international scene or all three the situation at the moment hangs in balance there are forces that seem to be pushing events more and more in the direction of revolution there are counter forces that tend to check and negate the drift toward revolution among the former i include the following continued ghettoization of blacks in the urban areas and selfsegregation of whites in surrounding suburbs the deepening economic plight of the masses of blacks i relative to the condition of the average white american increasing militarization of urban police forces accelerating thrust of the philosophy of black_power and the black cultural revolution the accelerating thrust of a white student movement sympathetic to the goals and objectives of black liberation among the countering forces i include continued growth and prosperity of the black middle class continued spread of i colonial welfarismimproved public assistance grants antipovertyl programs model cities programs black capitalism etc continued generalized commitment among black people to the capitalist ethic of the pursuit of economic activity for private gain selfcentered material ism nationwide encirclement and repression of liberation movement leadership and membership which of the above set of forces will prevail no one can truly say the apocalyptic predictions of marxist determinists have failed to maj terialize as a result the deterministic approach to history and social change has been largely discredited c w mills position on historical change is probably closer to the truth than that of the economic determinists when he says to be grounded in history is to expect of the future that which does not follow mechanically but flows from large decisions not yet made and to be sure it is the large decisions noj yet made that revolutionary black nationalism must seek to influence if it hopes to swing future events in the direction of its ultimate aims and purposes in summary black nationalists argue that significant change in the black mans position in this country can only be brought about througl revolutionary overthrow of the existing social economic and politic structure some hold that the chief instruments of change are necessari violent others political and still others cultural the most pressing issi at this point may not be which of the three is correct in a final or ultimai sense but rather given the situation that exists in america today an among black people in particular which of the three instruments change would appear to be most strategically viable at this point i history numerous observers in recent years have drawn a parallel betwee the oppressed black people of america and the colonized people of th third world they are quick to point out that the liberation struggle in the countries of the third world have been characteristically violen affairs and that the struggle for black liberation in this country must alsj proceed along the lines of armed revolution it should be clear howeven that the parallel between the blacks of america and the oppressed of thl third world is far from exact aside from certain obvious difference on the question of prior ownership of and the relative numerical strengtl of the colonized vs the colonizers other important differences exist witl respect to the predominant modes of control and oppression employed by the mother country although historically terroristic activity and arbitrary proscription of civil liberties have been systematically employed against blacks in this country these arc no longer the chief instrument of oppression that they have been in the past the black man in americi and in the newly emerging nations of the third world suffer not sc much from terroristic domination and control as from domination tha stems from enforced economic political and cultural dependency on the mother country the mechanisms of repression center less in the police and the military and more in the farreaching patterns of racial discrimination in housing employment and education colonial welfarism and cultural suppression the domination of afroamericans has been made complete by the destruction and removal of all possibility for the development of a black cultural base forcing blacks to rely on the cultural prescriptions and guidelines of the culture of the oppressor the road to the liberation of the blackman in america would seem to lead at this time not through armed revolution but through the assertion of black cultural autonomy or in other words a black cultural revolution to repeat the problem we presently face is not primarily one of widespread terrorism physical coercion or arbitrary denial of civil liberties these are no longer the chief means of oppression in this country the problem we now confront is one of domination by social economic and political institutions that have been organized and which operate in such a way as to keep black people in a permanent state of subjugation it is important to point out however that the source of oppression rests not only in the form or the structure of these institutions but also and perhaps most importantly in their very substance or content in the past liberation efforts have tended to focus on the former we have since come to understand that change must be brought about in both the form and the content for instance modifying or opening the capitalistic structure in the interest of promoting greater black participation does nothing to change the substance of capitalism yet it is the substance its essentially racist and exploitative core that serves to keep the masses of blacks subjugated and dominated at home and abroad the structural approach to change is based on the assumption that the black mans problem is essentially one of exclusion consequently the answer to the problem becomes one of structuring the black man into the prevailing system the problem however goes much further than that the problem exists because the core values goals and objectives of americas basic institutions are inimical to the interests of black people the first step toward changing such institutions must be the building of a black cultural base or frame of reference out of which new answers to the plight of the blackman can be fashioned the only frame of reference that the afroamerican now has is that of his oppressor new social political and economic forms and contents cannot be projected or realized in the absence of alternative cultural perspectives the aim of the black cultural revolution must be to furnish such alternatives there is ample evidence that the process is already well underway on the college campuses in the public schools and hundreds of cultural organizations throughout the country to reiterate the basic institutions and practices of a people are determined by its culture the projection and realization of alternative liberating social forms and institutions for afroamericans rests upon the development of a cultural matrix out of which the substance of these new forms will be shaped the liberation of the black man in america cannot go forward in the absence of a generalized cultural revolution in the black community finally the theory of black liberation through armed revolution at this point in the history of the afroamerican must be seriously questioned for several other reasons than those outlined above a black america presently lacks the material and military base for successfully carrying out a revolution on its own against the most powerful military and industrial country in the history of the world b there does not seem to be in the country today among the white population revolutionary allies with sufficient political economic or military resources at this time to make a difference in armed struggle and c for the immediate future armed revolution is only likely to produce catastrophic repression of black people and a severe setback to the ultimate triumph of the afroamerican liberation struggle let me be clear the above is not intended as an argument in favor of the single strategy approach to black liberation neither armed conflict nor political action can be summarily dismissed as unimportant the issue has to do with where our primary efforts should be concentrated at this time black people would be foolish not to take seriously j the threat of genocide and to prepare themselves accordingly just as it is unthinkable that we should not prepare ourselves to capitalize fully on the opportunity for political control of the many urban areas that will come our way during the next to years however unless we develop political social and economic forms that transcend those that have been the source of our oppression for centuries then in truth we will have gained a hollow victory should political or military victory come our way it is only through consciously disengaging ourselves from the cultural matrix out of which existing institutions are fashioned that we can begin to get into position to develop newer more humane social forms and institutions in this sense i agree wholeheartedly with harold cruse who holds that in america the key to the liberation of the blackman hinges on the development of a revolutionary movement that is social political economic and cultural and that there can be no revolution in the u s without cultural revolution this undoubtedly is a topic that deserves much more discussion in the near future i hope to go into it in greater depth in conclusion may i say that the above analysis of black_power and black nationalism in my opinion not only offers a more systematic approach to program development than has been evident in the movement to date it also serves to call attention to something that organizational differences within the movement have tended to obscure and that is the substantial amount of agreement that exists among black nationalists with respect to the analysis of the black mans position in america and the broadly defined strategies necessary for ultimate liberation where they differ and i have no desire to conceal or to cover up such differences is on the matter of the definition of endgoals there is no way in the final analysis of determining at this juncture which of the views are correct there seems to be little evidence quite frankly of any significant support for the newly revived backtoafrica movement but l between the black_panthers the republic of new africa black federationists and the cultural nationalists who is to say which if any history will prove to be correct the ultimate outcome as argued above will be determined by a variety of historical forces of which black nationalist organizations constitute but a part although a critically important part but whether black nationalism succeeds in winning over a majority of afroamericans to its philosophyor at least a significant minority will be determined to a very considerable degree by further developments at home and abroad here i have in mind such things on the domestic front as whether the country decides to undertake allout repression of the escalating liberation movement or whether it chooses to initiate quite unexpectedly a truly comprehensive national effort to elevate the economic social and political position of its million black citizens or to continue along its present gradualist course on the international scene the materialization of war in south africa or in other parts of the third world could have a profound influence on the afroamerican liberation movement these are matters of course which deserve much closer study than can be undertaken in this particular paper in the meantime and even while recognizing severe limitations on the predictability of the social sciences the search for a theoretical base for the liberation movement should certainly go forward to be sure ideology in the long run will play a more decisive role than the offings of science yet afroamerican students of human relations and society in general have a responsibility to apply whatever skills and knowledge they possess toward the ultimate triumph of the goals of black liberation this paper is offered as one step in that direction a sure thing about clarence majors first novel allnight visitors olympia is that a lot of us particularly the soul sisters do or will not like it and will not think too highly of clarence major for writing it this will be because eli bolton the central character in allnight visitors is an aimless cockhound whose scores are mostly with white chicks and he describes all of his sexbased relationships with vivid detail in the first pages understand ably the novel might not be finish by some who pick it up still i b lieve there are reasons why majc editor of the new black poetry h offered us what appears to be a sti novel i believe his reasons are erary and social eli an orphan is a veteran of tl nam he is a numbed soul broth but not because of the nam exp rience he observes the world car fully and is hip to whats happenii around him he can dig the muslithing and flavors his sexvocab with swahili his story a firstpersonpresent narrative is a wandering outwardwhirling vortex of flashbacks dreams smells and commentary on his own precocious sensibility the present tense brilliantly projects the authors poetic imagination as do the numerous metaphors whieh are skillfully handled eli hustles through his limo with intentions to hold an honest job he works one gig at the other side hotel of onenighters later he is a sodajerk at goldburgs drugcounter three white chicks and two soul sisters fall in and out of elis range of need and circumstance there is tammy the unsophisticated impulsive liar from the midwest the restless cathy a prolonged loveobject eunice elis willowy sophisticated new england angel anita a boss soul momma and loveobject and clara a daughter of elis foster parents the novel is constructed so that the two black women and what they mean to eli are described nearest the center at the end elis three white objectangels also spin away from his grasp as we weave through elis tangled story we find that the main plot involves jimmy sheraton a white excomic turned drunkard nuisance and his death the derelict who claims that a black momma raised him is booted out of goldburgs by brogan the stores bad black assistantmanager eventually he decided to follow eli home bugging him on the subway preferring to avoid letting his irritation get the best of him eli walks swiftly to his pad stopping the youth near his destination sheraton is attacked by three young soul brothers who assume the responsibility of protecting members of the black community sheratons death is a beefkill at heart eli is a hedonist motivated only by an unquenchable de sire to tcb he is ensnared by apathy and harassed by the proximity of circumstance he will not neglect or forsake his rod in fact in the presence of women it is truly a fetish eli possesses a clinical curiosity sheratons death the brutal killing of the wardens pup at the orphanage and the rapekilling of a vietnamese child find eli in a frontrow seat massaged by the medium by the end of his narrative he will have acted in such a manner that even he doesnt fully realize the degree to which his actions permit him to break out of his malaise first he offers a confession of being witness to the beefkill in order to save the three soul brothers from the chair gazing at the nape of one youths neck as he is led from the interrogation room eli muses the view of an early defeat or the beginning of a kind of human victory his second redemptive deed comes with the offering of his living accommodations to a nonenglish speaking pregnant puertorican mother of seven whose husband has ousted them from their own upstairs apartment this is effective dramatic irony we will realize immediately the significance of these actions before eli does allnight visitors as a novel of a young black mans psychic travels contain some very believable people besides the narrator himself whether the characters are objects of elis passion andor are structural props they hold our interest because elis keen eye brings out their personalities with candor even when in the novels structure they appear to come and go as phantoms they are adequately developed as a stylist major has been influenced by henry miller and anais nin his delivery is poetic and the finished product has his own earthy touch in the fashion of ishmael reed major exploits the possibilities of surreal comedy and the ludicrous for momentary effect in descriptive content the sex scenes are reminiscent of the writings of john cleland and desade though no writer today needs these people as models the orgiastic scene with the foxy anita is described with brilliant sibilance despite the fact that lengthy sex scenes seem a standard or a necessity for the acceptable contemporary american novel the success or failure of allnight visitors will ultimately lie with what it represents as a novel by a black american writer most of us agree that white americas current psychosexual fixation represents part of its demise the fact to consider is majors intent in starting out on this rubbish heap with his first novel if we give allnight visitors an absolute condemnation it would contradict a casually accepted image both in and outside of art of the walking black phallus an image eli doesnt mind fulfilling this image has been assumed at times because it is what white america thinks of the black man in the first place but in majors novel we do watch an apathetic black man take his first steps toward maturitysocial community responsibility eli bolton is a numbed individual sex is his only meaningful outlet eli too is not by himself allnight visitors depicts a libidinous urge but its character is headed in a worthwhile direction he begins to live up to his honorable name when he acts in a manner that will attest to his selfless responsibilit to reach out for others clarence major has the novelist talent but since he is contributing t contemporary afroamerican litera ture his craft should be highlighte by a central character who is able t carry the aesthetic motion of thl story on a more active social level major already shows signs of bein able to handle the psychologica drama the afro novel today mus project meaningful social concept and spiritual values into the blood stream of black america and thi can be done and done well with al the possibilities of style and messag taken into account in order to tel his story in order to get the message across major gives us both what we want and dont wanthis decisior to do so is the artists prerogative anc his energyvision is involved in the tell in a of truths what would have been the significance of john coltrane for example if he had giver the people the music they would have preferred to hear it is my guess that clarence major sees beyond this novel to the real needs of the black community as those needs can be expressed and illustrated through fiction soul brother eli bolton represents the living problem of apathy and as both a wanderer of the psyche and a sexual waystation his initial steps toward selftransformation were inevitable and justify his honesty ron welburn if leroi jones and other black artists hadnt already impressed me with the necessity of ignoring fire hydrants i could possibly be disturbed by mr john hicks novel the long whip david mckay fortunately jones admonition that black people should avoidthe ludicrous posture of attempting to communicate with fire hydrants ie people whites generally whose consciousness is equivalent to that of a fire hydrant conditioned my reaction to a book that blatantly utilizes the most hackneyed and offensive stereotypes of black people once you are convinced of the essential insanity of trying to converse with fire hydrants then it is impossible to be disturbed over a book written by one in fact the only possible reason i can see for reviewing this book at all is to document the fact that writers like hicks still exist that they are still being published and read and that white writers in america are still trying to market what they do not believe in and what they usually cannot understandthe complex humanity of the black man perhaps simply knowing the truth about american white literary traditions is in itself a form of liberation the story covers the short life of a black slave ridiculously named ben franklin from the time he is sold to a white master in new orleans until he dies fighting for his rights as a freedman during reconstruction one would have to look back to the novels of white southern unrealists like thomas dixon and thomas nelson page to find a more repugnant picture of black slaves than hicks has created in the long whip william styrons portrayal of nat turner another dehumanized myth from the decay of white fantasy seems by comparison positively innocent and wellintentioned because of its basic insincerity the book never rises to the level of art so there is no need to be sidetracked by such aesthetic considerations as technique or style or to be overly concerned with the artistic merits of this book it is first of all poorly constructed events follow one another with as little motivation and as little relationship as you are likely to find in items on a grocery list secondly the only theme the author remembers to develop with any consistency is the idea that bens freedom is somehow tied up with his subconscious desire for a white woman that he must conquer this inner repressed urge before he will be totally free since this theme crops up two or three times in the novel which is at least once more than any other idea i assume it must have some sort of importance what passes for characterization in the long whip is intentionally crude and vulgar every conceivable and banal black stereotype squatting in the degenerate imagination of mr hicks is displayed here there is odette the young beautiful mulatto slave girl whom ben falls in love with her sole purpose in life is to solicit a wealthy white patron to set her up in style in the french quarter from time to time from whichever white mans bedroom she is currently occupying she is permitted to mutter a few lines of coarse dialogue you like odette she purred that good huh you lie still odette show you more big man you good so good pp other than some lecherous remarks to ben about the size of his genitals and a series of barbaric nativestyle guttural laughs that is practically all that odette the major black female character is allowed to say or think or feel justine the faithful old slave woman who loves her master and his family too much to leave them is another favorite white myth that appears after she is given her freedom she makes the typical tearful and loyal pronouncement law mars legrand ifn ya jus let me stay right here ahll be the happies nigger live p now in all probability there were such sentiments voiced by some old slaves but judging from white writers attachment to and need for the faithful darky there were probably considerably fewer than we have been encouraged to believe besides whites have never been able to tell when a niggers pissed oftuntil after the riot etienne legrand or mars legrand as he is affectionately called by his niggers is a conspicuous mouthpiece for hicks himself a liberalsupposedly out of time and place in the slave southhe makes several noble and contrived speeches for example trying to explain the subtleties of freedom to ben he says i have never really approved of the institution of slavery ben i have slaves because it is an economic necessity but in any conflict i will be forced to take sides against the north because this is my home because i believe in another freedomthe right of each sovereign state to determine its own course do you understand me ben p aside from the most obvious obje tion that no one talks this way oul side of political treaties and seconj rate novels hicks use of legrarl as a straw man for his own prop gandu is a cheap trick that an un talented writer cannot carry off i as the mythical white souther hero legrand is as magnificent i death as in life to ben it seen impossible that there was no longj an etienne legrand and he castl gates himself for not being there tl save his master his final commenl he had been a good man i a good white man p i as one of the critics of styrons bool has pointed out the idea of a blacl slave an intelligent and tragic figurj differentiating among his oppressor as though he believes tyranny can bl rated on a scale from high to lovl is psychologically inconsistent likl dividing blacks into good niggers and bad niggers you have to juggll the whole apparatus to make the rig answer come out i but even hicks attempts at jugl gling are clumsy and obvious thl black manwhite woman theme il suddenly resurrected near the end o the novel and as expected ben il forced to deal with what hicks coni siders the big question in his lifei not land or power or equalitybu where the hells mah white womai tserew p the opportunity presents itself but ben is terrified of the woman blindingly white body a phenom enon completely beyond my compre hension and experience and is un able to score victory number one instead he bursts out of the room with the sound of her laughter following him falls against a lamppost outside and vomits which is what the reader is tempted to do at this point as if this scene were not the ultimate distortion of ben franklin hicks leaves him meditating in profound concern over his blackness she made him feel so damned what was the word black that was it black the new thought hit him with a physical force black hed never actually thought of himself as being black p hickss mama couldnt sound less like a black slave all of his life ben franklin has been a piece of property bought and sold at the highest price he is a soldier in the branch of the army called officially the nigger regiment and hicks has him discovering his blackness as though he were edward brooke trying to integrate hyannis port the idea is as patently absurd as the rest of the book the long whip is in a sense a testimony that such a book is possible in twentiethcentury america bearing as it does an identical resemblance to the racist fiction of the th and th centuries is a genuine testimony to the unchanging nature of this country this will come as no shock to anyone who has been listening carefully to black critics for the last years langston hughes j saunders redding william stanley braithwaiteto name only a fewhave been condemning the traditions in america literature which exploit and degrade the image of black people a writer like john hicks who presents the black man as an oversexed simpleminded bewildered victim of society hung up over the sexual threat of the white woman pronounces judgment upon himself and his own artistic integrity moronically he consigns himself to a level of inferiority and mediocrity where he can really do very little harm much of the history taught in our schools is false history a history of lies omissions and distortions in reading it you get the impression that there were almost no black men in america that they did not play an important part in its development that slavery was a benign institution that slaves were contented with their condition and that black people generally were satisfied with their status deceived by this false history people are astonished and bewildered when our cities are burned and attribute the burning to the agitation of communistinspired agents if watts newark detroit and chicago havent dispelled those delusions then perhaps this book will do so pioneers in protest johnson by lerone bennett jr senior editor of ebony magazine who is at the institute of the black world tells of fighters for black liberation both black and white from crispus attucks who led boston mobs against british soldiers to w e b du bois brilliant scholar who died in ghana in as a member of the communist party and a ghanaian citizen it is written for the layman with an index but with no footnotes and no bibliography beside wellknown leaders like du bois harriet tubman sojourner truth and frederick douglass lerone bennett writes of those not so well known and of those whom history has passed by or stamped with obloquy like marcus garvey father of african nationalism nat turner leader of a slave revolt and james monroe trotter an early black nationalist mr bennett points out that the american revolution was never finished and he tells of the efforts of black men to carry it to completion he tells how benjamin banneker wrote to thomas jefferson cooling from the revolutionary fire of his youth for help against growing discrimination against blacks this lack of completion led to nat turners revolt and mr benneit points out that what a nation sows it reaps he says that slavery was an original act of violence then its violence was internalized in the slaves who were violent toward each other then violent toward their masters who in turn reacted with violence to the slaves closing the circuit of violence mr bennett writes of white lead ers whom historians have maligned because of their sympathy for blacks john brown who some have called a fanatic saw clearly that slavery was an act of war and reacted to it with violence thaddeus stevens and charles sumner leaders of congress during reconstruction tried hard to construct a just and equal society in the south stevens said how can republican institutions free schools free churches free social intercourse exist in a mingled community of nabobs and serfs their efforts were defeated and we are reaping today what was sown when their plans were thwarted among the less wellknown blacks mr bennett includes are henry highland garnet who appealed to the slaves to start a general strike and to revolt and david walker whose appeal to the coloured citizens of the world anticipated frantz fanon mr bennetts portrait of nat turner is very different from that drawn by william styron he ascribes to turner strong and close family ties an identification with the blacks and a grim resolve to end slavery because of its inclusion of less wellknown persons this book will be a useful addition to schools and libraries lee effectively constructs extended runon phrases into a myriad of thought the total idea is expressed by letters that become words and contractions correspond tonally to the diction of black speakers these mark lees style in the graphic sense the technique is not an innovation of course the umbra poets leroi jones and norman pritchard have utilized it successfully since early in the decade lee is not doing his thing as imitation or emulation but to express his distinct voice as a poet of the black revolution the thrust of contemporary black poetry is both calvin herntons fist beating against the ear and lerois machine gun and while it is destroying images which are no longer useful it is creating new ones relative to the lives of oppressed peoples don lees poetry subscribes to this standard that life in america is already absurd is no secret to lee but the absurdity is of the grotesque inhumanity of the unpeople not the configuration of their existential limitations lee is thematically unpretentious straightforward and sarcastic he is not burdened by the kind of ironic vision that plagues white existentialist poets these poets carry an apathy across their backs like the weight of dead stone they think they see too much of the universe and that universe is incomprehensible to their sensibilities their confessional poetry reeks of death wishes simply because they had attempted to conquer something larger than themselves the poor devils cannot embrace it as to labor a point cited by miss brooks who indicated that don l lee would never subscribe to what jascha kessler mentioned as a longing for death which typifies american white poets it should be further made clear that lee has a rendezvous with life as dont cry scream is his third projection of the sounds of black lifelife sounds only the spiritually alienated cry and see death as the most meaningful escapehatch race toward it like it is their lover and crying leads to that feeling we have experienced known as the blues to this the young chicago poet would respond we aint blue we is black yet kessler who would be totally outside the poetic conceptions of the black aesthetic would insist which is a reflection on the spiritual emptiness which the black american found himself being sucked into hence black death is subjective but hardly private and quite unique the white academicians understanding of white deaths is shallow they are lonely all of them poems like lees nigerian unityor little niggers killing little niggers can only appeal to the loneliness of nonblacks meanwhile assassination speaks of the response to the shooting of rev king they came running as if the king was going to fire back this kind of dying for black men has been standard and unique all this is to say that lees poetry screams for us to the general editor of any publishing company should rightfully be expected to print a volume of his own writings such has dudley randall done on broadside press and quite unselfishly limiting himself to a book of twelve poems of an impressive quality cities burning is a first book by the detroit editorpoetlibrarian who has coauthored poem counterpoem with margaret danner and coedited the popular collection for malcolm with margaret burroughs randall possesses a firm sense of the lyric and cities burning is more appropriately a book of songs or psalms than a rugged razoredged batch of poetry that might correspond to the title of the collection itself the lyrical tone dominates throughout it is so strong that the poem ballad of birmingham is one example of the kind of randall piece that has been set to music randall is a contemporary of gwendolyn brooks and so not in the new school of black poets but all schools aside his is a keen functional awareness of what black poetry has been and remains and there is no hint of an alienation from the ethos being developed by the new stylists in theme and passion black poetry has always had its own thing going in sound sense imagery metaphor and content and there are many different styles or ways of doing the thingtry as he might any poet endowed with a sense of music cannot easily escape it for it is a natural asset no poets in america serve in such a priestly capacity as do black poets priests musicians deacons chanters hail dionysus analysands and augury for an infant are similar evocations each poem in this collection depicts some aspect of the terror the decay the pleasures and the hopes that affect life in cities the persona of dionysus watches with praise the work of the god of frenzy and release the melting pot and a different image offset each other with the selfacceptance after racial rejection to the more definite and enduring recognition of an artifact which defines and exemplifies heritage the final augury affirms a belief in the infants potential and in context to the rest of the book reaffirms a new conception of the moral fiber of cities randall has brought to this first volume a good heart ear and eye for sensitive observation all which enhance his lyricism young black poets who read him should be influenced by him to some degree for his voice alone is infectious moreso he is contributing something to black literature that has a lasting value cities burning unfortunately does not include most of the work he has done for a long period of years still it will endure as a piece of sculpture endures with a proud sereneand classic bronze of benin black readers will respect these statements by dudley randall as near monuments along the way toward the liberation of black poetics yellow back radio brokedown doubleday hardcover paperback by ishmael reed fulfills a need in that it is the type of seein funny book that makes you laugh and yet be aware and ready to deal with

bond once said of ray charles dont it make you feel all right on a day in early august william o still of philadelphia was approached by a man who gave his name as peter freeman and said that he was looking for his long lost father and mother levin and sidney former slaves like himself still was an underground railroad operator and hence familiar with dramatic incidents but as peter unfolded his story he stood almost transfixed for it happened that levin and sidney were his own parents and therefore the man talking to him was an older brother he had never seen before such human interest stories about slaves who journeyed northward looking for relatives or in pursuit of freedom or both made effective propaganda for the abolitionist cause fugitive slaves on the wing tended to arouse sympathy and to stir the public conscience slavery was weakened far less by the economic loss of the absconding blacks than by the antislavery feeling they evoked by their flight and the attempts to reclaim them sympathy for the runaway slave was created and sustained by the fugitive slave act of heavily weighted in favor of the master this measure offended the popular sense of fair play without first obtaining a warrant a master had only to seize his slave bring him before any judge and prove to the courts satisfaction that the person in custody was guilty as charged the judge would then issue what was in essence a certificate of repossession the alleged slave was permitted no trial by jury and given no opportunity to present witnesses to give testimony on his behalf the abolitionists attacked the measure on the dual grounds that it was unconstitutional and that it legalized kidnapping the latter contention was the more readily provable as in the instance in which the churchman richard allen was seized as a fugitive and his claimant was spared a court punishment only through allens intercession the law was onesided but even had it been more fairly drafted there would still have remained a great reservoir of sympathy for those who made the dash for freedom a blend of the desperate and the heroic their actions could hardly fail to win the admiration even of the great mass of people who did not care for the abolitionists and to whom the free negro was someone to be tolerated rather than welcomed hence the work of assisting runaways was in popular favor in the north many whites being drawn into the work possibly the best known of these was the quaker levi coffin whose year record of slaves assisted ran to well over formerly from north carolina coffins success as a storekeeper in newport indiana and then in cincinnati afforded him the means for underground railroad activities two other abolitionists with long and almost as notable careers in helping fugitives were thomas garrett whose wilmington home was perhaps the best known station in the east and canadianborn alexander m ross who took time from his career as a physician to recruit escapeminded slaves in richmond nashville selma and new orleans any balanced analysis of underground railroad operations must include its negro workers in ohio for example black people were particularly active abolitionist leader james g birney noted in february that slaves were escaping in great numbers to canada by way of ohio and he added such matters are almost uniformly managed by the colored people i know nothing of them generally till they are past the fugitive slaves who made their way through sandusky were aided almost wholly by the towns negroes led by barbershop owner grant richie the state as a whole numbered not fewer than negro underground railroad workers in missouri the loose network included a cluster of allnegro associations in st louis which sped the fugitive to chicago and points north of the variety of ways to assist fugitives one in particular was suited to the negro operatorthat which entailed going into the south and making contact with those who were escapeminded the slave was more likely to place his trust initially in a black face moreover some negro conductors were former slaves who were familiar with the territory in which they operated some of these secret returnees were willing to run this special risk in order to rescue their wives and children the most renowned of these black conductors was harriet tubman who like nat turner the slave rebel of an earlier generation was given to dreams and to prayers herself an escapee from dorches ter county maryland in she made some excursions into slave territory and brought back more than fugitives short and spare she hardly looked like a person with a price on her head but she was as skillful in avoiding detection her coolness in a tight spot matching her courage to her abolitionist associates she became something of a legend thomas wentworth higginson calling her the greatest heroine of the age a less noted and less lucky conductor was leonard a grimes a free negro grimes became a hackman in washington dc eventually owning a number of horses and carriages all as available for rescuing slaves as for conveying paying passengers in one of his ventures in virginia his native state he was seized after spiriting a slave family away in a hack grimes spent two years in the state prison at richmond he then went to boston becoming the pastor of the twelfth baptist church but as in washington he neglected no opportunity to assist a runaway most of the conductors whose names are lodged in the record were based in the free states and hence were engaged in speeding the slave on his way rather than leading him out of the south these middlemen included george l burroughs of cairo illinois whose job as a sleepingcar porter between cairo and chicago gave him an unusual opportunity for smuggling slaves the most enterprising conductor in salem ohio was george w c lucas whose falsebottomed wagon conveyed fugitives to cleveland sandusky and toledo at elmira new york former slave john w jones secreted slaves in baggage cars bound for canada t for some black conductors the water was the freedom route slaves were carried across the ohio on skiffs from kentucky to indiana negro crewmen might bring slaves aboard as stowaways on vessels leaving southern ports and bound for the north elizabeth barnes who worked for a ship captain at portsmouth virginia hid slaves on vessels sailing for boston and new bedford new yorkers edward smith and isaac gansey of the schooner robert centre were charged by the virginia governor thomas w gilmer with having abducted slave isaac and was offered for their delivery to the jailer at norfolk a prominent feature of the ne gro underground was the providing of overnight accommodations for the escaping slave a white host might well be an object of suspicion to a newly fledged fugitive upon reaching philadelphia where they revealed their true identities william and ellen craft were placed with barkley ivens a nonnegro much to ellens alarm i have no confidence whatever in white people she told william they are only trying to get us back into slavery levi coffin noted that the fugitives who passed through newport indiana generally stopped among the colored people although the latter were not always as skillful in concealing them as they might have been but carelessness could hardly be charged to chapman harris of jefferson county and his associate elijah anderson despite the fact that their cabins were well known stopping places for fugitives coming to cincinnati in levi coffin found that there too most of the fugitives who landed in the city soon vanished into the colored quarter some of those who were taken to the negro section wound up at a place most unlikely to be suspected of harboring fugitivesthe wellappointed dumas house famous for its ornate saloon where one might find the biggest colored faro game in the country at ross ohio the reverend william m mitchell gave overnight housing to some fugitives over a span of years mitchells lodginghouse activities ceased in when the american baptist free mission society engaged his services as a missionary to the former slaves in toronto runaway slaves reaching detroit could find asylum at the residence of george debaptiste who had worn out his welcome in madison indiana because of his underground railroad activities a slave coming to chicago might be lodged with the welltodo tailor john jones at philadelphia the physicianclergyman james j g bias gave his bed freely to slaves directed to his house by the white abolitionist charles t torrey not stopping with his bed bias also gave to his overnight guests a quick medical checkup just outside philadelphia the byberry residence of robert purvis a wellknown station on the underground had a special room reached only by a trap door another wealthy black abolitionist william j whipper of columbia a port of entry for fugitives from maryland and virginia resided at the end of the bridge leading into the town he put up as many as slaves in one night the next day sending them west by boat to pittsburgh or by rail to philadelphia in the false end of a boxcar he owned in one instance whipper alerted jacob c white at philadelphia that the fugitive he was dispatching was in a perilous situation having seen his master that very day at west chester abraham d shadd fairly well off but not in a class with whipper or purvis entertained and forward ed black transients in new york city the home of charles b ray was a haven for journeying fugitives of them walking up the front steps one summer morning but ray was not the only black new yorker to be so blessed one hundred and fifty in a single year have lodged under my roof wrote henry highland garnett and i have never asked or received a penny for what gave them but divided with them my last crust negro abolitionist leaders in upstate new york knew that runaways would be directed to their doors jermain w loguen at syracuse fitted an apartment in his house for these unannounced visitors those who came to rochester made their way to the office of frederick douglass on buffalo street early morning arrivals sitting on the steps until opening time in albany the home of stephen myers was an overnight sanctuary for black dropins on the last leg of their northward journey the buffalo home of william wells brown was a station on the underground railroad brown himself conducting to canada over a period of seven months in in the northeast the best known rendezvous for runaways was the home of lewis hayden in downtown boston hayden himself was a fugitive from kentucky his rescuer calvin fairbank having been arrested and jailed for helping him escape hayden had turned down an earlier opportunity to escape because he could not bring his future wife along with him as if to prove himself worthy of fairbanks sacrifice hayden welcomed fugitives to stop under his roof when the owner of william and ellen craft dr robert collins of macon georgia sent two deputies to reclaim them william took lodging in the hayden dwelling temporarily barricaded for the occasion one day when harriet beecher stowe visited the haydens she was surrounded by escaped slaves upon settling in newport rhode island in george t downing quickly established himself as the friend of any fugitive alighting in that city o o o individual assistance to runaway slaves was supplemented by the work of vigilance committees and here too the black people in the north played a distinctive role a vigilance committee aided the fugitives in a variety of waysboarding and lodging them for a few days purchasing clothing and medicine for them providing them with small sums of money informing them as to their legal rights and giving them legal protection from kidnappers a primary function of the vigilance committee was to help a slave establish himself in a new location to furnish him with letters of introduction to help him find a job and to give him guidance and protection while he was thus engaged in getting started hence a vigilance committee was a combination underground and upperground railroad the latter comprising its efforts to help the slave locate within the united states the time has come to stop running announced jermain w loguen manager of the fugitive aid society of syracuse many of the vigilance committees had a totally or predominantly negro membership the greatest of these negrorun organizations was the new york committee of vigilance founded in november with david ruggles as its secretary and general agent at its monthly meetings the committee listened to speakers like james emerson a seaman who had almost been sold into slavery after accepting work on a ship running to petersburg virginia appearing at committee meetings were speakers like the wife of kidnapped peter john lee her fatherless sons at her side the committee listened to stories of colored children who had been hired as domestics and then carried into the south and sold the committee publicized descriptions of missing negroes and informed its members as to the arrival and departure dates of ships suspected of harboring slaves at one of its meetings three destitute africans were introduced with a t plea for funds to help them return to their native land on one occasion isaac wright told his story of being rescued by an agent of the committee after having been sold into slavery at new orleans by the captain of the newcastle j d wilson it was through the committee that wilson was arrested and detained for the illegal sale of wright and two other negro seamen to attend a meeting of the vigilance committee tended to tear at the heart strings at the annual meeting in at the zion church alvan steward founder in of the new york antislavery society was deeply moved by the strong emotions of gratitude expressed by the fugitives whom the committee had assisted i could submit to become a slave for the privilege of making such a friendship he said to the gathering during its first year the committee protected negroes from slavery and this figure was a sound approximation for each of the succeeding years the committee also won public acceptance of its contention that persons claimed as fugitives should have a trial by jury a measure they had sponsored from their opening meeting much of the success of the new york committee of vigilance could be credited to david ruggles he is a general marion sort of man wrote a contemporary editor for sleepless activity sagacity and talent ruggles personally gave assistance to hundreds of runaways frederick douglass being a typical case ruggles sheltered the young douglass for nearly two weeks made his marriage arrangements and sent the newlyweds to new bedford massachusetts with a fivedollar bill and a letter of introduction to a locally prominent negro nathan johnson ruggles boarded incoming ships to see whether slaves were being smuggled in he went from door to door in fashionable neighborhoods making inquiry as to the status of black domestics new york law freeing any imported slave after a residence of nine months in one instance ruggles went to the brooklyn home of daniel k dodge and brought away a domestic charity walker a former slave negroes in boston and detroit had allnegro vigilance groups although neither had as dramatic a figure as ruggles founded in boston in and lasting for five years the new england freedom association aimed to extend a helping hand to all who may bid adieu to whips and chains it solicited donations of money or clothing for the fugitives and places of residence temporary or permanent for them and advertised in the abolitionist press for persons who would give them jobs two of its seven directors were women founded in the same year as its boston counterpart the colored vigilance committee of detroit was headed first by william lambert and then by george debaptiste in the absence of competing white abolitionist organizations the detroit group maintained an independent existence until the civil war reaching its peak in the midfifties in one twoweek period in the committee gave assistance to freedombound blacks a figure which grew to for the period from may to january cleveland had an allcolored committee of nine of whom four were women which sped slaves to canada from april to january in boston and new york the allnegro vigilance groups were succeeded by racially mixed prototypes in boston in september a committee of vigilance was formed by samuel gridley howe following public indignation over the return of a slave who had secreted himself on a vessel bound from new orleans to boston the committee included robert morris and william c nell along with many prominent white reformers and literary figures ralph waldo emerson sending word that if the economic wellbeing of massachusetts depended upon making boston a slaveport he would willingly forego such prosperity and turn to the mountains to chop wood the boston committee of vigilance performed its most conspicuous services in the early s following the passage of the fugitive slave law new york city was the headquarters of another racially mixed group to assist the runaway slave the new york state vigilance committee founded in with the quaker isaac t hopper as president but with a membership over percent negro the committee assisted fugitives during its first six months in the committee was reorganized with white philanthropist gerritt smith as president and charles b ray as corresponding secretary one of the committees accomplishments during its first year was the instigation of action in the federal courts in nine cases in which a person was held as a slave in a slave state but who nonetheless was entitled to his freedom by the laws of the state from january to april the committee assisted former slaves many of whom received little more than periodic counseling but of whom were freed after being brought into new york city by their reputed masters upstate new york had two interracial slaveassisting organizations although the one in albany might well have been called the myers vigilance committee its guiding spirit stephen myers held few meetings although acting in the name of the committee but myers was able and honest thus muting any criticism at syracuse the abolitionists founded the fugitive aid society with jermain w loguen as its manager engaged in helping runaways since loguen devoted full time to the work beginning in he wrote letters to the local newspapers urging their readers to hire fugitives in their shops and on their farms how many jobs he found for the more than former slaves that passed through his hand each year cannot be known but it earned for syracuse the title of the canada of the united states loguens good work in syracuse was overshadowed only by that of william still in philadelphia the secretary of the general vigilance committee this organization had a predecessor the philadelphia vigilance committee which had a career of six years beginning in this parent group was interracial on paper whites comprising of the members of the first socalled standing committee but the president was robert purvis and the agent executive secretary was another negro jacob c white moreover after the monthly meetings were no longer attended by whites thus making the committee allnegro in its operations and increasingly so in its personnel this committee assisted some fugitives a year its high for one weekthe first week in september running to it dispatched the fugitives to canada or to david ruggles in new york the committee expired in although many of the former members purvis white j j g bias daniel payne and stephen h gloucester among them continued to assist slaves in an individual capacity the successor of this pioneer organization the general vigilance committee was more consistently interracial robert purvis was made chairman of the new organization seven of whose founders were negroes but most importantly black william still was made chairman of the fourmember acting committee thus becoming the executive secretary of the organization and its dominant figure a more resourceful and hardworking operator could hardly have been found the full scope of stills activities may be gleaned from his page work the underground railroad published in in this factcrammed semidocumentary work still produced scores of letters from workers in the field such as joseph c bustill from harrisburg describing the beginnings of the local fugitive aid society still exchanged fruitful letters with such white supporters and colleagues as thomas garrett in wilmington sidney howard gay in new york levi coffin in cincinnati and hiram wilson at st catherines in canada still received scores of letters from fugitives he had helped such as the one john j hill sent from toronto i am as free as your president pearce only i have not been free so long it is true that i have to work very hard for comfort but i am happy happy the general vigilance committee aided hundreds of black bondmen the number running to from december to february but the episode that still was least likely to forget was the delivery of henry brown shipped in a box from richmond to philadelphia by adams express when the shipment reached the antislavery office still one of the four receiving agents pried off the lid whereupon the marvellous resurrection of brown ensued wrote the author of the underground railroad raising up in his box he reached out his hand saying how do you do gentlemen figuratively speaking the concept of black_power and v black history are twins that were fathered by the same his h torical experience this concept was created to counteract jsl an ther concept that the people of african descent had no m history worthy of respect the europeans who started the slave trade and the colonial system that followed needed to propagate this concept in order to justify their action the presentday young black militants are asking in many ways why the word history is so limited when it is applied to their people they are beginning to learn belatedly that history depending on how it is manipulated can be either an instrument of oppression or of liberation in most cases what is called african history is only the history of africas contact with europe beginning with the slave trade what is called negro history is generally the history of american slavery and subsequent effects the europeans who started the slave trade in the fifteenth century had to forgetor pretend to forgetall they had previously known about africas contribution to the development of mankind the presentday black_power and black history advocates are trying to restore what the slave trade and the system of economic oppression took away their fight has long roots and it was not started by stokely carmichael or h rap brown in a formal sense the concept of black_power started in the nineteenth century concurrent with the many attempts to restore black men to an honorable place in history the concept of black_power confuses most people because they are looking for a complicated system black_power means no more or less than the right to determine your own destiny starting with the control of your own communities this is the same thing that every ethnic group in america hasor is trying to get black_power without a respect for black history is meaningless until the essential manhood of a people is respected no power in their hands is effective in a speech made in cuba last year stokely carmichael while addressing himself to the subject black_power and the third world said this since the cry of the rebellions has been black_power in this cry there was an ideology implied which the masses understood instinctively it is because we are powerless that we are oppressed and it is only with power that we can make the decisions governing our lives and our communities black_power is more than a slogan it is a way of looking at our problems and the beginning of a solution because our color has been used as a weapon to oppress us we must use our color as a weapon of liberation this is the same as other people using their nationality as a weapon for their liberation this coming together around our race was an inevitable part of our struggle we recognize however that this is not the totality only the necessary beginning then while emphasizing the need for the cultural restoration of a people he said black_power recognizes that while we are made to feel inferior this is only that we can be easily exploited color and culture were and are key in our oppression therefore our analysis of history and our economic analysis are rooted in these concepts with power we will take our birthjpght because it was with power that our birthright was taken from tis black_power not only addresses itself to exploitation but to the problem of cultural integrity the nineteenth century black militants and some before them were saying essentially the same thing in different ways the fight against the distortion and suppression of the true history of the africans and afroamericans was started long before the civil war by free negroes and escaped slaves who had learned to read and write the backtoafrica idea has been a recurring theme in the lives of black americans for more than a hundred years the thought was strong during the formative years of the colonization society and some of the most outstanding black men of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries came under its persuasion in the middle of the nineteenth century while the issue of slavery was being debated in most of the country the feeling for africa among american blacks was growing stronger publications like freedoms journal and douglass monthly edited by frederick douglass called attention to the plight of the people of africa as well as the black americans as far back as the renowned scholar and benefactor of west africa dr edward wilmot blyden speaking on the occasion of his inauguration as president of liberia college sounded the note for the organized teaching of the culture and civilization of africa and decried the fact that the worlds image of africa was not in keeping with africas true status in world history i quote from his address on this occasion the people generally are not yet prepared to understand their own interests in the great work to be done for themselves and their children we shall be obliged to work for some time to come not only without the popular sympathy we ought to have but with utterly inadequate resources in all englishspeaking countries the mind of the intelligent negro child revolts against the descriptions of the negro given in elementary books geographies travels histories having embraced or at least assented to these falsehoods about himself he concludes that his only hope of rising in the scale of respectable manhood is to strive for what is most unlike himself and most alien to his peculiar tastes and whatever his literary attainments or acquired ability he fancies that he must grind at the mill which is provided for him putting in material furnished by his hands bringing no contribution from his own field and of course nothing comes out but what is put in the great human drama now being called the black revolution in the usa has long historical roots and it cannot be fully understood until it is seen in this context in his book capitalism and slavery dr eric williams places the origin of this revolution in historical perspective and calls attention to its early development when in columbus representing the spanish monarchy discovered the new world he set in train the long and bitter international rivalry over colonial possessions for which after four and a half centuries no solution has yet been found portugal which had initiated the movement of international expansion claimed the new territories on the ground that they fell within the scope of a papal bull of authorizing her to reduce to servitude all infidel people the two powers spain and portugal to avoid controversy sought arbitration and as catholics turned to the pope a natural and logical step in an age when the universal claims of the papacy were still unchallenged by individuals and governments after carefully sifting the rival claims the pope issued in a series of papal bulls which established a line of demarcation bettween the colonial possessions of the states the east went to portugal and the west went to spain though the announcement of the fact came much later the european scramble for africa and subsequently asia and north america started with this act the labor and raw materials of africa asia south america and the west indies financed the european industrial revolution the africans who were brought to the new world against their will were dehumanized and in most cases deculturalized they were neither respected africans nor accepted new world americans they were renamed and became a marginal branch of the human family now referred to as negroes the europeans needed a rationale for their actions and a rationale was created with supporting concepts the crudest concept ever devised by the mind of man was created to support the slave trade and the colonial system that followedthe concept of race and the assumption that there are superior and inferior races the africans were depicted as a people without a history who had never properly handled power and who certainly had made no contribution to the development of human cultures and thus the seeds of the presentday conflict were planted the american federation of teachers conference on racism in education held in washington d c on december and set in motion much of the present action and the debate about black history and how it should be taught in the public schools the noted actor ossie davis addressed the conference on the first day his opening remarks were those of us who are concerned who are caught up who really want to be involved in the revolution must be prepared at this conference to tear aside our most private thoughts and prejudices the tone for the conference had been set for two days more than teachers and educators examined and indicated the american educational system they were told that a curtain of ignorance hangs over the school systems of this nation and that our children are not being i educated to face the realities of this nation and this world cases of deliberate distortion of the role that the black americans have played in the making of this country were pointed out and it was further stated that everyone from professional textbook writers to missionaries had participlated in this distortion ossie davis cited the english language as a basic transmitter of prejudice in his speech entitled the english language is my enemy he said that he counted synonyms for the term blackness in rogets thesaurus half of which were grossly unfavorable davis argued that right from the time a black child learns the english language he learns ways to despise himself and a white child learns ways to aid and abet the crime keith e baird a new york school teacher who followed ossie davis talked about the importance of ethnic identification for afroamericans mr baird who is a teacher of languages spoke of the respected place in history as celebrated in the jewish holiday of hanukkah of the maccabees of biblical times he also pointed out that in the process of ethnic identification not only a persons individual attributes are considered but the cultural identification of this group baird presented to the conference a resolution that he urged it to adopt the wording of which was to say that the slaveryconnected word negro should be abandoned and in its place the words afro or africanamerican be applied to persons of african descent in the united states in all places where such reference to ethnic descent is appropriate at a later conference session concerning resolutions this one was unanimously adopted in his presentation mr baird had defined what the cry for black history is aboutit is about the search for a peoples identity and their need for a new image of themselves the black americans are trying to locate themselves on the map of human geography this explains the growing preference for the words black african and afroamerican these words show how the black americans relate to a land a history and a culture in a number of other conferences sponsored by the local branches of the american federation of teachers and the uft the teachers agreed on plans to implement courses in black history the main conferences were held in detroit may and in chicago march and conferences in denver and st louis followed while many of the white teachers clearly admitted that racism is rampant in the american educational system very few of them had any basic plan concerning what to do about it their reluctance to commit themselves to the correction of this racism caused a lot of black teachers to form separate organizations some within the framework of the american federation of teachers and the uft the chicago black teachers caucus was one in new york city the afroamerican teachers association was another still another organization the conference of afroamerican educators which met in chicago in june shows the best potential of becoming a nationwide force to affect change in the educational system at this conference donald freeman who renamed himself baba lamumba defined education as it relates to black people what we understand by education is the application of all ones knowledge for the benefit of the collective which in turn will benefit each individual within the collective to this end what must constitute a basic part of ones education is the understanding of people rather than things we realize that once people understand themselves their knowledge of things is facilitated that the exclusive knowledge of things does not guarantee knowledge of people and in fact contributes to the erosion disintegration and destruction of the creativity of man therefore education must teach black people who they are teach black people what they are fighting for teach black people who they must identify with teach black people where their loyalty must lie teach black people what must be done teach black people how to do it and teach black people that the destinies of all black people are inseparably linked whether we are in north central or south america the west indies europe asia or africa broadening his explanation mr freeman continued m now there must be a complete unity of all aspects of ones life and in particular education must be indelibly linked with ones life processes for the benefit of each black man and woman and all black people those who have knowledge primarily from books must be linked with those who have knowledge from the streets and vice versa to confront and solve all the problems of black people education must assure that all of what one learns can be and will be applied to concrete practical problems and their solutions if our people can throw molotov cocktails in white stores we can certainly throw molotov cocktails in our minds mathematics physics electronics sociology religion and other sciences must not be viewed as abstractions but comprehended as the concentrated experiences of mans interrelationships with man nature and the universe to mold and control his own destiny it is obvious that the american educational establishment is not ready to correct itself and implement these suggestions that it would consider extreme this would not only be tantamount to correcting itself it would also be tantamount to repudiating itself at the base of the grievance of the black teachers and growing numbers of black people is the fact that they have been educated or miseducated in a system that has yet to acknowledge that they are an integral part of american or western civilization both the clamor for black_power and black history are the clamor of people to enter the mainstream of a society and to institute dynamic social reformor to replace that society the most farreaching reforms will be in the field of education control is the key word in the school situation because it implies power to act in ones best interest at a time and a place of ones choosing the educational establishment could digest or tolerate decentralization because the school system would still be run in the main by the educational establishment which is a force operating outside of the local community when community control is added to decentralization a whole new area of power is defined this means that the community will have the right to hire and fire teachers and to control the massive budget of the school system that is now a major american industry in an address in ann arbor michigan on may dr grace boggs said in effect that the question of black control of the schools has now become a question of survival for all black people urban school systems are disintegrating before their eyes to the point where their actual physical and mental safety are at stake black children and their parents have lost the traditional respect for the teachers and principals of their schools because of the growing alienation between the school and the community the mass media principally television have taught these children to become suspicious of most large establishments especially police forces and governmental agencies that make promises which they do not keep many of the white teachers in the large educational systems in cities like new york detroit philadelphia chicago and los angeles come to the system with preconceived notions about the ability of the black child to learn instead of teaching him they spend a lot of time convincing themselves that the children are unteachable they do not bring their best teaching ability to these communities because they do not respect the children or the community well enough to do so in addition to being poor teachers for the black community these teachers are not even good babysitters in a lot of cases they are arrogant unfulfilled and insecure people long overdue for analysis very often the black child and the black community become whippingboys for their neuroses community control would mean that these teachers can be transferred or fired once their lack of qualifications have been proven there is no attempt to drive all white teachers out of any black community however teachers who fall within the above description will not be secure under any form of community control keith e baird director of the afroamerican history and cultural unit of the board of education gave the following explanation of decentralization and community control at the summer forum at columbia university in august of on the black experience i am going to talk about decentralization in the public schools and its implications i use the term decentralization largely because it is the one that is generally used now most words that begin with this prefix de suggest a kind of fall from grace and i think that discussion about the changes that are being sought in the school system suffer somewhat from this semantic difficulty i rejoice however to see that in this booklet the decentralization means reforming the present school system in new york city into largely autonomous school districts joined with the central education agency into a citywide federation now this is a fairly decent and workable definition but what does it actually mean in terms of the black experience the context in which we have come together to discuss this matter we seem to have two separate questions before us decentralization and community control of course the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive you can have decentralization without having community control and you can have community control without having decentralization now there is no problem about white people controlling the schools because that of course is what has always happened the schools are run by white people the majority of the teachers are white and the people who administer the schools are in great part white thus we have what are essentially white schools reflecting white interests a white selfconcept and white culture the question of community control comes in because certain enclaves certain new ethnic enclaves will now be having greater control or at any rate be in a better position to exercise control over the schools their children go toprovided of course that the rules and regulations of the new york city board of education actually permit this to happen thus we come to what is really the crux of the situation namely the control of schools in afroamerican and puerto rican areas by the afroamerican and puerto rican communities particularly because these communities have not been significantly represented until now at the policymaking level in educational affairs what community control boils down to is simply this are we or are we not going to let black people and puerto rican people really tell teachers what to do especially tell white teachers what to do and so on that is really what this whole thing boils down to and we may as well face up to it because most of decentralization and community control talk in new york city is centered around i s in harlem and ocean hill brownsville in brooklyn it would be well to show the essence of the background of this conflict the crucial issue of the i s controversy is the poor quality of education in ghettos such as harlem from the first through the twelfth grade an increasingly larger proportion of ghetto youth perform below their grade level in reading and math eightyseven percent of the pupils in the harlem school district are below grade level better than twothirds of the pupils drop out before graduation from high school daniel schreiber the former assistant superintendent of district in which i s is located verified these figures the parents of school district were willing to accept the promise of the board of education that integration would help solve the problem of poor education for their children when was proposed as a junior high school as far back as parents objected on the grounds that construction of a school at the proposed site would create another segregated school as late as dr bernard donavan maintained that would be an integrated school he even alluded to having the school related to a university accompanied by special programs by february of daniel schreiber maintained that would be integrated but by this time integrated had come to mean representative groups of black and puerto rican children as early as march community representatives were demanding the establishment of a community group to which teachers would be responsible in addition to the demand for an integrated school parents opposition to the board of educations response or lack of response to these demands canceled the scheduled opening of for the spring term of the school district was gerrymandered without the consultation of the community to create a student body of puerto ricans and negroes integration gives way to quality education by the end of the summer the board of education had to admit that it had no plan for truly integrating i s the parents realizing that the board of education had no intention of integrating the schools of harlem focused attention on the basic problem of improving the quality of education in harlem with the realization that it would in reality have to be segregated there is agreement between the parents and the board of education that the board has failed to integrate the harlem schools there is also agreement between the parents and the board that the quality of education in harlem is low the disagreement lies in the means used to improve the quality of education the parents place the full responsibility of poor education in harlem upon the board of education whose present structure they feel is incapable of providing or administering a quality educational system to meet the needs of the ghetto community the composition of the board how its members are selected and its source of power indicate the distance that exists between the body that makes educational policy and the community for whom the policy is made the ocean hillbrownsville decentralization experiment in brooklyn new york was spoiled by success the local school board consisting mainly of parents from the community took their jobs seriously and asked that a number of teachers who they deemed incompetent be transferred this move seemed to have shocked and angered both the board of education and the head of the united federation of teachers this abrupt exercising of power by the local school board and their unit administrator came unexpectedly the two large black ghettos of brooklyn merge at ocean hill its inhabitants include a growing number of puerto ricans nothing of a dynamic nature was expected of these slumdwellers in september the controversy around i s in harlem had a profound effect on the ocean hillbrownsville school district that month a group of parents in harlem demanded that the board of education respect their right to select the principal for i s these parents were asking for the first time to have a voice in the administration of the schools in their community the contagious cry for community control was now spreading beyond harlem it did not bypass the ocean hillbrownsville school district in brooklyn after some protracted agitation the board of education allowed the people of ocean hill to form an administrative unit with the understanding that the board would relinquish some of its authority to this unit the administrative unit and the local governing board succeeded and began to exercise the authority that the board of education never thought it would use this is the basis of their trouble with the board of education and the united federation of teachers the dispute between the people of ocean hillbrownsville on one side and the board of education and united federation of teachers on the other side might well be a sad indication of what will soon be a national crisis in education the cry for black_power and black history has rekindled a long smoldering fire that will no doubt affect major changes in the educational political and economic structure of the united states late show addicts and the older generation know that hollywood deserves no thanks for its portrayals of black americans in the s what few people know is that the black community tried to produce movies that would make important statements about life in the black world low budgets inadequate distributing facilities lack of experience and low audience potential limited their success but the two decades between the world wars must be granted several achievements the black world revealed by its loyalty to the performers from its ranks that it would support honest depictions of black life the small independent film companies operating chiefly out of abandoned studios in fort lee new jersey and astoria long island gave experience to such laterfamous performers as lena horne and pigmeat markham the movies that they produced gave a number of credible and relevant selfimages to black folk at the same time that the larger white companies in hollywood ignored or demeaned them they gave honest work to actors who needed respite from the unrewarding grind of playing maids and butlers in california and they helped train a generation of independent black entrepeneurs who founded movie houses in southern and other provincial cities where it was all the more important to create positive role models the black filmmakers were not without some aid and comfort from white producers in the years before d w griffiths birth of a nation that infamous yet artistically significant racist view of postcivil war reconstruction negroes appeared in varied roles in american movies in that era when films were usually no more than visually stimulating newsreel items strung together like sausages negroes were photographed by early pioneers such as thomas edison and thomas ince true black people bore more than their share of the stereotyped roles but types were important because without sound there was no surer way to establish character than by exaggerating traits thus canny jews blustering irishmen inscrutable chinese and happy negroes all seemed larger than life yet blacks appeared as soldiers in the spanish american war the philippine campaign world war i and their march up fifth avenue after it ended even in comedy sometimes the black character emerged triumphant in a short onereeler a bucket of cream ale for example a black waitress irritated by her white customers nagging dumps a bucket of ale over his head even in the bad timethe three decades after the enthusiastic reception of birth of a nation black fortunes did not fall to absolute zero one of d w griffiths most successful films was one exciting night a mystery film in which a hero is a black african detective later in king vidor tried to capture the mood and temper of black religion in his artfully done hallelujah blacks also had important roles in s movies which attempted social comment such as frank capras sullivans travels and william wylers beggars of life and in the s the war against fascism provided a reason for black characters to enter the plots of white movies ben carter in crash dive rex ingram in sahara dooley wilson in casablanca canada lee in lifeboat and kenneth spencer in bataan each broke the old stereotype mold in obvious ways there were frequent interracial and even equalitarianroles cheaply made series movies in hal roachs our gang comedies farina and buckwheat the two black characters frequently shared the humor and plot lines with the white members of the gang for a brief while the dead end kids comedies enlisted a black gang member but generally forces combined to deny black folk access to white screens these forces in the white world consisted chiefly of the attitudes of hollywood producers and executives some of whom such as s a lynch and edward kuykendall were southerners they accepted uncritically the notion that there was a monolithic and powerful southern boxoffice that could ruin the revenues of films which broke racial taboos thus in producing films they sacrificed black characters on the altar of the southern mystique which formed the basis of such moneymaking pictures as gone with the wind in the black world also there were ironic forces that helped to deny blacks access to the screen the success of the naacp in throttling distribution of birth of a nation had a feedback effect on producers at the same time as the naacps insistent demands for the censorship of odious racial characterizations the filmmakers concluded that negro protagonists would not sell movies in the south thus they tended to exclude all but the most comic negro charactersthe first major attempt of black men to produce their own films emerged out of the conflict over birth of a nation in failing to prevent the showing of the film in most parts of the country naacp executives agonized over the decision to commit the organizations funds to a propaganda movie but decided to rely on legal actions against birth of a nation on the other hand emmett j scott personal secretary to booker t washington at tuskegee contrived to get a film project off the ground to counteract the ill effects of griffiths picture at first he and washington hoped to merely tack a prologue of negro attainments onto birth of a nation then they turned to a professional writer elaine sterne to write lincolns dream an optimistic prophesy of negro fortunes when universal of hollywood failed to buy the scenario scott decided to raise funds among the black bourgeoisie with whom he had hundreds of contacts through his administration of the national negro business league eventually it took scott over three years to finish a picture the birth of a race an artistic failure yet with striking implications for the future scotts promotion and stock selling campaigns fell on hard times although he tapped the negro community for thousands of dollars to finance the venture but the rigors of producing a lengthy reel film by a new black company shooting in florida and chicago rather than in hollywood proved too great a burden in midcareer the company needed new capital and turned to a white group which denied that the film would be exclusively about black achievement despite the promotional literature which proudly announced for the basis of our photoplay we have chosen a race which has become american through and through it has helped fight our battles clear our land build our cities and worked shoulder to shoulder with all other races ah you guessed it the first time the negro the new backers also denied that there were black owners of the company the checkered history could not help but produce grotesque results the movie that eventually opened at the blackstone in chicago the most fashionable theatre in america proved a flop there were beautiful sets next to shoddy backdrops pacifist themes interspersed with a few shots of blacks mass battle scenes set against cheap stock shots obviously the surviving company had the products of three years work and buried the original theme in a welter of unrelated shots if the movie failed it at least showed the way to succeeding black motion picture producers many of whom continued to be thwarted by lack of capital subsequent producers learned to stick with attainable goals and to maintain some control over white backers and technicians by the late s some estimates placed the number of available ghetto movie houses at as the number of houses increased new companies sprang up ebony film corporation in chicago with j luther pollard at the helm began producing onereel comedies that were parodies of popular stories the first film was a black sherlock holmes later walton the manager of the lafayette in harlem and drama editor of the new york age produced the first of an intended series the brute starring the boxer sam langford for his second feature he tried to get charles gilpin to repeat his stage success in emperor jones gate city film corporation opened in kansas city the first black company in its region madison corey and charles anderson earlier the federal internal revenue collector for the wall street district formed constellation films for the purpose of producing black cinema a year later in the actor leigh whipper formed the renaissance company to produce allnegro newsreels famous artists with white backers in attempted similar movies for showing along the black vaudeville circuits by late the colored players film corporation owned by a black washington impresario opened at tempo studios in philadelphia with an optimistic vision of creating a black hollywood just outside of the capital in dunbar pictures began shooting in the old vitagraph studios in brooklyn and roseland pictures and recording laboratories of new york both announced series of allblack tworeelers in by far the most famous and best of the black silent filmmakers was oscar micheaux who operated from th street his greatest coups was the signing of paul robeson to do body and soul robeson an allamerican football player at the beginning his career in singing and acting needed the work and did a creditable job body and soul was sophisticated for its day yet it went unnoticed outside of the ghetto theatres it was the first successful film with black performers made for a black audience robeson seemed to be playing a dissolute and venal black preacher for the plot line cut back and forth from the two sides of his double life on the one hand as an habitue of a seedy speakeasy with its petty gamblers and crooks and on the other as the preacher attempting to dupe a pious matron into allowing him to marry her daughter the two worlds are symbolized by two photographs hanging from the walls of the two sets in the former a worn cover from a police gazette and on the other a portrait of booker t washington gazing benignly upon the household the denouement comes when the viewer realizes that both roles are the nightmare ramblings of a young girl and robeson is really the opposite of his character strong powerful resolute and perhaps even a detective sent to close the speakeasy thus by the end of the movie black audiences have seen the symbolic emergence of a black character rising from the decadence presumed by whites to the autonomous masculinity demanded by negroes the success of such films and the growing awareness of the emerging ghetto box office receipts led a few whites into the same film market jack goldberg as early as had attempted a documentary on africa during world war i the creel committee performed its propaganda function by releasing our colored fighters and a full onereeler of the th black regiment our hell fighters return distributors raided the vaults of european producers who were less timid about doing themes of blacks and whites in conflict the white hope an english movie about blacks and whites fighting for a championship and a white barbarian which was a tale set amidst an east african tribe ruled by a carthaginian royal line were two such films the germans contributed dark alleys starring the african boxer battling siki josephine baker the coffeecolored rage of paris represented the french with siren of the tropics independent white producers missed the point of the movement through the s few valid black characters could be found in its products the producers assuming that the new market could be served by the old stereotypes octavus roy cohen for example formed birmingham pictures in order to produce movies of his own darkey stories while the ku klux klan muddled through a patriotic movie that was so poorly lighted from having been shot in someones garage that eventually it was abandoned the major hollywood producers despite their more calculated eye for box office receipts made some allblack films and spread rumors of others but they rarely departed from stereotypes many of them simply shot vaudeville acts movie men read in their weekly variety that deforest phonofilm would shoot the club alabam show in its entirety vitaphone did onereelers of noble sissle and eubie blake the three pullman porters the cabin kids ethel waters jules bledsoe singing spirituals and buck and bubbles as two northern blacks who ride south only to find not soul brothers but snobbish black servants who look down on them as crass yankee town negroes a few of the white companies made distinguished movies pool films with kenneth macpherson directing made borderline on location in switzerland with paul and eslanda robeson and the poet hilda doolittle as stars dudley murphy directed bessie smith in st louis blues a superb tworeel vignette and king vidor directed an inconsistent hallelujah with many sensitive portrayals of southern black life unfortunately interspersed with stereotyping so broad as to evoke unintended laughter from harlem audiences by the end of the silent film era the black community especially in new york had become conscious of its own box office potential and critical of both black and white movies in one year three new houses in chicago alone added new seats black managers and owners took over theaters in the ghettos from chicago to arkansas while a variety editorial speculated that black theaters would rush to wire for sound because they were the only market in america that could make profit with both black and white movies black vaudeville circuits had stabilized enough to provide regular bookings for movies even in the south and in the exciting time of flux critics such as theophilus lewis of the tatler demanded better acting from the black companies the first allblack sound film was oscar micheaux the exile financed by frank schiffman the white manager of the lafayette theatre in harlem it revealed both the virtues and the needs of black filmmaking even though no white man appeared on the screen the plot still moved on white terms a black girl comes into possession of a mansion which he turns into a cabaretbrothel her fiance learning of her decision abandons the city for a farm in south dakota where he meets a white girl who is the soul of puritan virtue at the end of the movie they can marry because the hero learns that the white girl is really a negro in varietys opinion only donald hey woods jazz combo livened the essentially dull picture everything seemed to be wrong the tedious story suggested that to be lightskinned was to be virtuous the sound track was only partically dialog the rest of it being synchronized music the harlem audiences giggled in the wrong places at the absurd plot variety analyzing the film from the point of view of box office returns concluded that the black companies should make only comedies for a while at least until budgets allowed them to use better equipment and to get out of the old studios such as metro in fort lee where the exile was shot probably another important factor was that the trained actors unwittingly made the patois of some of the amateurs seem out of place and awkward a year later in two other movies were more ambitious southland a black company in fort lee produced the black king a potentially important social drama about the leader of a backtoafrica movement led by a charlatan preacher it was ruined by the same weaknesses that undermined the exile so that the statements that might have been dealt with such as the division of black loyalties between america and africa the place of the church in the black world and the mean iqg of the stillremembered garvey s movement were lost in the laughter at a comic ending that sees the protagonists scampering back to mississippi dressed as hoboes however lincoln films harlem is heaven starring bill robinson with a budget of under m proved what could be done robinsons long experience helped the thin plot bridge the gaps between his songanddance numbers harlem is heaven made in its first week in harlem a striking figure for a neighborhood house despite the jagged editing which was inevitable in a quickie movie it was clearly so good that it got successful bookings in the ghettos of baltimore washington pittsburgh chicago and smaller towns in between such gems as robinsons harlem is heaven many other allblack pictures ran in the ghettos their sole virtue the power of being black drums ovoodoo a louis weiss allblack production suffered from the usual low budgets and inconsistent acting but it was one of the few movies of the s that depicted black voodoo and christianity as being on the same side against evil a popularization of a historically accurate syncretism of west v african religions and roman catholicism some of these movies simply depicted the old racial stereotypes which harlem and south side auj diences seemed able to enjoy without resentment in the privacy of a ghetto theater one such film was eddie rochester andersons comic eyerolling fear as expressed in jed buells lucky ghost another variant on criminal typing occurred in ralph coopers dark manhattan a gangster movie which acted out the ritual of good versus evil with the conflict centered on two rival mobs fightingm over control of the numbers game in harlem however without the presence of police in the allblack film the audience was left with the image of blacks as crooks but with no counter image of black cops the only documentary film of consequence came from lincoln productions although the whites alan bunce and robert rossen contributed narration and script the unknown soldier speaks was an intensely emotional film which strung together war newsreels showing the black mans contribution to the american effort in the world war the unifying device was the ethereal voice of the unknown soldier who describes the heroism of black soldiers despite the survival of ghetto movies by the mids variety began to report the end of the era all major studios are planning films to include colored performers predicted a story about green pastures former fears of southern box office losses began to disappear when some executives saw that the losses might be made up in the overseas market where paul robeson had carved out a career making borderline big fella solomons mines proud valley jericho and other movies the most striking instance of white awakening to the box office power of black themes was the emperor jones with robeson in the title role which did surprising business and helped persuade hollywood to reexamine its racial policies shot on a low budget in astoria long island the picture grossed an amazing in one harlem week but even more astonishing was the it made in washington dc where distributors had predicted failure because of white apathy and black resentment of the term nigger nevertheless despite the success of such s independent productions as the emperor jones and of major hollywood productions such as green pastures with its ambivalent combination of fineedged characterizations and stock types variety in its new yorks anniversary issue for summed up what seemed to be the most remarkable new phenomenon on the cinema scene with the headline story negro and yiddish film boom the story revealed how the major companies watched such trends by black independents as trial balloons before investing their own swollen overhead and budgets in what might have been merely a transitory fad thus the prosperity of independent black companies was often only the storm warning before being swamped by a wave of major company imitations despite such a shift in white attention the black independents managed one last wave of pictures in sackamuse contributed two gun man from harlem a quickie designed for distribution in the southwest while grand national released spirit of youth a boxing romance that could not overcome the wooden acting of joe louis despite the presence of clarence muse and mantan moreland jed buells associated pictures f contributed harlem on the prairie a low budget comic western which variety considered valuable to both white and black film markets lena horne made her movie debut with ralph cooper in million dollar pictures the duke is tops which failed to overcome its slow build toward a series of excellent vaudeville production numbers a year later louise beavers gave her professional touch to million dollars reform school an argument in favor of boys schools based on the honor system the harlem tuff kids lent comic touches to a social drama the early s witnessed jack goldbergs jubilee productions attempted allblack version of othello both the older and new companies kept up a stream of gangster pictures but other kinds of films continued to emerge the bryant company did a semidocumentary of george washington carver in which the old argronomist played himself surrounded by a cast of tuskegee students dixie national with jed buell directing finished mr washington goes to town a kind of black grand hotel which variety predicted would be a healthy grosser all american news released weekly topical newsreels about the black world and the war but the best of the last wave of black productions was million dollars one dark night directed by a sensitive white man leo c popkin variety as usual found the acting of the lesser players wanting and the techniques weak because of the low budget but more important mantan moreland turned in another performance which departed from his white movie typecasting the plot concerns the brown familya negro version of the andy hardy family whose eternally jobless father provides the motive for a matriarchal family unit but once one of many schemes pays out he assumes a patriarchal role and in the accepted middle class manner saves his daughters honor from the villain thus the film realistically suggests unemployment as a casual factor in black family structure the reviewer found it far more entertaining than many hollywood bs low budget pictures and with tighter editing a possible box office success in white houses but the small independent companies in the market of black movies were finally defeated by hollywoods drift toward their territory the s audiences saw such major hollywood productions as lena horne and bill robinson in stormy weather a musical treatment of the black soldier in world war i ethel waters in cabin in the sky and gjon milis evocative jammin the blues in addition importers continued to fill big city houses with robesons english movies such as michael balcons proud valley the story of a black miner who is accepted by and sacrifices his life for a village of welsh miners the united states department of agriculture contributed henry brown farmer with canada lee narrating a story of the negros contribution to world war ii j thus the black independents could not survive the war traditionally unresponsive white rulers of hollywood already were turning their attention to the ring of cash registers in the ghettos they also could piously feel that they were striking a blow for democracy in the war against fascism and racism walter white of the naacp darryl zanuck of twentieth century fox and wendell willkie the republican candidate in all jl f attended the annual academy awards banquet and talked about racial questions varietys headline writer accurately predicted that better breaks for negroes in hwood would come from such discussions but such a result in the war movies of the s the social message movies of the postwar era and the welllaundered negroes of the harry belafonte and sidney poitier period could not obscure the achievement of the black independent producers they had struggled with both superb and indifferent results to keep upon ghetto screens the dignity black humor the soul that were absent from hollywood movies even today they are missed if one heeds the complaints against the the major film companies that continue to see black folk as social problems rather than people there were four i of us children nori man thirdchild jy lory secondchild k davey firstchild and me and of course there was moma moma was a thin hardworking domestic worker with facial squints and frowns that made her seem forever pondering difficult questions her hair was windblown suggesting the woman of perpetual motion she was her hands were thick and severely chapped from long and persistent exposure to disinfectants and detergents and her palms were hard with calluses from having gripped too many electricirons and scrub buckets in the domestic service her grip was strong and while she was a gentle woman she sometimes held our hands too tight when she guided us across a street looking at moma now moving beneath the slogan twenty dollars and consideration which davey printed and hung in the dining room moma surrounded with platters of pigsfeet chitterlings chicken heaped a mountainhigh with potato salad coleslaw ready for sale the proceeds to be donated for the betterment of the lot of general maids and chambermaids so overwhelmingly represented here moma weaving around them greeting them her hair combed severely from her face and pinned at the back of her head in a modest bun severity being required to control it looking at moma now i am a child again looking at moma now and thinking of moma as she was i again see the four of us wideeyed children on holiday running to keep abreast of her quick direct steps she turning now and then to see if we were following and calling hurry children and stepping into the race again the wind lifting her hair sometimes laying it down again sometimes not and moma not minding either way we began our journey imagining the mountains and rivers we would crossalthough we never saw any mountains and the only river we crossed was the schuylkilland we expressed so much enthusiasm that moma had to restrain us almost we ran ahead of her and back again and ahead until we met the crosswalk felt the gnawing urge to race across the street exerting our urge with leaps and yells until moma stood beside us and guided us across the street her large warm hand engulfed ours and our hands explored the warm hard roughness with insatiable curiosity sometimes we giggled we said her hands tickled she said ours would tickle too if we worked as hard as she did the best recreation moma could afford was a train or bus ride into the shopping center where we looked in the store windows or savored frankfurters with mustard and root beer in the fiveanddime then home again w sunday was another special day moma polished our shoes dressed us in our sunday clothes and sent norman and davey next door so that mr cunningham our neigh w w bor could tie their ties then moma dressed herself and asked us girls if she looked presentable and we went to church old and young women smiled at us and at moma and remarked to her that we were wellbehaved some of them said moma looked as young as we and of course moma was proud to hear that moma confided that she was thirtyfive and we children began to notice how long moma remained thirtyfive the neighbors said that moma took excellent care of us and that she had taught us good manners moma replying that she did the best she could moma was proud of us and proud that she was managing to care for us after popa died now and then we could see a moment of sadness pass over momas face when she sat alone in the living room where she and popa used to sit where popa died of a heart attack the living room was filled with apprehension the day moma called us together in the urgent way she had when she had something important to tell us or when she was going to reprimand us the insurance money she received after popa died was almost gone she had to find a jobperhaps housecleaning because it was the only way she knew to earn a living her finding a job meant that we would not see her as much as we used to that we should not feel abandoned or neglected she would make us her little helpers maryellen could do the errands at the neighboring stores norman could scrape the dishes and discard the scraps lory would wash the dishes and prepare our breakfast of cereal and milk and davey would take his wagon to the supermarket and earn money by carrying the ladies groceries home things would be difficult for a while but if grandmoma was able to manage a houseful of children moma could manage a house of four moma worked long hours scrubbing floors washing and ironing clothes she even washed walls and windows evenings she returned from work tired and cross scolded us for having used too much milk or too much sugar or for burning too many lights we were not allowed to have lights in any part of the house other than where we were at the time we could not watch more than two television shows an evening she scolded us for running too much water letting water run down the drain when no one was using it was a waste moma said we watched moma with bewilderment and sometimes tears in the backs of our eyes as she changed to a person we no longer knew one evening after having discovered that each of us had eaten an apple reserved for the next days lunch moma scolded us so severely that suddenly the four of us at once began to cry all the tears we had restrained so long moma was taken aback children she said children and we buried our heads in the folds of her clothing children look at moma let her see those big pretty eyes she pried our hands from her body and embraced us sit down children moma wants to explain something to you you want to hear it don you we nodded and slid rthe sofa and listened to her explain that she worked hard that sometimes bad things happened at work that made her cross she said that she loved us and tucked us happy into bed nights when she thought we were asleep moma sat telling mr cunningham how humiliated some of the women made her feel they planted silver dollars and quarters around the floors moma said to see if she would steal them one woman planted so many quarters around the floors that moma left a note describing the places where the quarters lay and said she hadnt dared to move them and that since she couldnt move them she wasnt able to clean sufficiently she told mr cunningham that the women should have been more daring with their moneyplanting and dropped some dollar bills something that would have done poor folks some real good had they been tempted they seldom gave moma enough to eat one of the women used to fill her refrigerator with steaks hams and every kind of meat poor folks forgot existed moma said but all she could give moma was a cheese sandwich and a cup of tea moma said that at the weeks end the woman had meat left over and spoiling the woman didnt want to throw it away so she wrapped it up and gave it to moma moma said she thanked her for it and when she left the house she threw it away being rich should make vou feel good moma said but she wasnt going to get sick from rich folks bad meat moma took some chitterlings the next time she went to work there whats that olivia the woman asked chitterlings chitterlings for my lunch but i give you lunch its not like im used to eating whats this chitterlings oh its the part of the pig nobody else will eat so they sell it to the poor folks moma said the woman didnt say another word but stared at her with a strange smile on her face like she was paralyzed then there was the woman who reserved a set of cracked plates for moma to eat from moma ate in the kitchen while the family ate together in the dining room moma said the deepest hurt came when she saw the dog eating from the same plate reserved for her we whispered among ourselves the hope that moma would stop working altogether and come home forever but we knew that there would be no money even though davey earned as much as twenty dollars a week carrying groceries at the supermarket moma worked for a woman who was sick with an incurable disease she didnt know what it was but she tolerated the womans ill temper because of her condition and because she felt sorry for her but she cursed moma one day and moma said her throat became so filled up that she couldnt say a word but stared at the woman hot tears running down her face and she must have looked pitiful because the woman apologizedthe first time moma said that she had acted humanly towards her but it was too late moma finished the days work and never returned miss olivia we heard mr cunningham say you can put an end to all of this you knowyou wouldnt have to work if youd marry me and the children would have a father but moma said mr cunninghammr cunningham and we imagined moma patting mr cunningham on the hand in a gesture of appreciation which she could not otherwise express mr cunningham was a nice man he repaired leaking pipes unclogged the plumbing tended the cracked plaster replaced electric fuses or cut norman and daveys hair and refused to accept money so moma invited him to sunday dinner mr cunningham was a big conscientious goodlooking bachelor he had white hair that he said he poured white shoe polish on he smoked lots of cigarettes and had a foggy laugh that sounded as if the smoke had collected in his throat and he had laugh wrinkles he coughed a lot and moma said he smoked too much moma spoke of mr cunningham with pride and respect and wondered why he never married she guessed he never married because he spent half of his life in the united states army i loved to stand and look at mr cunninghams white hair and to watch the wrinkles around his eyes deepen and spread when he laughed he laughed all of the time as if he enjoyed laughing moma admonished me for staring but mr cunningham laughed and took me onto his knee pressed my cheeks to his so that i heard the rattles of laughter in his throat and giggled that girls got a funnybone lets shake it up and he lifted me into the air shook me gently and put me down maryellen im going to marry you when you get just a little older when will i be older lets seetomorrow nooo the next day hmm i giggled and ran into the kitchen to tell moma what mr cunningham said davey he yelled come here man to man he flexed his arms and sent a mock blow to daveys jaw davey aimed for his stomach good man mr cunninghams light aim to daveys stomach caught him by surprise aw davey i praised you for a good defense so what did you do you dropped your guard spare the rug called moma its got to last a while yet wheres that scholarly younger brother of yours norman where you hiding out im here mr cunningham well come out of there and lets see those fists with spirit man now see if you can hit me hard man boys moma said the rug there was new excitement in our house when the doctor suggested that davey and norman be circumcised moma made arrangements to send them to the hospital mr cunningham cut their hair and put sweetsmelling lotion on it moma dressed them in their best clothes and packed a suitcase of pajamas and clothes and funny books lory and i were envious because of the fun and ice cream and cake davey and norman would be eating moma always gave us ice cream when we had to stay in bed and they didnt try to make us any less jealous we asked moma why we could not be circumcised too of course the reason being that we wanted ice cream and cake too she said nothing for a moment then she said it was a long story that took a lot of time to tell and promised us that our brothers would be home in a few days mr cunningham carried the suitcases and davey and norman followed like two boys going on holiday christmas time arrived wearing an unbuttoned winter coat over a cotton house dress moma set out against the wind and frost often forgetting to powder her face and neglecting her hair she never protected her head against the weather not even against the march wind which she said thinned the hair and her face was a taut expression of perplexity where has the time gone she sighed revealing large hands reddened by the stinging wind as she wearily set a large bag on the table only a few months ago it was summer time flies she sat upon the sofa and slowly pulled off her coat bring moma a basin of hot waterand the salt these feet have done some walking today davey went to get the water while lory norman and i stood watching moma pull off her stockings and rub her feet with her hands moma had the funniest looking toes they were thick short and arched and looked as if she had been in the habit of wearing shoes too tight for her feet tonight is christmas eve moma i said obeying a compulsion to touch one of her toes yes children tonight is christmas eve mr cunningham will be along with the tree soon and before momas children go to bed they can hang a ball or two on the tree we jumped up and down each of us shouting something children momas ears moma davey said setting the basin of water beneath momas feet why dont you and mr cunningham get married married moma said startled what do you know about married where did you hear that just marrieddavey mumbled ashamed of having suggested it dont be ashamed son mr cunningham is a nice man hes good to the children but it wouldnt be fair it would be taking advantage if the children were oldermarried my boys got a new word in his vocabulary moma said easing her feet into the warm water christmas morning we scampered downstairs to open presents mr cunningham stood hands in his pockets smiling as we eagerly ripped the wrappings from our gifts of model airplanes and guns and sewing kits and bingo sets from mr cunningham and we ripped the ribbons from corduroy pants and wool sweaters wool jumpers blouses socks candy from moma i hope you children will take good care of your new clothes moma worked hard with the help of the good lord well manage if we take care she held up a package and squinted an eye i dont remember wrapping this one she turned the label over until she saw to moma printed on the label by lorys hand she opened the package and made such contortions of her face that we were frightened she looked from one to the other of us tears racing down her face the childrens first christmas present to their moma a pair of rubber gloves and sweetsmelling hand cream come here children sniffing away her tears she put her arms around all of us at once dont cry moma davey begged and nearly cried too momas not crying children momas just happy put some on your hands moma not now children lets save it to put under the tree until after christmas all right children we nodded our heads and replacing the bottle and rubber gloves under the tree she embraced us again while mr cunningham stood watching and chuckling with the same pride our father would have shown we had moma all to ourselves most sundays she shopped for food saturday evenings and davey brought it home in the wagon she lengthened the hems of lorys and my dresses and lengthened norman and daveys pants cuffs exclaiming that we grew taller every week when lory outgrew her clothing they were passed to me and davey passed his to norman once moma could not afford to buy a pair of shoes for me so she let me wear a pair of lorys to school until she could do better they were too large and too wide for me and it was obvious to anyone looking at them that they were not mine i remember children stared at me as i stood in the line outside a class room they whispered i tried to tuck my feet under me so that they could not see but i knew that it was impossible to hide i wanted to die right there or to disappear through the floor a girl stepped out of the opposite line whose shoes you got theyre too big for you oh no i said my feet are just large for my size she stared at me and at my shoes for a while without saying anything i wished she would laugh and get it over with but she said my sisters feet are large too mother said she thinks she stopped growing so that her feet could grow and her shoes are so expensive are your shoes expensive too then the line she was in started moving and i didnt have to answer to help moma i began collecting empty perfume bottles and hiding them among my playthings when i thought i had enough i began filling them with water and a drop of momas perfume i was going to earn lots of money for moma so that she could afford to buy things and stay home i put the bottles into normans wagon and transported them to the corner drugstore where i lined them on a ledge outside the window and hung a sign with the price of five cents written on it hold out your wrist i said to the first lady i saw what you selling little girl hold out your wrist oh perfume she said and raised her eyebrows whats the name of your perfume no name its brandnew i rubbed the liquid on her wrist smells awfully good she said it costs five cents ill tell you what little girl ill pay you a nickel now and if you have any perfume left when i come back ill take one home she patted me on the head and continued her walk a neighbor stopped does your mother know youre out here trying to sell that maryellen what is it perfume i said timidly perfume sniffing it it has no scent where did you get it i made it come along your mother wouldnt allow this she said leading me home maryellen moma said in a horrified voice your moma never taught you to do anything like that why did you do it i dont know you dont know momas going to have to punish you maybe then shell get some reason out of you dont moma teach you not to beg yes moma then why on this earth did you do it stop wringing your hands and talk to moma i dont know i said crying you should have cried before you did it now ill have to send you to bed without your dinner i did it for you i cried and threw my arms around her burying my face in her apron moma lifted my head and stared at me go dry your eyes you wouldnt want mr cunningham to see his big girl with wet eyes would you and she held me so tight that it frightened me now go she said it was our daily game to see which one of us would be the first to recognize momas footsteps upon the pavement outside when she climbed the stairs her footsteps sounded like the labored footsteps of a person bearing a heavy burden we rushed to the door happy to have her home each of us trying to be the first to take hold of her carryall and to pick up her discarded shoes her hair was ruffled and her breathing quick she gave us the usual startled look children she said as if she was seeing us for the first time and barefooted she walked to the sofa sat heavily upon it sighed looked around the room and back to us how are the children finish your school work and before we could answer she said lory fix momas salt water so she can soak her feet hurry momas feet are about to kill her its a sure sign that were in for some rainy weather moma got all kinds of signs she knew when we were going to have a visitor and whether it would be a man or a woman depending upon whether the left or right side of her nose itched she had even gotten a sign that papa was going to die the picture of him that hung on the wall just fell one night moma said the nail was still securely in the wall and the wire was not broken from the frame she rehung it and it fell again moma said i was born with a veil over my face and that i used to see things she couldnt see that grandmoma and grandpopa had special vision too grandpopa could neither read nor write but he could open the newspaper and turn to the horse betting section and predict the winner and he could drive a car anywhere and never had had an accident and grandmoma could tell when we did something wrong she didnt have to see us do it shed just get the belt and of course she had to catch us first we stood near moma and stared wondering how she could tell that it was going to rain lory looped an arm through momas while davey norman and i sought to touch an equal part of her did you work hard today moma we asked and waited for her to reveal strange tales no harder than usual children davey give momas back a little rub my my my boy is getting stronger and stronger every minute thats too strong now son youll rub the skin from momas backgentle gentle thats the boy bring moma a cup of coffee norman that new woman i worked for today is as stingy as a cipher you would think coffee was rationed lory set down the basin of salt and water and moma eased her feet into the water children does that feel good she wiggled her toes in the water we laughed and she wiggled them again just to make us laugh what did the children do today nothing we answered more interested in what had happened to her during the day well you must have done something ill start with you maryellen give moma a full account of what she missed today we were watching television one evening when norman rushed into the living room and told us that moma had come to stealing you never saw so much toothpaste it tastes like thousands of flavors where asked davey in the medicine closetall kinds of sweetsmelling soap too we ran upstairs to taste the toothpaste lory opened the jar and we stuck a finger into it it tastes good enough to eat we vigorously brushed our teeth stopping only to plunge our brushes into the jar or toothpaste and to marvel at its abundance it tasted delicious and we were glad that we would not have to use bak ing soda to wash our teeth any more we smelled the fragments of soap rubbed them together in our hands and let the water run into our hands and vigorously rubbed our hands together to the most exciting bubbles where do you think moma got this i asked oh from those rich people they use a different piece of soap every day every day thats wasting so moma didnt steal it cant you see these are left overs it would only be wasted they never use all of the toothpaste from the tube they use it two or three times and they throw it away wow we wont have to brush our teeth with baking soda its so scratchyand we wont have to bathe with that brown soap any more its not good for the complexion moma said its more economical lets take a bath davey suggested we got into a tub nearly overflowing with water and had the most delicious bath in a tub filled with miraculous bubbles like wed never seen moma came home in the evening and shouted to us to turn off the television and come upstairs each of us reluctant to be the first to mount where are you moma one of us called knowing full well that she was standing in the bathroom door her hair stood wildly over her head and her face was stern here whats the matter moma stand tall she said staring at the guilt on our faces what ducks have been splashing in here pointing to the puddles on the floor and the mirror streaked with toothpaste and water is this the way you behave when momas away we stood like criminals in a lineup our chins practically in our chests now i want all of you to get busy and clean this room in record time she commanded and left the room time pushed on bringing many changes moma worked sundays serving dinners little by little she was able to get things for the house she had not been able to get before davey norman and mr cunningham laid new tile in the kitchen and painted the interior of the house norman and davey had grown very tall and muscular and moma did not go into the bathroom when they were bathing any more and lory was acting strange one day she called moma into our room with what seemed like hysteria and moma didnt ask her what the matter was but embraced her and in a comforting voice whispered that it was all right and told me to go downstairs for a few days afterward moma treated lory in a special way as if there was something between them that the rest of us could not share often during the day she called lory upstairs or questioned her in a manner that we could not understand and then the day came when i awoke started to get out of bed sat rigidly on the side and said lory my voice quivering and she said dont tell me tell moma with knowing indifference and i yelled for moma with all my strength i baffled that woman i worked for today moma said one day not long ago easing her feet into the basin of salt and water she was chuckling and in the best spirits we had seen in a long time she even looked younger the woman gave me the upstairs to clean and i finished before noon i told her i was finished before she expected me to be finished and she just gaped at me you finished the whole upstairsthe baseboard beds everything she asked me i said yes and she asked me if that included the windows i said i didnt wash windows any more that that was a mans job but i said i could do it this time if she was pressed for labor for twentydollars and carfare i didnt know i was going to say it children but you know i felt so good afterwards if they cant stand cleaning their own houses they ought to be willing to pay the price for somebody else to clean it a woman should keep her own housewell children she brought out a big bundle of ironingclothes from last year and the year before she didnt want to pay twentydollars for washing the windows but she was going to keep me busy for the rest of the daywhether id finished what i came to do or not did she really give you clothes from last years wash moma almost that much children almost moma smiled rocking her body back and forth because of the throbbing in her toes i finished the ironing by three oclock and she was beside herself she said i was supposed to work until six she found some silver and told me to fill the salt and pepper shakers until she could find something else for me to do she came back with a defeated look and said she guessed that was all and fumbled with the zipper on her purse you ever noticed that rich people have zippers on their purses and the poor people have snaps on theirs moma said laughing moma davey said laughing its mostly true moma said well she counted out twentydollars and handed them to me as if i was a poor relative asking for charity youre getting so independent she said so i said my children are growing up ones going to be a doctor and the others going to be a nurse really she said and children i dont think she believed that it would be possible she told her neighbors that i was charging twenty dollars and carfare and that i refused to wash windows before i knew anything maizie was congratulating me for my gumption and saying we ought to organize soon you wont have to work at all moma davey said my children grown up already right out of momas sight and theyre working good jobs ive got an accountant a secretary and im going to have a doctor and a nurse they dont have to scrub floors moma made certain of that where have the years gone children its a sure sign you and your signs moma she looked from one to the other of us smiling and nodding momas never wrong rub momas back will you baby moma sniffing the aroma of chitterlings flowing through the house smells good dont it children its going to be some benefit dinner moma let me style your hair and manicure your nails make you a glamorous maid theres nothing glamorous about being a maid but very soon children were going to give it a little dignity just look a little glamorous never mind id just as soon remain moma let me do it please moma let her moma tonights a special night itll be like introducing you to society if society asks why you are so late arriving you can explain you had a lot of making up to do brilliant davey thank you lory this is only a sample of my brilliance how about printing a sign that says twenty dollars and consideration thatll be good children the girls will like that moma lifted a foot out of the basin and began drying it with a towel momas got some bad feet but theyre the only ones i have so i shouldnt complain too much remembering moma then and looking at moma now gallantly pressing those feet into action stopping of a sudden to rearrange her toes in her shoes i can still hear her asking does moma look presentable is the hair combed too severely from my face and looking into the mirror and patting her hair and smoothing her dress baby i dont like this red on my lipstoo gaudy moma now darting here and there replenishing paper plates with chitterlings pigsfeet potato salad dont be bashful buy two and three plates and help the cause twenty dollars and consideration were poor and we have to work but we want to be treated human moma is saying and she never stops scooping up the chitterlings twenty dollars and consideration from someone in the room with a side order of chitterlings mr cunningham as handsome as ever and never letting moma out of his sight pushing a forkful of chitterlings into his mouth moma now and the four of us children looking back in our concerted memories looking on with concerted hope everything south of canada malcolm_x once said is prison and knowing what we do about canada we may even include canada however the physical reality of prison as opposed to the mental detention we all suffer from has not been totally negative to black people beginning with malcolm_x we find a number of negroes who graduated from that institution of black artists among them etheridge knight eldridge cleaverand now we are blessed with calvin c heard author of howard street dial in reading black rage the section on education gave us an insight into the meaning of time school is pitting black time against the white time we all must face sooner or later drs william grier and price cobb say our black men purchase black women time by sending us to school and putting themselves on the firing line prison is a black mans school it is the time he has nothing more to worry about than the guards and poor facilities which can easily be compared with the police and poor facilities of the outsidewith the added component that in prison he is completely dependent which is not speaking on the need for imprisonment or to indicate in any way that it is a desirable state but only to relate to the fact that in a state of complete dependence ie having no responsibility for physical well being the black man can relax and deal with his mental and emotional needs in this context we would not think it at all unfair to compare four years at fisk with two at the new jersey state prison and though we took different trails we all have ended at the same state and this time a main stop and not some little way station howard street nathan heards first novel is a masterpiece for a single work we would compare it to the flagellants which we compared to many thousands gone which we link to invisible man and on into classic black literature for just the sheer technical skill and black understanding he brings us in the book nathan heard not only knows but also loves every one of his characters and he doesnt waste himself or our time trying to justify it perhaps we mention this because our middleclass approximations require that he indeed should judge them and justify his love but through howard street we find that all black people are beyond judgment heard simply says we aretake it or leave it and he isnt belligerent about it angry yes who could help but be able to place responsibility for there can be no blame without a judgment most definitely but it doesnt matter what the white man thinks or what we think or even what nathan heard thinks about hip gypsy pearl or franchot because the only reality is how they feel and how they relate to that feelingand we can look or not like or not it has essentially nothing to do with their lives anyway amoral we would simply think a new morality how can any of us dare to judge hip franchots junkie brother on the old terms as hip so ably defends himself from rosemary i aint bothering nobody i aint no cop and i aint no soldier i dont build no bombs and i dont fly no planes to drop none i aint no redblooded american trying my damnedest to spill the red blood of other countries and i aint responsible for none of the mess in the world sure i make an illegal dollar here and there and i dont follow no christian ethic but then i dont claim none yall hypocrites cant say as much can you no we cant we all play a gross game that they at least hip and gypsy pearl the best prostitute on howard street have moved beyond take it or not theyre real we run around trying to win fame and fortune while decrying other folks for achieving some degree of it we largely suspect some lean hungry young people are coming to lunch whenever the counter is openedwearing brooks brothers danshikis carrying the latest pronouncements from an intellectual who probably thought w e b du bois was french and decided not to deal with him we all hope for a star that we may be the ones to shoot it down we hate our mothers for being strong and our fathers for being weak we sit in graduate school hating undergraduates for having faith and envying professors for their degrees we are discontented because we have not allowed ourselves to be who we are and as close to what we want to be as we can we are more afraid of being laughed at and losing our cool than we are of innovating and discovering our warmth we are afraid to love because we are afraid to hate we are loathe to hope because our fear may consume us we shout no war cries because we sing no love songs we sit in the shadows in our sunglasses firmly convinced that black is beautiful but how will we know unless we come naked into the sun we are afraid to feel because to feel is life and to live is to kill we dont want to kill but to kill is love and to love is our national manhood and our natural birthright when hip breaks the capsule and shoots up he is killing for all times or at least until he comes down the worldmost especially the hypocrites when gypsy pearl goes out for hip shes doing what every school teacher or social worker does for her husbandmanworking to help them both meet another day its so easy to condemn a prostitute for selling her body but who doesnt what is it but prostitution when we sit somewhere for eight hours a day and make the proper responses to people and things that have no meaning for us we are placing ourselves at the hands of the same whoremonger as she only she has the whoremongers disdain while we have his praise and of the two we are the most likely to contract his social diseases hip and franchot had a beautiful relationship hip accepted franchot holding a straight job while franchot accepted hips illegalism each offered the other what he hadto be accepted or not sartre or one of those people would call that existentialism we call it love rosemary franchots girl was the only one unwilling to give and take in that manner rosemary didnt want gypsy pearls in franchots house because she thought the competition would be too stiff rosemary attempts to make hip jealous but hip only offers rosemary the same position in his life as gypsy pearl now occupies rosemary got insulted and complained to franchot that hip propositioned her did you accept it he asked no well then dont worry about it rosemary thinks franchot doesnt understand but he understands all too well that after a certain point we are responsible for what we are no man as he points out can put a woman on the block if she doesnt want to turn out and howard street is peopled with memorable characters who have turned out many times jackie the one who almost made it off the street gets philosophical and explains you cant make it on the street until you learn to say i dont want to hear that st and little jimmie who adores jackiebut in his adoration never saw jackie but only the glory then the degradation never the strength never the love miss it and miss thing were delightful if transvestites can be delightful cowboy mcnair emma dee and all the people who are in the final analysis just people trying to fill as many of their needs as possible wed like to say it but in light of how it affected us we ask instead please read it nathan heard has given us another look at the whole scene lets take it now so that we can be ready nikki giovanni the major difficulty with the negro almanac published more than a year ago by bellwether publishing company in new york is the price the big plus page book retails for which puts it out of the hands of most potential consumers and even of some community libraries it is a pity the book is very nearly what its jacket blurb claims an indispensable reference work for home school office the market is being deluged just now with books dealing with various aspects of black life and history and many of them are very much worthwhile but few of them manage to bring together within the covers of a single volume so much useful information much of this information is backed up with maps and charts there is an extensive selected bibliography and there is a rather comprehensive index nevertheless there also are many glaring errors of omission some misinformation and misplaced emphasis the two gentlemen responsible for compiling and editing the negro almanac are dr harry a ploski and dr roscoe c brown jr both of the faculty of new york university on the evidence of the book drs ploski and brown need considerable exposure to what has been happening in the past decade their selections of who and what is of significance suggests that they dwell in an era other than the revolutionary age of the sixties for example neither kristin hunter nor ronald fair is listed among the negroes in literature although both authors had produced two important novels at the time the book went to press and leroi jones and william melvin kelley are the only two under authors in the ploskibrown list excepting a supplementary list of other negro literary figures which does include such younger poets as julia fields and clarence major the lists of national negro organizations and famous negro personalities also are highly selective with emphasis on the donetodeath people lou rawls is not even mentioned among the performing artists in the entertainment department the editors chose photographs as though they were doing a special issue of fan magazine too much gloss and space in the section on the negro press the editors somehow managed even to omit negro digest from the list of commercial magazines and journals although such obscure publications as ivy leaf and on the ball magazine were noted of course they also ignored liberator one of the few important black journals about there is in short much to quarrel with in the negro almanac but to quarrel is to miss the point the book represents a valuable contribution to the literature of black people and as was stated at the beginning it simply is a pity that it costs so much perhaps the publishers will consider in the near future bringing out a paperback edition of the negro almanac selling for a dollar or so by that time the editors will have been able to bring their material more up to date and to arrange to fill some of the important omissionshwf who is esteban montejo well he is a yearoid cuban he is black he is proud and he is an extraordinary man this autobiography the autobiography of a runaway slave by esteban montejo is a unique item for it is doubtful that we shall ever again hear such an authentic voice from the past his editor miguel barnet is a cuban poet and anthropologist and he has captured with considerable skill the flavor of this man and his time the book is divided into three parts slavery abolition and the war of independence in the first part montejo tells of the bleak misery of his childhood he never knew his parents negroes were sold like pigs he states and they sold me at once he refuses to accept sympathy for this fact since it is not sad because it is true his description of life in the barracoons slave quarters is a recital of torture and deprivation and even humor life was based on watchfulness and the whip but there were also games and drinking bouts and lovemaking in the cane fields any student of anthropology would find the vivid descriptions of life in nineteenth century cuba invaluable for montejo treats us to a feast of festivals african rituals medicine and superstitions this is a carnival without real gaiety in which slaves cuban born blacks whites and mulattoes chinese servants the odd gypsy filipinos and spanish overlords play their particular scenes montejo rebelled against slavery and escaped into the thick forests of cuba he lived there for years without any human contact until he heard the shouts of freedom then he left his hideaway and reentered the world he had left but he never gave up that reserve that independence lots of negroes wanted to be friends with me and they used to ask me what i had done as a runaway i told them nothing i have always been one for my independence idle gossip never helped anyone i went for years and years without talking to anyone at all life after emancipation was really the same litany of woe as it had been during slavery it was the pretense of liberation without freedom the same backbreaking work with little hope of advancement the real joys then were listening to the old ma lucias stories of an africa he did not know of hearing the elders talk about the land africa animals and apparitions of participating in the festivals of remedios and ariosa of learning about spirits and witchcraft this was what he knew until the cry for independence sounded throughoul cuba until he knew that this war against spain was also his war the fact is the war was necessary the dead would have died anyway and this way they were dying for a purpose the war was needed it was wrong that so many jobs and privileges should fall into spanish hands or that women should have to sleep with spaniards to get work none of this was right you never saw a negro lawyer because they said negroes werent good for anything except the forest you never saw a negro schoolmaster it was all kept for white spaniards even the white creoles were pushed aside i saw this happen a watchman with nothing to do except walk up and down call the hour and put out the lights had to be a spaniard it was the same everywhere there was no freedom i realized this when the leaders explained it all to us this was why we had to go to war the cuban war for independence from spain lasted from and when it ended the americans were firmly in control of the country in this historically fascinating section montejo speaks movingly about his hero the black general maceo who was killed during the war he thinks that the cuban patriot general maximo gomez has been given too noble a place in history he suggests that gomez might have collaborated with the americans in the sinking of the mainean act that brought the americans to cuba above all he enunciates the contempt americans had for blacks their disregard of cuban customs their abuse of cuban women and their spread of racist venom among the cubans he remains convinced however that truth will always triumph for now he sees that cubans have become masters of their country it is irrelevant to say that one system of slavery was more humanethan the other when people are deprived of their freedom when they become goods that are geared to the machinery of production it makes no sense to compare systems yet there is one striking difference in the panoply of slavery in cuba and in this country african culture remained deeply entrenched in cuba during slavery montejo emphatically states that the strongest gods are african and so he cannot understand why they permitted slavery he further observes that no person is one thing pure and simple in this country because all the religions have got mixed together the african brought his which is the stronger one and the spaniard brought his which isnt so strong but you should respect them all that is my way of thinking he has great respect for the old men of his youth who were born in africa and were therefore special people who had to be treated differently because they knew all about religious matters he notes that they were called the muzzled ones by the creoles because of their inability to speak spanish but for him they were the essence of gentility fortitude and good manners they taught me many things without being able to read or writecustoms which are more important than knowledge to be polite not to meddle in other peoples affairs to speak softly to be respectful and religious to work hard esteban montejo knew from whence he came he had the myths the superstitions and the festivals of a strong culture and these were enough to sustain him to tell him that the symbols of inferiority heaped upon his race were a travesty of the past his ancestors knew it was this knowledge that enabled him to live like a hermit in the siguanea forests to say of slavery it was repugnant to me it was shameful it was like a plagueit still seems like that today it was his confidence in that past that made him deride the whites who believed that the blacks were created for locks and bolts and whips and with whom he refused to truck since they believed they were the lords of creation and it is precisely his belief in that noble past that enables him to say today at that even if i had to die tomorrow i would not give up my pride he throws down the gauntlet to those who would limit human freedom who would dare to set limits on a mans aspirations thats why i say i dont want to die so i can fight in all the battles to come and im not going into the trenches or using any of those modern weapons a machete will do for me this is the voice of a man and it is the resonance of this voice that must reverberate on our psyches for black men must be proud again they must reach out to grab the world by its balls and fashion it to suit them it is this stubbornness this refusal to admit defeat in the teeth of a racist system designed to destroy them that should be the rallying call of american blacks for the black mans history in this western world is nothing if it is not one of indestructibility of his tenacious belief that he would not die but would confirm his humanity until his children were strong enough to proclaim it from every rooftop and that belief has not been in vain for there are now loud echoes resounding from the voices of the last poets in the souls of black folk web du bois observes that black americans must so to speak look at the world through two separate lenses one lens scanning the scene as it is on the surface while the other refocuses according to the adjusted meaning for the black individuals lifechances consequently the black ego consists of two selfimages one black the other white between these two selves there looms a continual lifedeath struggle in which the white self is an object to the subjective black self the black self is spontaneous and natural restrained and restrictive for the black individual the drama of thinking conceiving judging believing reasoning deciding reacting expecting in short existing is to resist the tyrannical impositions of the exterior white self on the stage of existence today the mirror of the black persons looking glass self is white contradicting and negating the black ego this dooms the fainthearted black individual to think in a white framework confusing and contradictory contending on the pushpull scale of color prejudice pushed from the security of what otherwise would be his blackness into the grasping abyss of an alien and destructive whiteness yet unlike other animals man while influenced by phenomena external to himself is not a slave to his circumstances past or present where lower animals rely on instinct and the nature of the habitat man is capable of resorting to strategy and reasonthough many do not indeed mans scientific name homo sapiens is translated thinking man although scientists also toyed with then discarded the label homo loquens or talking man which admittedly characterizes the major ity of us accurately but in a fundamental sense man is distinguished from other animals by his ability to thinkwhich is in the ideal sense an important prelude to thinkingand is capable of choosing between two or more ideas or alternatives rejecting one or both of them cicero was aware of this in his treatise on friendship when he stated wise men are instructed by reason men of less understanding by experience the most ignorant by necessity beasts by nature history let alone the biographies of individuals is a testimony to mans ability to rise above the surface of his circumstances as black men are now beginning to do said cicero further vivere est cogitore to think is to live it is not merely to contemplate the dictionary lists connotations of thinking we have chosen one of them to keep continually in mind be obsessed with as he thinks model airplanes all day long in other words to think is to live to think black is to live black to think black is to feel black look black so far as we can and be black to think black is to question whiteness and its values and the contradictions and irrationalities of white society however thinking black does not addict oneself alone to combating whiteness to do so would place the black individual all over again in a neosubordinate role reacting instead of initiating action to react to whiteness exclusively is to fall victim to a kind of reactionformation this in a roundabout way itself acknowledges the supremacy of whiteness it gives rise to symbolic behavior enslaved by the dictates of white decrees it is like a fighter always on the defensive seldom or never putting forth an offensive thrust absolute negativism is rigidly defensive a good contestant needs both a good defense and a good offense but most of all a good offense thinking black far from getting bogged down in dogmatic nihilism is based on a philosophy of pragmatic positivism more about that later we may divide the processes of thinking black for the purposes of discussion into a sixpronged attack the plasma of black thinking the plasma of black thinking may be categorized as follows pphysiognomy llanguage aartifacts ssickness mmathematics and aaudaciousness physiognomy this refers to the system of defining white characteristics as desirable black as undesirable which must be reversed in order to think black the motivations behind the negative physiognomy of blackness have a long history from the beginning blacks subjugated in slavery were subjected to a system of whitewashing this included control over their minds bodies and souls even down to the present day black individuals are brought up on a diet of diddies such as the black race was lured to america with stories of tanks of molasses and flapjacks growing on trees one of the rhymes which may be heard asserts that you can tell a chinaman you can tell a dutch you can tell a nigger but you cant tell him much now a white man was born with a veil over his face he can tell you things years before they ever take place but a nigger was born with a sack over his ass he cant tell you a damned thing until its done passed this defines the black race called negroes ie niggers as inferior another goes like this if youre white youre all right yellow youre mellow brown stick around black stand back they also may talk of wanting nothing black but a cadillac many parents contrarily avoid references to color or race within earshot of their children some touch the backs of their hands to indicate a black person rub the palms to refer to a white individual many black children accordingly grow up thinking of themselves coneludes princeton psychologist bertram karon the negro personality as inferior defining impressive attributes of the black race as undesirable for instance the sensuality of full hips and full lips become in a turnabout way degrading the thin lips and flat hips of white women alternatively are held out to black women as models for emulation many black women will starve themselves puny in the effort to lose the major attributes they possess while coveting for example the horselike legs of white women many black women are impelled to fry their hair to imitate the stringy texture of white womens tresses when anybody knows who has ever chanced to see that there is nothing so beautiful as a black womans freshly washed hair the intricacies of the curls are impressive indeed to behold a work of art it is almost enough to make a man believe in god while whites bake themselves all day to get rid of their whiteness blacks disdain the sun and hug the shade in search of whiteness as children we were laughed at when suntanned and deterred from drinking coffee with the warning that to drink coffee would make us blacker the preferential physiognomy of whiteness is apparent when black men and women grown and gray after the freedom of barefoot days as children purchase shoes too small in order to restrict the sufficiency of their pedal foundations language the language of white america has exhibited a builtin force destructive of the black individuals selfconcept white is the color symbolizing purity while black is a color loaded with derogatory connotations in addition blacks are taught to worship a god who is always painted white then to sing that they want to be more and more like jesus who will be riding six white horses when he comes i myself accepted these white myths at the early age of eight joining the church inopportunely during the lords supper a cannibalistic white rite in which the lord eats nothing but christians actually proceed symbolically to eat the lord then i grew up to learn that god is dead only to read later that they found him alive in the white house i therefore proposed that they move the white house to howard university and call it the black house but the suggestion didnt take too well with those on high the language of prejudice is apparent to the person thinking black when an intelligent individual is labeled bright as over against stupid professors are said to reside in the ivory tower including those at socalled negro colleges or ebony towers whetherwe are regarded as the black sheep of our families may not correlate with skin color we are nonwhites even when we are in the majority but the dictionary carries no such word as nonblack even mulattoes are curiously halfwhite instead of halfblack recently i sat listening to a verbose fellows discussion of the dark famine of ireland finally i told him if it was that bad it had to be white artifacts artifacts include the objects made by man and used in everyday life for instance children must pass through sunday schools with lesson cards picturing a white jesus and his disciples surrounded by church walls and decorative windows portraying the same in school they are exposed to textbooks peopled by middle class white urban children talking the doubletalk of looksee primary readers this same condition pervades most other areas of american life and is compounded by a number of other contradictions visavis black people sickness too much already has been written on the schizoid nature of white society and the bland emptiness of white culture to merit detailed discussion here in all areas of lifesex religion race crime and commercethere is a tendency sometimes socially approved to profess one thing and practice another this stems in part from the practice of holding out progress as an ideal in the technical and scientific spheres while clinging to tradition and convention in the social sphere obsolescent social institutions and norms developed by primitive whites to fit their own social conditions have been handed down to us and cemented by the cake of custom the discrepancy between the mushrooming technological development and our social stagnation grows greater not surprisingly with each day sociologists call this a cultural lag i think that by now it has become a cultural drag yet many black persons cling gullibly to these norms while whites may frequently disdain the alleged ideals in preference to more customary real practices thinking blacks are not obliged to merely adjust to a schizoid society which itself is maladjusted to be adjusted to a maladjusted society is in effect to be maladjusted black persons thinking black quite naturally will reject a society which rejects black people to accept a society which rejects you is in a roundabout way to reject yourself mathematics the numerical basis of the system which oppresses black people is apparent in the word minority group which implies that blacks are oppressed because they represent a numerical minority actually they are a majority in the world as a whole and all over the world wherever there are white people are oppressed regardless of their proportionate representation yet whites a minority in the world as a whole have developed and disseminated techniques of majorityrule which stymie black efforts toward selfdetermination we are told that we are a minority whenever retaliatory violence flares in the black community but simultaneously urged to engage in the majority dominated politics of voting our way to freedom even population statistics and birth controlthe essence of the numbers and distribution of people take on a tinge of white racism we are led to believe to think that our predicament is a product of our high procreative powers that we may soon cause the population to outstrip the food supply actually it would appear to represent a discrepancy between the distribution of resources and people the land surface of the earth my third grade geography teacher told me is only about twothirds of the globe an eminent graduate school professor in turn proclaimed that twothirds of the people have crowded themselves into only about onetenth of the land area we have not learned to eat much of the edible material for example dozens of specimens of fish swimming wild in the ocean i can conceive of a gigantic raftvillage afloat at sea instead the white man proceeds to disseminate books such as standing room only wherein it would appear that should the situation ever reach that point the problem will just about take care of itself one illustration will indicate the condition in which we already find ourselves dr bentley glass famous new york biologist recently predicted in the press that by the turn of the century the practice will emerge in response to population explosion of issuing coupons when couples are wed two coupons one child per coupon we already have acquired the coupon of marriage a marriage license couples whose children can obtain a genetic certificate tantamount to the current blood test certificate prerequisite to marriage will be able to exceed the twochild allotment the method of certifying couples genetically will according to dr glass be based on a test of physical and mental normalcy of the two allotted offspring the offspring will be examined of course by tests made out on the white folks up at princeton black children for reasons now wellknown will be less likely to pass the tests then rev ralph abernathy jr v will have to stage a march on washington in order to get a fertility rights act passed audaciousness the black race and its struggle today is in need of individuals who can dare to be problack as well as antiwhite to think blackwe have already concludedis to be black to be black in turn is to do black the latter is a rather neglected phenomenon many black militants unconsciously overplay the process of being black in order to avoid doing black they lose themselves in dogmatic nihilism and mystic militancy their militancy their blackness becomes a religion so to speak in which strategy is enslaved by their symbolism africa for example a land most never truly expect to visit may take the place of the christians heaven as it were african garb replacing the priestly frock although this is not to deride such practices as a means of cementing ones identity as a black individual so long as they do not become ends instead of means frantz fanon maotsetung and che guevara may be parroted like a bible without apparent concern for transforming their conclusions to fit the demography culture and social organization of this country sometimes i feel that the white folk gave us such works for some good reason many mystic militants mistakenly measure militancy on a scale of whiterejection those who reject whites percent though conservative economically and politically are regarded as more militant than those who reject only per cent and so on i who reject only and of them am occasionally regarded as a moderate that may be so but those who would think black must now prepare to move out of this expressive bag and take on the pragmatic duties of true revolutionary innovation on january a group of middleranking military officers attempted to take over the civilian government of nigeria this attempt was foiled by the higher military officers under the leadership of the late majorgeneral ironsi the attempted take over led to the death of the federal prime minister two regional premiers and the federal minister of finance following the attempt the civilian government handed over powers to the nigerian army after the military take over the future of nigeria as a single political unit became highly uncertain the army mutiny of july and the mass massacre of civilians of eastern nigerian origin particularly in northern nigeria led to the secession of the former eastern nigeria now called biafra the nigerian military government attempt to end what it termed a rebellion led to what jet magazine of july called the war between blacks nobody cares about in that same july eugene walton writing in negro digest pointed out the often overlooked fact that the colonial powers in their scramble for africa created countries without regard to the tribal and cultural differences of african people mr walton noted m under the circumstances it may be better to let them come apart and regroup along lines of their own choosing forming new nations with more workable economic and cultural combinationsand certainly with more harmonious tribal groupings this article will attempt to analyze the cultural content of the former federation of nigeria and the part cultural differences played in the countrys disintegration we may remind our readers that nigeria had million people from about different ethnic tribal groups the land area was about four times that of the united kingdom or the size of the states of oklahoma and texas the country was made up of four regions states each region was autonomous and in fact each had different diplomatic representation at the court of st james london the federal and regional governments had bicameral legislaturesthe second chamber called the senate on the federal level and house of chiefs on the regional level cases for and against the continuation of nigeria as a political unit nigeria was seen by many non nigerians as an example of political stability in black africa her leadership was noted for its political sportsmanship compromise was the foundation stone of the political stability the first case for the continuation of nigeria as a political unit is the psychic movement towards unity that is common among many liberals and intellectuals such unity is said to be essential for the human race as a whole particularly if economic and other values are to be maximized second africa now has more countries than any other continent in the world and further increase from existing countries would lead to mushroom countries too small to be viable this is the balkanization thesis third economists and others drawing from adam smith point out that division of labor is limited by the extent of the market and in the case of nigeria disintegration would essentially lead to economic suicide such disintegration would hamper factor mobility fourth nigeria had been a laboratory of human relations and its disintegration would suggest the failure of black people to interact in a meaningful way for their own common good the cases for allowing nigeria to disintegrate start first with the artificial nature of nigeria lord hailey one of the most enlightened british colonial experts had remarked that in creating nigeria britain created perhaps the most artificial of the many administrative units created in the course of european occupation of africa the continuation of this artificial entity would be a major source of instability and would for all practical purposes retard the process of development second nigeria by its size is too big to be handled by a single political authority particularly when one takes into consideration primacy of the various modern institutions in the new states third any modem government must have the confidence of its citizens this confidence must be built on trust and a feeling of belonging in the case of nigeria events in the past two years have shown that fear mistrust and resentment have been the order of the day and that a section of the country felt that their security life and property were no longer protected in the nigerian federation events in the past two years seem to justify this feeling fourth the economic case for nigerian existence tends to overlook the fact that more than politics economic relations transcend national boundaries the european economic community the east african common market and the central american economic area are examples where economics go wider than politics exterminating people as now done in nigeria limits the market since potential manpower is destroyed and property damaged fifth it might be better to have small but stable countries than to have large and unstable ones finally by its very nature federalism is a bond which may be broken when parties fail to live up to their obligations many federations in the british colonial and commonwealth history did not last for long these include the malaysian federation india and pakistan and the west indies federation britain did not succeed in her efforts to incorporate ireland and quite recently there were talks about the establishment of a scottish national assembly it might therefore be asking too much to expect the federation of nigeria to continue to exist no matter the cost human and otherwise the cultures of nigeria one of the simplest definitions of culture is that culture is ways of doing things culture is classified into material and nonmaterial material culture consists of physical objects the tools weapons accouterments charms fetishes ikons and all physical apparatus of life nonmaterial culture includes the entire system of practices customs or folkways by which the life of a community seems to be organized material culture is embodied in technology and nonmaterial culture embodied in ceremonies both aspects of culture are present in all societies at all times ethnologists have evolved methods of observing how personalities are formed and organized in the context of a culture human attitudes aspirations actions and reactions views on life and the world in general are all conditioned by cultural background political culture pye and verba tell us suggests that the traditions of a society the spirit of its public institutions the passions and the collective reasoning of its citizenry and the style and operating codes of its leaders are not just random products of historical experience but fit together as part of the meaningful whole the former nigerian republic was made up of many ethnic groups arid contained heterogenous cultures the three largest ethnic groups the hausafulani the ibos and the yorubas were located in the northern eastern and western regions of nigeria respectively the ibos and other ethnic groups in the eastern region are all located within the boundaries of the federation the yorubas are divided between nigeria and dahomey while the hausafulanis are divided between nigeria niger and chad republics this makes it possible for the divided tribes to feel at home in these other countries while the tribes of the eastern region have no where else to go we will argue that despite minor local differences the tribes of former eastern region biafra belong to a common cultural pool this pool is not shared by other tribes in nigeria ottenberg writing on the ibo receptivity to change made the following observation the ibo are a sedentary agricultural people dwelling mainly in the tropical forest areas of southeastern nigeria members of this cultural and linguistic grouping consisting of about five million persons live slightly inland from the coast and are separated from it by the efiks ibibio ogoni eastern i jaw and other peoples who share with them many similarities in culture and in contact experience forde and jones also observed major cultural similarities among the ethnic groups in biafra which include elaborate new yam rituals when first fruits are ceremonially presented to sacred images the ivory trumpet kept by the senior linage head to summon the group for defense etc methods of fighting weapons and war drums many births marriage and burial customs folk tales with the tortoise as hero political culture the biafran tribes belong to what experts call stateless or acephalous societies the hausafulani and the yorubas on the other hand belong to state or kingdom societies in the acephalous societies of nigeria oneman rule is totally unknown and people aspire to political office on the basis of their abilities this contrasts with the kingdom societies where oneman rule or a modification of it is the rule rather than the exception and where people aspire to political office by birth this difference accounts for the existence of emirs among the hausafulani and obas among the yorubas attempts to introduce the one man rule in the form of warrant chiefs in former eastern nigeria biafra led to series of riots and disturbances in the area in the late twenties and early thirties although some few powerful chieftains flourished along the coastal areas in the region their existence was more a function of european trade than of indigenous tradition political power among the ibos and allied tribes sklar and whitaker tell us t exemplifys the pattern of dispersed tribal authority as a rule authority extending to matters of land tenure is based on patrilineal kinship groups typically the ibo village chief is the head of a special lineage the chief of a senior village in a group may preside at meetings of the village group in some cases villagegroup heads enjoy great prestige but their authority never reaches beyond the village group indeed there are parts of iboland where chieftancy is virtually unknown and tribal government is thought of as the collective rule of the senior age grades ft this political structure requires the ibos and other tribes in biafra to have a popular participation in the community political decision making these tribes are said to be ultrarepublican or parademocratic the kingdom societies of the yorubas and the hausafulani do not allow for popular decisionmaking in politics and other social matters the yoruba political system has a resemblance to the english constitutional monarch when the lords checked the activities of their sovereign lloyd noted on the yoruba political system there has always been a delicate balance of power between the chiefs who make policy and the oba whose sacred status commands such authority as will ensure obedience if the oba misused his powers he might be deposed by his chiefs who would ask him to die this form of constitutional monarch extended to other areas of midwestern nigeria particularly in benin the hausafulani societies are ruled by the emirs who embody both religious social and political powers the islamic jihad of the early nineteenth century gave rise to the emirate kingdoms of northern nigeria and the political culture of that area is rooted in islamic religion sklar and whitaker observed each of the political systems of the emirates has distinctive features but certain principles of emirate rule are general in their application first emirate rule is theocratic in the sense that an emir is thought to personify the islamic fusion of political and religious authority second it is dynastic emirs are chosen from the membership of royal dynasties by traditional electors subject to the special customary procedures of particular states third emirs govern their domains through ranks of titled officials some traditional offices are restricted to men of royal birth and some men of noble birth others are within the emirs unrestricted power of appointment among those eligible for office competition is keen and its intensity is reinforced by the participation of those who stand to gain by the advancement of a prospectively more powerful patron this implies a fourth important principle of emirate rule namely clientage defined by m g smith as an exclusive relation of mutual benefit which holds between two persons defined as socially and politically unequal which stresses their solidarity the concentration of dejure power and authority in the hands of the emir tended to inhibit any opposition to him even from within the ranks of the ruling stratum from the standpoint of the commoner emirate rule was despotic in form his personal security depended wholly upon the uncertain benevolence of his overlords the fusion of the theocratic or despotic system with the limited monarchical and the parademocratic systems was bound to run into difficulties this we submit was one of the painful ills of nigeria this fusion of stateless and state societies in nigeria made interaction between their members very difficult and led to the existence of continued misunderstanding this interaction difficulty was noted by coleman the ibo as well as the ibibio had strong personal economic reasons for wanting nigeria to be a nation with freedom of movement and enterprise the existence of this sentiment was well demonstrated by a minority report submitted by representatives from eastern region six ibos four ibibios efiks one cameronian and one ijaw as part of the recommendation whereby southerners resident in the north would be rendered ineligible for election to the northern house of assembly it is in our view invidious that a nigerian could under a nigerian constitution be deprived of the right of election to the house of assembly in any region in which he for the time beingor permanently has his abode merely by reason of the accident of birth or ancestry in the last analysis the unity of nigeria is the unity of individual in it the individuals are bound together by political ties of nationality identical nationality of any country must surely carry with it identical political rights it is significant to note that of the twelve eastern signatories to this report only three were supporters of azikiwe indeed the remaining nine opposed azikiwe in varying degrees and some were definitely probritish it is equally important to emphasize that the discriminatory provision opposed by easterners was supported by all representatives from the northern and western regions colemans observations are consistent with our thesis on cultural homogeneity of easterners biafrans and our broad division of nigeria into state and stateless societies religious culture religious differences in nigeria are the best known to people outside nigeria while biafrans have the same religious systemschristianity and animism the yorubas and the hausafulani have a mixture of christianity and islam the hausafulani are predominantly moslems in general the ibos ibibios efiks and ijaws who occupy biafra are secular societies this contrasts with the sacred societies of the yorubas and the hausafulani sacred societies are characterized by emphatic resistance to cultural change and when they do change their changes tend to be imitative secular societies on the other hand are highly receptive to change and their changes tend to be innovative it is interesting to note that among biafrans religious fanaticism is rare and the people tend to exhibit rationality in their religious observance these characteristics contrast with the rather slavish and religious fanaticism that prevails in the northern and western regions yorubas have always had someone who claims to be a christ the difference in religion accounts for the different rates of social change in nigeria where christian churches operate they establish schools of various types and teach not only religion but skills as well the moslem schools teach only the koran and do little or nothing in the area of modem education economic culture many people in the former federation of nigeria live in about villages urban centers are fast growing but still have less than percent of the population agriculture is the mainstay of the countrys economy land therefore is an important factor in the economy and the systems of land tenure indicate the degree of diversity in the economic system in the acephalous societies as in biafra land belongs to the dead the living and the generation yet to be born ownership of land is not a function of price but rather a function of membership in the community there is therefore no landless person or landless people in the state societies of the yorubas land belongs to the kingdom and heads of various families act as custodians among the hausafulani land belongs to the emirs and the use of land is dictated by the various district heads who act as the emirs representative the state societies may have landless people the biafrans have a strong linkage with their land and where ones ancestors are buried is regarded as sacred tribes in this area remind their children of their ownership of land and this makes it easy to trace people back home in biafra among the tribes of the state societies to trace one back home can seldom be done trade systems and market operations differ among various ethnic groups in the stateless societies the intermediary between the producer and the consumer is hardly rigid that is to say mobility is seldom impaired either by regulation or by custom in the state societies markets are administered by various titled officials each in charge of such things as butchery the grain marketing and the cloth marketing market intermediaries tend to be rigid smith made the following remarks on hausa markets since the hausa merchants and officials are the main links between the rural markets in which the peasants trade and the larger city markets which handle the intranigerian and overseas commerce and since neither of these markets is ever static for long the hausa peasants are subject to changing economic pressures mediated by officials and tradersthe friction that arises when traders accustomed to different types of salesmanship interact continued to be one of the major sources of tension among the various tribal groups labor mobility in the geographical sense differed among the ethnic groups traditionally the yorubas of western nigeria have been urban and quasiurban dwellers the hausafulani developed administrative centers that had some urban characteristics the ethnic groups in biafra wereand arestill predominantly rural urban centers in the area grew out of the british colonial experience in there were nine cities in western nigeria yoruba with a population of and over there were two such cities in northern nigeria hausafulani and no city of that size in eastern nigeria biafra by there were such cities in western nigeria seven in northern nigeria and five in eastern nigeria the urban areas both new and old experienced a high degree of ibo ibibio efik biafrans immigrants coleman had remarked yet this rapid and intensive urbanization of the ibo peoples since the british occupation is a phenomenon not only of the eastern region their homeland ibos also constitute more than onethird of the nonindigenous population of the urban centers in the northern and western regions k o dike attributed this mass movement of ibos to landhunger w a lewis blamed the palm produce marketing board price policies for the migration phenomenon in eastern nigeria biafra these two reasons are weak because few migrants became farmers but rather took to petty trading and nonfarm activities the friction of urban socialization and the competition for urban employment are some of the factors which created tribal hatred which was the crucial element in the series of massacres that led to biafran secession conclusion nigerian disintegration is a function of her cultural heterogeneity it is also a function of the high expectation of many people outside nigeria who not only saw the country as a model of democracy for black africa but also got more nigeriaconscious and oriented than nigerians themselves in lord lugard amalgamated the protectorates of northern and southern nigeria and the crown colony of lagos the amalgamation worked only on paper and it was not until that the representatives from these areas met and started interacting and shaping the framework of what is now known as nigeria one might say that there is only a generation of nigerians and that to call someone a nigerian is to call him a british colonial subject the newness of the nigerian political framework coupled with the countrys large ethnic composition led to what professor deutsch called incomplete social mobilization and as deutsch pointed out elsewhere ceteris paribus the stage of rapid social mobilization may be expected therefore to promote the consolidation of states whose peoples already share the same language culture and major social institutions while the same process may tend to strain or destroy the unity of states whose population is already divided into several groups with different languages or cultures or basic ways of life the nigerian experience is a living example of the failure of the westminister model when transferred to other cultures this model evolved from the british experience of class is inappropriate to africa where the key element is community given the diversity of african or nigerian ethnic groups the competition inherent in the westminister model becomes rather divisive and tends to create deep wounds despite its cultural link with england the united states did not import the westminister system lock stock and barrel the united states presidency senate and judiciary are not carbon copies of the british monarchy lords and judiciary the american model was structured to suit the american situation african leaders scholars and statesmen will do africa and africans justice if they realize the diversity of their peoples and advocate and pursue policies that will allow for peaceful evolution of african institutions to cope with africa in transition indiscriminate institutional importation and pseudo international and diplomatic maturity might prove very expensive in human terms as the nigerian disintegration exemplifies so god created man in his own image this is the essential f christian message which gets so mixed up in the minds of jj people god created us in his own image we intend to live e as beings created in the image of god and everything we do c m in the church should be designed to help us live that way something has happened to black people in these united states we are not as we were a few years ago a few months ago a few weeks ago something has happened to us not to america but to us to the way we think the way we fight the way we work together this is the most important thing that has ever happened in americawhat is that something it is that fear is gone just a few weeks ago we were so different down south we were afraid up north we were afraid the fear was a very elementary fear it was not the fear of being brutalized of being humiliated essentially it was the fear of dying when the white man in the south said get off the sidewalk why did we get off because we were afraid of dying we are not afraid any more so the white man has stopped saying it now he is afraid now he must redefine his relationship with us why is fear gone fear is gone essentially because we are in the process of becoming a black nation a nation that is as real as if it had a capital a congress and a president we as a people are now dedicated to one purpose freedom for black people it is this which makes the difference we didnt understand what this was before because each of us functioned as an individual we were afraid to fight because we felt that if we fought we would fight alone and we would die alone it is hard to stand up and be a man when you are all by yourself that is the way we were the difference now is that we are coming together we are no longer just individuals we are becoming a nation you know that the rest of us are going to support you in every way we can if you fight back against oppression we are not going to turn our backs and run away when you know that you feel different no matter how much uncle tom still remains in you now you are part of a nation so fear is gone everything that is going on in america today stems from this basic fact once we were alone now we are together we have changed we are a black nation in a white mans world increasingly the white mans world has become an enemy world recognized as such an enemy world from which we have been systematically excluded and which we now despise and reject they cant exclude us any more because we dont want to be in their world now we are in our own world our own nation so much so that sometimes we feel uncomfortable because we have to go out into their enemy world to work and to shop we wish that we could stay with our own people all the time when you get on the bus and you have an afro or a natural hairdo and the man stares you think to yourself i dont like the way he looks any more than he likes the way i look and the way i look is just as beautiful to me as the way he looks is beautiful to him you cant exclude a man when he doesnt want to come in you cant tell a man that he cant marry your daughter when he doesnt even want to spit in your face it is a strange new world that we have created it keeps the white man confused he doesnt know what to make of it so he tries to concentrate upon the tangible a burnedout building for example he figures that if he can do something about this physical blight other things will go back to normal but there is nothing he can do with bricks and steel and stone that can make us act like he wants us to act because bricks and steel and stone have nothing to do with it it is not something physical we are different unless they deal with us as we are now they can put up all the bricks and steel and stone that they want to and it wont stay too long we have become a black nation you can see it everywhere the white press doesnt know what to make of it white journalists are the most confused people in the world sometimes when you read the things they write you think you are reading a fairy tale hans christian anderson is much closer to reality than they are because they dont have any key to understand whats happening that is because in their minds we are inferior we cant hate like they hate we cant believe like they believe we cant fight like they fight so they have to make up some kind of story to explain why we do the things we do yet the answer is so simple all they have to accept is the simple fact black people are black but in every other way there is no difference if they could just accept this simple fact they would realize why we cannot accept any more than they could the brutalization the degradation the indignities and the criminalities to which we have been subjected but they cant see that and so they cant understand our black revolution so they write fairy tales to amuse themselves when you look at what is happening you see how we have changed the national student association recently held a national convention the same student organization that the cia financed for years some black students went to that convention and said we dont care who is paying your bills if you want us in the student movement you are going to endorse black_power here and now and the national student association voted to endorse black_power then the teachers we have been looking down on black teachers for a long time we have said that all they cared about was their own individual selves their clothes their cars their social life but recently the american federation of teachers had a convention and the black teachers got together and said what amounted to we dont like anything that is going on and if you dont endorse black_power we are walking out you see how a nation comes into being a year ago they wouldnt have even opened their mouths at the convention the white folks would have picked one of them to speak for the negroes and that would have been that but now at every convention black folks put up a sign saying black caucus whitey stay out this is the beginning of a black nation there was a time when we didnt even want to sit together if we came into a room and saw a negro there we would walk over to the other side of the room and sit down we didnt want to segregate ourselves but now the first thing we do is separate ourselves and get together with all the brothers and sisters to find out what it is that we all want to do that has been the pattern at every convention that has been held this summer and the white man doesnt know what to do the left had a convention in chicago new left old left all kinds of lefts black folks went to that convention the white folks had set up a convention just like white people always set up ghetto day buses from detroit newark and cleveland would bring in black folks to put on a show for the white folks but black folks would have nothing to do with the planning nothing to do with the organization of convention procedure nothing to do with the assessment of political realities white folks have been having ghetto days like this for more than years only this time black folks werent interested in any ghetto day so they got together and they drew up a beautiful statement even when the newspapers got through with the statement they drew up it was still a beautiful thing listen to the preamble we as black people believe that a united states system that is committed to the practice of genocide social degradation the denial of political and cultural selfdetermination of black people cannot reform itself there must be revolutionary change then they made specific black_power demands and there wasnt anything that those white leftists could do but accept those demands because without black people there isnt any revolutionary movement in america there are some white people who are poor who are exploited but they are white there are some white people who are liberal but they are white there are some white people who are radical but they are white and in the final analysis all these white people stand together we know this to be true so we black people are now demanding the things that we want for ourselves no white man whatever he represents himself to be is going to tell us what to do this is the message of the conventions of all the rebellions it is the message from coast to coast of the burnedout buildings black people are going to be free and we are going to do it ourselves what is fear when i was going to school i remember studying the psychology of fear and the debate over whether the emotional reaction preceded or followed the visceral reaction even then i knew it to be nonsense what does it mean when we say fear is gone it doesnt mean that when you get into a situation you dont have an emotional or a visceral reaction but that is not fear the emotion the adrenalin m that is pumped into your body can lead you to either fight or ight the body is ready for either one fear is determined by what you do with that energy dont be ashamed if you react if your pressure goes up if your heart starts pumping just be sure you do the right thing at work when they begin to talk about niggers and you are supposed to be invisible dont worry if your heart begins to pump what matters is do you speak up do you just sit there and pretend not to hear we had a peoples tribunal to try the officers charged with the massacre of three black youths in the algiers motel during the july rebellion right here beneath the beautiful black madonna witnesses testified everything possible had been done by the police to intimidate these black people and yet they testified and told the truth does that mean that as they sat here their hearts were not pounding of course not they knew that the man was going to brutalize them at the first opportunity but that wasnt fear because they did what had to be done a whole lot of you have guiity feelings about being afraid you neednt have it is not fear as long as you do what has to be done america is set on a disaster course of conflict and violence the black man cannot accept america as it is the white man refuses to make the changes necessary for the black man to live in america with dignity and justice these are two facts we will not accept conditions as they are and the white man will not accept the changes which we demand there is no solution except open conflict and violence you dont have to feel guilty about that either it is his fault not ours we say that we are created in the image of god he refuses to accept that it is his fault not ours when there is justice there can be love peace and brotherhood only the oppressor can afford to talk about the preservation of law and order without justice for the oppressed that is for us for all black people to talk about law and order peace and brotherhood is either insanity or it is craven cowardice we have no choice to make we cant be concerned with law and order peace and brotherhood until we first get justice securing justice is our basic concern there are black people who dont understand that we dont have justice but they are becoming fewer and fewer everything about the elections in mississippi was crooked there wasnt any law and order there because there was injustice they were determined that black people would not be elected in american cities during the recent rebellion every constitutional right guaranteed citizens was denied to black people the courts became kangaroo courts the judges functioned as though they were part of the police department the news papers were part of the police department all the white community came together to protect order that is to protect white supremacy to protect and to preserve injustice even as they talked about law and order they were the perpetrators of injustice and the destroyers of law and order the police talked about looters in the street and they themselves were doing more looting every day than the looters in the street but injustice had to be preserved white supremacy had to be maintained the white man was willing to sacrifice the constitution the courts and the law to preserve what he held sacred the status quo to preserve his injustice he was willing to go to any lengths and he did some of you were arrested you know what they did in the jails the prisons and the concentration camps you remember the wanton brutality against men women and children and all the time they were talking about law and order america is headed for increased racial conflict and violence there is no escape because the white man is determined to preserve injustice and we are determined that justice is ours by right and that we shall have it we have decided that we are willing to die rather than continue to suffer the injustice that we have suffered for years we have the strength necessary for this kind of struggle because we have come together and we are a black nation but it is going to take every bit of our united strength to withstand the kind of persecution that is being prepared for us i dont care how nice you feel inside how much you would like to go along how much you wish you could live out your lifetime without so much conflict and violence i am sorry you were just born at the wrong time there is no way that that kind of injustice can be preserved even when you long for the good old days when you could be a comfortable uncle tom you realize that the good old days are gone forever we are living in the midst of a revolution and in a time of revolution the old values are no long valid when they draft you into the army they take you to camp and teach you how to kill that is against the values of society but the society has declared that in this emergency it is necessary that you forget what you have been taught so you learn how to kill and how to kill well the old values are no longer valid we have got to understand this we have got to understand that in a time of revolution the old values must also be rescinded when america revolted against england they looted a ship in boston harbor they took the cargo of tea and threw it overboard they burned everything that they needed to burn because they said we are engaged in a revolution and in revolution the old values must be cast aside they knew it then because they were engaged in a revolution they were fighting against injustice and oppression now we know it an old lady called me up the other day she said that she lived on west warren avenue and she talked about the way those people were acting during the rebellion how they ran up and down the streets with the things they had taken and told her to get off her front porch or they would burn down her house they probably saw her writing down license numbers to give the police she said that everything we black people do is wrong and that i should stop fussing with white people and start fussing with black people to get them to do right she said that she had tried so hard to keep her little house neat and clean to plant a little grass to organize a block club but the black people in her block wouldnt cooperate they said this aint our community the man owns it and she was hurt because she had wanted to make her block a little grosse pointe she was so happy because a white lady she worked for called her up during the rebellion and asked her how she was doing and sent her some canned food i tried to explain to her that in a time of revolution the old values are no longer valid the old virtues she had cherished so long of saving up to buy a little house and putting a fence around it wont work it is time for all of us to build a community together and if you are still thinking of protecting your little thing trying to make your fence high enough to keep us out you are wrong you ought to love the looters because they are part of the black nation if you were too old to participate then the least you could do was not talk about those who did it is one struggle and we are in it together we have got to love one another we have got to remember that even if at the end of the struggle down the road a piece we end up in concentration camps together we are still brothers and sisters and we must love one another white people in america dont understand this a white daily had an editorial the other day the us dailies are undoubtedly among the most biased newspapers in the world but this was a new low even for an establishment newspaper the editorial said that h rap brown and the ku kluxers who voted times in mississippi are equally wrong and if it is accepted that brown is privileged to foment violence then the kkk is also so privileged this is the hitler technique tell a big lie and tell it over and over until the whole world believes it to be true the press knows that there is a basic difference between h rap brown and the kkk brown says one simple thing that black people must fight for justice by all means necessary while the kkk says that white people have got to preserve injustice by all means necessary do you see the difference it doesnt become the same thing because the white mans press pretends to believe that it is the same we have got to fight injustice by all means necessary if that is sedition then we are all guilty white people in organizations all over the country are joining together in support of one basic philosophic position we have got to use all means necessary to preserve injustice against black people that is why conflict and violence are inevitable the white man could change his position but he is not changing it the sale of guns to white people has increased by leaps and bounds even as they write long articles in newspapers and magazines against black violence in the streets they have special flights bringing in guns every day to white people in detroit they are dedicated to the preservation of injustice without injustice they wouldnt need guns we dont even want to live in their communities or go to their schools all we want is control over our own communities they would have nothing to fear except for the simple fact that they are unwilling to give up their control over our community they want to live in dearborn and grosse pointe and still control our schools and teach our children and they are not going to do it that is why they are buying guns because we are demanding a change that is why there is going to be conflict and violence conflict is inevitable unless the white man agrees to transfer power we say that to him and he looks the other way he sets up a new detroit committee to rebuild detroit he gives it all kinds of money but the committee refuses to realize that its one function is to preside at the transference of power it could say black people wont accept injustice any longer lets make some changes but it wont do that instead it reassembles the same old hackneyed negro leadership gives it a new name and tries to deal with it as though it speaks for the black community in order to preserve the same old injustice but it wont work conflict is inevitable because the white man wont face reality oppression does not destroy a people it is the acceptance of oppression that destroys that is why we were sick until we started fighting just trying to hold in our indignation made us sick messed up our minds that is why a girl who gets a natural feels like a whole new world has opened up to her we have begun to throw off oppression we dont know whether we are going to win or lose all black people in america could be killed within the next five years but we would be better off dead than accepting oppression fear is gone the white man has got to understand that in this period of becoming a nation the black church conscious of its african roots becomes increasingly significant many black people have given up the church but the church can become the basis for a new unity in the black community we ask people to join the church so that they will know that they are brothers and sisters that they belong to a black nation this church is dedicated to a black messiah this church believes that the purpose of christianity is to free black people to rid black people of injustice this is what we believe this is why we are so important to the black revolution this is why we need more churches like ours from coast to coast the church must free our minds strengthen our bodies and unite our people this is the task of the church because god created us in his own image and as a child of god we must walk with pride and dignity we are going to be free by any means necessary brothers and sisters remember that we have agents every sunday if someone comes up to you talking about firebombs and guerilla warfare dont let him make a fool out of you one group of private investigators is in the city trying to earn a purse of by proving a conspiracy there was no conspiracy except the conspiracy to maintain injustice perpetrated by the white man for the past years let them expose that conspiracy heavenly father we thank thee for the opportunity of worshipping in this house we thank thee that we have this house to come together in be with us and help us to do those things that must be done let your spirit be in our midst and lead our brothers and sisters to feel the call to join together with us in this task of uniting our people this we ask in the name of the black messiah jesus christ amen image is a term which we are using more and more in the black community because we are discovering that the image we have of ourselves controls what we are capable of doing image in this sense has the meaning of selfconcept we are giving cause and effect the same name but the word image is properly speaking a concrete term meaning the projection or representation of an object the image is the mirror of some aspect of reality at this point we should draw a distinction between real and created images both are projections of reality but the created image is projected by the imagination of man and by the recall and associative power of his five senses for instance i can hold out a rose before you the image of that rose is mirrored in your eye it is a real image or i can describe a rose to you and my words will create an image which you can visualize mentally perhaps you will even imagine the smell and the feel the words i choose and the way i build them into the image will determine this usually a whole complex of associations builds up around an image secondary images are evoked until welldefined patterns of associations based upon sensory perceptions pervade in a very vague way the whole area of a mans experience why is image so central to a mans selfdefinition because all images and especially created images represent a certain way of focusing on the world outside and therefore they represent a certain point of view now if we hold a certain point of view we have automatically emphasized some aspects of reality blocked out others and glossed over the rest and the image which we project or which we perceive is not objective reality but our ownor someone elsesreshaping of reality if it is someone elses reshaping of reality which we perceive then we are within that other persons sphere of influence and can be led to believe whatever he wishes us to believe that a rosebush is pleasant because it has a fragrant smell or that it is unpleasant because it has thorns if these two images of the rosebush are combined into a metaphor we have created images which lead us to make an association between the reality of the rosebush and another level of reality and we can be influenced for instance on a moral level pleasantsmelling roses have unpleasant thorns therefore beware the sweet fragrance of pleasure for underneath it lie hidden the thorns of destruction in this way the association made in the mind of the hearer or reader is controlled by guiding by controlling our associations the imagemaker can and usually does shape our view of reality because the images the words conjure up when they are put together artistically provoke an immediate emotional response in us and dim out of our consciousness all the untold other points of view at our disposal imagemaking is part of all human experience however we are speaking here of the image created by the magic of words we are considering image not so much as life but as literary art art reshapes the raw materials of nature and of human interaction and in so doing interprets reality in a nonanalytical nonintellectual way art thus makes a direct appeal to the senses and calls forth a spontaneous emotional identification with other men and with the universe therefore the effects of the literary image are most often intuitive deep beyond the threshold of reason and common sense when we spoke of the sweet fragrance of pleasure and the thorns of destruction we made an appeal not to reason but to the emotional attractiveness of the images in this way we develop quite aside from our rational perception an intuitive view of nature and of the cosmos and our own relation to it the rose is an old familiar example of how our attitude toward the surrounding environment takes form and grows the body of imagery surrounding the rose is rooted historically deep in western cultural patterns of looking at the world the rose symbolize beauty on the physical level and purity and freshness on the moral level because this imagery is traditional the associations are unquestioned and because they are unquestioned they take on the quality of myth in the case of the rose the imagery may seem harmless but we will see in a moment how such mythbuilding images can be the very death of selfconcept notice too in the case of the rose that man has projected himself into his imagery the purity beauty and freshness of the rose are usually compared to an idealized womankind this is because the natural impetus of man is to impart to the whole cosmos the qualities which he possesses mans imagery is thus anthropomorphic he sees himself or his behavior in every projection he makes thus a flower dances in the breeze the thunder rushes angrily through the skies the sun smiles down on the sleepy noontime village mother earth provides for us it follows that mans selfconcept must inevitably be tied to his view of the universe since he sees his own reflec tion in it at every moment and a reflection of ourselves cannot be neutral it cannot be objective it is either positive or negative how we regard the phenomena of nature is an indication of what we think of ourselves the howling wind for example is not the same image as the whining wind if our literary tradition stresses the howling wind then we feel emotively that a mysterious prowling creature stalks through our universe if the whining wind is stressed we feel the presence of a weak but persistent creature following us constantly around weve said that man projects his image upon the universe but man does not exist in isolation it is far more accurate to say that man projects his cultural and racial images upon the universe and he derives a sense of personal worth from the reflection he sees gazing back at him for he defines himself and the world in terms of others like him he discovers his identity within a group and now we come to the heart of the matter for we cannot judge ourselves unless we see a continuity of ourselves in other people and in things and concepts we question our very right to exist without other existences like our own this is why image is so important to african americans we are black people living in a white world when we consider that the black man sees white cultural and racial images projected upon the whole extent of his universe we cannot help but realize that a very great deal of the time the black man sees a zero image of himself the black child growing into adulthood through a series of weekend movies seeing white protagonists constantly before him projecting the whole gamut of human experience is in extreme cases persuaded that he too must be white or what is more likely he experiences manhood by proxy and in someone elses image he sees in other words a zero image of himself if there are black people on the screen they are subservient to uncomfortably different from or busy emulating the larger allinclusive white culture in that case our young person sees a negative image of himself nor are the images which control personal worth always so direct or obvious the very same imagemyth process which we discovered through the example of the rose is present in the extensive body of color imagery in western culture those associations with black and white have conditioned us to accept white as the symbol of goodness and purity black as the symbol of evil and impurity this did not just happen it is the result of white racial projection of its own best image upon the universe concomitant with that projection for several hundred yearsever since the black man has come within the sphere of influence of the whitethe moral and esthetic associations of black and white have been mixed up with race thus the negative reflection of ourselves is in the white mans system the reverse side of his positive projection of himself the white man has developed a myth of superiority based on images which compare him symbolically with the black man the very fact of this interconnection is at once a holdover from previous bondage and the most effective means of perpetuating that bondage we realize now that we are involved in a blackwhite war over the control of image for to manipulate an image is to control a peoplehood zero image has for a long time meant the repression of our peoplehood of course the black american has not relied totally on the image projected by white culture he has developed a literature and that literature gives him a certain sense of self we have however in spite of ourselves not been successful in destroying zero image for we have not been able to convince ourselves that our image is projected on any but a small and segregated strip of the universe when a selfdefinition has proceeded spontaneously the literature will reflect not only a group consciousness shared points of view common ancestry common destiny and aspirations but it reflects these in spiritual oneness with whatever natural andor supernatural powers preside over and guide that destiny for the black writer the only possibility for spiritual oneness has been nonrace or religious literature but nonrace or religious literature takes on insidiously the image projected by what is called the larger culture and so takes on a white image black writers have also attempted to reflect spiritual oneness by writing within a totally black framework but white images are implanted at the core of black life the most obvious example being that of the church where god is white moreover the black community is not selfsustaining and a literature which would circumvent this essential feature of peoplehood cannot cope with the forces that shape us for the most part though black writers have avoided these two pitfalls and our literature has been as we have slowly painfully coming out of bondage and has been contributing to our growing sense of peoplehood if black writers have historically concentrated on whiteblack animosity it is because that animosity is an everyday fact of life and functional part of our universe the artist then is the guardian of image the writer is the mythmaker of his people we still at times are not sure as to how much of our image is us to what extent we are the sole authors of our myth our peoplehood there are those white people who would nullify any argument we advance on the basis that it is advanced in a white language and it is true that languages project a specific cultural image but i believe that we have arrived at a stage of selfawareness in our writing which sees this type of argument as irrelevant our very plain answer to this sophisticated argument is simply that we will not let white men define our peoplehood by telling us were still using white tools to create it similarly we must reject white attempts at portraying black reality they are valid only in terms of the white mans projection of himself they have no place in the definition of blackness for they reveal the white writers attempt to work through his own cultural guilt fascination with blackness or sense of spiritual emptiness this includes all latterday harriet beecher stowes no one can hand us a peoplehood complete with prefabricated images even the word black is a translation from the portuguese slave term negro gone into the english language as negro but black is also the generalized term which we use to symbolize unity of origin whether we are called anglophone francophone coloured mulatto west indian or american negro by the white imagemakers black is the highly imagistic term we use to do away with all such division ary euphemisms it is the term we use to destroy the myth based on the complex of images which polarize black and white these images must be mythically torn down ritually destroyed we cannot bury our heads before the existing body of myth nor before our own europeanization therefore we cannot return nostalgically to a past heritage and pretend that historical continuity exists in anything but fragmentary form we cannot block out the blackwhite struggle for control of image and create a utopianized world of allblack reflections our work at this stage is clearly to destroy the zero and the negative imagemyths of ourselves by turning them inside out to do this we reverse the symbolism and we use that reverse symbolism as the tool for projecting our own image upon the universe zero image and the need to work through it is not a new concept many black writers have understood the importance of image and ralph ellison in the early fifties stated the same intent metaphorically in the title and outer structure of his novel invisible man what is new i believe is the deliberate desecration and smashing of idols the turning insideout of symbols to which black writers are now proceeding with a vengeance bitterness which runs through the whole of black literature is being replaced by wrath a sense of frustration is giving way before a sense of power it is the sense of power which proceeds from a mythic consciousness based on a peoples positive view of themselves and their destiny perhaps we can best conclude with an illustration of the processes weve been discussing the following poem attempts to desecrate the mythical and beautiful figure of the muse entrenched in white culture since the time of its earliest flowering grecoroman antiquity dorothy sterling the author of the captain of the planter has penned another delightful book for our childrentear down these walls doubleday whether that is a plea or a command her treatment of the civil_rights movement is one of the more understanding ones for youngsters miss sterling opens with the tired feet theory of rosa parks which we suspect is being a bit overplayed we hope some promising young novelist visits mrs parks before she fades from us and some honkie does his confessions that is not however the tone of the book from montgomery we move to africa from which we were forcibly abducted miss sterling quite correctly points out that millions were murdered so that thousands could be brought to these shores as slaves included in the book is a diagram of a slave ship the most efficient slave ship in fact which is itself worth the price of the book she doesnt bother our children with any unproven tales of africans selling each other for a few white women who were never worth a good black man or a couple bottles of coke nor does she fill that section with such horrors that our children would be loathe to continue reading though she speaks of the forced marches to the coast of up to miles in some cases and of the greed of the western nations that often caused them to attempt to leave a pregnant woman about to deliver on the road alone and then to kill her husband when he asks to be left with her she does a commendable job of describing the horrors the africans must surely have felt without instilling fear into the reader she doesnt go beyond her subject or the possible knowledge of her young readers with tales of the hebrew nation suffering almost as much as we but she tells our story with such compassion and understanding that it is difficult to believe she is nonblack if suffering is indeed a virtue then we are perhaps the most virtuous people of all we leave the slave ships and return to montgomery where dr martin_luther_kings home is bombed he counsels love for our enemy nonviolence turn the other cheek many of us regret that dr_king was not able to turn his other cheek in memphis we move from montgomery to greensboro and the start of the largest mass movement since garveythe in movement sit stand walk wade pray die in the united states as she describes the busburning in anniston which moved the john f kennedy administration to consider the freedom rides a moral issue her concise analytical mind helps prevent her from maligning the late president his late brother and from negating some very brave acts by our people though miss sterling is too shy to say it only a fool or a god would walk into a jungle with only his love to keep him the outstanding chapters deal with immigrants as has been pointed out many times before the white people and italians came to america for freedomwe came to be enslaved they came to own propertywe came to be property they came to claim their manhood we came to lose ours they came for religious freedomwe came to lose our gods some came running as james jones once said to love and be lovedwe came fighting back to hate and be hated she doesnt try to clean up slavery with the theyareheathens wearechristians nonsense she fairly presents our side of the question that as was pointed out in ten black writers respond to the south couldnt afford fire insurance because the slaves were burning them out that armed organized resistance was great and the fear of it greater that we never accepted an attitude of slavery in this context watts is fully in line with black history detroit is comparable to charleston newark but a reiteration of southampton we would like to have seen some holes punched into the theory that old tom gave vesey away if denmark vesey could organize men into an army while under the closest scrutiny any men have been under then no single one of them could upset the plans or as big mabel used to sing so sweetly one monkey doesnt stop the show and im here to tell him so just as the british captured jomo kenyatta the french murdered frantz fanon the cia poisoned richard wright the honkie period has murdered and imprisoned every freedom fighter they could the fight goes on just as malcolm was murdered rap and stokely sprang up and as they were being silenced somebody the honkie hadnt even heard of started killing policemen in cleveland the fight goes on that old theory that a tom broke up our biggest army just does not hold water because any man or group of men who could organize that well would have had the sense to organize around any possible slipups of that nature but white people want us to think we are our worst enemies that the only reason we havent wiped them out is that we dont trust each other maybe we dont but we havent been telling him either if the slaves were so loquacious how was it that harriet tubman was able to return again and again for the underground railroad even those afraid to make the break were not going to tell on those who were ready to go even the term we have for traitor uncle tom is not an adequate description for our reaction to it uncle tom died rather than tell we ought to keep these things in mind just because he wasnt able he didnt turn his people in you have to go to gunga din as john killens points out before you find a traitor and hes truly a white mans fantasy tear down these walls is a good concise history the logical progression of truths and the welcomed absence of confusing words makes it a valuable addition to any youngsters library so often in histories especially about black people those writing history or what pretends to be history are just not logical we can well imagine the day when someone will write of this period the murderous sixties as a time when black people rebelled and were killed at the approximate rate of to which will be as illogical as some of the writings weve endured on the previously preconstructed centuries how could it be my grandchild the next group of poems beginning with negritude and ending with a view from the white helmet reveal the perceptions and sensibilities of a poet who conducts his thought and expression very much in the manner of an apparently unassuming gadflywhich is to say that in emanuel we are to encounter yet another kind of ellison whose individuality of viewpoint and smoothness of expression is bound to offend the more tribalminded among the black conscious indeed a poet is revealed whose singular toughness and keenness of mind and fancy is almost hidden by an apparent absence of any interest in the current fondness for and preoccupation with stunning spatial innovations that stress uniqueness in form and word arrangement indeed in emanuel we encounter a poet who leans in the very unfashionable direction of not so verylongago traditional devices such as rhymed quatrains and regularity of line and stanza length yet for all of this we are faced with a formidable deadly serious and technically assured and even mischievous talent there is here a verbal dexterity and tightness not unworthy of a brooks and an emotional steadiness and resiliency underneath the light humorous gentle unassuming surface that will grip your fondest notions and make them scream out as they are carried unceremoniously under tq repeat the ideas the subjects dealt with and the very strikingly bold and personal handling they all receive will hardly make this poet popular with those super blacks and super biggers whose common notion of revolutionary relevance and sense of urgency lead them to view with simple hostility any writing by any black man that is good by virtue of precision and subtlety of phrase rather than simpleness and consciously unantiliterary directness there is to be no stretching out with words that makes the least uncommon demand on the peoples imagination allah forbid thus jones first two volumes of poetry preface and the dead lecturer are largely viewed as dangerously preblack to pursue these brothers and sisters further these are the people who find no difficulty in neatly distinguishing blacks from negroes universalists from nittygritty soul experts the lost wouldsowantto be whites from properly dedicated and pure liberated militants and afros ask them what is blackness and you would never get the mercifully optional though very elaborate and lengthy list that brother poet emanuel offers in the first piece of this group nor would many of the individual things itemized escape the blackstarched indignation of the secure and very black whether statements contained in the following rearranged series of couplets might or might not stand a brothers chance of passing depends on the degree of presumption and blackerthan thouness one is willing to exercise there we have it a list as thoroughgoing as it is incomplete but then is not the elaborate catalogue structure of the poem a sufficient commentary in itself on the inadequacy of all definitions especially those that must depend on enumerating individual items such as those found here even the element of surprise which challenges the readers personal notion of what is true of blackness is used by brother emanuel and very effectively to reenforce just that very point all definitions are inadequate and especially those that rely on enumeration general head countingthat is taking general survey or pollis a process of enumerating another bristling example from this same group of poems the negro takes us by a more direct route deeper into the question of defining blackness deeper into the thicket where blackmaneating fleshstripping bloodgulping uniquefeatureliquidating creatures roamcreatures hitherto the exclusive pets of white criticreviewers called universals the poem leads us deeper into an awareness of the pitfalls of definition by leaving us with the weird impression that some black writers are as white as their critics meaning that they use the white critics trick of denying a human shape to black experience by setting a hostile pack of preconceived notions upon it or viewed another way black experience is forced before a mirror that reflects nothing actual or concrete about what is placed before it the least tendency to depart from the blankness of such a mirror of such an arbitrary and preconceived standard is labeled insignificant if not altogether nonexistent the blankness itself is labeled universal man or just man in the abstract it once appeared that black minds were calling the white minds bluff when they would say universal man is just an abstraction sweetheart now it would seem that instead of calling the white critics bluff these words were simply intended to swipe his thunder for abstractions in a black mouth are just as sweet to some is not every black mans black man an abstraction too emanuel seems to be clearly suggesting as much in his poem the negro so formal definition itself it would seemat least the scientific dictionary way of arriving at and conveying meaningis a process of excluding the fullblooded uniqueness and significance of people and things definitions are a very strict rigid spiritkilling fleshdismissing way of regarding life the fate of being defined by them is much like the fate of a living language in the grip of a school grammar the threat of being defined justifies all of the apprehensive restlessness that these lines from gwendolyn brooks a lovely love leaves vibrating in the ear do i see any hands questions comments wolf tickets a very good question indeed sister even an improvement on the brothers silence over there this poem is indeed a very sound place for getting down with it to the matter of a black aesthetic we need only reflect on leaves of a color hard to name and we have begun in earnest to be deeply black deeply involved in the mystery of memories and time and placea place such as the title poem invites us to to every man his treehouse what has this poets fondness of things vital and green and alive turning and changing in peril and pregnancywhat has all this to do with fondling a black aesthetic why have we been backed into this irritationarea of trees part of the not so simple answer is given in emanuels more vernacular get up blues just promised someone not to go on telling more and moreespecially about fishermen or even try conveying the delightful humor of pieces like the voyage of jimmy poo the darker more matteroffact teasing to which brother emanuel subjects the colonialist oppressors in a view from the white helmet nor the strong fun and substance of freedom rider washout i will admit though and by way of conclusion that this would have been a mercifully shorter pieceand a far more incisive one toohad i simply enlisted brother lerois swift twilight touch to pay even passing tribute to what brother emanuel has achieved and said so well and masterfully here in the treehouse and other poems for instance jones style would have conveyed swiftly and simply both emanuels own style and content what is arbitrarily labelled black revolutionary theatre in the summer issue of the drama review is actually a catchall phrase to describe the political philosophy and aesthetic attitude of many young black rebellious playwrights the editors of tdr were largely influenced by the above factor in their decision to give ed bullins resident playwright at the new lafayette theatre unprecedented freedom to edit this issue at his discretion for it is a reasonable assumption that only a negro writer can express the thoughts and feelings of other negroes in a nation that often ignores the black presence in the midst of american culture an important and unique aspect of black awareness is present in this collection of essays and oneact plays leroi jones is undoubtedly the prophet behind this black arts movement whose converts believe that the contradictions between ethics and aesthetics in western society are symptomatic of a dying society these ideas expressed by the poetessayist larry neal are greatly expanded in the opening article of this issue black writers represented here have attempted collectively to expose and destroy the repressive degrading drama of white america through an ethical political and cultural revolution no more will they engage in the falsification of actuality as advocated by the ideas and actions of whites especially as they relate to the black man and his cultural heritage a manifesto for a black aesthetic is echoed throughout this issue questions are raised concerning ultimates such as truth ethics and morals the ideology behind the movement is clearer however than the artistic form used to express it an attempt to convey the content of black experience prior to the creation of a unique theatrical form has resulted in the recreation of naturalism perhaps this traditional form is most suitable to the sociopolitical context of black revolutionary drama bullins has collected a group of new plays to express black consciousness rather than essays and articles because drama has the potential to evoke immediate action most of the oneacters represented here are unable structurally to support the weight of characters and ideas too often the playwright is bellowing at the white beast who denies his voice papas daughter by dorothy ahmad take care of business by marvin x and claras ole man by ed bullins are the few plays that speak directly to black america a particular kind of human experience is spoken of through these plays in a few cases the authors have found a suitable dramatic form through which to explore elements of black expression what is important is whether the theatrical experience images the truth of human action and the beauty of the human spirit and absence of dramatic form in most of these plays is replaced by content that speaks to all mankind either directly or indirectlyfloyd gaffney i would like to take some issue with your editorial on chauncey warrington hildreth iii esq which appeared in the november edition first it is quite childish and shallow at a time when we truly need depth and perception second it speaks in broad generalities and stereotypes much like those of the segregationist reactionary press which portray all negroes in an all too familiar insulting vein third it is silly and offers nothing positive or constructive it is criticism of the immature type and i think we have enough shallow thinking and behavior from those who oppose racial progress and as a group striving for improvement we cannot indulge in that luxury but apart from those rather general criticisms let us try to analyze the picture portrayed so critically with innuendo and invective let us try to add a bit of intelligence to a very trite and contrived portrayal cwh iii is supposed to have a good job the only of his group with some ficticious firm this must mean that he is in the salary bracket which in most cases is a junior executive of between and years of age cwh iii was born between and if as is indicated he went through schools that were integrated in the s and s he was indeed quite rare also in the s and s the days of depression of amos and andy stepin fetchit etc if he went to integrated schools he certainly took much abuse was poked fun at ignored and discouraged by his teachers denied all participation in the ordinary social activities of his school probably given grades lower than he deserved may have been barred from participation in athletics and was certainly barred from such things as restaurants plays and other forms of public convenience if as the article indicates he got through this difficult period and still had what it takes to go on to college he was probably quite a guy being in the age group it is likely he served in segregated armed forcesquartermasters in the army cook in the navyduring world war ii he had none of the advantages of the training and opportunity for advancement now found in the services if he went to an integrated college then he had to compete on better than equal terms with his white counterparts he probably worked at odd jobs to help pay his way through school even if his parents were professionals few made very much during the depression years and not until some time after the war was there real prosperity among negro professionals but the point here is that cwh iii had to compete with the cards stacked against him on the basis of his individual abilitieswith little or no help from faculty or teachers if he went to an integrated schooland probably a great deal of downright hostility and discouragement again he would have been effectively barredif as you indicate he attended an integrated university from all the normal activities of university life you state his parents were professional people do you have any conception of what it meant to obtain professional status in the s if cwh iii is in his s his parents must be in their s that means they were in college in the s to get a professionalor any other degree in the s was rare and required the utmost perseverance fortitude and luck cwh ills father certainly must have worked as a waiter or probably ran the road as a pullman porter he must have worked extremely hard to attain professional statuspass licensing exams that were rigged to prevent negroes from entering professionsif a physician all medical schools were closed except howard or meharry the article completely ignores the atmosphere of the s and s when the klan was a respectable organization lynchings were common and all doors were closed to negroes of ability further if his parents had the courage to live in an integrated neighborhood then they are to be admired in fact it is likely that one or both died prematurely as the strain imposed on the negro with ability and ambition in the s and s generally took its toll in a reduced life span now we have chauncey iii in a good job what does this mean is all now peaches and cream the article would so imply nothing further is needed simply collect the fat pay check and be arrogant well if cwh iii is in fact the only negro in a white firm he has a hard hard way to go the brief case in the picture had better be filled with plenty of work to do at home and on weekends for if he does not produce and produce better than his white counterparts he is out there is likely some bright young caucasian fresh out of harvard or yale dating the vice presidents daughter breathing down his neck and envying his job cwh iii is still barred from the places that really count in the power structurethat is the private clubs golf courses etc where real decisions are made he had better work hard and produce on ability or he will go to work one day and find someone else at his desk in other words cwh iii is in the real world now with its infighting and struggles for power which the average negro especially it seems negro digest has absolutely no comprehension he must fight every day and must fight with one arm tied behind his back and one eye closed as he can never be where the real decisions are made or be on the social terms which in todays world insure success and mobility thus in a time when the group is desperately striving to raise itself the virtues of chauncey iiidiscipline ability fortitude neatness and the courage to face the majority group alone on its own termsshould be virtues for admiration no other minority group decries its own who have succeeded or demands a rigid standard of conformity to patterns which debase achievement and equate success with rejection no program for involvement of the socalled black middle class is advocated in the article what precisely is it negro digest wants what program is laid out what goals what objectiveswhere is there anything but the most trite of commonplace generalities when cwh iii comes home after a hour day worried about the bright young fellow after his job and out of the inner circle at the office what is he supposed to do the things required of cwh iii on a daytoday basis are the things that must be achieved by black people as a whole if they are to progress these are not western virtues or the socalled alien culture of the majority group but the disciplines that are required in every modern society whether it be in the us europe asia or elsewhere and without regard to racein other words the disciplines of the modern world without these effort is a waste of time which i suspect chauncey iii must feel about some of the childish unrealistic ravings of socalled negro leaders what the modern world requires is discipline organization ability which is not instant but takes a long long time self criticism personal neatness and good personal conduct especially the ability to be quiet and in the modern technological world these can only be obtained by facing the power structure on its own terms in other words the skills and insights chauncey is obtaining must be obtained by the group as a whole if we are to succeed not because they are the mores of an alien culture forced upon unwilling black people but because this is the way the world operates and its either get in or stay out that we have no concept of this is evident from the printing of the chauncey iii article whether we like it or not the world of chauncey iii is the world and we had better develop a cadre of people who have been exposed to it and its pressures you certainly do not gain this type of experience by pretending you dont need it for your magazine to decry in a childish superficial way these necessities is simply evidence of what a long long way we have to go and how pathetic are some of thoseie negro digestwho seek to show the way does the negro digest advocate that cwh iii quit his job and go to work in the ghetto would this really help all trained negroes cant give up their professions to work in the ghetto this is pure folly it would be counter productive and severely limit the types of training contacts and insights that must be acquired if we are to move forward despite his appearance of luxury if cwh iii is a junior executive his salary is not large enough to permit much financial help if he is to keep up appearances that are as much required by his job as is coming to work on time perhaps he could do moreand probably would if properly approachedbut he is a long way from the affluence that permits large donations to causesregardless of their merit and if he is perceptive he is not going to give to groups that show a lack of responsibility discipline and objective programs if he is sophisticated enough to have come through the trials and tribulations of your indicated integrated background then he can surely see through those leaders who approach every problem with an open mouth and whose real motivation is ego in any case to limit and find worth in any one sphere of activity is counterproductive negroes must advance on all fronts acquire as many skills as possible or otherwise you have a self imposed prison that is easily surrounded handledand since the leadership is inbred and unsophisticatedeasily dismissed riots or not riots the black mans place in this society is at the bottom and he is controllable his thrashing about apart from being a good way for tv news media to increase its ratings are really little more than pinpricks in the power structure the worst possible thing is to overestimate your power and importance now back to chauncey iii what can he do in his job first negroes generally being unsophisticated as is so evident from reading negro di gest have no conception of how things are really done chauncey iii is in the scheme in which he operates at a very low level he cannot waive a wand and bring in more negroes at the earliest with all the obstacles he faces in years he might be at high enough position to make some impact the socalled big jobs that the johnson pubications harp about are really quite little and insignificant in the real scheme of things and even when a negro obtains a really powerful jobie a cabinet memberhe still must play according to the rules or he will not have his job long in other words he must play exactly the same game that every one else in the power structure operates underthat is discipline planning and above all no rash or emotional acts therefore there is only a limited number of things he can do that will show immediate assistance to the negro masses but this is the way things are played have been played and will be played in this country and in all other countries in the modern world for you cannot run away and find any road to instant success and there is nothing anyone least of all the socalled negro leaders can do about itviolently or otherwise up is a long term hard job and we had better prepare our youth for discipline training selfsacrifice and good conduct if they are to make it now supposing other minorities say the jewish grouphad imposed the silly selfdefeating rule that every one had to subvert his own personal progress for group service without any real monetary reward jews would still be running little corner stores and helping each other to speak english instead they made individual achievement the hallmark and excellence and personal selfsacrifice to attain personal achievement as the method of progress their group responsibilities were great and demanding but they were done quietly there were no open mouth jewish leadersand with good organization their most competent sophisticated provide the leadership and the contacts to move the group as a whole there was no either or approach does negro digest think for one moment that jews would decry one of their group who attained financial success and all its attributes rather he would be the hero and the model for others to emulatewhich is exactly what has occurred only the negro foolishly decries his own achievements if all the chaunceys in the country gave up their jobs and went to work in the ghetto the only thing that would be accomplished is more confusion in fact working in the ghetto is probably the last thing the socalled instant negro leaders really want as their positionsbased largely on egotistical emotional charismatic appeals and simple solutions the same techniques used by george wallace et alwould be threatened therefore whether negro digest or socalled instant negro leaders like it or not chauncey iii will probably make it and make it in a very substantial way if his virtues are imitatedas other groups have imitated the virtues of its successfulthen many will make progress for despite all difficulties and frustrations there is some progress if they are ignored and deprecated and instead slovenliness loudness lack of organization lack of discipline and lack of working hard to take advantage of training opportunities are passed off as maintaining our cultural heritage then the children of these people will and will forever be the maids and dishwashers of chauncey iv let us see negro digest make some intelligent sophisticated proposals which after reading the digest i doubt is possiblealthough it would be refreshing to see and honest if bungled try for involving chauncey or try asking chauncey for his ideas and dont react with customary immature emotion and ravings of uncle tom instead try listening to his suggestions but whatever is done do it quietly dont advertise your lack of sophistication ive always known that i was a second class citizen in my beloved country america but somewhere along the way this made me try harder to earn my share of it and enjoy it i think i enjoy it more and am prouder because i did have to prove myself i know i shouldnt have had to do this but since i did im glad i had the determination not to bask in defeat every time i talked to other people who were always finding excuses for not trying blaming their failure on everyone but themselves reminded me that even though my parents were professionals who brought me up in a stable middle class neighborhood i knew that they were probably not always middle class and had worked hard and stuck to it to become socalled middle class you know when you become a middle class negro you pay taxes property taxes the land that go to help our less fortunate black brothers and sisters and you hope with all your might that they will use it to benefit themselves and not give up because you see that just about all socalled middle class negroes got theirs the hard way against odds that their donations to the naacp and the urban league have helped to eliminate during these protest years they might have been working on two jobs to pay the everrising property tax now they didnt really have to look for a job they were already there waiting for them and looking for someone to do them no one should envy the middle class negro because if things are as bad as they are supposed to be he must have a pretty hard time getting to be middle class as you call it now i know that with a lot of cooperation from all thinking people white and black working with a lot of white employers all of a sudden there are a lot of jobs going begging stop look and listen things are better stop bristling and march with us to a better world not perfect but if we all help it will be better this is the only country we have we dont know what another country would be like we cannot fight until we get every narrow minded person to admit that they wronged a people years ago but we dont need them instead of us wallowing in the defeats of the past leave them behind and come with the middle class negro that is if a middle class negro is a property tax payer look at the blocks and blocks of black taxpayers this means that we have a concern for our school windows and other destruction that our poor misguided children have been led to believe that only whitey has to pay for i can see what youll say if you ever read this but i feel that we dont have to ask if we can control our neighborhood i will contribute towards this i feel like i would like to stop begging now and do please dont take my freedom of speech away if i do not agree with the extremists please dont take away my freedom to say it i can not say that the middle class negro has not helped in the struggle but if you want more help you will have to meet us half way im willing to give a little if you are and maybe we can have a meeting of the minds come out from under and expose some of the good negroes we have teachers lawyers doctors newspapers and a lot of people who are willing to help we cannot fight individuals or well fight the longest war of history come black brothers i havent the time to wait for you but i am hoping that you join me and do your share to build a better world riding on the ebony wings of black pride and black sel fdetermination has been the burgeoning interest in all things appurtenant to the black americans traditional heritage not the least of which has been an assiduity to discover a black language apart from gullah one that would uplift unify inspire and glorify the black man to fill this need a few years ago some people gravitated to kiswahili swahili perhaps because it was the only african language they had heard about almost to the point of cliche gee dont all africans speak swahili and of course swahili was the source of that great word uhuru symbolizing the elusive concept of freedom somewhere along the line it turned out that swahili s bright image got tarnished for one thing soon afterwards a horde of denigrating whites started ridiculing the very idea of black folk wasting their time learning an uncivilized jungle language and how these whites questioned could swahili be a symbol of the new black man when it had once been employed by rapacious slave traders it didnt seem to bother these critics that a lot of white people have wasted their time in studying swahili as evidenced by the curious fact that percent of all swahili grammar books are whiteauthored in america nor did they seem unnerved by the fact that the usedbyslave traders charge could be equally cast against english spanish french german portuguese and a lot of other languages deemed more appropriate for black folk to be concerned with for example some of these instant swahili experts suggested that swahili was spoiled because of the influence of arabic upon its vocabulary great slavers those arabs and proceeded to urge upon blacks the study of the west african language hausa they were ignorant to the truth that most flausas are muslims by religion and that their language has also been influenced by arabic so much so that the very hausa word for god is allah a veritable linguistic war broke out in the district of columbia recently when some high schoolers had the audacity to demand use of the taxpayers money to introduce swahili as a regular foreign language in the high school curriculum exacerbating matters was the knowledge that d cs school system had for years turned out scores of functional illiterates who could not speak good english a demand for swahili was looked upon by many as a sure disaster and as a dangerous obstruction to preparing alreadydeprived children to enter the mainstream of respectable responsible american life at worst such a demand was considered an act of sabotage against the educational system and at best an irrelevant diversion over the years my interest in language and communication has led me to learn several languages in high school my eagerness made me borrow with permission a spanish grammar a full year before was scheduled to take the schools spanish course and in college bowie state of spiro agnew fame due to my entering in the second semester i was a whole semester behind everyone else in the french class but in my zeal i wound up by achieving one of the few as given in class at another time in high school i once greatly irritated my civics teacher by writing the first paragraph of an essay on communism sovyershit vid kommunist na narodye in russian while during a few lean months some years past when i was out of work i kept out of trouble by studying the bible in hebrew bereshith barn elohim et hashamayyim wa et haaretz i began to learn swahili when concern for my african heritage bloomed in the blood of martvr dr martin_luther_king jr the trauma produced by his brutal murder turned me inward toward blackness away from honky america and her honky institutions values and language not being content merely with textbook study i contacted the tanzanian embassy in d cwriting in swahili naturally since it is tanzanias national languageand arranged to receive a swahili newspaper i also scouted around for some black swahilispeaking penpals i now have ten then after about six months of study i decided to move closer to africas west coast and added hausa and yoruba to my continuing study of swahili acquiring in the process two yoruba penpals and getting wrapped up in the politics of the nigerian civil war but thats another story finally i ran across the white swahili scholar and author basic structure of swahili jim brain who is currently an associate professor of anthropology at the state university college in new york and we began exchanging correspondence in swahili the purpose of all this background is to separate what i am about to conclude from the senseless inaccurate assertions of the myriad of swahili detractors who abound today who try to substitute bias for knowledge in the first place the objections to a few black people learning swahili are utterly ridiculous swahili is no more nor any less than any other foreign language it is neither magic nor poison knowing how to speak it is no panacea for the black americans ills but neither will its study retard him in arty way if it is not entirely the very quintessence of uhuru neither is it the very embodiment of colonialism kiswahili is a bantu african language native to africas east coast about or ad arab settlers and merchandise traders in that area intermarried with bantu natives and thus introduced some arabic terms into the lanuage and still later the islamic religion among the africans there subsequent commerce slavery and colonialism caused the inclusion into swahili of some indian and english terms but the grammatical structure of swahili has remained bantu african throughout all this activity none of these borrowed foreign words changes the fact that swahili is an african language any more than the large quantity of borrowed latin and french words changes english from a germanic to a romance language knowing how to speak swahili wont conjure up miracles for the hardpressed black american the mental disciplining derived from its study might enliven the mind and promote good study habits in other areas but merely intoning uhuru unlike the mythical shazzam wont turn anyone into a captain marvel nor will it put money in the pocket or food on the table in honky america it is a serious fact of life that learning honky english kimombo is a swahili term for english mumbojumbo to africans is of much more immediate benefit than learning how to speak swahilior french or spanish for that matter none of this is meant to suggest that studying swahili is conversely a waste of time if a black child is interested and advanced enough to undertake the study of a foreign language swahili is definitely as useful as any european language with the advantage of being distinctively african even though swahili words are easier to pronounce than those of tone languages like yoruba swahili grammar presents a mental challenge it is very involved and very precise similar to latin in these respects a student who has real trouble learning english had better forget about swahili learning correct swahili actually requires a great amount of skill and concentration but at the same time such study can be made very interesting and relevant if tied in with a study of african life and heritage after all africa not just west africa is the home of the black man and swahili and swahilispeakers are not foreign to our heritage a common blackness and a common experience with slavery and colonialism and neocolonialism makes us all kinsmen in fact and experience using swahili or some other african language can open up a wealth of doors to interesting and fruitful friendships sure most educated africans can speak english or french but many of them would prefer to use their own languages several tanzanians have impressed this fact upon me and it was a point effectively made by members of kenyas olympic track team the danger inherent in the putdown of swahili by most people is that it implies also that the validity relevance and usefulness of all other african languages is doubtful for the purists who pursue a banal sectionalism by asserting that afroamericans have little in common with east africans because our ancestors were primarily west africans suggest that they agitate for more recognition and instruction of ede yoruba bakin hausa ibo ashanti or mandingo in the educational systems of this land however for those who want knowledge of a black african language that is beautiful logical wellconstructed challenging and abounding in written material swahili has few equals in short swahili has the usual assets and liabilities of any other foreign language except that the black highschooler of the aware generation might be more interested in whats going on in the congo angola kenya or tanzania than in the action in some obscure village in peru or france while language of itself cannot teach culture it certainly need not be divorced from culture and can be excellently employed as a springboard for the study of culture and heritage kwa haya kiswahili huweza kuwa samani ya manufaa katika makolokolo ya kujifahamu ya mweusi pia baada ya kufikiri dhana za kiswahili mintarafu uhuru kujitegemea ljjamaa na upinduzi kwa muda kidogo ajuaye ni nani my any black youth are becoming involved in the process which they term revolution revolution black revolution we hear these cries echoing from the campuses to the ghettos across the face of america today but many of these youth i find alarmingly in much of their basic outlook perhaps unconsciously imitate the western newleft whites much of the same sterile marxist jargon of these whites with the usual references to lenin trotsky castro etc comes to mind even some of our most fiery young spokesmen are constantly quoting albert camus as a reference i propose that these youth are deeply misguided and in their references are still operating within the trance of the whiteeyes the west they are still under western controlthe radical wing of the western establishments captive negroes many of these youth when questioned closely after breaking through the mystique of the gunfetish guns baby guns the gun as extended penis an adolescent manhood symbol really seek an integrated marxistsocialist america revolutionary integration so to speak which has always been within western radical tradition as an ultimate solution for american social development in this essay i speak of a concept of black revolution totally different from the sterile western forms and concepts i speak of a spiritual internal revolution which will create new people new men a revolution which will follow in el hajj malik el shabazzs malcolm_xs footsteps to relink afroamerica with the afroasian east a revolution which will restore the mind and soul of the black man to his ancestral rhythms and ancient spirituality while many of these undisciplined youth shout of guns which will eventually become necessary for survival i agree and getting whitey how many of them would be able to begin the most basic internal revolution to uplift their moral and spiritual natures and uproot the decadence and spiritual and moral diseases that haunt the psyches of all who fall victim to the western way of life ill wager that many cannot even admit that we are and have been a mentally and morally sick people it is my belief that the end result of this revolution will be new forms political cultural spiritualwhich will crystalize into a new black civilization here in the west which will ultimately change the moral spiritual and political outlook of the entire planet earth what our youth must realize is that one cannot defeat the west by using western formsbeat the devil at his own game so to speak and marxist materialism is the most dangerous form the west has used to ensnare the minds of black people we have the writings of harold cruse to attest to this fact i would add that were not against socialism or communalism as leroi jones says this is the natural way for men to live what we are against however is the western atheistic denial of godallah moulder and shaper of the universe which is totally against our spiritual nature as black people and actually reflects the white western intellectuals estrangement from his religion western christianitywhich is whiteys internal problem not ours in a great sense this fundamental nonwestern revolution has already begun and has been in progress for the last few years one has only to observe the dress images and changing lifestyles of a growing number of black youth outside of the marxist movement to discern this phenomenon it is as though an african nation were rising here in the west to quote a black spiritual leader el hajj ameer hassan my brothers and sisters are returning to themselves donning their ancestral robes once again returning to their true religion philosophies and lifestyles this process this easternization or reafricanization is coming to them from the vibrations of allah in the atmosphere the air they breathe the water they drink nothing is more startling than to see the robes of africa in the subways and the gray ghettos of this land which robbed us of our heritage and seemingly turned us into frankensteinnegroes a people without past or future it is this process which again is the true revolution that our people are making and this is the path which should be explored selfconsciously by our leading young minds in this credo essay i attempt to move in this direction the black magi i have at last found the kind of personal identity that i desire as a black man i know that when first turned from the westernized revolutionary intellectual path into an eastern direction i became worried about my new role my personal identity if i wasnt a revolutionary intellectual if this was a white thinga leftist white thingthen what was i how to define to the inner self this eastern orientation i had always in my revolutionary intellectual days shunned the poet in me in those days i saw the poet through western radical eyes as a feeble little versifier only content to put rhymes on paper talking hard but really out of it in terms of guns revolutionary politics community organization etc but now thanks to my continued striving jihad and growth i have returned to myself i no longer shun the poet in me for i now see a greater deeper definition of poet and artist in the eastern sense returning to the book muntu and correspondingly the writings of poetphilosopher aime cesaire and the philosophers of both african eastern culture i began to discover the poet as priest as sorcerer a black magician from magi hence imagnation whose sole duty is to raise the collective consciousness of his black people the black nation and prepare them for revolution and the seizure of their collective destinies by creating an inner revolution of the soul transmuting them from negroes into an eastern people once again this role of poet as priest seer holyman and finally prophet has given me a muchneeded dignity and added a new dimension to my life i now choose as my models the great priests of ancient egypt ethiopia the black magi of ancient persia elam and the learned shiekhs of timbuctu my sole duty in life now is the elevation of my race and the shaping of black people here into a great new nation rising upon the ruins of a crumbling decadent america doomed to go down hard screaming and blubbering in the flames of her filthy murders and spiritual doom i now see myself and my brothers as the embodiment of the soul of my nation the living vessel of its myths rituals aspirations and future world view we the new black artists and thinkers are evolving into its conscience voice and living archetypes in the age of the third world the coming world order we the new black artists and thinkers are the harbingers of a new spiritual dawn when the wretched billions of humanity will arise from the degradation of this evil barbaristic white age and reclaim their lost heritage by returning to their original selves and uniting with the evolving cosmos of god to restore civilization to our planet we the new holymen and shiekhs of the black nation must serve as the living mind and holy soul of the coming black nation the guardians the warriorprophets the lovers of man everywhere we are we must put down roots and sacrifice our time in service to black people the nation by teaching them new ways and helping them to elevate their minds magi spreading the healing light of black consciousness and national being there must not be any great contradictions in our own lives for we must serve as living examples to our peopleas brother malcolm peace be upon him didin order for them to advance with confidence and unity they must come to feel that the new brothers and sisters are above reproach in their actions would never under any circumstances let them down or sell them out this will be a difficult task at first for we are all filled with white western contradictions in our minds but we must strive greatly jihad to remove this cancer from our spirits and establish eastern models and forms to live by for the eastern world africa included is the originator of human civilization and of all things godlike and spiritual upon our planet identity and nationhood our thrust then would be to rtstore the spiritual links with our racial ancestors we are west africans in captivity we must rekindle the energies and tap the root sources that gave rise to ghana mali songhai and the moorish empire we must link these redis covered roots to our africanamerican soul culture in order to become a whole people once again we must strive to restore what chattel slavery destroyed a the black national identity b religion and cosmology c communal family structure we must transform our imitation white lifestyle into a positive black cultural form we must restore the ancient rhythms that raised the race once we change from imitation or carboncopy white forms into truly black eastern forms we will purify our psyches so that the wisdom of our illustrious ancestors will return to usintuitively one cannot expect spiritual light to shine through a corrupted vessel such spiritual ways as islam african cultural teachings and yoga its philosophy spiritual training and physical therapy will prove helpful in restoring our harmony with the cosmosalong with the eastern martial arts evolution will be our slogan evolution evolution change the forms change the images of selfour selves change into the new that is old the ancient that is here again african and eastern dress wearing the long dress or west african wraps for our sisters black woman give beastina back her whorish miniskirts bellbottoms dykesuits evolve eastwards into your african princess self the dashikis and burnooses for our brothers give the ivyleague back its togs black man the buttondown world is crumbling along with the furnishing and decoration of our homes in an african and eastern manner all of these revolutionary changes in our lifestyles forms will help free our black souls from the stranglehold of the dying west dietary changes you are the food you eat oink oink oink many brothers and sisters have not only given up reactionary food the filthy hog but have gone further eastwards by becoming vegetarians and adding to their mental and physical health by using herb teas to cleanse their systems and other health foods speech how we speak what we say languagelanguage helps shape thought identity being we must releam rediscover the history and languages of our ancestors arabic yoruba swahili hausa etcin order to become a whole people once again we must become nationbuilders think nation be nation in our minds in our hearts be be be become the new emerging from the ashes of the old identity will spirit strivinginmotion jihad there is only one identity and one direction that history will allow us black nationhood as many of our leaders and thinkers from marcus garvey and w e b du bois to harold cruse and elijah muhammad have pointed out we are already a separate peoplehave been since we were brought here in chains what we must strive to do is to organize this separateness and make it work for us by forging our to million souls never believe your enemys statistics into the highest modern form of human organization the nationstate for only a sovereign national state will solve our centuriesold identitycrisis and land question our slave ancestors worked the fertile lands of the deep south for centuries and it was promised us in the form of forty acres and a mule by the union government which later withdrew its promise along with its armies and left our defenseless ancestors at the mercy of the southern terror forty acres and a mule to millions of black peasants wouldve created a black nationwithinanation in the deep south only then will we have the living room or space to fully evolve and develop our national potential as dictated by the dynamism inherent in our black spirit and will to power timid souls will ask what about the white man i would answer by saying that we have this task to perform because it represents the final workingout of our collective destiny whether the white man is living or dead living and creating evil and suffering or burned to destruction by the fires of divinity i say that if the white man gets in our way or tries to interfere then he is tampering with our godgiven rights to selfdetermination as human beings and we must deal with him as any other sovereign people or nation would deal with their foreign enemies in a highly organized disciplined fashion by any means we deem necessary scientifically intellectually rationally remember the oppressors are only a highly organized hierarchy of corrupt men they are not god and only god controls our planet and the universe including the white man there fore fear a llah not the white man the complete man in returning to the subject of the roles of the new black artists and thinkers we must strive to become complete men in the eastern sense of the term a complete man is a person who is fully developed physically mentally and spiritually the eastern man could write a beautiful poem or carve an ancestral figure or mask then don his armour and lead a thundering horde into battle in defense of his nation and culture he could hold discourses with learned sages and organize and handle the administrative and diplomatic affairs of his nation or empire while taking time to lecture to students or to design beautiful parks and flowergardens for the people i speak of such men as askia the great the soldierstatesmanemperor of the songhai empire muhammad ahmed the mahdi scholar spiritualleader and revolutionary warrior of the sudan yakub al mansur soldierstatesman cultural leader and emperor of the moorish empire of northern africa and spain and in modern times the two poets philosophers and revolutionary statesmen of the east ho chi minh and mao tse tung who while admittedly using marxism have absorbed all of the ancient philosophies of their cultures and shaped and moulded that marxism to fit the psyches and psychologies of their ancient peoples these are examples of the complete or eastern man that we must become if we wish to be truly free by developing fully in this sense we would rule out the socalled western intellectual who would live a contradiction between his life and his work a person who would write beautiful revolutionary essays plays etc but who might actually be a weakling or coward when it comes to basic manhood protecting his family picking up the gun to defend his community or nation or setting a living example of courageous virtue for his people in my humble opinion this is the path we must take if we desire a full and complete existence for our race here in the west and if we expect to survive the fall of the west only history will know if well find success here within the grey walls of harlem among the myriad masses of my people i work out my destiny evolving in the soul upwards towards my higher self moving to reestablish the broken links with my racial ancestors while maintaining a revolutionary black awareness of the modern world moving eastwards towards mother africa and holy meccain these young years of black awareness heeding the call of the world spirit l come come striding forward striving in a great jihad of collective being we all come evolving towards a new spiritual a ge a iways the nation always the black nation rising with the great dawn breaking in the east flooding the planet with a new world age come brothers and sisters take my thrilling hands as we march forward together a singing army of new men to raise the race raise the race raise the ra most of those who object to the teaching of black literature j if d s n aesthetic grounds they suggest that the black lvj k writer does not present a realistic view of his society that his version of america and the world is shameful fantasy that his art is slanted by racism and wellmeaning sentimentalism arguing that a valuable aesthetic experience must be primary to the teaching of literature they go on to suggest that all black literature is aesthetically inferior they imply in their artforartssake thesis that all aesthetically valuable literature with only a few exceptions is white no one should disagree with the notion that literature should afford one a valuable aesthetic experience an elementary test of the aesthetically valuable however is concerned with the relative beauty of art the art that is literature is concerned with the relative beauty of the lives of people how they stand on top of a western mountain and die how they live their short happy lives in search of success of course there is universality in all human experience but when teachers present experiences to a class of black and white children they should present experiences which compliment the humanity and dignity of a black and white class surely no sane teacher will defend presenting literary experiences to any student which implies denial of that students humanity his human beauty literature should facilitate a persons search through the mirrored past of human experience for reflections of his own life worth his own humanity if every image in the aesthetically valuable is white and if in contrast the only black image presented is one concerning a black child chased by a childeating tiger is this not a cruel denial of the childs human beauty and worth is it not building a social dynamite which must some day explode in black summer rage history gives men a panoramic view of life experience in the universe literature isolates experiences and men gives them spirit aesthetic structure the literature that is history is created so that men may have a record of their past if that record is honest it should aid in shaping the future deciding about even the next moments the literature that is literature that is aesthetically valuable is governed by integrity it is according to professor andrew pawley an essential institution created to serve common human needs and aspirations an honest literary experience should serve the needs and aspirations of all of the peopled hills of a nation a city or a school it is common knowledge that every american city has its various ethnic and racial groups cleveland has its hough its mount pleasant and its glenville each populated mainly by black americans murray hill is predominantly italianamerican numerous slavic families in habit the lower southeast side beechwood is a predominantly jewish community parma is second and third generation polishamerican in every urban area such ethnic and racial communities exist my purpose is not to justify these racial and ethnic lines in urban living patterns it is rather to prove that our society is pluralistic a reflection of the many parts of our societal whole and that as a result the teaching of literature ought to be pluralistic a reflection of the peopled hills in our cities in our classrooms the demand for the teaching of black literature is a demand for a more human definition of the aesthetically valuable it is more specifically a demand for a literature that serves the specific human needs and aspirations of black life black humanity the literature that is presently called american literature is complimentary to white images it is in short what may be called white literature i do not mean to suggest that what is presently called american literature is not good literature much of it however lacks the basic ingredient of literary integrity and is indeed slanted by racism and wellmeaning sentimentalism since black life experiences are normally different in america from white life experiences constantly in aesthetic and actual conflict there is no reason why a clearthinking teacher should expect one valuable aesthetic experience from honest literature what is reasonable is that there should be at least two aesthetically valuable experiences and there should be beauties in between the solution it seems to me lies in the acceptance of all of our american selveswhite yellow red black gwendolyn brooks is a pulitzer prize winning poet her in the mecca was nominated for a national book award her beverly hills chicago is a splendid example of poetic excellence but in spite of awards and nominations gwendolyn brooks poet laureate of illinois is edited out of books of american verse the prose of richard wright is as clear and clean as that of ernest hemingway the dominant most admirable image in the fiction of hemingway is white the nigger that cooks is in the kitchen in hemingways fiction and he seems to want to stay there the nigger may be in the kitchen in the fiction of richard wright but he does not want to stay there he does not wish to remain a nigger either implied in the fiction of richard wright are the hopes and aspirations of black life in america implicit in the fiction of this black writer is what the civil_rights movement isor wasall about black students as i understand them are saying that if they must read hemingways the short happy life of francis macomber then white students ought to read richard wrights big boy leaves home that if they must read emily dickinsons as imperceptibly as grief then white students ought to read gwendolyn brookss beverly hills chicago to thine own self be true was the last admonition polonious gave his son laertes when laertes left home for school in france the proper study of mankind is man alexander pope wrote in his essay on man an elementary lesson in modern social problems reveals that thousands of people are institutionalized each year because they do not know themselves thousands of lives are lost each year as they are washed down ghetto drains in search of other selves through drugs alcohol lsd when laertes left home for school he had been taught well the ways of other men but more important than that he had been taught to know himself if we teach on the green grounds of universality a black child the life experience of a white child we are saying to that black child that there is no american difference between him and the white child we may desire that dream to be true but it is not true today a white child may go to mississippi from his home in cleveland and find that only the weather is different and perhaps the people walk and talk a little slower than they do in cleveland but a black child having been taught that there is no american difference between him and the white child may go to mississippi and die in the bloated belly of the mississippi pearl where emmett till far from chicago floated to a deathly adolescent truth black child truth is not the same as white child truth in mississippi there is a deadly difference between the two kinds of childish truths surely most educators would like to equalize the two truths recognizing and teaching them may be one way of equalizing them meanwhile however the child must know the truth of the world he lives in that truth may not set him free in mississippi but it may well save his life those who contend that the black writer cannotor does not present a realistic view of society are obviously not black they do not know the reality of black american experience often they do not even sympathize with the needs and aspirations of black humanity and a writer ought to sympathize he really ought to empathize he ought at least to sympathize with the denial of black feminine narcissism illuminated in black rage what robert herrick does for white womanhood in his to electra is denied black womanhood barred from the classrooms by traditional professors who apparently know nothing about human needs and aspirations and their relations to literature of course there are black writers who have not presented a realistic view of their society most of these writers however had their brains washed in the stagnant waters of slavery or selfhate sometimes success in the white world drove them to copy the stereotypes of their humanity phillis wheatley an outstanding example of a black woman who was denied feminine worth most probably hated herself looking at phillis wheatleys poem through contemporary blackpower and emergingafrica eyes one must conclude that miss wheatley was ashamed of her native land ultimately of herself but phillis wheatley was a slave and so it is easy to forgive her for her mask jupiter hammon a contemporary of miss wheatley was a slave who was encouraged by his kind master to write and it is easy to forgive that dutiful slave paul laurence dunbar in his poem we wear the mask suggests that there have been many black lies told to white america jupiter hammon and phillis wheatley wore the mask so have dozens of white american authors worn white puritan masks but there are black writers who have grown up who have taken off the mask there are black writers who have never worn a literary mask they paid a painful price for their integrity it is they who can take the slogan blackisbeautiful and develop it lovingly in all of its american shades it is they who can most vividly portray the racial glory and dark beauty of black life most white writers in america have not described honestly the human beauty of the black american perhaps these writers are too near in their imagery herricks to electra perhaps unconsciously they distort the humanity of black life perhaps they do so because it isit certainly wasin vogue it was the literary thing to do at any rate if they cannot treat that humanity vividly and lovinglynot as vividly and as lovingly as the black writer can for you see if he loves himself his treatment of other black lives will be reflected through his loving eyes most white writers do not bring sympathetic or empathetic hearts with them when they endeavor to portray black life they bring creative hearts creative hearts may create new lives distort old ones they cannot however measure the extent of rejection the black man takes to his youcanmakeitifyoutry brainwashed home if they have not felt the electric cattleprod stabbing afroamerican dignity they cannot measure not truly the aesthetic value of blacklife dignity because they have not felt the electrocution of it if they have not been black like me for one day they cannot begin to know the realism of my uncle johnnys separate but equal louisiana sawmill years while black students may seem to be saying that the proper study of black man is black life i understand them to mean that they want to be told the american truth of themselves i understand them to mean that the proper study of any man is honest life they know that jim of huckleberry finn is a compromise of man in them they know that little black sambo is a classic black lie they know that virtually every story about black life in american literature is a story that presents a questionable humanity black life is portrayed as primitive savage life or saintly romantic life neither is honest earthly american life this is not meant as an argument against the teaching of literature by white writers to black children our national goal at least at this writing is still an open society still one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all to teach any one kind of literature however in an integrated classroom is a tragic denial of value for another kind of life beauty life experience perhaps an honest solution lies in teaching world literaturenot just the white world but all the world a meltingpot world the american worldthe unmelted ethnic world the image of the black american in american literature has been to say the least dishonest black humanity as represented by most white writers has been capsulized categorized and disintegratized the happy slave is a literary hoax the tragic mulatto was tragic because he was a social slave trapped in the iron grip of class the wretched freedman was not free and the local color negro is a romantic creation like the exotic primitive if there was ever such a man as the local color negro he is dead now if he is not dead then he has moved to the city if there was ever such a wretch as a wretched freedman he lives solely in the territory of american fiction the tragic mulatto has integrated now and the exotic primitive has lost his exoticism as well as his primeval loveliness in urban ghetto reproduction we teach by what we teach as well as by what we do not teach for too long aesthetic reality in american literature has said that the humanity of black americans is ridiculous with stepin fetchit amusing with amos and andy entertaining with white blackfaced minstrelsy and human only in exceptional cases like uncle toms cabin up from slavery the jackie robinson story and yes l can what we have said as a nation about and to black humanity is this basically your humanity is questionable however if you are fantastic like uncle tom booker t washington jackie robinson and sammie davis jr we will concede your exceptional ability now those are not kind words to utter to a human being they are not kind words to speak to any child regardless of the color of his humanity they are unkind and they erect a stone wall between the human needs and aspirations of people something there is that doesnt love a wall robert frost wrote in mending wall frost went on to say that that something nature black students want to send a frozengroundswell under the aesthetic wall which bars them from their own human needs and aspirations they want to unmend that wall to spill the upper boulders before a black sun and make gaps that even two can pass abreast that even they and white students can pass abreast much of the fault for the communication gap between people in america today is due in part to three centuries of classic lies and not to teach in the context of american literature that literature which treats honestly the humanity of black americans is to continue to be to black and white americans academically dishonest humanistically cruel and psychologically destructive not to teach black literature at all is to continue to build with scholarly arrogancy a summer bomb that must explode over the traditional september walls of academic paranoia onto the green canvas of american liberty thomas jefferson might have written that while all men are created equal literature keeps them equal literature can build a fortress of human dignity in a childs heart thomas jefferson did not write that however he wrote all men are created equal it is up to education to write the rest it is up to education to build the fortress of human dignity in black and white american hearts we communicate by what we say as well as by what we do not say and we have not yet said as teachers administrators and educators that black life is beautiful life we have not even said that black life is human life we have stood on the white brink of artforartssake and denied the humanity of most of the world is it not now time that we move our concern across the wall toward a sane oasis of universal life if we do move toward the sane center land we may witness the dark reality of alexander popes wisdom when he declared in essay on man david littlejohn is the author of a white paper black on white which should be appropriately entitled the effects of the vast body of black literature on the little blind bigoted white mind this proves to be a clinical analysis of the effect of the american dilemma on the mind of what should be a disciplined scholarly white intellectual and educationist rather than a critical survey of black writing as it is supposed to be this then is essentially a black paper by a black writer on the white paper by a white writer who describes black literature in terms of its effects on the white readers already burdened and confused mind perhaps if three years before the publication of the before mentioned book in era bell thompson and herbert nipson editors of ebony magazine had not published white on blackthe views oj twentytwo white americans on the negro or had even asked mr littlejohn to give the definitive twentythird view we would have been spared this occasion for certainly the impulse begins here browsing through success book store in san francisco i found a copy from this source spring platitudinous statements which have since become cliches as an integral part of black humor eleanor roosevelt begins with the essay some of my best friends are negro honest injun and what follows are period pieces in americas attempt to bridge the racial gulf and to integrate the negro into the fabric of the democratic society although mrs roosevelt admitted that one of the odd things about my negro friends is their consistent failure to invite me to their social gatherings she claims never to have lost a negro friend she also admits that she could have done so had she known paul robeson she assesses him and his talents thusly he should be using his talents to help rather than to destroy his country despite his intelligence feel that he has not demonstrated any analytical qualities surely he has not examined the soviet system because it does not permit for real democratic freedom the kindest thing that i can say about him perhaps that he believes that communism will give all people equality this everyone should have but mr robeson and all of us have a greater chance of getting it here in the united states than anywhere else in the world she goes on to describe a crude drawing she encountered in georgia during a political campaign showing her dancing with a negro and entitled niggerlover eleanor and as a result how she had franklin d call in the secret service and the fbi to investigate the rumored eleanor clubs where negro members of those clubs were supposed to push white people on thursdays or something really strange the second essay the plight of southern white women by a husbandandwife team wilma dykeman and james stokely who are authors of a book on the race problems neither black nor white is one which lauds the moral courage of the women born and bred southemers who met on november to form the association of southern women for the prevention of lynching this came after a preliminary study of the violent practices of their men this study included the revealing statistics that of lynchings occurring from to only per cent of the victims had even been accused of crimes against white women this fact convinced them that economic exploitation had hidden too long and too comfortably behind their skirts following these two essays is a string of confessionals by an array of white people sophie tucker the last of the red hot mamas told how she launched her entertainment career in by thinking black billy graham evangelist warned no color line in heaven lillian smith in strange fruit in harlem admitted that bounded on the south by visible signs on the north by invisible signs filled with its heaven and its hells there is no way for a white person to walk away from harlem frank sinatra in the way i look at race informs us that people who hate dont live wholesome lives and that i believe that bigotry is a national disease but that it can be cured we are curing it slowly and are on the road to the solution of our no domestic problem segregation bishop g bromley oxnam in the sin of silence begins with once again the ku klux klan burns crosses and masquerades in white it proclaims its message of vicious racialism antisemitism and religious bigotry many church members who proudly declare they are saved belong to this unamerican and unchristian body ralph mcgill in the south looks ahead states matteroffactly that the south has sacrificed its children colored and white to inferior education and has across a hundred years discriminated in one degree or another against all its people a free south will be in fact a new south the human being or condition always has had at least three yearnings to be treated as a human being to have an equal fair chance to win respect and advancement as an individual in the economic environment and freely to seek spiritual and cultural happiness and finally william faulkner the mississippi writer who won the nobel prize for literature in gives advice in a sevenpage essay if i were a negro in answer to the question surrounded by antagonistic white people would you find it hard not to hate them his answer was i would repeat to myself booker t washingtons words when he said i will let no man no matter what his color ever make me hate him so if i were a negro i would say to my people let us be always unflaggingly and inflexibly flexible but always decently quietly courteous with dignity and without violence and above all with patience the white man has devoted three hundred years to teaching us to be patient that is one thing at least in which we are his superiors let us turn it into a weapon against him let us use this patience not as a passive quality but as an active weapon if you will pardon the seeming digression i cite these numerous references from the book white on black in order to pose the question can a white american from a society diseased in institutionalized racism ever talk about the black man without it being a projection of his own racist fantasies which colors his logic and i would answer that with seldom certainly the few white revisionist historians have found a way in the somewhat newer field of english literature scholars like professor richard m dorson author of american negro folktales and abraham chapman who in september edited the page anthology of afroamerican literature black voices show that it can be done chapman ends his page introduction thusly i close this anthology reluctantly with the feeling that so much is happening and being born that it would be good to keep the book open and bring it still more of the new but the end of this anthology is not conclusion i hope but further beginnings greater appreciation of what black writers have contributed and are contributing to the diversity of american literature and movement towards greater inclusion of works by negro writers in our american literature courses in the high schools and colleges and from the january issue of negro digest he includes a quote from the fine black writer margaret walker author of the novel jubilee the black aesthetic has a rich if undiscovered past this goes back in time to the beginning of civilization in egypt babylonia india china persia and all the islamic world that preceded the renaissance of the europeans we have lived too long excluded by the anglosaxon aesthetic where else should the journey lead the black writer is the black experience how can the human experience transcend humanity its the same thing yes thank god it can be done unfortunately however mr littlejohn failed in his critical analysis of black writing to be equal to this mammoth task to use his image he was not the gulliver he imagined himself to be nor are the yearold voices which resound from the wealth of afroamerican literaure those of the lilliputians which could be easily dismissed as the product of small minds that happento be negro or a literary output which if a bright white mind immerses itself for long is pained dispirited by dwelling in the dull dark prison yard that is so often the negro writers world and the responding spirit is dulled and bored by the sordid limitation of the soul in the tight closet of the black imagination this man is so square that he doesnt even know that black people have more soul than anyone ask james brown aretha franklin or even time magazine or esquire where has this man been where is he coming from mr littlejohn does not have to study the background the history the social milieu which produces black writers he already has his mind made up in the first pages of his introduction of the quality the nature and the occasion of this vexing material the occasion and the substance of most negro writing in america is still the undeclared race war in which all americans are by definition involved this writing often becomes a weapon in the race war and from the view of white readers an enemy weapon some of it is meant to give pain to disconcert and unbalance the pain in most negro literature of the american race war however remains solid and undigestible it juts up it rankles it rubs raw like an ulcer as it is meant to sometimes the design is quite conscious writing is one way of getting back at the enemy the negros satisfaction will be doubled of course if his foolish white reader can be made to pay for and to praise the materials of his own discomfort p and even when the scholar in him nags at him to consider the history of a racially oppressed minority he dismisses this impulse the wounded white reader may even try to reduce out the color content and claim that there are simply the histories of any oppressed minority regardless of race and then confront that accusations as he will such attempts to deflect the pain of negro writing are like the evasion interpretations the explainingaway of book iv of gullivers travels horses really arent houyhnms you know people really arent yahoos gulliver has obviously gone mad swift was psychologically misanthropic and so on well who wants to top that what was that the great white father william faulkner advised his good colored people in his sevenpage essay if i were a negro first i must repeat the magic words from booker t washington will let no man no matter what his color ever make me hate him and then according to faulkner i must use patience as an active war weapon frankly i never expected to find in faulkner a true adversary but perhaps just perhaps can communicate what i must say from this vantage point having exhumed the ghost of the great white father of american literature even his voice comes back to haunt mr littlejohn with the truth that not only is what he has to say about the black writers so much nonsense but even what he says about white writers proves him to be a sloppy scholar and critic i quote mr littlejohn william faulkner who of all people might have had an idea could not imagine himself a negro for two minutes p in this book on the black writing checking the reference pages in the index i found that jonathan swift has three references while sterling brown dean of black literature and black scholarship has only two sterling brown respected poet and longtime professor of english literature at howard university did the definitive scholarship on negro writing in the s leading to the valuable book the negro caravan continuing this disproportionate cataloguing we find the naacp with one page reference claude mckay with eight jean genet with five arna bontemps with five dr strangelove with one marcys garvey with one charles dickens with three and william faulkner with mr littlejohn continues frankly must admit that the other side of the coin may also be true certainly as a black literary critic on the subject of a whites attempt at criticizing black writing i at least blush it becomes rather obvious then that this book should be viewed as a companion piece to the confessions of william styron via nat turner therefore i will view it with patience ijowever even now since faulkners advice i must run the risk of bringing new pains to this brave warriorcritic of the race war literature of black people as mr littlejohn cautions p the literature of the race war polarizes american it forces them to take sides they would rarely take in life it pains me to be so argumentative but mr littlejohn even here is in error because he does not know himself in real life his stances are the same contradictory to his philosophy that of a gulliversized fairhaired bigoted pedant you see using this scholarly work as a shield mr littlejohn is waging a war in reallife drama this one is pitting him and i as generals on either side of the camp the war is over a simple idea is the history and culture and society reflected in black writing worthy of serious study to even those blacks who must know themselves to open the floodgate of all other knowledge the university of california berkeley was the wartorn battleground where this open and declared war was to be staged we were both members of the faculty of this worldrenowned institution of higher learning for the year i was teaching a subjecta course in remedial composition where the bulk of third world people particularly entering black students are placed as a result of discriminatory criminally inaccurate whiteoriented achievement and placement tests as a black teacher i was teaching this course primarily for blacksalthough of my original students were nonblacks it was taught from a black perspective it recognizes the black mothertongue as a possible effective poetic language which is a very natural outgrowth of the black experience and i used black literature as models of form for expository writing subjecta is not an integrated part of the english department as is the case on some campuses it stand alone it is for the student who is deemed deficient in language enough to justify barring him from participation in more meaningful courses from a white standpoint within the hallowed ivy walls of the academic department of english on the berkeley campus i had students who elected to take my course from a black perspective one black graduate student was auditing this remedial class of my nonblacks one was an orientalamerican one a mexicanamerican at least one was jewishamerican and there were six other white nonestablishmenttypes and then of course there were my black students trying to determine to what extent they shared in the american tradition mr littlejohn whom i have not had the pleasure of meeting facetoface because of my outhouse status on campus is a respected member of the english department he is most vociferous in denouncing the merits of afroamerican literature and he is accepted by his colleagues as an expert critic in this field which is my expertise by birthright by godgiven and academically developed talent and scholarship so far he has been successful in convincing his department the university the educational community of the san francisco bay area of the meanness of this unliterary body of work by illiterates who have small minds and who dwell in a small dark world somewhere on the periphery of his great white vision he has convinced all that am an outlaw practicing an outlaw trade and that to lower the floodgates to let in either the monster known as a black writer or the writing which is the product of such a monstrously dwarfed world would be a disaster and so the afroamerican studies department waits the afroamerican students wait the body of afroamerican literature waits and least of all ian upcoming black poetmust wait while a hand is on the gate which has locked us out when did this real war for me begin with this intensity it was almost a year ago at that time while developing creating courses in this field for the english department and the newly envisioned afroamerican studies departmentthe first one in actuality in northern californiai became a target of intellectual abuse in the educational community this happened while i was serving my time as an outcast in the miserably segregated and unequal facility known as merritt junior college a feeder junior college of urban vintage as over against the suburban disneylands for which california is so well known in its attempt to give free education for every worthy white student regardless of mental ability and human worth it began in my overcrowded first class in one of the many portables crammed together for the most part in a onecityblock concentrationcamp type institution which proved often to be the logjam of aspiration for urban youthas well as academic death for the black students who had been systematically confined there regardless of mental aptitude and social position in my class were auditors from the university of california graduate english departmentmostly whiteand jim nabors a thirdworld activist who is also an afroamerican he explained that the u c students were desirous of starting such a course on the berkeley campus he was attending my class to determine the focus of such a course and the desirability of initiating a similar one on january shortly after the beginning of the winter term for the daily californian announced that jim nabors had proposed a potential course in an article entitled afroamerican literature class this was on monday mr nabors was beaming when he arrived at our early morning wednesday class the students were exuberant even i was pleased momentarily at the anticipated reception of the new course i had not only spent my entire life as a student of afroamerican literature and had my vows as a black writer to champion its cause but more immediately i had burned the midnight oil well into the night since the beginning of the school year also i had spent a small fortune in acquiring books on this topic which were systematically excluded from the public schools libraries and higher educational institutions in the western tradition i spent my christmas holiday much to the dismay of my dentisthusband and my five offsprings delving into these books in my private collecton purchasing others that would be essential in the new field that was about to open surveying libraries book stores in the end being really disheartened by the mammoth void i noted the storehouse of ignorance that existed in this field in this educational center of western culture the high motivation of angry black students this was only a part of their great beauty many of them followers of black_panther leaders bobby seale huey newton eldridge cleaver gave me the impetus i needed to keep going on in the face of so much pain and persecution i beamed by thursday the uc establishment with mr littlejohn as one of the academic warring generals declared through the press its open war on me here i feel compelled to inject that the chairman of the english department james d hart remarked in the january article entitled conflict over proposed course that such a course was perfectly feasible however this lone white sane voice was lost in the shrill air of the louder voices which were raised as follows david littlejohn assistant professor of english and author of black on white a critical survey of writing by american negroes asserted to invent the course before a substantial literature came along would be pandering to the needs of race pride such a course would be educational therapy for blacks who need to invent a heritage by grasping at such things as jazz african sculpture or afroamerican literature littlejohn said mr littlejohn was not alone his colleague jackson burgess an associate professor of english who spent a year in africa as a smithmundt lecturer in american literature at the university of capetown according to the article stated that the bulk of negro literature is of great value in the fields of history sociology and political science mr burgess stated there isnt a great deal of negro american literature of much value written before the second world war over the last years negro writing has been more emphasized partly because it is becoming better known and partly because much of the better literature has only been written in the last years by the next week an afroamerican student norman wilkerson senior in the english department wrote a letter to the ice box he asserted that black students were black and proud and that we have learned it most prudent not to address ourselves to every perverted inane ejaculation that dribbles from the universitys several malignant orifices however he felt that he must answer mr littlejohn and did so as follows mr littlejohn manages to be both thoroughly insulting and distressingly illogical by this imagery we are characterized as diseased black students seeking rehabilitation through the benevolence of educational therapy while at the same time we are striving to invent a heritage just as littlejohn explained the harlem renaissance into nonexistence so he has reduced us to nonentities if these arguments fail to convince one of littlejohns racism we recommend his low pathetic endeavor to appraise black literature we submit that littlejohn considering his manifest ignorance of black literature should argue for rather than against the creation of such a course on friday january a front page article stated that petition demonstrates interest in black literature course and the afroamerican student union president lenneal henderson called the study of afroamerican literature an absolute necessity i was asked to come to the campus for an interview with the daily californian staff writer debbie heintz and the result of this interview was boldly headlined in the wednesday january paper black literature course offered at merritt college in this article i was asked to describe the contents of my course and in a sweeping generality i mentioned that it starts with the ancient folktales of west africa goes to uncle remus and ends with a survey of todays black drama and poetry by thursday february raymond kent assistant professor of african history had raised his voice in the letters to the ice box column his letter was entiled african black american link rejected although at the time two very pleased african students were students of mine and later took the course for two quarters stating over and over again that because of colonial conditions they had learned more about their african selves in my course than was ever possible in their own homelands mr kent suspected that african students in this country would not welcome links of this kind he further argued that curiously enough the course at merritt is not called black literature but rather afroamerican folklore poetry and drama this conveys that the instructor is teaching certain forms of literary expression which emanate from black americans whether literate or not it is limited to a single culture and language familiar both to the instructor and her students it hence is not predicated on pigment alone as in the case of black literature the term afro is intended to replace black again your readers should know that africa is far from being either uniformly or consistently black it is also meant to connect the black american with africa as a single cultural entity which corresponds to the black subculture in this country etc etc etc ad nauseum to retain my sanity at this point i asked that my class turn inward on itself to get the most from our unique experience with a verboten subject area and instructed that if no one kept such a ridiculous circular illogical argument alive that it would in time die of natural cause and it did more or less die for the remainder of the year it was james baldwin who said people are trapped in history and history is trapped in them how true today i am still entrapped in the cold war being fought in the english department to keep from legitimatizing my expertise in the field of afroamerican literature i must implore you dear reader to have the patience with me that i must have with my adversaries i promise no more digressions i will be direct about a critical analysis of mr littlejohns black on white mr littlejohn feels that novels in the richard wright tradition depend on sadism and brutality which cause the reader to respond with the imaginative equivalent of nausea p he theorizes why this is so behind the sadism and brutality secondly are the sadists and brutes the legions of bitches and boors of near subhuman moral monsters who throng the pages of negro writing detached from its specific nationalracial setting the literature of american negroes may be read as one giant case against man at his worst even the white reader philosophic enough not to identify himself in guilt with these disgusting white human specimens not to read them as personal indictments will see in the genuineness of their portraits a dispiriting swiftian reminder that man at his low point is incredibly vicious and foul it is not a pleasant reminder and negro literature hammers it in p works of richard wright james o killens he must mean the respected novelist john o killens margaret walker introduced in the forties as a poet in the yale series of younger poets and robert hayden winner of the literature award at the first world festival of negro art in dakar senegal were passed off as mere catalogues of white oppression littlejohn says they use the technique of the unrolling of the white mans abuse of the negro in america from the inhuman slave ships and plantations of antebellum days through the lynchings and beatings and brutalization and the stunting economic imprisonment of yesterday and today he blames this literature of the race war with polarizing americans of the warring racesblack and white and he adds this polarization with the implicit assumption of all the suffering by one side and all the guilt by the other is enforced by the frequent and usually unnoticed use of wethey rhetoric in negro writing a usage that presumes the myth and fosters the fact of racial war of we versus they he criticizes james baldwins mixing of the pronouns until even the emotional truth of his rhetoric is corrupted he then states in any case the dogmatic use by negro writers of the warringcamp pronouns helps to enforce in white readers the disturbingly irrational sensation that their hands are on every whip and every touch the habit is not confined to negroes police chief parker of los angeles declared when victory over the watts rioters seemed to be near were on the top now and theyre on the bottom p mr littlejohns historical frame of reference is as confused illogical and inexact as his power of critical analysisat least in the area of what he calls literature of the race war to refresh his memory on the use of war camp pronouns police chief parker is far more american in his usage of the warring camp pronouns than is our ivory tower professor wasnt it abraham lincoln that great emancipator of the black race who at the time advocated expatriation and colonization of the newly freed slaves that made the historical statement which follows you and we are different races we have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races whether it is right or wrong need not discuss but this physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both as i think your race suffers very greatly many of them by living among us while ours suffer from your presence in a word we suffer on each side if this is admitted it affords a reason why we should be separated for the record this statement was made following an altercation by factions of the american society known as the civil war in the polarization of northerners and southerners over the practice of slavery each side solicited black men to engage in battle with each other over their freedom a contemporary of president abraham lincoln usa was one of the giants of black literature that great abolitionist and statesman frederick douglass in narrative of the life o f frederick douglass an american slave published in he eloquently expressed the psychology of master and slave and the effects which such a psychicas well as physicalcondition might have on an individual and a society his writing of well over a century ago created a sensation in its day and spurred on his career as a militant uncompromising leader of his people he rose from bondage to become secretary of the santo domingo commission recorder of deeds in the district of columbia and united states minister to haiti he led a minor rebellion escaped from slavery became a selftaught man contrary to mr littlejohns fact that blacks were illiterate before world war ii all that blacks needed to become publishers of newspapers essayist poets was to have lived the harrowing black experience in america and then live to tell it checking out mr douglasss poem called a parody which is the conclusion of the book one finds that it has a whole lotsa soul much insight about reality and truth again please note that in a book about negro writing mr douglass has a onepage reference as opposed to william faulkners understandably i have a difference of opinion with respect to mr douglasss works which mr littlejohn dismissesone fell sweepalong with the works of james weldon johnson and booker t washingtonas follows i would make no claim for any of these as literature the douglass and johnson works are fat detailed episodic memoirs of the usual unliterary sort mr douglass would not be perturbed by this he anticipates the littlejohns who fathered him enslaved him tortured him who surrounded him and would keep coming on down through the centuries menacingly using the diction of the bible the only book a slave could learn to read from under threat of death his words are no less true today the christianity of america is a christianity of whose votaries it may be as truly said as it was of the ancient scribes and pharisees they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on mens shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers all their works they do for to be seen of menthey love the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues woe unto you scribes and phari sees hypocrites for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness dark and terrible as is this picture i hold it to be strictly true of the overwhelming mass of professed christians in america they strain at a gnat and swallow a camel it will not be necessary for me to attempt to establish a name for mr douglass his life is his glory even an innocuous and generally irrelevant magazine like life had his wise black visage on the november cover in an attempt at revisionist recording of the true american experiencethat is for those americans who are ready for this the truth i mean glimpse of truth is completely overshadowed by its surrounding diatribe in such a critical analysis the titles of the chapters are before native son the dark ages before native son the renaissance and after negro writers today the novelist i negro writers today the novelist ii conclusion and index the conclusions and index comprise an additional pages i have discussed the illogical and dishonest nature of the index which outlines the geography of the totally irrelevant body of the work as it relates to understanding black literature the value in a book of this sort is the revelation of the nature of the psychopathic pseudointellectual mind which has dominated the thinking in the western world even the simplemindedness of the titles of chapters tells the truly informed much more than a small mind could envision of one of the giants in black literatureand american literature also if it were knownrichard wright who by the way authored the landmark novel native son which served as a chronological pivot for mr littlejohn mr littlejohn says in what he must assume to be a poetical idiom an infant crying in the night an infant crying for the light and with no language but a cry p julian mayfields the hit is called a small strangely airy family tragedy it is about a little negro building superintendent his little dream is deferred p of pulitzer prize winner and poet laureate of illinois gwendolyn brooks work maud martha referred to as one of the handsomest small novels by american negroes mr littlejohn says in tiny fragments vignettes tiny moments in passage the reader skims into the life of maud martha it is a powerful beautiful dagger of a book a womanly book as generous as it can possibly be it teaches more more quickly more lastingly than a thousand pages of protest pp of langston hughes mr littlejohn says that he is as skillful and durable a storyteller as he is poet a master at the ironic little social comedies of negro life he is lesser than ellison or baldwin only because his scope is so much smaller not because his work is cheaper or less complete pp of willard motley and others in the school of wright he dismisses their work of the forties as material james baldwin the dramatist mr littlejohn feels wrote blues for mister charlie as an attempt to give white people an inferiority problem he calls it an essay in artless bullying not a play and since a play is about words and actions which underscore and dramatize these words mr littlejohn lowers the big boom by saying the play betrays serious imaginative disability and the dialogue for the most part is hopeless faked banter faked poetry doctrinaire racism dated slang all conflated with artificial violence and obscenity p this in spite of the fact that it was based on a real life lynching of a black young man taking place in the present day among socalled civilized christianized democratic citizens of the usa where law and order is violently and unjustly dispensed to the victims of an oppressive racist society mr baldwin in his notes for blues explains his impetus and concerns about writing protest drama admitting that at first he was unwilling to risk my morale and my talentmy lifein endeavors which could only increase a level of frustration already dangerously high however in fully explaining the impetus for writing this essential drama he said lorraine hansberrys a raisin in the sun new york drama critics award as a conventional socialrealist drama the short story of an embattled negro family in chicagos black belt and their small unsatisfied dreams p is mr littlejohn having pronoun trouble shouldnt that be familyits and not their as opposed to our great american dream i suppose mr littlejohn in his little way approves in some small way the talent of mr davis he makes the following comments mr davis composed the worddrunken part of reverend purlie to suit his own exuberant talents godfrey cambridge one of the best new negro comedians took the part of a classic twofaced uncle tom who sings slavery songs to his master the fact that so healthfully doubleedged a takeoff on racial oppression and the civil_rights struggle could be written and produced in one of the surest signs of the maturity of negro art every sugary deep south lie every hoary delusion and institution is deftly mocked in the play its white folks are all patent fools this is clearly a negroes show for negroes to laugh at the jokes are all theirs he says but white viewers too if they are ready for it can relish its sanity p gosh mr littlejohns pronoun confusion which is clearly racewar oriented really is about to confuse my good clear sane black mind leroi jones the dutchman obieoff broadwayaward for was described thusly it may be the most important imaginative literary document of the american race war since native son and it works the dialogue is almost perfect of mr jones the toilet which takes place in the little john of a city high school he says the plays major strength lies in its sense of menace of the slave he says it is a blatant unmodulated scream of racial abuse its primary purpose one assumes was authorial selfgratification pp of the author of black mans burden and the screen play odds against tomorrow he says james oliver killens has written two long detailed humorless artless almost documentary race novels youngblood and and then we heard the thunder the first is a sort of negro family epic the expected tale of two generations of longsuffering blacks and their sadistic white masters in a georgia town the second tells the interminable story of negroes and whites in wartime where the ordeal of world war ii seems less harrowing in the long run than the race war inside it p killens who is generously placed in the school of wright described as the most celebrated of the second rank heads the list of writers of the angry novels which are described as symptoms rather than examinations of the race war mr littlejohn says of these they are weapons like rockfilled mudballs they are aimed from the negro fort into the white fort in the hope of wounding or at least splattering some of its inhabitants p yes we are detecting a circular motion that brings us back where we started as ellison has said of invisible man in the end is my beginning and in the beginning my end perhaps we should end with mr littlejohns appraisal of ellisons talents he lauds ellison for having the most closely focused review of the negros story in america he calls it a shorthand history and sociology of the american negro among the couples tattered scrambled effects cast out on the street are artefacts and mementoes from every stage of the american negro past minstrel show bones voodoonuggets an ethiopian flag a tintype of lincoln a picture of a banjostrumming blackfaced white man a yellowing headline of garveys deportation a hollywood pinup a st louis fair plate and a set of manumission papers dated august p as testimonials to ellisons art mr littlejohn mentions the fine texture of his style his manipulative skill in handling language character event design and to move to items of slightly larger focus the fullest sense of drama he says his rhetorical skill is prodigious and he is not reticent about displaying its range not only does he indulge himself in perfect mimicry of the tall tale the emotioncharged address word display and makes his heros hold on history a way with words a gift of tongues an awesome and dangerous eloquence like his own p in describing a chapter entitled out of the hospital and under the bar which was excluded from the novel but published in soon one morning mr littlejohns description sounds almost appropos for ed bullins inspiration for the electronic nigger here the hero after his disastrous explosion at liberty paints is imprisoned in an antiseptic glass case and operated on by voices and white hands which rearrange his brain and identity with electric devices a negro maid a wonderful woman helps him to escape into underground passages as psychological as they are architectural p after much quibbling mr littlejohn assigns ellison a place in the tradition of great american novelists like hawthorne and faulkner rather than among the new negroes he says he is not up there of course but i see no reason not to assign him a placeeven for one unbalanced bookat least in the high second rank p woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites frederick douglass shook his head in patience humility disbelief they strain at the gnat and swallow a camel as you might suspect i feel that any conclusions reached by mr littlejohn in the field of afroamerican or black literature are inconclusive to say the least even for the white reader they are totally irrelevant and ridiculous for the black reader i would like to call attention to his criticism misplaced again as cause rather than effect that most negroes are too unhappy about their racial identity to be able to celebrate the life of their people he lowrates black people in general and black writers in particular for wanting to deny their people wanting to become white in face to adopt white values to assimilate he instructs black readers and writers it is one thing to want to be free it is quite another and sick to want to be a different color it makes for neurosis not for art but america all of it goes on hating blackness fosters the neurosis and holds off the day of a true negro art this of course is a halftruth but he obviously does not realize the heads or tails of the turth also how can he believe this then protest the black students militant demand to be able to study black literature by stating as he did last winter in the daily californian that such courses as black literature african sculpture and other courses which attempt to establish or rather invent a heritage for black students would be pandering to the needs of the students a great truth is evidenced in mr littlejohns critical analysis and fortunately it is addressedeven then in a wrongheaded wayto the white reader he warns that a proper reading an honest evaluation will be the hardest task of alland the most liberating he remarks that it is all too morally easy to grovel to cringe beneath the lash not all the history of racial oppression in america should be allowed to paralyze the moral sensibility the critical faculty the ability even of white men to discriminate or the war has indeed been lost to read with a sharp gidean conscience ever awake monitoring regulating correcting to resist the unfair imposition the bullying intimidation but to acknowledge too to accept and heed the insults that are deserved this is the way to read the literature of war and it is the better works one finds that require the most total selfexaminations the most radical selfsurgery pp afroamerica has a culture afroamerica has a language afroamerica has a literature karl shapiro currently teaching at the university of california at davis wrote a few years ago an article entitled the decolonization of american literature he argued for a broad inclusion of literatures and visionsblacks whites inbetweenswhich more nearly tell us the shape of the world in which we live mr shapiro reminds us that literature is an accurate transcription of the quality of thought and feeling of the writer and his people a great literature leaves nothing outthat is its greatness but to leave nothing out means to go against the grain it means to dissent afroamerican literature is a great literature just as afroamerican music is great american music and literature are greatly enriched by the creative talents of black americans black awareness black love black pride black protest black_power black revolution demand of the american conscience the most total selfexaminations the most radical selfsurgery and is the only way to heal our history and overcome the problem of the color line which w e b du bois recognized at the turn of the century as the problem of the twentieth century and which many decades later the social scientist gunnar myrdal described as the american dilemma the university of california at berkeleywhere ironically mr littlejohn and i were serving as instructors and where angry black students and angry whites are clamoring for reforms in our educational systems and are demanding an end to institutionalized racism which has crippled the american dreamcan serve as a laboratory and a forum whereby the race war the problem the dilemma can be truly critically examined and remediedor it can continue to be the battle ground the expected opposition to the concept of a black aesthetic was not long in coming in separate reviews of black fire an anthology edited by leroi jones and larry neal critics from the saturday review and the new york review of books presented the expected rebuttal agreeing with ralph ellison that sociology and art are incompatible mates these critics nevertheless invoked the cliches of the social ideology of the we shall overcome years in their attempt to steer blacks from the path of literary fantasy and folly their major thesis is simple there is no black aesthetic because there is no white aesthetic the kerner commission report to the contrary america is not two societies but one therefore americans of all races colors and creeds share a common cultural heredity this is to say that there is one predominant culturethe american culturewith tributary national and ethnic streams flowing into ture the duct of the larger river literamost important byprothis cultural moonolith knows no parochial boundaries to speak of a black literature a black aesthetic or a black state is to engage in racial chauvinism separatist bias and black fantasy the question of a white aesthetic however is academic one has neither to talk about it nor define it most americans white accept the existence white aesthetic as naturally as they accept april th as the deadline for paying their income tax with far less animosity towards the former than the latter the white aesthetic despite the academic critics has always been with us for long before diotima pointed out the way to heavenly beauty to socrates the poets of biblical times were discussing beauty in terms of light and darkthe essential characteristics of a white and black aestheticand establishing the dichotomy of superior vs inferior which would assume body and form in the th century therefore more serious than a definition is the problem of tracing the white aesthetic from its early origins and afterwards outlining the various changes in the basic formula from culture to culture and from nation to nation such an undertaking would be more germane to a book than an essay nevertheless one may take a certain starting point and using selective nations and cultures make the critical point while calling attention to the necessity of a more comprehensive study encompassing all of the nations and cultures of the world let us propose greece as the logical starting point bearing in mind will durants observation that all of western civilization is but a footnote to plato and take plato as the first writer to attempt a systematic aesthetic two documents by plato the symposium and the republic reveal the twin components of platos aesthetic system in the symposium plato divides the universe into spheres in one sphere the lower one finds the forms of beauty in the other the higher beauty as diotima tells socrates is absolute and supreme in the republic plato defines the poet as an imitator a thirdrate imitatora point which modern critics have long since forgotten who reflects the heavenly beauty in the earthly mirror in other words the poet recreates beauty as it exists in heaven thus the poet as neoplatonists from aquinas to coleridge have told us is the custodian of beauty on earth however plato defines beauty only in ambiguous mystical terms leaving the problem of a more circumscribed secular definition to philosophers poets and critics during most of the history of the western world these aestheticians have been white therefore it is not surprising that symbolically and literally they have defined beauty in terms of whiteness an early contradiction to this tendency is the marquis desade who inverted the symbols making black beautiful but demonic and white pure but sterilethe marquis is considered by modern criticism to have been mentally deranged the distinction between whiteness as beautiful good and blackness as ugly evil appears early in the literature of the middle agesin the morality plays of england heavily influenced by both platonism and christianity these plays set forth the distinctions which exist today to be white was to be pure good universal and beautiful to be black was to be impure evil parochial and ugly the characters and the plots of these plays followed this basic format the villain is always evil in most cases the devil the protagonist or hero is always good in most cases angels or disciples the plot then is simple good light triumphs over the forces of evil dark as english literature became more sophisticated the symbols were made to cover wider areas of the human and literary experience to love was divine to hate evil the fancied mistress of petrarch was the purest of the pure grendels mother a creature from the lower regions and marshes is like her son a monster the bad characters in chaucers canterbury tales tell dark stories and the satan of paradise lost must be vanquished by gabriel the angel of purity these ancients as swift might have called them established their dichotomies as a result of the influences of neoplatonism and christianity later the symbols became internationalized robert burton in the anatomy of melancholy writes of dark despair in the seventeenth century and james boswell describes melancholia that state of mind common to intellectuals of the th and th centuries as a dark dreaded affliction which robbed men of their creative energies this conditiondark despair or melancholiawas later popularized in what is referred to in english literature as its dark periodthe period of the grave yard school of poets and the gothic novels the symbols thus far were largely applied to conditions although characters who symbolized evil influences were also dark in the early stages of english literature these characters were mythological and fictitious and not representative of people of specific racial or ethnic groups in the th century english novel however the symbolism becomes ethnic and racial there were forerunners as early as shakespeare has lago refer to othello as that old black ewe attaching the mystical sexual characteristic to blackness which would become the motive for centuries of oppressive acts by white americans in the tempest shakespeares last play caliban though not ostensibly black is nevertheless a distant cousin of the colonial friday in daniel defoes robinson crusoe robinson crusoe was published at a historically significant time in the year the english had all but completed their colonization of africa the slave trade in america was on its way to becoming a booming industry in africa black people were enslaved men tally as well as physically by such strange bedfellows as criminals businessmen and christians in the social and political spheres a rationale was needed and help came from the artistin this case the novelistin the form of robinson crusoe in the novel defoe brings together both christian and platonic symbolism sharpening the dichotomy between light and dark on the one hand while on the other establishing a criterion for the inferiority of black people as opposed to the superiority of white one need only compare crusoe with friday to validate both of these statements crusoe is majestic wise white and a colonialist friday is savage ignorant black and a colonial therefore crusoe the colonialist has a double task on the one hand he must transform the island africaunproductive barren dead into a little england prosperous lifegiving fertile and he must recreate friday in his own image thus bringing him close to being an englishman as possible at the end of the novel crusoe has accomplished both undertakings the island is a replica of mother england and friday has been transformed into a white man now capable of immigrating to the land of the gods from such mystical artifacts has the literature and criticism of the western world sprung and based upon such narrow prejudices as those of defoe the art of black people throughout the world has been described as parochial and in ferior friday was parochial and inferior until having denounced his own culture he assimilated another once this was done symbolically friday underwent a change to deal with him after the conversion was to deal with him in terms of a character who had been civilized and therefore had moved beyond racial parochialism however defoe was merely a hack novelist not a thinker it was left to shrewder minds than his to apply the rules of the white aesthetic to the practical areas of the black literary and social worlds and no shrewder minds were at work on this problem than those of writers and critics in america in america the rationale for both slavery and the inferiority of black art and culture was supplied boldly without the trappings of th century symbolism in in a book entiled nojoque a question for a continent hinton helper provided the vehicle for the cultural and social symbols of inferiority under which blacks have labored in this country helper intended as he states frankly in his preface to write the negro out of america in the headings of the two major chapters of the book the whole symbolic apparatus of the white aesthetic handed down from plato to america is graphically revealed the heading of one chapter reads black a thing of ugliness disease another heading reads white a thing of life health and beauty under the first heading helper argues that the color black has always been associated with sinister things such as mourning the devil the darkness of night under the second white has always been associated with the light of day divine transfiguration the beneficent moon and stars the fair complexion of romantic ladies the costumes of romans and angels and the white of the american flag so beautifuly combined with blue and red without ever a touch of the black that has been for the flag of pirates such is the american critical ethic based upon centuries of distortion of the platonic ideal by not adequately defining beauty and implying at least that this was the job of the poet plato laid the foundation for the white aesthetic as defined by daniel defoe and hinton helper however the uses of that aesthetic to stifle and strangle the cultures of other nations is not to be attributed to plato but instead to his hereditary brothers far from the aegean for plato knew his poets they were not he surmised a very trusting lot and therefore by adopting an ambiguous position on symbols he limited their power in the realm of aesthetics for plato there were two kinds of symbols natural and proscriptive natural symbols corresponded to absolute beauty as created by god proscriptive symbols on the other hand were symbols of beauty as proscribed by man which is to say that certain symbols are said to mean such and such by man himself the irony of the trap in which the black artist has found himself throughout history is apparent those symbols which govern his life and art are proscriptive ones set down by minds as diseased as hinton helpers in other words beauty has been in the eyes of an earthly beholder who has stipulated that beauty conforms to such and such a definition to return to friday defoe stipulated that civilized man was what friday had to become proscribed certain characteristics to the term civilized and presto friday in order not to be regarded as a savage under western eyes was forced to conform to this ideal how well have the same stipulative definitions worked in the artistic sphere masterpieces are made at will by each new critic who argues that the subject of his doctoral dissertation is immortal at one period of history john donne according to the critic samuel johnson is a second rate poet at another period according to the critic t s eliot he is one of the finest poets in the language dickens argues professor ada nisbet is one of englands most representative novelists while for f r leavis dickens work does not warrant him a place in the great tradition when black literature is the subject the verbiage reaches the height of the ridiculous the good negro novel we are told by robert bone and herbert hill is that novel in which the subject matter moves beyond the limitations of narrow parochialism form is the most important criterion of the work of art when black literature is evaluated whereas form almost nonexistent in dostoyevskys crime and punishment and totally chaotic in kafkas the trial must take second place to the supremacy of thought and message richard wright says theodore gross is not a major american novelist while ralph ellison on the strength of one novel is leroi jones is not a major poet ed bullins not a major playwright baldwin incapable of handling the novel formall because white critics have said so behind the symbol is the object or vehicle and behind the vehicle is the definition it is the definition with which we are concerned for the extent of the cultural strangulation of black literature by white critics has been the extent to which they have been allowed to define the terms in which the black artist will deal with his own experience the career of paul laurence dunbar is the most striking example having internalized the definitions handed him by the american society dunbar would rather not have written about the black ex perience at all and three of his novels and most of his poetry support this argument however when forced to do so by his white liberal mentors among them was the powerful critic william dean howells dunbar deals with blacks in terms of buffoonery idiocy and comedy like so many black writers past and present dunbar was trapped by the definitions of other men never capable of realizing until near the end of his life that those definitions were not godgiven but mangiven and so circumscribed by tradition and culture that they were irrelevant to an evaluation of either his life or his art in a literary conflict involving christianity zarathustra friedrich nietzsches iconoclast calls for a new table of the laws in similar iconoclastic fashion the proponents of a black aesthetic the idol smashers of america call for a set of rules by which black literature and art is to be judged and evaluated for the historic practice of bowing to other mens gods and definitions has produced a crisis of the highest magnitude and brought us culturally to the limits of racial armegeddon the trend must be reversed the acceptance of the phrase black is beautiful is the first step in the destruction of the old table of the laws and the construction of new ones for the phrase flies in the face of the whole ethos of the white aesthetic this step must be followed by serious scholarship and hard work and black critics must black experienceregions where dig beneath the phrase and unearth others due to historical conditionthe treasure of beauty lying deep ing and cultural deprivation canin the untoured regions of the not go then we intellectually its consider the idea of a vv black aesthetics we v rm need not look to aris xqnnsh totean academes or white western artistic qualifiers we need not be preoccupied with classical dramatic unities or traditional plot and character development we need not submit ourselves to the arbitrary classes of absurdist impressionist surrealist naturalist or other available labels m t which have absorbed new dimensions in american dramaturgy we need not in search of a black aesthetics we need only to look to ourselves we must probe the depths of the black soul and unleash the wild wings of the black spirit its flight will lead us forever onward and upward to a greater aesthetic appreciation of the free black spirit the aesthetics of black art come from within it is the internal made external for within the creative psyche of the black artist who must be deep into the reality of his own existence is born the essence of black aesthetics from its union with community it is thus the internal consciousness of the black artist from whence come the sole standard if you will of his art black artists must not look for absolute external aesthetic criteria for selfexpression for that forced objectivity negates a fundamental aspect of creativitythe self instead he must view his art from within the total spirituality of his blackness and create new forms and new standards which offer a truer reflection of himself and his art in theater the thrust of aesthetics is the drama of the black experience it derives its energy from black lifestyles and exerts a positive force toward the dramatic perpetuation of that life it redefines the theater process into an arena of selfawareness selfdirection selfcriticism in relation to the entire black community it is a marriage of the self and the community whose child is art as such black theater fosters a great festival of blackness where new doors are opened new directions forgedand new aesthetics developed from the dark continent of the progressive black being it is indeed intellectually satisfying to expound upon the ideologies of a black aesthetics but the total grasp of such knowledge is missed if the intellectual aesthetics renders itself impotent in practical application the viability then of a black aesthetics or the art of black life can only be appreciated in the truest sense by its function it must live it must live on the streets as well as reside in secluded ivycovered minds the viability or the living of a black aesthetics in theater rests in a total liberation from a white or negro mentality to an artistic awareness of the beauty of black activity it is functional active alivefor a true black aesthetics lives in every black man it walks talks eats and sleeps with every black man it is the essence of black existence it is the soul a black aesthetics can never function in theater unless there is a conscious living black we as black artists in theater must explore every speech pattern every physical movement every psychological crisis of a black existence in white america we must know the indigenous art of black life completely so as to be able to use that uninhibited style as the artistic impetus to a dramatic presentation of the black experience otherwise there can never be a black theater reflective of black life or black people we must combine all phases of theater divisions into a communal direction towards the development of an afroamerican theater tradition its product is a merger of the black actor playwright director and audience in a common quest for a total liberation to a cultural and political identity free at last from the rusty chains of western aesthetics the castrated black actor in what is conveniently referred to today as american theater must regain his artistic masculinity he must emancipate himself from the auction block of commercial theater and hollywood glamour once free physically and most important mentally he then can utilize in a new theater perspective aspects of black life eg movement speech character these new techniques that are characteristic of black people become one important foundation for the building of a black aesthetics in theater the black actor no longer acts or imitates he lives he lives blackly his mind and body are stripped of the facade of broadway professionalism and left naked to discover the mysterious essence of his stark black existence he is free from current theatrical restrictions to think black and thus give birth to a true black art which is an essential and a living part of his existence as a black man the black actor is liberated from an artistic colonial mentality to that of an independent creator once liberated he serves primarily as a liberator he is a messenger to the community he then in turn liberates the community to a significant cultural and political awareness essential to the freedom of all black people the messenger communicates the message which is the revolutionary philosophy of the playwright his literature is the prophecy that heralds the creation of a black artistic medium as the only form which fully expresses the aesthetic truth of black life the playwright is a sculptor who com bines various aspects of black life into a soft fertile clay and molds the spiritual essence of the black experience into a solid living structure impervious to the intrusion of white exploiters the playwright has created now he must communicate as a black artist he directs himself to the black community to which he is both educator and student as educator the playwright teaches his people the glory of black heroes the resolution of social problems and the art of community politics he exposes the flaws of black society to foster internal reform he praises black accomplishments to instill hope and ambition he proclaims black beauty to show forth pride in being black he teaches his people about themselves in order that they may appreciate their blackness as a unique blessing the theater then becomes a great ritual of ethnic identity and ethnic worth as student the black playwright looks to his community as a source of material he must learn about himself in relation to his people in order to provide a true representation of black life the playwright learns from the people he chooses to portray thus the black community dictates the technique he must use to effectively relate to that community black people as a collective body will dictate the form and content of black drama and in r the end they will judge the artistic merit of the playwright as his art speaks for the people and himself the black community at large is both the source and the critic of the black playwright it is clear that the community as a collective society is the center of black aesthetics in our quest for a functional application of a black aesthetics in theater and the devejr opment of an afroamerican theater tradition we must look first to the black community therein lie the souls of black folk therein lies the beauty of black life as reflected by black people therein lies the black aesthetics a functional viable black aes thetics grows from an alliance of the artist with the community the artist and his audience become one in search of the spiritual truth of blackness in a righteous effort to create an indigenous black art a living theater a living aesthetics though we may al come from god where n we decide to take ourselves is what we eventually become though we change at the moment of decision thereby making if one talks of america morality a matter of strengthand distortion of the natural world sin at its vilest the lie with which we whip others in line and with which we kidnap our senses that is why the blues is the most important art form ever produced in america ever possibly in the west because it has the big feeling as john lee hooker says it broke past the lie became rudely vulgar in its exposition of w truth spit in the face of venus de milo the armless bitch incapable of the embrace stumbled through the flung lye of loneliness so often scalded walking barefoot in the glassstrewn alleys of anguish maimed by memories suffering the treason against the self which is called sentimentality but at the end with its tongue hanging out in love dunt you want to rock or got a good rocking mama and the way she rock is all right that is the final specificity of feeling and of life the woman reached or wished forand say babe dont you remember me that is the blues to me means no one is crushed if he or she can summon the strength to understand what has happened which is identity therefore b b king need not be threatened by white musicians he knows who he is and knows as we all must as long as youve got black people youll have the blues the truth that nothing is easier to carry than the lie for the moment we diminish our adversaries we diminish ourselves there is no other way to look at it and neither black artists nor black people can afford purely in the arena of personal growth to do this for that the turning of other lives to ideas that perpetuate fantasy is where the white man has been as long as we can read or remember backward r f the heaviest growls the biggest truths always come together to make the strongest art forms and i believe that the blues or rhythm and blues as popular art forms amongst black people have kept us sane as a mass as opposed to the maudlin weeping of a white folk form like country and western musicthough both musics the folk black and the folk white deal with the same areas of challenge death natural disaster and anguish but white men crumble and end up shooting people from bell towers because their arts have not prepared them for the pressurecooker of living which burns or purifies but to get way down in it the fantasy which america suckles like a synthetic breast is created by the fact that the country is controlled by faggots and dykes from ymca toilets in washington to hollywood to broadway to fashion circles they who must reorder the world because they are not and can never be that which they would want to be hence the abstractions the trail pulled from struggle to the salivating desire for instant change as lsd not too long ago made for instant spirituality as though god could so easily be hidden in a chemical lsd and indians anything other than what one is which leads to whowhom you are we as black people need none of this for most often we seek not instant life change nor insulation but merely a vessel from which to express that which we know to be true bullshit notwithstanding all men come forward with equal internal chances but the fags and dykes would have us believe otherwise that human reality is subjective and freedom but a state of mind those ideas oh so useful because they themselves are some place else their minds are perpetually in pursuit of the alteration the reordering of what is naturally placed forward hence aggression vietnam dead jack and bobby kennedy slaughters on the wholesale of black people as the most natural must be done away with and controlled first or fashions wherein women are made to look like men which cools out the faggotsand we know the dykes dig it we should want total truth and realize ourselves as fools if we wish otherwise we must seek to understand all levels of living must be strong as nothing black people have ever created in this country or elsewhere has ever been easy the only instants ever were fear and death creation always took time and understanding even more than that which is why black artists must seek the inner workings of every possible thing their eyes ears and senses can find for the redeeming qualities are those which a personor a peoplewould have whether or not the place was america africa or alaska that is say black women are not beautiful because other women are not but simply because they are things must be seen that way or one ends up having something by default which is there can be no doubt the rankest way to look at the world all possibilities of heroism and growth are eliminated because the measure against which one compares his legs are ricketturned and eaten with sores from the start and one can thereby just walk on to the finish line very cool let us say then this man would be good whether all other men were rotten or all other men were good false gods called ourselves are not necessary are never necessary as clear vision for it is only the insecure who need to shout down all other voices to be heard since the strongest thing will stand up anyway and i will never say that the white man is responsible for my possibilities my strengths prowess or ideas me no ill never give him that much credit i would be whatever i am if i were a south american indian whod never heard of america can you dig that now to get down to further business the thing at hand there may though may is almost idealistic come the time when we will have to kill people and it must always be understood that its people were killing not ideas fantasy abstractions nor even our wishes that part of ourselves we would like to be but destroy so that we will not more fully pursue that illusion as long as we know those policemen those mayors and even presidents we may have to do away with in selfdefense long as we know they are men and yes have wives families lovers as long as we know those things murder in defense of whatever possible vision is humane for it is when men become abstractions that the land of the soul is inflamed and any evil is possible and even the most cursory thumbing through of the white mans history will show that his greatest failing has been his inability to accept the humanity of those whom he murdered to accept that responsibility which is where all those funny names come from polacks niggers jerries chinks japs redskins etc and the tools the ideas the mentalities and responsibilities or fear of them which are involved in the overthrowing of a system are the building blocks of that which will follow the smoke so we must be very much together internally to truly come up with something different we must be on the move for as leroi jones says love not bloodhounds sniffing the tracks of a misshapen world whose tenets and buildings are but caricatures of our real power the presence of self of spirit nowadays when attention is so sharply turned on the black creative writer as prophet and analyst of the black soul and psyche the recent book black expression weybright and talley edited by addison gayle jr provides a kind of counterbalance which helps to bring the whole matter into better perspective it is becoming harder and harder to live in isolation from our own literature black literature has of course been going on all the time but there was a time when black people werent encouraged to be particularly aware of it perhaps in the james baldwin of the fifties in the leroi jones of the sixties we can trace the current movement of affirmation in which more and more black writers seem bent on making the black reader aware that his life through art is captured in all its fullness and preserved so that he may savor it and be shocked by it even so the contemporary reader is frequently unaware that that whole other body of writingthe critical apparatus which must accompany artistic endeavorexists and exists from the pens of black men this is exactly the point black expression makes addison gayle jr has collected in this work a very large number of essays from various sources and fashioned them into a neat comprehensive volume the essays represent work published as early as web du bois and langston hughes five of the essays were written especially for black expression the established recognized men of black letters are to be found here web du bois alain locke sterling a brown arna bontemps j saunders redding the writers themselves are included langston hughes margaret walker richard wright james baldwin ralph ellison leroi jones black scholars who will be active in the shape of things to come are here john henrik clarke james a emanuel addison gayle jr there are others writers critics popularizers whose names are not so well known but who have or had a sincere commitment to the fortunes of black literature in america the book contains a preface and an index the preface examines at length the peculiar position of the black critic and what his role should be and puts forth the thesis that understanding black poets depends not only on knowledge of american literature as some white critics may presumptuously declare but also on a critical perspective conditioned by the manyfaceted experiences of the negro in the turbulent american society the essays themselves there are forty of them are divided into four categories folk culture poetry drama and fiction the inclusion of a section on folk culture can be perhaps justified on the basis that the oral tradition constitutes literature as well as the written however the reader will probably find that this section stands somewhat apart from the rest the section on poetry is quite complete the entire history of black poetry is there dudley randalls essay black poetry rounds out the picture by speaking at length of the revolutionary black poets of today the section on drama is perhaps the most exciting gyrating as it does between commerciallyoriented theater and black revolutionary theater the reader must conjure up in his imagination on the one hand the large whiterun whitepatronized whiteoriented movie houses and broadway musicals the minstrel shows which preceded them and on the other work in the black communities by and for black people traditionally harlem but also more recently watts and san francisco california and newark new jersey compare for instance this passage from jessie fausets article that laughter for which we are so justly famed has had in late years its overtones of pain now for some time past it has been used by colored men who have gained a precarious footing on the stage to conceal the very real dolar raging in their breasts to be by force of circumstances the most dramatic figure in a country to be possessed of the wells of feeling of the most spontaneous instinct for effective action and to be shunted no less always into the role of the ridiculous and funnythat is enough to create the quality of bitterness for which we are ever so often rebuked with the following from k william kgositsiles towards our theater a definitive act we will finally be coming to grips with where we are really at historically we will be destroying the symbols which have facilitated our captivity we will be creating and establishing symbols to facilitate our necessary constant beginning old decadent wouldbe black woman this theater will straighten out your mind instead of your hair the last and largest section on fiction deals with various things the novel the essay and the intangibles of attitude aesthetics and destiny the amount of research and organization necessary in putting together such a volume should not be underestimated however one would have hoped for better editorship in one or two areas the most perturbing aspect is the absence of publication dates for a significant number of the essays a chronological ordering is especially important in the field of black letters due to the accelerated character of its development in the twentieth century when one comes across these words by langston hughes but to my mind it is the duty of the younger negro artist if he accepts any duties at all from outsiders to change through the force of his art that old whispering i want to be white hidden in the aspirations of his people to why should i want to be white i am a negroand beautiful if one realizes that they were first published in then one understands that the younger artist is hughes himself and not his younger brothers of the sixties who may indeed express the same sentiments though in more militant style and one would understand instantly if one had not up till then why dudley randall can state elsewhere in the volume that hughes in the midsixties was still holding his finger to the pulse of the times there is it is true at the beginning of the book copyright information on most of the essays and by referring constantly to these pages the reader can most of the time determine when an essay was first published however as if by some ghoulish prank it is precisely in those essays lacking copyright information that we come across such phrases as for some time now recently in late years currently wallace thurman and jessie fauset are especially frustrating in this respect there is here and there the need for clarification in the form of an editors footnote we need to know something about the amsac writers conference to which julian mayfield refers in his article this is important as the conference apparently provided the impetus for the article the preface makes much of the fact that black critics are the invisible men of black letters the whole reason for the books existence is presumably to remedy this it is not clear from the books subtitle essays by and about black americans in the creative arts that we are dealing exclusively with a collection of black writers this is something the reader will probably ascertain by prior knowledge and inference as he gets further into the book but confusion however momentary could be avoided by a very short footnote at the beginning of each essay giving the date of publication and some information about the author and would greatly enhance the books handiness and tighten its organization admittedly some of these men need no introduction but there are others here who are not necessarily familiar to the general reader these weaknesses are more than compensated for by the richness variety and scope of the essays themselves one of the beauties of the volume is that it will immerse the conscientious reader in the world of black literary criticism and will do it not within the rigid confines of the programmed syllabus but gradually and leisurely it must be admitted that some of the essays will sting and irk some readers because some of them are bound to reflect an attitude about blackness which is odious to him therefore if you like james baldwin you must prepare yourself for eldridge cleavers essay which decimates him if you feel that acceptance into the mainstream or the negros contribution to american letters is of no relevance then several essays including margaret walkers new poets may vex you if you pride yourself on your deep reverence for black american literature then leroi jones essay which probably should be more specific in its charges will exasperate you writers themselves may understandably take offense at nick aaron fords blueprint for negro authors writers presumably know how to make their own blueprints all of the essays are not of the same quality and there are some contradictions for instance arthur huff fauset and sterling a brown will instruct you differently as to the existence of the rabbit in african folklore and addison gayle jr in his preface gives a picture of frank yerby very much different from the one given by nick aaron ford all these different opinions and the reactions they may provoke in the reader do no more than point to a strong feature of the book it is not slanted toward any one school or period of black criticism there is every shape of article here the richly informative reportage of ernest kaiser the literature of harlem the reminiscing tone in arna bontemps negro poets then and now one cannot help but be aware of the scholarships behind james a emanuels interesting comments in the future of negro poetry a challenge for critics as opposed to the downright antischolarly and negative attitude of wallace thurman in negro poets and their poetry there is also the sensitive perception beautifully expressed of the artist himself as in the case of ralph ellisons richard wrights blues certain essays are enjoyable not only for what they bring to our understanding of literaturenathan a scott jrs essay on richard wright contains a wealth of allusions to the american and european traditions in generalbut also the light they throw directly or indirectly on other aspects of the black experience addison gayles own essay perhaps not so soon one morning will be of special interest to teachers for it deals with one black instructors attempt to introduce black literature to students for the most part black and puerto rican and the reader cannot help but be encouraged by the rewarding experience his perseverance brought to those students the reader venturing into black expression penetrates into a world where black literary expression can be studied but more importantly where it can be experienced through all its manifestations and in the entire length of its american history the reader is invited into this world by men and women who have that kind of relaxed acquaintance the writers they deal with if you are at all interested in black literaavailable only to those who share the heritage and the experiences of ture you must read this bookcarolyn gerald anita followed her a movements in the bu j reau mirror as she deftly applied pink lipstick to the full cupids bow of her mouth then pausing she gazed critically back at her reflection the offshoulder black cocktail dress fitted snugly over her round curved hips while the white pearl necklace and earrings set off the creamy tan of her skin she decided that she looked very chic and smart im sorry you wont go with me claude she said turning now to the man seated at a makeshift card table desk in the comer of the bedroom i got more important things to do he grumbled sullenly bent over the mound of papers a frown wrinkled tiny delicate lines between her widespaced eyes as she stared long at him sometimeslike nowhe looked so forbidding to her with all that fierce black hair worn stiff and high and long bushy hair growing down his dark brown face into sideburns which ended in an entangled brush of beard with all that hair covering his face and arching above the thick full lips he looked like a black samson a black samson who needed hair to give him his manstrength she sighed reaching to struggle her fingers one by one into the white linen gloves you never go anyplace with me anymore not since he had gotten so wrapped up in the movement the movement almost an obsession with him now he lit a cigarette from the crumpled pack of larks on the table flicking the match into the already overflowing ash tray i got better things to do right now the movement the movement she almost shouted at him thats all you think about hell i believe in the movement too but christ i cant live the movement im also an individualist a person not just a negro person i cant eat sleep and go to the toilet with civil_rights and hating the white man with each breath i take i cant submerge the fact that i also like to have fun once in a while i like to enjoy a good book not soused with racism listen to pretty music valk in the park and admire the natural green of the grass and blue of the sky i like to look up at the strength of the trees growing high and i like to look down and gaze into the coolness of a spring brook i like to see and do those things as a person without their being marred all the time by hating and thinking about the white man she stopped feeling out of breath like the words had drained her slowly she went over to him caressing his haid broad back outlined in the colorful summer african shirt with geometric patterns of spears and masks surrounding a lion cant you relaxsometimes it was a plea he tensed beneath her touch not turning to her not looking hell no thats the trouble now we been relaxing too long your daddy and my daddyrelaxing uncle toming all those years letting things get tougher and tougher claude thats not true you know how our parents yeah i know by buying lifetime memberships in the naacp you go on to that cocktail party with all those mealymouth white liberals whore going to do thisandthat for the brother until they get out in the air and back to the suburbs i work with those people i cant refuse their invitations all the time besides in my line of work it gives me an opportunity to meet others and make significant contacts significant contacts he sneered excusesexcusesexcuses you just want to be with them and act like them and wish you were like them you cant forget your little black bourgeois upbringing about how great it is being in with white people like a status symbol she stepped back as if struck you had the same socalled black bourgeois background as i yeah baby but got out that second year in that middleclass snooty college i got out and joined the movement i left my doctor daddy and my social sprinting mother beeehind there are times when i think youre jealous because at least i did finish his hands tightened on the chair the knuckles showing like taut knobs through his skin she knew the lance had pierced always between them now were angry hatefilled words making them no longer one but two divided into sharp brittle separate pieces blown by different winds and guided by different stars go on where you going he muttered thickly i got work to do work she repeated bitterly watching him shut himself away from her over the desk her eyes swept the papers before him the array of pencils and the oldfashioned battered typewriter what kind of work work keep us going and i work because my black skin still doesnt deter me from liking good scotch good steaks living in a decent neighborhood and seeing a good play and its my work thats doing it she watched him puff heavily on the cigarette knowing she had wounded this timestruck where the sore was like a cancer eating him finally he laughed shortly some work the only nigger in a government job placement center a showpiece to prove nobodys prejudice a nigger behind a desk whos pretty and looks white with a forever florida suntan big deal meim out in the streets working with the brothers out there where the nitty gritty is fighting mister charlie im going to make whitey realize im a man i want to be treated as a man and baby i am going to be treated like a man takes a lot to make a man she scoffed slamming the door hard behind her the doors slam was like a slap a burning sting pierced the tips of his forefinger and thumb the cigarette had burned down to a pinpoint heat he dropped it in the burial ground of others a sharp recurring pain streaked across his forehead blurring his vision and the words on the paper she had caused him to lose his thought just when his pencil had moved and written a wonderful spring of free flowing words he was certain this one was the onethe essay that the atlantic monthly or new yorker would publish he was sure because he knew it was good it was just as good as any of baldwins or jones or cleavers wasnt he socking it to whitey spilling out his seething hatred and venom and frustrations making whitey feel guilt making whitey want to feel punished by the hot word lava flung at him by a black writer now was the time for the black writer to emerge because whitey was a masochist who wanted to be verbally whipped by the black man for his guilt whitey wanted the negro to tell him like it is tell him that he wasnt shit never was shit and never would be shit but the black man was some shit and even if blood had to flow the black man would prove he was some good shit he stared down at the papers and rejection slip that had come in the mornings mailthe telltale slip he had tried to hide from her the stock words swam before him thank you for your submittal which we are returning to you please dont consider this a reflection on the quality of your work he crumpled up the letter damn them whitey wouldnt even give him a chance to tell it like it is he got up stiffly noticing the soft summer evening rapidly fading into night a mauve twilight streaked pink and lilac ridges across the blue sky what he needed was a drink he went to the kitchen where a bottle of cutty sark was on the sink he got a glass from the cabinet and half filled it with the clear brown liquid raising the glass to his lips he savored the rich expensive odor of the scotch then suddenly in revenge he flung the glass across the room it made a dull thud against the wall before crashing into pieces on the floor the ache in his head flared anew he closed his eyes thinking he had to get out away from hereif only for a while he had to walk a block down the neat wellkept residential street with rows of modern onestory box houses and green carpets of manicured lawns before he could board the bus he felt the eyes upon him as he took a seat midway by the window the people on the bus stared furtively at him because they were used to seeing cleanshaven negro men in wellpressed suits dress shirts and carefully matching ties in this neighborhood this amused him so he always played a game with the passengers first he would glare at the white women gazing boldly to frighten them through his boring eyes with all those stories about the black mans sex powers some of the women would look away nervously averting the blackeyed spotlight beaming upon them while others would squirm uneasily on their seats as if what his gaze was divulging made them want to masturbate then tiring of this he would turn his fierce threatening look to the palefaced washedout cleanly scrubbed dickless white men and watch them wither as they wondered if he were there to start a riot or rob them or rape their women it was a tough hard funny wellplayed game that he enjoyed very much but tonight he didnt feel like playing instead of staring at them he simply ignored them by looking out the window and down at the cars appearing like miniature bugs darting in and out of the traffic soon the white people began to empty the bus and after a while he was left alone to travel into the belly of the ghetto where the seats would then be taken by others like himself he felt a surge of exhilaration when the first sister got on a large black perspiring woman grunting up the steps flopping down tiredly on the seat in front of him her hair was short and shot straight up as beads of sweat sprinkled the bare crinkled kitchen of her neck he smelled her sweat felt her tiredness wallowed in her big black brassiness and felt suddenly hilariously drunk you wont be tired long we black men are going to take up for you he thought he had said to himself but when the woman turned stared at him and back he wondered if he had said it aloud the ghetto noises began to drift in and rock with the rhythm of the bus flashing neon signs shattered kaleidoscopic shock waves of pawn shops bars furniture outlets and allnight grocery stores soul music spilled from the sleazy bars and shabby mountainous hollow eyed tenements into the streets bouncing off the hot pavements with its loud soaring beat home he wished anita would move here where his work was his heart lay and where his pain could be borne with a little more ease but no she wanted to stay where they were because it was closer to her work and she liked it there the streets were taking on the evenings life men lounged on the corners cracking jokes and making passes at the pliant flashing swell of brown yellow black feminine pulchritude floating by in gales of teasing laughter he breathed deeply soaking in the fetid air and the sounds and sights he liked it here he got off the bus and walked back to the movements office a few people who knew him waved he waved back bracing his shoulders in a swagger making the lion on his shirt stretch as he smiled broadly at them the office was locked he stood at the door for a moment then decided to go to tubbys black bar across the street the place was deserted except for two men in dingy tshirts and faded pants at the bar drinking beer an old man halfslept in a corner by the jukebox blaring james browns wailing blues shout the mans muddy face sank heavily in deep valley folds he was dressed in overalls that fell over and hid his shoes from time to time he would awaken sip from a glass of beer gone flat and nod again hi claude the shiny dark baldheaded man behind the bar greeted him hey tubby whiskey he perched on the bar stool glancing around at the shabby booths and worn wooden floor which had held and showed the weight and scuffle of many souls long gone friday and saturday there was hardly room to get in the whiskey was set before him it was cheap and raw and burned like a blaze going down his throat but it warmed him and he began to feel mellow inside he reached in his pocket and pulled out a crumpled bill the weeks pay from the movement slow night he commented picking up the change yeah too hot to stir anyway i got no air conditioner tubbys head jerked back to a lone fan in the window whirling a bee sound to make a faint breeze suddenly a police siren screamed outside reaching high above the wailing of james brown the two men further down the bar turned quickly trying to peer out the dirt streaked plate glass window a quick visible chill of fear iced their eyes the loud whine ceased but from the proximity of its subsidence they could tell it had stopped somewhere near claude kept his eyes on the glass he had to drink slowly to make the liquor and the money and companionship last james browns bellow ended in a crying moan leaving the room silent and each mans thoughts naked to the other trouble tubby said frowning too hot a night for trouble the police cars siren squealed again and faded away the old mans eyes opened as if on signal and he reached for the beer glass that was encircled with skimmed foam well tubby smiled relief flooding his face gone probly nothing much next round on the house brothers then the polices warning song shrilled again coming closer and louder like a screaming angry hyena the scream stopped in front of the bar the door swung back and two uniform policemen entered everybody up and over against the wall the big stout one ordered standing spraddlelegged with gun drawn in the middle of the room search em ed he said to the tall thin young one who looked and acted like a rookie the two men at the bar resembling welltrained robots moved simultaneously to stand against the pock marked wall scribbled with countless names and addresses and epithets the old man half stood obediently in his corner then through no volition of his own swayed back down in his chair too drunk to stand you too pops the big officer snapped pushing the bill of his cap back to unmask small narrow eyes then moving uncannily fast across the room he jerked the old man to his feet and shoved his dead weight against the wall the man bent his will to blend into the scars of the walls legacy of past histories whats wrong officer tubby asked quickly i aint had no trouble in here but weve had trouble white man was mugged down the street were looking for the nigger who done it it was then his eyes discovered claude still sitting firmly on the bar stool their eyes met the white mans cold grey steel of a winters sky and the angry black mans storm of inbred hate goddamnit you get over there to that wall like the rest claude steeled himself against the bar planting his feet solidly on the rungs of the stool who the hell did they think they were bursting in here like this they had no right that white man who got mugged had no rightbeing here in their world words came out revealing his thoughts what was that white man doing down here anyway looking for black pussy the policemans mouth opened in surprise his thin lips folding like a tent against the flabbiness of his face for a stilled deathlike moment he was too shocked to say anything then giving an angry bellow his meaty hands seized claude by his shirt ripping the african symbols and tearing the lion into shreds furiously he slammed him against the wall the hardness struck his head stunning him for a moment he knew he had fallen because he felt the floor and grit under the palms of his hands dazed he saw the big black shoes of the policeman shift and before he could roll out of the way felt the hard weight of the lawmans foot plunging into his side pain gripped him as his body was left as breathless as a deflated balloon black bastard i believe you the one done it get the goddam hell up get up he got up slowly the hurt bursting through him the room swirled in a circular motion reminding him of the ferris wheel he rode on when he was a boy that went around and around and when he closed his eyes he could yet feel the revolving sensation in the blackness he felt numbed and on another planet where there was nothing and even the nothing would not keep still the cheap rotgut whiskey rose to his throat he wanted to vomit but he swallowed and swallowed the bile to keep it down he couldnt do that not before him dont this one look like the one he described ed naw bull the young cop replied shaking his head eyes nervously skirting claude he said the guy was little and yellow with he looks like him to me bull growled spittle making bubbles at the corners of his mouth his tone became wheedling now dont he to you the young one looked down and away as if studying the thought but said nothing the men against the wall stood motionless like a shadow of silent ghosts claude guardedly watched the cop called bull thinking if that white sonofabitch hit him again hed kill him so help him hed kill that white motherfucker im goin to take this nigger in bull said pointing to claude comon lets go claude worked his lips they felt cracked and he could taste the salt of blood around them the movement of his mouth to speak hurt but the words came out strong not betraying the inward pain how you going to take me in he just said i didnt fit shut up nigger i can take you in for anything i goddam got a mind to we ought to take all you black coons in and kill ever last one of you pow pow like that he waved his pistol menacingly shoving it into claudes face suddenly upon seeing the beefy face and the wild grey eyes so near the old familiar ache crossed his forehead as a rushing tide of black ancient fires of loathing seared through him his black fist clenched doubled hard and drew back the white target wavered like a leering pendulum before him it seemed like a time without beginning or end but it was only a second before his right fist raised ladened with the weight of his rage suddenly there was a weakness in his arm like a pressure was holding it back subconsciously restraining it making his arm not a part of him but a separate entity the fist shot out lightly grazing the fleshy white chin goddam black bastard the policeman roared he saw the cops gun handle raise in the air and pause for a blinding moment before he closed his eyes and waited to go down in darkness he awakened in the back room of tubbys on a hard dirty cot a cold towel was over his forehead and he felt the bandage behind his ear the pallid yellow naked bulb shone above him making him aware that he had entered the now you goin to be all right man tubby said soothingly standing above him face anxious that other cop grabbed his arm just in time to keep him from really knockin your brains out they didnt take me innaw they too scared i guess the skinny one said sumpin bout the chief wanting em to lay off crackin niggers heads for a while guess they scared we might start a riot he laughed a dim sound can you make it home by yourself ill call a cab gently he removed the towel i can make it he shifted his legs over the side of the bed and with effort stood up groggily im ok aside from a pain in his head and the blood caking his lips making them heavy and swollen only thingonly thing i sure wished i had knocked the goddam pure white shit out of that motherfucker but he hadnt he hadnt or was it that he couldnt a chilling helplessness invaded him blown by the winds of past ancient black futility he suddenly wanted to go home at home he didnt bother to wash he simply stepped out of his tattered clothes and got between the clean white sheets in his shorts it was early but seemed late to him it was early when she came home yet seemed late to him he closed his eyes when he heard her key pretending to be asleep his ears followed her movements from the living room to the bathroom where he heard the running water the flushing of the toilet then her foot sounds in the soft mules coming into the room the bed dipped slightly as she slid in beside him he could smell the peppermint toothpaste and the avon cream she applied to her face at night as well as the faint odor of her perfume still clinging to her he wondered why it hadnt taken her as long as usual to go through her nightly rituals without opening his eyes he knew it was because she hadnt put her curlers onshe hadnt planted the garden rows of wires to make her hair bloom round soft ringlets in the morning he heard her turn over on her side and sigh soon she would be asleep listening to her steady breathing he thought she hadnt spoken to him or even tried to awaken him and talk with him she hadnt noticed the bloody bandage behind his ear or the cakey brown crust on his mouth it was as though he wasnt therewasnt there like the white policeman had actedlike he was nothing a nameless phantom to be pushed and cursed and ignored he was nothing at all absolutely nothing suddenly he opened his eyes to shout at her as the white policeman had at him make her notice him see himrealize he was there the darkness met his eyes first upon seeing it he felt inept frustrated in the mire of his thoughts somehow he knew she hadnt even bothered to turn on the light in the room at all simply undressed in the bathroom and followed her instinct around the darkened bedroom to the bed she hadnt wanted to see him anita he shouted sitting up angrily anita she stirred moving a little what is it claude the words were even estranged from him coming sleepy and muffled in her pillow he swallowed hard what was it what did he want to tell her about the eveninghis failure a failure because of a yet alive ageold fear of the white man still ghosting his black mind and making him ineffectual was that what had caused his abortive effort to strike back the way he really wanted to hard strong like a mannot a feeble man how were the nice white people he finally asked the question meaningless to him but it was an attempt a start for wasnt she there eating and drinking and laughing with them while others of them were beating him up oh god claude not tonight again im sleepy he moved closer to where she was lying with her back to him a perverse anger made him want to continue did you sneak out in the car with any of those faggot blonde boys whore always trying to get you in bed behind my back she did not answer her back and her silence a barrier to him they almost killed a white sonofabitch downtown tonight for that thingafter black women is that so and the police thought was the one who did it now hear that he thought gleefully the police thought someone like him could do thatwas capable of defending his black women welldid you had he detected a note of sarcasm in her words the derision dipped over him like smoldering hot honey was it her cool contempt that made him feel she knew him too well i could have hummm with your black_power i suppose damnit anita look at me the words spewed out a belch of fire before he realized she couldnt look at him because of the darkness even if she did look there would only be the dark outline of him that was a man all right claude she murmured in exasperation turning towards him so a white man was half killed and i was involved the police beat me up in a bar the words were hesitantthe story not coherent puzzle pieces which he couldnt put together for her snatches of thoughts and actions left hanging in the air so whats so new about that the white mans been beating nigger heads since slave time and will still do it whenever they can get a chance it just happened that you were there at that time in that particular situation suddenly her voice softened claude im sorry are you hurt bad she reached for the light on the bedstand but he stopped her he didnt want the light the light and its harshness would destroy the mood and the moment and turn his feelings inside out the sudden concern of her began to anger him but wasnt that what he had wanted her sympathy kindness the protective shelter of his black woman as all black men had wanted and gotten at some time whats there to be sorry about he snapped defensively were all going to get bloody fighting the system in the movement we expect those things welcome them roll with the punches and give out some too you dig me baby unhuh she yawned shifting back to her side of the bed to him the disdain was there in the mocking aloofness the ache in his head began again slowly intensifying the pain from the cut on his head he had been a buffoon all nighta black travesty beaten by what he was trying to beat destroyed by what he was trying to destroy and now he was being buked and scorned by what he imagined her to be all in one a black tribe of amazons towering in statuesque dominance over the black male pygmies stunted by the white mans nurturing the ache increased as pain and heated resentment flowed hotly through his loins the boiling blood caused his manhood to rise stiff and long the throbbing elongated maleness of him made him passionately aware again of what he was and of what he could do he could make babies like the white man he could and should make hundreds of babies to create an army to fight the white man hundreds of black babies to make the white mans milk black he could he was a man wasnt he uttering a harsh desperate cry his arms reached out to grab her to pull her savagely against him he wanted her to feel and know the strength of him the depth the height the power and the glory his bruised sore lips smashed against hers then tearing the flimsy material of her gown he covered her with his stink and beard anger and wretchedness he entered her before she was ready and was hardly conscious of what he was doing he heard and didnt hear her cries to cease for him to stop get up get off he had caught her by surprise she stiffened beneath him trying to close the entrance to her against him but he swelled and gloried in the battle that he fought now without gun or fistonly with the spear of him stabbing again and again into her until finally he felt her weaken and grow pliant under his warriorlike strokes to make her submissive to his will and strength and manhood he fought and fought marvelling at his staying power pridefully thinking he could go on and on like this all night but when he felt the moistness of her beginning to receive him bringing him into the hot deep well of her that claimed him now and made him feel caught and obliviously lost he realized the battle was over and in the end he cried out in triumphin defeat after a quivering moment that froze him he rolled off her breathing heavily expelling the last of his strength before he closed his eyes to give up to the tiredness he heard her say in a voice that made him know she knew it takes more than that to be a man then he thought he never wanted to awaken again in a mirror a soul a twopart volume of poems richardson sister fabio has written two books of poetryboth of which are sarah webster fabio meaning a blkpoet and both about what is relative to blkpeople meaning the blkexperience of blkpeople the distinction sister fabio draws between the mirror and the soul is both heavy and finea combination of the visual and of the aural visually the book is in two parts with one part reversed no matter which side of the book is up aurally sister fabio has done a thing with the written languagewrites it to sound like we sound in her foreword she presents her whythe existence of a black mother tongue born out of necessity from a period where not only were blkpeoples bodies shackled their minds enslaved but their tongues were tied and then proclaims that this then is a bilingual if not trilingual volume but back to the distinctionthe fine onethe distinction blurs somewhat for two reasons first there are poems in both sections which could comprise an intermediate section languagewise poems such as a downhome recipe from a black soul mothers workshop my own thing artifacts from home free by any means necessary and formula for liberation second and perhaps primarily though sister fabio has done a thing she hasnt completely done a thanga direction in which our blkenglishteachers should move and i say this is primary because in coming short of a thang sister fabio defeats some of her purpose in having the book in two sections what actually happens is that where she writes the language so that it sounds like we sound for the most part there are a few exceptions she has not written it to look like we sound then we deal with the fact that most blkpeople reading from a written page tend to pronounce read english words using the english pronunciation patterns they have been taught likewhen we look at whipping we more often see and read whip ing rather than whippin which is more often what we actually say or like the difference in your behind and yo behine or the actual difference in capturing and not capturing our blkspeech patterns in sightsound but for the poetry itself some of the poems are beautifully worked through the

white liberal sits fnrl like a giant incubus on the black freedom movement it has devoured the interracial civil_rights organizations and waves their empty husks at the black people trying to cajole them into fleshing out the dead organizations with their presence probably it is futile to belabor the white liberal for his blind arrogance he is so clearly incapable of understanding his present role in the civil_rights movement that he professes to believe in and cherish he is after all whitesharing the views of his white culture and by choice preserving his place in the white community at best he was an innocent dogooder whose presence in civil_rights activities could be tolerated by the black community at worst he has become the pawn of the white power structure in its desperate attempt to avoid facing and dealing with the emerging black strength in america alone among white americans the white liberal has a conscience of a sort he believes that he is a moral man and america is a moral nation this is essentially what separates the white paternalist from the white bigot but the white liberals conscience and his morality are inseparable from his white superiority during the last decade as the black revolt gained momentum the white liberal discovered that the hitherto nonexistent black people were being outrageously treated in america he became indignant over their wrongs and he began to march he picketed to integrate schools jobs neighborhoods he crossed arms locked hands and sang black and white together we shall overcome some day he gave time energy money and occasionally his life for years he was theredoing the right things for the wrong reasons the white liberal worked from several basic premises that it was tragic to be bom black that black people should wish to be and should be exactly like white people and that he knew at least as well asprobably better than black people what they should want and how to get it his morality his social justice consisted of deciding that people with dark complexions should share his white america on his terms live in his neighborhoods attend his schools and work beside him what more could they want he did not question the basic values of white america for they were his values and therefore absolute he argued with complete sincerity they are just like us the only difference is the color of their skin to himself he might add if some of them are culturally deprived they are not to be blamed they have been segregated so long integration will help them advance to black people he said im completely color blind i dont even think about it and he tried earnestly to practice this enlightened outlook when he socialized with black people he relished his own broadmindedness in offering himself as a true apostle of integration and giving his negro friends the opportunity to associate with a white person his utopia was a completely integrated america peopled by lightskinned white men and darkskinned white men the black ghetto was alien while he might fraternize in the civil_rights movement with individual blacks in the black community their numbers and strange closed faces frightened him he ventured into the ghetto as a civil_rights crusader but at night he went home thankfully to his white neighbor hood this was the white man who marched and sang in washington dc and selma sincere dedicated paternalistic and completely white he performed his good deeds with the blind arrogance of a white man dealing with black men the white liberal failed to ask the hard question he does not know they are there to be asked how can i know what black people want what place in white america do they really seek am i bound to respect their right to make their own decisions or respect them as equals there is a watershed of identity from which values arise almost all white americans are glad they were born white and they accept without question the superiority of their white western culture they feel sorry for people who were born black and who do not share freely in that culture to them the black man must automatically wish above all else to lose his black identity and be completely assimilated in their america when black people do not welcome this they are thought to be ignorant backward or prejudiced they think the black community and black institutions should dissolve as rapidly as opportunities for integration will permit for example the persistence of the black church puzzles them now that many white churches profess to welcome black communicants when the central conference of the methodist church chose to retain its identity white liberals smiled knowingly and said it was because negroes liked to flourish their bishops titles that the black methodists were too selfimportant to give up their little empires for integration they believe black clergymen are trying to keep their flocks out of white churches because the black preachers would surely lose their pulpits because white is right they assume that white churches could serve black people better than black churches they do not doubt that when black people have progressed sufficiently they will turn to the white churches they have not the least understanding of the great and living strength of the black church the actions of black and white demonstrators were the same their motives were not the black man picketed a segregated school because he knew his child would have a better opportunity to learn in a predominantly white school where it was assumed the pupils could and would learn and the school was oriented toward that end he knew that no matter how intelligent or gifted his child might be the child would learn little in a segregated northern school th where the staff considered black pupils culturally deprived and unteachable and many of the children responded to this rejection with equal hostility he was not seeking to thrust his child among white children because they were white but because education was available in their classrooms the white man picketed because he thought black children would be improved by attending wfiite schools and mingling with white children he knew his schools were better and he was willing to be generous and dilute them with a few disadvantaged black children the black child could only benefit from assimilating the cultural values of his white schoolmates the relative merits of bach and rhythm and blues were certainly not debatable the black man demonstrated for open housing because he wanted the opportunity to live wherever he chosebecause the ghetto walls permitted landlords to charge him more for poor housing than he would have to pay in an open city he did not wish to destroy the black community but to breach the walls that surround it the white man picketed because the very existence of the ghetto which he equated with both a slum and the black community was the ultimate mark of humiliation and shame he was trying so hard to help his darkskinned compatriots forget they were not just like himtrying so hard to forget it himself during the late summer of i was associated with a core chapter in a large eastern city it was the second chapter to be organized there almost entirely black national core had revoked the charter of the previous affiliate organized and dominated by white university students this black chapter had the confidence of many of the militants in the black community a white social worker director cf a large settlement house in a black neighborhood worked with the chapter he was a small intelligent energetic man who loved power he had been active in organizing the march on washington in another city he gloried in what he thought was his successful manipulation of this core chapter and its supporting groups he told me as much the black leaders watched this supposed exercise of power utilizing the mans energy and talent completely aware that they must retain control of policy decisions they did the glimpse i had of national core was different and distressing that fall i attended as an observer a regional core conference in new york city it was dominated by three white experts on the national staff two of them particularly were assured white men i could not imagine them pausing to doubt their competence to tell the black freedom movement what to do the black staff members had minor roles in the conference i do not know what the black delegates thought of these white experts this was two years before the blackwhite struggle in core became public i first saw seattle core during the school boycott the spring of the morning of the boycott in response to a lastminute call for additional help i reported to the core office the second floor of a vacant store building in the black community i had been receiving the core bulletin and was impressed by the chapters activity a white woman was minding the office coordinating activity for the freedom schools under cores direction she sent me immediately to a large catholic community center overflowing with children her daughter a college student bubm bling with excitement drove me over arent they just adorable those little deprived black children she cooed i grunted we reached the center before i could reply that the little black children were not deprived the principal of the freedom school was a strong black man most of the teachers were white liberal intellectual types some of the special features of the curriculum reflected white values the white woman playing a gavotte on the harp was obviously a brief exposure to the better things for the deprived black children a white man played southern racist songs on a violin for each class black music was ignored there was no proud statement that black is beautiful one learned black scholar lectured on the history of black people in america concluding with langston hughes rivers otherwise black culture was not recognized the white students almost a fifth of the enrollment were largely the children of the white liberals who supported the boycott they tended to be mouthy and selfassured seeking to monopolize the class discussions they probably duplicated their public school roles outwardly the boycott was successful in numbers of students who participated but im not sure what it did for the black community it appeared that whites dominated the planning and certainly the teaching staff had the freedom schools grown from within the black community i should think there would have been black sunday school teachers to staff them as it was many of the white teachers showed little understanding of their black pupils and the pupils had the experience of another white teacher rejecting them the dominant mood among the white staff members was we are noble and benevolent in fighting for the right of these deprived black children to attend our schools and mingle with our children i wonder how clearly the black children and their parents got the message a few months later i was appointed to our local naacp executive board protesting that i didnt think white folks should be making policy i was told by friends who privately agreed with me that so many white faces were necessary on the board and if i declined some other white person would be appointed so i began to attend meetings resolved to say little shortly after that another white board member concerned over the naacps lack of support in the black community proposed we send representatives to various organizations to explain our program and invite them to discuss their problems all board members white and black were expected to speak for the naacp in the black community i objected to the idea of sending white members into the black community to tell black people what to do this was arrogant and paternalistic i tried to explain white peoples limitations their place in the civil_rights movement as helpers and not leaders the members present black and white were either firmly disapproving of or outraged by my statements that the black community would not and should not be expected to accept white naacp spokesmen some denied angrily the black racism they thought i was implying the black community contained a black woman warmly defended the white paternalists citing mary white ovington and her spiritual descendants in the naacp through the years the two black board members who would have agreed with me were not present that night the consensus was resolutely color blind but the project of speakers before black organizations was not mentioned again i can only guess how the black civil_rights activists felt during those years about their white liberal allies the white liberal was talking about freedomjustice equality but it was freedomjusticeequality on his terms as he chose to grant and administer them this may not have been apparent at first possibly the black activists credited white liberals with more understanding and less arrogance than the whites possessed possibly they believed the whites would lose their paternalism as they came to know and understand the black community i have often found black people more charitable in their assessments of whites than i thought was warranted judging by their own humane culture they seem unable at times to believe that white folks can be so mean the deep cleavage between white liberals and the black community was dramatized when the concept of black_power became an angry slogan hurled at white america the white folks illusion of allowing darkskinned white people to share their white western culture on their terms was threatened white liberals had approved the humble and prayerfully supplicant posture of the nonviolent black demonstrators to them it was right and natural that powerless black people should beg and powerful white people should decide to grant they had accepted black people on the assumption they were trying to become white now they were forced to look at black men who did not beg and did not wish to be white their treatment of adam clayton powell revealed their inability to accept a proud black man socialists and other hitherto staunch civil_rights supporters joined the white establishment in attacking and reviling powell they could not understand black peoples loyalty to him then stokely carmichael shouted black_power and the sorting out began many white liberals who had marched and sung in and retreated to silence those who remained by their own definition dedicated workers in the civil_rights movement joined the establishment to denounce this frightening new idea or searched desperately for negro leaders who would say the things they wanted to hear no wonder the white liberal was horrified and alarmed by the black_power slogan and its attendant concepts his paternalistic role was challenged with all his blindness and disdain for the ghetto and for blackness he had claimed the ancient white prerogative of knowing what was best for the negro now he was being told he could merely help it was a deep affront to his white superiority he could not accept a subordinate place so he defended his paternalism by attacking black_power assuming that black nationalism was indefensible he attempted to destroy blackness with it how did this white man suppose black people had lived for the last three hundred years in america in complete negation and selfrejection in limbo waiting for the final day of integration when they could forget they were considered black first and american second the white liberal was shocked that black people were not sorry to have been born blackthat they considered themselves beautiful most of all his ego was shattered by black peoples defense of the fearsome and alien ghetto to him it was a slum to be wiped out bulldozed as soon as possible it was the supreme gesture of arrogance to question the precious gift of integration the white liberal was working so hard to bestow not to want complete and immediate integration on his terms was separatism racism prejudiceinreverse anything less than his kind of integration was antiwhite he saw nothing valuable in the black community he saw black culture only as a willful and misguided failure to become white in the name of his mythical integrated negro he would destroy the black community and its culture he was unaware of his double standard for a black man to criticize white culture and defend black culture was antiwhite and biased for him a white man to criticize black culture and defend white culture was not antiblack but objective those white liberals who remained in the civil_rights organizations fought the black militants for control black militants in the naacp have charged that the united auto workers faction in the last two conventions used every tactic from bribery to threats of physical violence to retain control of the organization its declining membership nationally reflects the black communitys growing lack of confidence in it last fall a group of leaders in the black community here tacoma wash organized a strategy committee to press for certain goals among them were officers and members of the naacp their first target was the personnel of a newly created human relations commission and particularly its executive director a prejudiced white man in whom they had no confidence they called for nonrecognition of the commission as constituted and appointment of a black director the commission was characterized as an instrument of appeasement controlled by the white power structure this program was presented to the naacp executive board with a request for naacp support and implementation led by the white liberals the board recommended rejection of the program i reported the boards action in our monthly newsletter and wrote a signed letter to the editor that began it is time for a white member to speak plainly after reviewing the presentation to the board meeting i said the merits of the proposal are basically not at issue clearly the program was being brought to the naacp by the leaders of the negro community the opposition was led by three white board members for all their lip service to the idea of respect for negroes and recognition of their rights these white members were displaying their superiority and paternalism in not recognizing the right of negro leaders to make basic civil_rights policy in this or any city anything less than our recognition as whites of the absolute necessity of negro leadership is to bring our white paternalism with us right into the naacp we whites are not equal to negroes in our understanding of and ability to communicate with the negro community how could we be we have not walked the earth one day of our lives as negroes granted that these white members have worked hard in the branch that they mean well this isnt enough unless they support loyally the negro leadership they are doing more harm than good to civil_rights if they really respect negroes let them accept this leadership and work to carry out the will of the negro community if the naacp does not support the committee it will certainly alienate itself from the negroes struggle for human dignity i appeal to white naacp members to move beyond their paternalism and join the struggle as loyal followers just before the branch meeting the newly appointed director of the human relations commission hastily joined the naacp he showed up at the meeting with a lengthy appeal for fair play and another chance before being condemned he had already bungled his first case the white liberals were there in numbers indignant at my attack completely unmoved by my appeal they voted down the proposals of the black leaders the arrogance of the white liberals in this branch and their insistence on compromise and appeasement have tended to discredit it in the black community in the seattle core election the end of the whitesupported moderate black candidate for chairman defeated the militant black candidate the defeated faction withdrew and formed an aggressive black community organization the whites may have saved core from the black militants but they seem to have silenced it in the black community in san franciscos fillmore district this spring i passed a vacant core office i saw no evidence of its activity in the community maybe it too was saved from the blacks recently a friend of mine a black woman related how impossible it was for a white man with whom she was associated in an interracial cultural organization to get along with his black peers he seemed unable to avoid the appearance of patronizing them and his feelings were hurt because they did not welcome him as a soul brother he was aggressive in the affairs of the organization the black men universally disliked him what can i tell him she asked me to make him understand tell him that he is a white paternalist i replied he probably is incapable of understanding this or he wouldnt behave as he does white men are the lords of creation and it is virtually impossible for them to be otherwise dont let the white paternalists dominate the organization or they will drive the black people away they already are she replied sadly this last year the civil_rights movement has seemed to make some progress local white power structures are beginning to make concessions to the moderate civil_rights organizations to avoid dealing with the black militants they are engaging in sham battles with these organizations rather than rec ognize the growing power of the black communities for years the seattle school system resisted integration by changing boundaries or busing while de facto segregation steadily increased under its open enrollment plan the school board ignored appeals picketing and the school boycott then the fall of at is the new junior high in harlem black parents demonstrated for a black principal and community control of the school the summer of seattle community organizations moved toward a similar program for their black schools this spring the seattle school board announced plans to close a black elementary and a black junior high school to reduce the ratio of black students in the high school by transfers out and to bus the children from the closed black schools to white schoolsthe naacp and white liberals applauded the progress the black community protested vigorously against busing its children out and demanding a black principal for the high school and community voice in its schools the naacp denounced this program as irresponsible it is true that the state board of education had finally established requirements for racial balance in school districts receiving state funds but to me the real reason for the seattle program is the changed options for the school boards for years the alternative to the civil_rights movements demand for dispersal of black students throughout the white schools was to do nothing and keep the black children penned up in their black schools now the white community has realized that those black schools are the breeding ground for a continuing crop of young black militants and the focal point around which the black community is uniting to demand community control and black administrators now the dispersal of these black students has suddenly become desirableto stifle their rising black consciousness the school boards program was not a victory gained by a strong civil_rights movement but an attempt to thwart the growing strength of the black community the same changed options were operating before and after the assassination of dr martin_luther_king jr for years the white community had been opposing his demands and demonstrations then early in as the nation began to look forward to another violent summer his nonviolent philosophy became a viable alternative to that of the black militants just before his death the saturday evening post featured an article in which he said that the poor peoples march on washington would be the last chance for nonviolence to prove its usefulness he implied that one of the purposes of demonstrations was busy work to allow black anger and white guilt to be vented in harmless channels malcolm_x told us years ago the march on washington was busy work dr_king still believed white america had a conscience that could be awakened and he preached love for all men for these reasons he became the acceptable alternative to the black militants the appeal to conscience could be ignored as it had been for hundreds of years the lavish public mourning after his death by the same white power structure that had fought him during his life was a cheap attempt to buy time and appease black anger that great opinion manipulator the readers digest for june featured two great sermons by martin_luther_king and a lead article plain talk about hatred and violence by a white liberal to me passage of the civil_rights act of was not a tribute to dr_king but a comment on the flames in the sky over washington dc white paternalism is inherently as racist as white bigotry it stems from the same concept of white superiority and the same lack of respect for black people and black culture the white paternalist embodied in the white liberal demonstrates his abhorrence for blackness by seeking to wipe out the black communities and assimilate blackskinned white men in his white western culture with increasing urgency the white liberal is being used against the black community he is truly the last best hope of white supremacy lawyer his sibility crisis by judge raymond pace alexander t was years ago when i then only a few years out of law school accepted an invitation from a distinblack lawyer in des moines iowa george h woodson and an equally brilliant lawyer of chicago a much younger gentleman c francis stradford to address the proceedings of the national bar association at its third annual convention i had never known either of those gentlemen before that convention george woodson then in his middle fifties was the founder of the national bar association organized in des moines iowa in c francis stradford then in his middle thirties was its president in neither of these revered barristers is any longer with us but each of them left his monumental contribution to the glorious history of this great association for a long number of years the national bar association truly was the lone voice crying in the wilderness as it were among all the organized law associations in americawith one exceptioncrying for justice and equality for the american negro the lone exception to which i pay loyal and respectful tribute was the national lawyers guild do you remember those years forty years is a long time ago and it might be well to recall some of the events of those years briefly and what the negro lawyer faced in his convention city detroit what he talked about his then problems before the american courts and indeed before america itself they were bleak and dismal years his future the future of the american negro was uncertain the full history of those near three decades to is an intensely absorbing and in many aspects a heartbreaking story which is well worth telling because it is an important part of the history of the american negro and of the american negro lawyer and his contribution to the ongoing and difficult struggle for better race relations in america time obviously prevents a detailed discussion of this subject what were our problems at that timein what were the subjects on the agenda for the negro lawyers assembled in detroit at the outset you must be reminded that we had no detroithilton or any other firstclass hotel white or black in which we could meet the white hotels just would not have us and we had no recourse to any court of law we met as did all negro organizations at that time in the ymcas and in the negro ymcas at that the total number of negro lawyers in america in barely totalled and half of that number were concentrated in three cities washington d c had about but were working in government offices there were approximately in the new yorkbrooklyn area and about in chicago as an illustration of their few numbers there were only lawyers in philadelphia as contrasted to todays less than in pittsburgh the remainder scattered principally in the large industrial cities of the north such as cleveland detroit indianapolis st louis and los angeles and san francisco there were perhaps less than in the entire south where they were most definitely needed where a mass of million black americans lived and labored in the farming cottongrowing states these people were crying for help but the law gave them no protection and their white overlords cotton plantation owners farm labor bosses sheriffs kkk night riders and other race baitors and terrorizesgave only the whip and the lash the torch and the rope if they made any organized effort to assert even the barest minimum of their constitutional rights to register to vote to serve on jury to be free from beatings to obtain forced confessions or to demand abolition of segregated rail and bus transportation in fact any organized and entirely peaceful protest against intolerable working conditions would cause the most cruel and inhuman abuse of those who protested to recite all the crimes and injustices committed against innocent black people of the rural south from to when we lawyers took up the defense of these people would cause your blood to chill in your body there was a crying need at that time for bright dedicated and courageous black lawyers there still is such a need today there was an equally crying need for a national organization of negro lawyers in those days there still is a great need for the national bar association today and let no one try to convince you that you have done a good job your mission has been accomplished and now since the american bar association has dropped its racial bar the national bar association is no longer necessary i would like to tell you my own personal experience in trying to become a member of the aba from to and of their refusal to admit me because of race but that is not a pleasant story and i prefer to let it rest to be told in detail in my memoirs the national bar association is needed more today than ever before in its historyand in a few moments i hope to tell you why let me remind those of you present tonight especially those who were too young to know the events of those years that at our annual conventions where cases of the character just alluded to came to our attention by our members we would discuss the legal points involved and assist the lawyers who were handling these cases from the hearings in the police court through the trial and state appellate courts and thence on appeal before the united states supreme court it was the negro lawyer who gave hope to the defenseless masses of black people of the south and sustain them in the belief that america offered a future for black people free from torture and despair and to the everlasting glory of the negro lawyer he was victorious in the overwhelming number of civil_rights and human rights cases argued before the supreme court during the last years including the greatest in the field of education in all its history the brown vs board of education case in to those who are interested in further research on this subject i prepared an article for the association for the study of negro life and history entitled the upgrading of the negros status by supreme court decisions which is published in bound volume xxx no a later and more complete study in book form appeared in entitled the petitioners the story of the supreme court of the united states and the negro loren miller a great lawyer and later a distinguished judge of the municipal court of los angeles who died quite unexpectedly in july commend these works to those who want to know more about the legal status of the negro who was in every respect a ward of the united states supreme court for more than years as loren miller aptly put it as befits a dependent a ward the negro has had to solicit the intercession of his guardian when he has sought to exercise rights and privileges enjoyed by grown up white citizens as a matter of course that negroes have had to secure supreme court decrees in order to do what white americans can do without question such as buy or rent homes vote in primary elections ride in pullman cars read daily newspapers in city libraries loll around in public parks eat in bus stations or swim in the ocean most of these cases were argued and won by negro lawyers many by loren miller himself who was eminently successful especially in the field of restrictive covenants barring blacks from open housing the names of these negro lawyerheroes as i like to describe those brilliant barristers who have been so successful before the highest court of our land are many and long and the list of heroes is increasing annually it is perhaps improper to mention a few without naming all but i must pay deep and solemn respect to two successful advocates in a number of unusual cases one was the architect and planner of scores of landmark decisions favorable to blacks a profound scholar in the field of law with whom i was associated as an underclassman while he was a senior at harvard law school i refer to the late father of civil_rights charles h houston i also pay deep and profound tribute to dean houstons protege who became one of the most successful advocates at the bar of the supreme court now mr justice thurgood marshall a member of the supreme court he was a student of charles houston while houston was dean of the law school at howard i also pay tribute to the law faculty of one of americas great law schools the law school of howard university it was the faculty of this law school that inspired and sharpened the minds of the bright young men of our race encouraging many of their graduates to follow the leadership of houston and marshall to countless victories in the state and federal courts throughout this nation i cannot leave this part of my subject without adding that a score of howard university college and law graduates now grace the benches in at least state and federal courtsa great step forward from the year years ago when we could count at that time and for twelve years thereafteruntil only one negro judge in all america the late judge james a cobb of the municipal court of the district of columbia in an america which spends mounting billions of dollars for defense and additional billions in the frenetic and chauvinistic race in the search of outer space we as negro lawyers guardians of the increasing millions of our people who are still wards of an affluent society living in the ghettos the cesspool inner core of great wealthy cities must challenge our government to retrieve and cultivate the inner space values of the negro of america we must challenge the government to find the true soul and heart and meaning of the negro what it means to be a negro and what he as a man and his family as a unit and his people as a race means to america and the future of this country the black lawyers of america the same professionals who with consummate skill and advocacy mastered the lawyers highest art the art of the relevantalways focusing their argument on the principal problems germane to the case at hand must now become the leaders of their people and fill the vacuum created by the death of one of the worlds most treasured souls dr martin_luther_king jr black lawyers must make relevant to america that today the need for new unselfish dynamic and talented leaders among the negro people is greater than at any time in the last years in no other way can the death of this great and most holy of the worlds modern men be vindicated in this way alone can the mortal wound to america be healed the black lawyer can fill this void he is among the best trained professionals of his race he has had years of study of the history of mankind the social ethical psychological and socioeconomic problems of masses of people of diverse background living together in great urban centers etc he also has had additional years of study of the increasingly large number of subjects and areas of investigation making him the ideal person to assume the leadership role in finding and proclaiming to america and to the world the relevant issues the relevant values and objectives which american negroes seek and demand from america above all we as lawyers must always demand equal opportunity equal treatment and full justice for the negro in every matter necessary for his total participation in the life of his country to be able to do this he must have three things that go hand in hand to make him a functional literate and healthy citizen he must have good quality education in the finest schools with a large percentage of male teachers to restore the father image so long removed from the lives of the young because of the sick society that surrounds the negro family in the ghetto an education free from the defeating handicaps of segregation in both the north and south so that the child will be able to get and hold a job to fit his skills or to further his education in the sciences or the professions the doors of commerce and industry must be opened widely to provide jobs at every level this may mean we lawyers must take some harsh measures against labor unions that deny negroes apprentice training and others that bar negroes from membership these cruel and repressive practices have for many long years deprived the negro worker both the skilled and the able apprentice of his manhood and of the ability to provide for his family racism has denied him the needed skills to work in industry in effect denied him his right to work and therefore his right to earn a living third in our list of objectives is the all important one of a decent place to live all these goals go hand in hand education jobs and nonsegregated housing either one education or two jobs without the third nonsegregated housing will weaken and ultimately destroy the new structure that must be built for a free negro in a just america we must select from the great black talent at the american bar now numbering negro lawyers a very encouraging increase from the lawyers in one man orif need be a committee of three one of whom i suggest be a womanwho will reject all ideas of separation of the negro from the mainstream of american life and of setting aside a negro state this is an utterly stupid and ridiculous suggestion completely devoid of any sense or reason it is sheer fantasy we have fought separation of the races in america all our lives many of our great lawyers some no longer living and many in our audience here tonight have literally sacrificed our lives our homes and subjected ourselves and our loved ones to assaults abuse and insults too degrading to mention to save our country from the shame and world stigma of an apartheid america how can we support the claims of those who say integration is irrelevant to the aims of the negro what we have fought for described in brief detail earlier resulting in countless victories in the highest court of our land is a documented story that speaks louder than my feeble words that america itself accents integration as the sensible goal to seek in the continuing struggle to make one family of all americans an equally important goal to seek is to commit america to the eradication literally the complete elimination of the hardcore ugly ghetto areas in the cities which is the real crime in the streets the disorders that flow from these disgraceful blots on the landscape are seeded nurtured and allowed to grow to full bloom by the willful neglect of the heartless the apathy of the disinterested and the failure of those who know better to become involved in americas problems the census if taken today would show the black population of america to be close to of whom nearly live in the inner cities the five largest centers of black population are washington d c per cent newark percent baltimore percent chicago percent and philadelphia percent there is a very forceful human problem underlying this whole question clearly if for no reason other than an economic one though the human social problems to my mind are the greatest the country must see that if it is to survive there must be radical and monumental efforts made to eliminate this cancerous sore in the midcities but we as lawyers who live in or near these communities from which so many of our clients come must know how destructive these conditions are it is our duty to see that the black members of congress by appropriate legislation urge our government to provide billions of dollars to remove the poverty families from the lifedestroying ghettos and provide healthy suburban or outercity areas so that these people may have some hope for the future and perhaps for the first time in their lives a sense of selfrespect faith in their fellowman and pride of race we as lawyers know from our travels in the backwoods and muddy swamps of the south where we have often gone in the dark days of southern justice to save the defenseless poor among our people from the curse of irrational intemperate and degrading racist justice in southern court houses that those people and now their descendants in the north who live in these ghettos have been confined to a life of voicelessness and powerlessness we have seen the breakdown of our families the absence of a father so long denied the right to a decent job hopeless emasculated in spirit we the lawyers must in a sense invade the ghetto and help to create for the people faith in themselves and faith in their fellow blacks and restore their faith in america which is greatly needed to do all of the above we must have help it is not too much to ask america to unlock its store of treasures and give to the poor and disadvantaged in the richest country in the world some of its wealth this is the only industrial democracy in the world that does not have a family or childrens allowance and as has been pointed out by so many scientists not only is this the wealthiest country in the world but it also is the only one whose streets are filled with rioters each summer canada as does several scandinavian countries has model family allowance laws which if enacted in america would effectively eliminate poverty and the ghettos these laws would give to the people a new psyche new faith in themselves and restore the status the strength of and the respect for the family as a social structure as an alternative to this the black lawyer should urge the guaranteed income plan to congress as a very real and scientific way of creating a base upon which the povertylevel family would be provided the means of becoming an integral and productive part of the american community this is a time to dareand the black lawyer must always do the daring if we could dare to take on the cruel and entrenched establishment and the courts of the old south and win we can dare to go forward against the counterparts of those barbaric institutions now infesting the north there are thousands of northern segregationists equally as dedicated to negro inferiority and secondclass status we can make america a healthy society for all its people the job will not be easy but we have as partners in our efforts millions of fairminded honest and sincere whites what is more important to us as lawyers there are thousands of members of the white bar throughout america who have offered their help both financial and physical and their resources to destroy racism wherever they see its ugly head and to create an america free from all restrictions or barriers free from every economic social or political restraint only the lawyer with his special training and experience to cope with the most difficult legal situation and the most extreme legal emergencies can bring quiet and order out of the overwhelming problem that face the poor within our group we would be able to define the lines of action between what is lawful and permitted within the framework of state and federal laws and acts which inevitably lead to destruction of life and property which are totally against the law and which defeat our purpose while serving to inflame the hatred of those too willing to perpetuate a racist america the call is clear the time is now the need for intelligent unselfish dedicated and courageous leadership awaits your answer is the black lawyer listening a middleaged negro tells it as it is by lloyd l brown am going to talk back to the young black militant talkers who have been doing all the talking lately talk talk talk or to use their expression rap rap rap if all the talk was put together you would have a storm that would really blow the man down but then what would there be to rap about i have been listening intently to all the talkat meetings and conferences and seminars and workshops and on radio and tv discussion panelslistening to everybody tell it like it is and reading all the books and articles and interviews that tell it like it is until i feel impelled to stand up and talk back and tell it as it is its a lot of stuff thats what it is just a lot of stuff i use that word defiantly with no apology for not using one of the fourletter words that every young black militant talker must use in every sentence in order to keep in good standing as a ybmt let us start on that subject why fourletter anglosaxon words arent there any fourletter words in swahili the fact is my young brothers your bold bad use of obscenities from the speakers platform is definitely not in the black cultural pattern it is merely a steal from the revolutionary white kids especially the uppermiddleclass white kids who now that you wont let them play with your revolution are doing their own thing by painting fourletters words on their foreheads because they dont have any old board fences in their fancy suburban neighborhoods on which to chalk dirty words if you call me a brainwashed negro i will argue back but if you call me a mouthwashed negro well you are so right around the age of seven when i first verbalized my own young black militant mood we matured earlier in those days one of the old folks grabbed my neck with one hand and a hunk of brown soap in the other and reamed out my mouth clean down to the tonsils more than years later i can still feel that hellfire of homemade lyesoap and hear the accompanying flow of words that burned into my soul enjoining me henceforth and forever to respect my elders and mind my manners and act decent and not like some poor white trash that dont know how to act the old folks are gone and so is the brown power of their soap and the black_power of their monumental dignity and selfrespect now we have packaged detergents from the a p and young black militant talkers who aint going to respect nobody man and who act just like some rich white trash that dont know how to act according to the ybmts there are of course some words that nobody is allowed to usefor example the word negro at one black_power seminar i heard the chairman interrupt a speaker with the warning that no black person who respected his blackness would ever refer to himself as a negro of course the chairman said we know there are some negroesunfortunately but they got to go laughter and applause anybody really wants black_power calls himself black thats our own word for ourselves nobody who ever considered himself a man ever called himself a negro like most of their white fellow students the ybmts know little or nothing about the history of our people call us what you will five minutes in the library would show that the greatest heroes of our freedom struggle have through the years referred to themselves by various designationscolored people afroamericans blacks negroes another five minutes would show that our worst traitors have also called themselves by those varied terms one of the earliest documentary records of our history in this land is a letter informing the governor of south carolina in about a planned slave rebellion the judas signed himself a black most of the black nationalist ideas of our ybmts were formulated by marcus garvey who insisted that no selfrespecting black man would ever call himself anything but a negro regardless of white efforts to term him something else in his essay who and what is a negro garvey wrote let us not be flattered by white anthropologists and statesmen who from time to time because of our success here there or anywhere try to make out that we are no longer members of the negro race if we were negroes when we were down under the hell of oppression then we will be negroes when we are up and liberated from such thraldom black is a good solid word but it is just as white a term as any you can find in the dictionary webster traces the origin of black all the way back to indoeuropean and that is as aryan as you can get and unless mr webster was a soulbrother black is not our own designation for ourselves it is his colored afroamerican negro blackyou still cant judge a book by its title and every ybmt will have more to talk about if he reads walkers appeal to the colored citizens of the world as well as black reconstruction in america the negro as capitalist as well as black bourgeoisie the negro mood as well as the souls of black folks i say take your pick of the names for our group and please dont call a brother a bad name if he picks one you dont like someday and all too soon you young ones will be old black militants and you wont like it if the next generation calls itself young colored militants and gives you a hard time for designating yourselves with the white word black as for me i still want to call myself a negro which is short for the way the old folks taught me to answer whenever the white kids called me something else im a negroandproudofit i still am another thing you might think about is this negroes and even colored people knew about guns long before the first ymbt hollered get your guns men for the benefit of tv cameramen my boyhood chum chester had several older brothers who owned hunting rifles whenever we had his house to ourselves chester and would take down a couple of the gleaming winchesters not having permission was an added thrill to use in our favorite gamethe kluxers are coming we began by taking our positions at the parlor front window chester covered the street from one direction and i from the other our rifle barrels poking under the starched lace curtains sometimes we waited grimly silent and alert for as long as half an hour before chester would shout that they were coming it was his house and his brothers guns so naturally he had the right to be first to yell bangbang at the imaginary invaders our armed defense of the house was no doubt inspired by the reports we read each week in the negro newspaper about the ossian sweet trial in detroit when a white mob in that city stormed the newly purchased home of dr o h sweet a negro physician one of the attackers was killed by a rifle shot from the beleagured house the physician his family and several friendsabout a dozen persons in allwere charged with murder the naacp took up the case employed as defense counsel the famous lawyer clarence darrow and after several trials all of the accused were acquitted chester and i were only eighth graders thennot college students like so many ybmts of today and so we didnt know a lot of things that seem to have been discovered lately for instance we did not know that our winchesters could achieve a whole lot more than homedefense with them we could have taken power man we could have captured the whole city putting chester in as prime minister with me as his no gunbearer and second shot we also did not know that our playshooting was directed at the wrong kind of people chester and i it now seems should have been banging away not at the attacking klansmen but at the main enemies of our race the majority of negroes both in and out of the naacp who believe in selfdefense but not selfdestruction and also white liberals like clarence darrow who defend them i have saved my most serious complaint about the young black militant talkers till last some of them are preaching white racism those preachments are sometimes called black racism or racism in reverse but you cant turn white into black by a switch in names racismthe idea that there are superior and inferior races of humankindis a modern idea originating from western europeans who happened to be white after the rape of africa and other lands where the populations happened to be nonwhite the most antihuman ideology ever to afflict mankind racism reached its depth of depravity in hitlerism which preached and practiced genocide the extermination of socalled nonaryans the nonpure whites according to the nazis who were a ku klux klan in power nothing they did in carrying out their racial policy was inhumane because the nonaryans were classified as untermenschen subhumans well heres how a socalled black militant leader recently expressed himself black people cannot commit any crimes against white people anything we do to the dog cannot be wrong the only crimes we can commit are crimes against humanity and white people arent part of humanity the name of the speaker isnt important our debate should stick to ideas not to personalities and i would like to hope that this man might think it over and change his mind his statement is racism it is precisely the idea that has branded and burned millions and millions of people most of them black people through the years if racism is in every respect a total evil opposite to the idea of the brotherhood of man does it change its nature when preached by a black person instead of a white race hate and black pride do not go together they are opposites in his famous credo written more than years ago i used to see it framed in our peoples homes w e b du bois after asserting his belief that all men black and brown and white are brothers went on to avow his special belief in the negro race in the beauty of its genius the sweetness of its soul and dr du bois added this profound thought i believe in pride of self so deep as to scorn injustice to other selves dig malcolm_x came to see that our struggle is not a matter of race against race but as he put it is part of the rebellion against the oppression and colonialism which has characterized this era in his last formal speech malcolm stressed that point the negro revolution is not a racial revolt we are interested in practicing brotherhood with anyone really interested in living according to it racism is not a weapon that we can snatch from the hands of our enemy for use against him since racism has no foundation in fact is a total lie and a fraud it has no use except to justify and maintain an existing oppression because racism can serve only an oppressor it is of no use at all to anyone fighting for freedom what we have to do is not embrace racism we have to destroy it the old folks who wiped away my tears of pain and rage when i came home battered by my first encounters with the monster never called it race hatred they did not call it prejudice they called it ignorance though they themselves could not read or write the old folks had a withering contempt for what they saw as ignorance anybody call you that is ignorant anybody believe color makes him better is ignorant plumb ignorant come to think of it nowthe old folks did do more than mouthwash me for life somehow they pounded into my seat of learning and into my head as well most of the fundamentals you are as good as anybody and dont ever forget it carry yourself like a man respect everybody god dont love ugly you come from a wonderful people you young black militants that soul you are always talking about didnt grow in a jukebox it was a long time agrowing and like the old folks songs that so richly expressed it that soul is warm and vibrant with humanity with compassion with love you did not invent the concepts of selfrespect and race pride you did not start the struggle for liberation and survival but those concepts and that struggle are your heritagea heritage to be cherished and to be fulfilled black poems poseurs and power by nikki giovanni like all the milii i tant poems that tell jj how we gonna kick the honkies backside and purge our new system of all honkie things like white women tv voting and all the ugly bad things that have been oppressing us so long i mean i wrote a poem asking nigger can you kill cause to want to live under presidentelect nodick nixon is certainly to become a killer yet in listening to smokey and the miracles sing their greatest hits recently i became aware again of the revolutionary quality of you can depend on me and if you ask whos loving you just because i say hes not a honkie you should still want to know if im well laid there is a tendency to look at the black experience too narrowly the maulana has pointed out rather accurately that the blues is counterrevolutionary but aretha is a voice of the new black experience its rather obvious that while think was primarily directed toward white america ted white could have taken a hint from it we must be aware of speaking on all levels what we help to create we will not necessarily be able to control the rape of newark in the past election was criminal if revolutionaries are going to involve themselves in politics they should be successful and while im sure poems are being written to explain the success of the newark campaign and essays and future speeches are being ground out on brand new scott tissues in living color blaming the black community for not supporting the united brothers i would imagine the first problem the united brothers encountered that they were unable to overcome is that they were not united leroi jones for whatever reason had no business appearing on a show with anthony imperiale issuing joint statements about anything at all because he leroi did not have equal power in his half of the joint joint statements and meetings with the governor did not encourage the black people of newark to support the united brothers because of the prestige of leroi no newark voice is being lifted to analyze what went wrong in the allblack central ward of the people who turned out to vote only percent of them voted for councilmen period they did not vote against the united brothers but they would not vote for them either in a year when black people showed little to no interest in national politics the stage was set for massive involvement in black_power there was no oppositionthe people were not involved in another camp so what went wrong militarismfor one thing to enter the main headquarters of the united brothers one had to sign in this turned most people off then you were asked quite tersely what do you want and if you couldnt answer concisely and accuratelyyou were dismissed the height of this attitude at headquarters was reached when a man carrying to give to the campaign was requested to sign in then engaged in conversation by one of the keepers of headquarters the man turned from the conversation to speak with someone else and was told by a second headquarterskeeper the brother wasnt finished with you when the mans response wasnt satisfactory they pushed him up against the wall and the brothers guarding him were told do anything necessary to keep him in line the man with the money finally made his way upstairs and complained to karenga and leroi and was told his treatment was an honest mistake it was a disaster if that kind of treatment was accorded a man with as much prestige as he had we shudder to think what happened to those who just drifted in to see they offered an apology to the offended brother but that missed the point entirely the people of newark became more afraid of the black candidates and their organization than they were of the present scandal ridden blackhating administration and at this writing not a single black candidate was elected leon ewing has contested the election and asked for a recount this is too badto put it mildly the contradictions are too great revolutionary politics has nothing to do with voting anyway but if we enter electoral politics we should follow the simple formula that every black person is a potential vote and must be welcomed and treated as such with or without dashiki with or without natural i the latent militarism of the artistic community is even more despicableart and the military have always been traditionally opposed we saw the epitome of the new alliance at the recent black_power conference at philadelphia every artist worth his salt had a military wing attached to him the conference had guards the artists had guards the guards had guards even one of the highlights of the conference to me was karengas guards complaining about stanfords guards this is foolish because it has already been proven beyond a reasonable doubtwith the murders of martin_luther_king jr and robert kennedythat anybody the honkie wants to take off he not only can but will whenever and however he wants to stage it the artistguard syndrome seems to center around the impression we can make with the various communities the artist impresses the white community with his militancy and the guards impress the black community with their power its a sick syndrome with again the black community being the loser there is no cause for wonder that the black community is withdrawing from involvement with the black artist watching soul which appears on educational tv in new york the same simplistic crap was taking place soul is funded by the rockefeller foundation and the negro ensemble company is funded by the ford foundation yet the people on soul after giving barbara ann teer credit for founding nec put it down as not being black enough and the last poets which is probably a truer title than they know performed die nigga its just not the same concept as kill it would seem to me that the most important and valid aspect of cultural nationalism would be the support of other black cultural ventures especially since one cultural function is funded by the same white folks who fund the group being put down since black people are going to look at tv they should look at julia diahann carroll is prettier ie more valid than doris day any day of the year and while the idea of cops is bad to me period and extralegal black cops are even worse if black people are going to watch cops shows on tv then mod squad beats the other white vigilante shows and if spy is indeed as ive been told the new lone ranger then bill cosby by becoming the new tonto should help make us aware that we are the indians of this decade the parallel institutions that we hear so much about must certainly have reached their apex with spy for love of ivy is as fine a movie as weve had since nothing but a man and its certainly more valid to us than planet of the apes space oddessy and those other white things we are forced to watch it would sometimes appear some elements of the black artistic community are against popular success unless its theirs sidney poitier has moved into the area where we have said we want actors to goonly we didnt mean and make money i guess everybody knows guess whos coming to dinner is a bad movie but it is neither the beginning nor the end of poitiers career and the righteous indignation we spout is really quite out of place black people will soon quit listening to us if we cant get in tune with them i would imagine its a question of wigs everybody has done his wig poem and wig play you know where we put black people down for not having taken care of business but what we so easily forget is our own wig while we put down commercially successful artists we scramble to the east side to work we fight for spots on tv we move our plays downtown at the first chance we getwe do the very things we say are not to be done just because our hair is natural doesnt mean we dont have a wig we are niggersinresidence at white universities and talk about voting as a means to take over a city then put james brown down for supporting hubert humphrey its all a wig we obviously have no concept of power because if we did wed recognize that the power of black people forced james brown to go natural everybody cant come up through the civil_rights movement cause it just doesnt exist any more when black boys and girls from mississippi to massachusetts write jb letters complaining about this is my country too or was that a john a williams book then we ought to rejoice that brown changes his position the people we purport to speak for have spoken for themselves we should be glad and its not as thoughif we just like to complainthere isnt an abundance of issues to complain about what was john coltrane doing with music that make some people murder him why isnt otis reddings plane brought up from the lake what about the obvious tieups in the murders of john and robert kennedy with martin_luther_kings death what elements in this country conspired to murder both richard wright and ben bella what did malcolm and nkrumah say to each other that caused one to die and the other to be overthrown why have so many arabs and people of arab descent been recently arrested for murder or conspiracy to commit murder and id like to know what the cultural nationalists think about james forman living with a white woman who has borne his children controlling and directing sncc while stokely married to a black woman was kicked out these are cultural questionsrelating to survival but it sometimes seems that the only thing that culturalists care about is assuring themselves and the various communities that they are the vanguard of the black revolution they have made black women the new jews while they remain the same old nigeers we c w have got to do better than this our enemy is the new york times not the amsterdam news its look and life not ebony and we ought to keep our enemv in sight if were going to talk about parallel institutions then we have to recognize the parallel institutions we have it is just not possible to have a crisis of negro intellectualism unless we recognize that negro intellectualism exists young writers ought to recognize that an old writer cant put down other old writers to our benefit a nonswimmer flailing around in a turbulent lake is sometimes better left to drown than that swimmers in trying to save him should go under also this may however be a personal decision one of the main points id like the culturalists to remember is that the jews had over art festivals while in concentration camps the warsaw ghetto itself became the cultural placetoplay until the germans carted them off and while it pleases me to know that we are making cultural strides it also worries me that we are failing to make political connections poems are nice but as don l lee points out they dont shoot no bullets we must as marvin x says read our own poems as a group we appear to be vying with each other for the title brother and sister black that will not get us our freedom poor people have always known they are black as rap brown pointed out just as poor honkies have always known they are white these are facts we need to know where our community is going and to give voice to that the onyx conference recently showed just how far from the community we had strayed we didnt even want people there who werent artists and while onyx will probably come out with an issue now that they have properly impressed the proper people we are in grave danger of slipping away from our roots the new hustle starting with claude brown and brought to its finest point by eldridge cleaver and bobby seale with their hustle of huey newton in hueys biography serialized by that great known black militant magazine ramparts seems to be who can get the ear of the enemv for enough money andor prestige to float on a pink damn cloud to the concentration camps everyone who is breathing easy now that wallace wasnt elected ought to check againthats gas youre smelling artistand it will take more than a black poem or your black seed in me to rid this country of it organizational development in the black community by clifford e darden urban ghettos have often been comjm pared to underdeveloped countries in that widespread poverty poor housing inadequate educational opportunities low health standards and general powerlessness of the inhabitants tend to characterize both to varying degrees in underdeveloped countries much thought and effort has gone into tracking the vital role which institutions and organizations of all kinds have in the development process there has been little comparable examination of the organization of the ghetto in most of the studies being debated the focus has been on individual ghetto residents aggregated into the percentage that are unemployed poorly housed poorly educated etc while this approach is useful for some purposes it completely ignores the organizational life of the ghetto were it not for the fact that black people must for the most part organize themselves collectively in order to achieve the degree of political economic and communal power desired this lack of attention to ghetto organizations would not be very distressing in real it v however the collective energies of black people have played and will continue to play the major role in the economic political and social transformation of black americans in the united states in a time of great uncertainty and confusion one observation seems only too valid progress in all important spheres will necessitate increasing organizational abilitv and skill on the part of the black people it behooves us then to take a more critical look at the current status of organizational development in the ghetto this paper will focus on the basic problems which tend to impede the efficient and effective operation of organizations which are created to deliver collective responses to collective needs and problems the current status of organizational development in the black community could best be characterized as being in the takeoff stage the crucial element of determination to do something about the many ills that afflict black people is now evident in every ghetto across the nation we now see scores of organizations moving on and off the local scene as more or less conscious and purposeful responses to perceived community needs nearly all of these organizations are encountering problems some of which should be briefly discussed historically the most stable and influential organization that affected the largest portion of the black community was the black church this is not to say that the black church was the only organization of any significance in the black community certainly there were others however the black church was unquestionably the most universal of black organizations it existed in nearly every community where there were sufficient numbers of blacks with religious leanings and in those days before the development of intensive black consciousness the number of blacks without religious leanings was insignificant this was before blacks cared about the typical portrayal of christ as a white anglosaxon the black church focused mainly on the nonmaterial aspects of the lives of black people and attempted to soothe and sing away the very real and mundane problems of being poor and black in america it wasnt that the black church wasnt cognizant of the misery and poverty that permeated black ghettos on the contrary these facts were dramatized each sunday when people had to shout and afterwards when collection was taken shouting was a way for blacks to release some of the tensions and burdens which cropped up during the first six days of the week it was a way of giving behavorial vent to the frustrations caused by daily misery except in the larger and wealthier parishes the sizes of the sunday collections were sufficient evidence in themselves that the parishioners were already living in hell the black church as an organization was aware of black peoples misery but tended to either minimize or ignore it in many churches black people were told not to worry too much about living decently here on earth heaven would be the reward of those who toiled and suffered throughout their earthly existence so effective was the church in disseminating this emphasis on the afterlife and future rewards in the celestial kingdom that even today we find a large segment of the black populaceespecially the older peoplestill hung up on not attempting to build treasures here on earth but in heaven this type of religious nonsense has reinforced a lifestyle that can be characterized as essentially fatalistic it is difficult to convey to some blacks the idea that one does not have to leave this world in just as wretched a condition as one came into it all too often many blacks act as if god himself prescribed the pattern and perimeters of their lives and that to attempt to alter these prescriptions would be futile not to mention contrary to his will now the black community finds itself in a transition stage which came on the heels of the great civil_rights movement we are caught between the moribund ethos of fatalism and the nascent ideology of black_poweror progressivism if you wish but old lifestyles which were so deeply ingrained do not die quickly and new ones do not take root overnight consequently we find ghetto organizations in which members have varying degrees of both lifestyles these organizations are somewhat schizophrenicexisting in more than one world and reflecting to a great extent the uncertainties and transitional states of the members but there are other factors which must be discussed before the current state of organizational development can be described and accounted for the reasons for the lack of trust and lack of group cohesiveness within black communities are historical various individuals have presented compelling arguments that much of the historical basis for these phenomena lie in the slavemaster relationships which forced blacks to relate to white superiors and to shun close association with black peers for whatever reasons the concepts of trust and group cohesion are not fully operative in most black communities the lack of trust is evident in different ways it shows in the recurring situations in which several leaders have to be on the board of directors of every organization of any import in the community of course other motivessuch as power status and influenceare present also it would seem that many leaders feel that unless they personally oversee every activity in the ghetto things will surely go awry the inability or unwillingness of various leaders to cooperate as equals has dire implications for the form that organizations take and more important for the pace of development march and simon and other social scientists have shown that the limited cognitive abilities of an individual necessitates a differentiation of tasks and a decentralization of decisionmaking authority without such differentiation and decentralization development depends very substantially upon the finite energy and limited skills of a black elite the lack of group cohesion while not as pronounced as it was or years ago is yet another factor which has reverberations in ghetto organizations conflicting ideologies and the lack of trust combine to reinforce the american ideal of individualisman ideal which some blacks have taken far too seriously forgetting that man establishes and sanctifies ideals but seldom behaves in a manner which is consistent with those ideals some blacksfar too manyhave developed the ideology of individualism into a fine art this serves to obscure or negate the need for collective action and commitment to group goals this adherence to the philosophy of me first and everybody else second leads to the interesting and saddening situation in which a black professional to take just one example declines to assist a community organization because he has prior obligationsto his wife his friends and the standards of his professional association it also leads to the disgusting even nauseating spectacle of certain prominent negroes being paraded around the nation by a houndstoothclad richard nixon as living proof that hardwork and individual effort are still the keys to success this lack of group cohesion is also at least partly responsible for the large number of violent crimes which black people perpetrate against other blacks one would be naive indeed to suppose that salutations of brother and sister have had an appreciable effect on the numbers of heinous offenses which occur each day in ghettos across the nation it would appear that the same system which bred the ghetto has set in motion forces which threaten to make a mockery of all the external shows of unity and brotherhood it is not so much that most black people do not recognize the mutuality of their interests and the commonness of their destiny rather it is that no one person or organization seems capable of sustaining for long periods of time the group effect which is the logical answer to group problems to turn to the influences exerted by ideologies we could if it were necessary classify them along several different dimensions but it is most useful for our purposes to note simply different ideologies do exist and then go on to show how these ideologies affect the performance of organizations the national convention of the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp provides a ready example at that convention a heated debate arose at one point as to whether the organization had been and was still effective in fomenting change and ushering in progress for black people there were those who argued that much had been done and that black people were too close to their goals to turn aside an opposing faction retorted quite sincerely that black people were just as far away as ever from their goals and not a few individuals declared that the naacp had actually moved blacks backwards from where they were several years earlier implicit in the arguments of each faction were different sets of goals and priorities based upon different ideological perspectives this example merely points out the organizational difficulties that arise when several conflicting ideologies are operative in one organization such ideological debates are not peculiar to the naacp recent months have witnessed an increasing number of fiery confrontations between various groups of ideologists within the same organization those community organizations which have thus far escaped the heat of such debates should not feel that they are beyond the danger zone ideological confrontations have a way of rudely imposing themselves upon organizational pacificity ideologies can be useful to the extent that they give purpose direction and even feelings of moral excellence to an organization but like a person an organizaiton cannot go in two or three different directions simultaneously when the ideologies of its constituents become so divergent that the performance of the whole unit is impaired one of several things will occur the organization will become ineffective until the strongest of the ideologies subdues the others or the organization will suffer a defection andor expulsion of those who cannot implant their ideology upon the total unit especially the decisionmaking center or the adherents to all contesting ideologies will continue to battle until the whole organization is reduced to but a caricature of that which existed initially one has but to look around to observe these three processes in action within any number of black organizations it is on the subject of ideology that we wish to proceed into a discussion of organizational development in the economic realm of black communities a word of caution is appropriate here the reader is asked to remember that these characterizationslike all such generalizationsare necessarily but rough approximations to reality and are not presented as the ultimate truth about ghetto organizational development this is but one way of ordering our understanding of how black organizations are faring in the initiation and implementation of change and progress one of the most intriguing developments in the black community is the dilemma over whether to push for progress via community development corporations and the like or via individual entrepreneurs there are several issues involved in this choice the dilemma revolves around the issues of widespread participation by the black community in its own development the psychological and sometimes economic needs of the entrepreneur to do his own thing without the bother of seeking the approval of the community the peculiar criteria by which the white financial source decides to extend or withhold credit and the often critical tradeoff between shortterm purely economic gain and longerterm investment in human resources which ensures future successes or both economic and noneconomic natures the black entrepreneur is a new breed of aggressive energetic black capitalist in his struggle to build a successful enterprise he is both helped and hindered by a wide spread belief within the black community that black capitalism which has been called a contradiction of termsshould not be allowed to replace the oppressive system of white capitalism this belief forces the typical black entrepreneur to modify his operations to provide broad social service eg training for the unskilled daycare centers for working mothers etcfor his employees and others in the community the black entrepreneur is helped to the extent that his provision of or his statement of his intentions to provide social services enables him to obtain loans and even equity capital which would not normally be available to him the tendency of white bankers and other capital suppliers to base loan decisions to black entrepreneurs on criteria such as how much social development will accrue to the community as a result of the operations make it expedient for the shrewd black entrepreneur to devise paper schemes for social services in order to obtain needed capital there are obvious dangers inherent in this situation first a community which is already suspicious of this new phenomenon of black capitalism and of the intentions of black entrepreneurs is likely to monitor very closely the progress of these persons in providing promised social services failures of black entrepreneurs to deliver is already creating increased disaffection for capitalism and entrepreneurship as vehicles for black development second the management talents of black entrepreneurs are already being severely taxed to create and sustain efficient and profitable operations black entrepreneurs see themselves as businessmen not as social workers and they resent efforts by white financiers and black community leaders to force them to assume social service obligations they have had enough contact with bankers and sources of capital to realize that white businessmen obtain their loans throueh sound economic policies which appear on the financial statements and not through their willingness and ability to provide social services most black entrepreneurs have neither the time nor the personnel to fulfill social service promises any time and resources devoted to running a nursery center are resources unavailable for use in the economic sphere of the operations hence black entrepreneurs are involved in a very complex game of trying to operate like any other businessman in a community and financial environment in which they must appear to be more than just businessmen third white financiers through their strange insistence upon seeing a proposal for social services before they lend to black entrepreneurs are burdening the entrepreneur with the problems previously mentioned perahps it is to the white establishments advantage to do so in a very real sense they are encouraging a dangerous con game only the black entrepreneur and the black community can lose it is not the financing source that has to walk that delicate line which separates in the communitys mind exploitation from development all of this is not to say that black entrepreneurs are insensitive to the need for social services in the ghetto nor is this to say that they are not in agreement with the longrun goals of the community black entrepreneurs are as concerned as anyone else about the lack of social services in the ghetto but they question whether they as fledgling businessmen are the ones upon whom the responsibility falls for providing such services they rightly ask why it is that the black community does not put more pressure on city and state and other governmental units to provide for the welfare of community residents black capitalists voice fears that the black community will never build a solid business structure if wouldbe businessmen are shackled by noneconomic burdens so far we have dealt with only the environmental factors which constrain the black entrepreneur looking now at the internal operations of entrepreneurdominated organizations we can see that he faces the problems in a different sort first the entrepreneur dominates the organizationbeing at once its guiding spirit its designer its key man and its primary politician he usually moves at such a rapid pace that his ideas outstrip the ability of his skeletal organization to structure itself to absorb the new undertakings thus the typical entrepreneurdominated organization is likely to be undermanned illdefined and crisisprone because of the lack of sufficient numbers of trained black managers in the ghetto and elsewhere the entrepreneur finds it difficult to hire the persons he needs to develop his organization this is one of his chief organizational problems entrepreneurs are not noted for their ability to develop the organizations necessary to manage the new enterprises that they pull together usually their time is fully occupied in just negotiating the acquisition or development of new operations and not infrequently this is the activity they enjoy most can the entrepreneurs organization survive let alone grow in the absence of trained managers to supervise the operations if it does it will do so mainly because of its adeptness in riding out crises many entrepreneurs lack even the staff necessary to maintain efficient accounting systems hence they seldom know what their profitability cash positions etc are at any point in time perhaps the greatest difficulty the black entrepreneur faces is conflict with representatives of the community over the issue of com munity participation in the development process this conflict is of course ideological in nature briefly many community leaders want to involve as large a portion of the ghetto as possible in the planning and implementation of change and developmentpolitical economic and social they argue that black people have for too long sat and let others do for and to them and that a community which helps draw the blueprints for its own development will be committed to the execution of that blueprint going beyond the participationcommitment argument community leaders argue that the low level of selfconfidence and skills among ghetto residents necessitates a development program which actually trains and educates the residents as an integral part of the process in short it is an argument for total development with the emphasis on human resources a fast pace of economic development is not the primary goal of most community leaders because they realize that such a fast pace may outdistance the participation of the majority of the community residents against the model for economic development which the black capitalist represents many community leaders offer the community development corporation as a more desirable model the community development corporation cdc is held to be the organizational mechanism by which blacks can develop a sense of mastery over their immediate environment both physical and human and over their destiny as a people the sense of mastery which a strong cdc is deemed capable of developing is important because it facilitates constructive participation from all community residents the cdc can and does take many different organizational forms nevertheless there is a common theme which distinguishes the cdc from other organizations in the economic realm it is the theme of broad ownership of the organizations enterprises and of course participation in the decisionmaking processes of the cdc accompanies the theme of broad ownership the cdc allows community residents more than just a fraction of the ownership and a voice in the direction of development under this form of economic organization it is also possible for residents to acquire new job skills and to upgrade existing skills because the community at large has more decisionmaking authority in the cdc than in the private black corporation the community is more effective in forcing the cdc to be more responsive to the noneconomic needs of the people frequently the cdc is involved in economic ventures solely because of the noneconomic objectives that are made possible thereby thus the cdc promotes the development of skills and confidence throughout the community against these advantages there are several problems of the cdc first the recruitment and motivation of topnotch administrators and staff personnel is not easy because of the many attractive jobs which private corporations offer it takes a person with a real sense of dedication to the cdc approach to forego attractive opportunities elsewhere second the cdc official has to be able to deal with that sometimes nebulous usually contradictory and always changing entity called the community it is sometimes quite distressing to discover that the communityor the body of persons interested in wielding influencevaries from issue to issue and from decision to decision the cdc official must accept his role as a servant of the community yet he has to relate to a variety of governmental and private organizations in order to accomplish the cdcs objectives his job is not an easy one because he is highly visible and often subject to the sometimes whimsical will of the community to complicate matters even more the community usually contains strong factions of nearly every ideology that the combined civil_rights and black_power movements have produced the cdc official has to be agile and thickskinned in order to ward off the poison darts that are occasionally hurled by the various factions another serious problem that the cdc official has is that of trying to balance community education and training with economic objectives the cdc loosely defined is a school a social service agency and a business the administrator has to be astute in directing the organizations energies among these several tasks he has to make the decision whether to call in experts or let the community do it through trial and error for example he has to know when to contract with outside firms to build a needed shopping center and when to create a subsidiary which will train blacks to build it this is the type of tradeoff between shortterm and longterm advantages which must be made in organizations with multifaceted objectives finally cdcs face financial problems not only is the government sometimes a rather capricious source of capital and operating funds but it is also an entity which responds most readily to strong political pressures and it is still true that the strongest political pressuresthose that make public bodies actexist outside the black community in most instances administrators of cdcs are not infrequently caught between the mandate of the community and the restrictions imposed by governmental funding sources at the crux of such binds is the determination of black communities to control their own destiny and the reluctance of public bodies to accede control however as it becomes increasingly difficult for political bodies to control the actions of the black community this bind will become less problematical and cdc administrators will devote less time to complex political battles with outside agencies will the cdc form of development work community leaders argue that it will work because black people have faith in it and because the people will demand an ever increasing role in the whole development process many assert that unless the peoples voices are heard in the development process increased alienation and bitterness will result the people ultimately have ways of eliminating that which is unacceptable and alienating it remains to be seen whether economic development in the black community will take the organizational form of black capitalism or community capitalism in either case it behooves us to be clear about the organizational choices and consequences of those choices it appears certain that the black community years hence will reflect greatly the types of organizational decisions being made by black people today a short storu by walter myers t had taken two minl i utes at the most he standing at the regis ter with the woman as she stuffed the money into a brown paper bag and jeff turner standing with a gun on the man something had happened maybe the man moved a little too quickly and jeff shot him down the old man fell his silver rimmed glasses dangling from his face by one ear his hands crossed in front of him the woman screamed and fell down on her knees next to her husband and began to moan quickly began to moan as if she had been waiting for something to happen and had been saving the moan moses looked over the counter and saw the man lying there the blood creeping across his white apron front his face trying to hold a twist of agony and even then it was slipping away then he was still one knee still up and one hand pointed towards the beer freezer they used to ask down where he came from in biloxi how long forever was and they used to answer two to foteen years for a nigger two to foteen years the first time that moses had come up for parole after seven years the other guys had said that he might as well forget it it was an automatic turndown maybe if he had just killed a nigger it would have been different but not a white man when moses walked in they were sitting around the big dark mahogany table laughing and joking among themselves and he had thought they might be in a good mood he said that he was sorry about the guy that was killed and that he hadnt actually done it that jeff turner had actually done the shooting and that he had given evidence for the state it didnt matter they said no and it all seemed so fast after waiting for seven years and the next time he had asked them please to give him another chance and even got down on his knees making the guard nervous and begged them as hard as he could but they said no again he had to stay somebody said it wasnt as much time to go as had already past that night sitting in the corner on the stool was as long as he remembered his whole life being all the guys said that they might give him a chance the next time around if he kept himself straight he intended to do just that he had to get out he was beginning to forget how things were on the outside what mornings felt like and what just running loose was like and how good food used to taste on sundays and he didnt know whether he remembered how a woman really felt or just remembered himself remembering a few years back he thought of himself in the country in mississippi near biloxi or laurel getting his high tops wet in the morning before the air cleared from the dampness his mother was still in biloxi waiting come on home she wrote before death gets here and take me moses wanted to see his mama again that was for sure he hadnt seen her since then and that was a long time he was nearly now a long piece gone from being a boy well it was going to come up again his chance for being free and everyone told him that he would be let go this time for sure even when he had done some work for the warden the warden m had said for him to keep clean because he had a chance to be free this time when the warden said that he went back to his cell and looked at himself deep in the mirror he was still black and walleyed but he was going to be free bbs hey nigger i hear you going home in a few months what made the guard jenkins so sinister was his eyes almost colorless in his pale face dont call me no nigger man moses kept his head down what should i call you whitey i got a name moses hated working under jenkins it seemed that every time he did jenkins pushed him a little harder he finished putting the last of the old library books in the carton to be taken to the incinerator what kind of man did you kill nigger i didnt kill nobody you in for murder aint you moses didnt answer i said you in for murder aint you jenkins raised his voice and edged forward you want this box tied or should i just carry it like this tie it moses turned to tie the box he had just looped the rope around the box once when he felt the pain in his crotch a wave of nausea swept over him as he sank to the ground in a second he was up turned and faced jenkins he crouched low hands spread apart come on nigger hit me youll have about years to think about it so make it a good one come on shine im gonna tell on you jenkins moses breathed deeply his chest heaving his eyes glued to jenkins im gonna tell the warden on you what the other guards gonna think if you tell the warden on me huh they gonna think you some bad nigger and they gonna have to get you right right moses knew that jenkins was right if there was anything at all against him even if there was some question to it he might not get his parole he picked up the box and started off to the incinerator jenkins walked behind him sliding his feet as he walked i hear you going to do some work over at the wardens office next week moses didnt answer you aint talky huh well i tell you one thing i bet that nigger clerk that williams that you wouldnt make probation this time bet him five dollars he didnt want to bet but i said whats wrong dont want to bet on your own race he bet then man he sure hates being a nigger he thinks hes gonna get white brownnosing around the guards anyhow i bet him so naturally you aint gonna get out moses stopped at the incinerator and handed over the box of books to the burning squad books from the library any good ones the dark slimfaced youth asked yeah some real hot ones jenkins answered come on we got more work to do we got to go over to the plant room and wipe up real good i got to go to the bathroom moses said now thats just too bad come on or ill write you up for sloughing off i got to go and that aint no damn sloughing off you raise your voice to me one more time and im gonna beat your ass silly nigger long as you got that uniform you can meet me some day when im free free you aint never gonna hear that word long side your name nigger i keep telling you that why you have to insist on disbelieving me they reached the plant room and jenkins signed the sheet for the guard to open the door there was a phone inside the plant room that the guard would use when they were finished only one of the huge generators was operating see all that oil on the floor over there go clean it up moses had cleaned the plant room before he went over to the sawdust box and filled the small scoop from it with this he started spreading it all over the oil watching it bead up around the sawdust tell me about the guy you killed nigger you know we dont have to talk about it jenkins thems prison rules moses hardly had the words out when jenkins club smashed across the small of his back the pain searing down the back of his legs he turned and grabbed the stick jenkins was only a foot away from him his thin lips tightened into a smile hit me nigger moses released the stick look jenkins i aint done nothing to you why dont you give me a break tell me about the guy you killed he was just a guy why did you kill him i didnt kill him you in jail cause you didnt kill him he slapped moses the sound was lost against the noise of the generator the guy i was with shot him was he white or black the guy you shot i didnt shoot him he was black moses lied you know what i saw the other day nigger what i saw that made my damn blood boil just leave me alone will you look i get three dollars when i sell my blood next week ill give you that ill tell you what i saw i saw that nigger with the bald head that big nigger on h block screwing a white boy you mean jake thats his name jake dont go that way you know jake dont go that way you calling me a liar i aint call you a liar why dont you give me a break when the last time you had some had some what some woman moses turned and continued spreading sawdust on the floor the next morning at breakfast the warden came around and talked to some of the men he did once in a while when he came over near moses he walked so fast that moses didnt have a chance to say anything to him i got chewed out about how that plant room wasnt properly cleaned they accusing me of sloughing off cause you didnt clean it good jenkins prodded moses along towards the plant house with his stick you tole me to stop moses protested shut your ugly black face nigger jenkins signed the paper to get into the plant house as soon as the door shut behind them he hit moses across the back with his stick big as you are nigger you aint nothing you hear that you aint nothing moses was already on the way to the saw dust bin you married no you got a mama yeah she put out you dont have the right to be talking about nobodys name whats wrong with you you supposed to be a guard and you ever have a white woman no you lying bastard i bet you picked up some white tramp someplace moses finished spreading the sawdust and started sweeping the floor you can tell me what was it like was it any different aint no use to being sullen lord moses thought dont let me get next to that man tell me about it and maybe ill lighten up a little moses continued to sweep he saw jenkins coming near and stiffened for the blow jenkins swung his stick again and again catching moses on his shoulders and arms moses tried to cover up his head and jenkins lifted a knee into his crotch moses fell to his knees he saw jenkins foot coming again but he couldnt move fast enough as it sank into his stomach dont hit him back he warned himself the foot came again always in the same place moses tried to curl up again again from the back and again until moses couldnt see until the nausea was more than anything else until his crying and helplessness shamed even him until he thought again about getting his high tops wet in the mississippi long grass at last it stopped and moses lay listening to the awful sound of his own breathing the sweat dripped from his face and the taste of puke was strong in his mouth somewhere in the back of his consciousness the generator grumbled like a brewing storm moses tried to stop his head from clearing he felt as if something was touching his knee sliding along his thigh fumbling with the front of his pants there was another sound quiet even close to his ear it took him a long while to realize that it was jenkins crouching over him hitting jenkins was more than good god it was glorious and every time that the thin white face jerked away from his fists every time that the eyes rolled to the top of his head so that only the white showed every time the blood spurted from the twisted nose and the face reddened moses felt better it was as if a great burden had been lifted from him and there was no use in stopping just because the figure in front of him was still no freedom had gone with the first blow and there was no use in stopping now until the swinging arm black and muscular could swing no more now the frenzied rhythm of a moment ago had slowed to an occasional smack against the inert figure that moses held across his lap then even that stopped and it was quiet for a while almost solemn in the stillness and then moses laughed him a laugh and once he had started there wasnt much use to stopping the magic word by stephen henderson hats right i y sent the letter thats rightdavis im pease t f meet you too one of you can sit here by the bed one of you can sit here heres the ash tray thanks fresh out and i still dont feel like much walking thats all right the nurse wont mind good now ill tell you the whole thing and all im asking is that you print it like it is i told you how they messed it up down here first of all most people didnt like himthe prof we called himbut he was really some guy he was brilliant if you ask me but he was strange and strange looking very tall all angles you know with a long bony face frankly if you didnt know otherwise youd take him for a white man in fact many people did say that he was white maybe he was but like i always say i dont see why a white man would want to be a negro in fact sometimes i dont see why anybody would want to course thats one of the funny things about prof he didnt have to be a negro but he said he was fact he was always trying to convince you that he was or trying to convince himself i dont know i swear he made you more race conscious than anybody i know and you never knew how to take him he was always making you mad calling you out of your namein class too man and you couldnt ignore him believe me hed read you right theredumb nigger you know the magic word and he didnt give a damn i think the administration was scared of him either that or they knew he was a heavy stud but like i said you couldnt ignore him one time i was downtown with a couple of fellows waiting for the bus and it was kinda crowded like everybody in town was waiting white folks too you know when up walks the damn prof togged to kill man continental and all that and you should see the gray chicks diggin him well here he is towering all over everybody like a great big playboy ad and what does he do as soon as he spots us he says hello spooks whats happening real jazzy like you know and the white folks looking all silly man because he knows us they dont know whether to laugh or to crap so we sort of talk for a while till he takes out this paper the afronyou know what i mean and starts talking about spooksl man i got so damn mad i liked to hit him and here he was enjoying it and all the patties were just looking man but they were squirming too he liked to make people squirm he told me so we got to be kinda tight after i left his class he kinda took to me i dont know why maybe because im real dark man like charcoalgray anyhow he told me that this whole business about race was stupid and the only way to destroy it was to embarrass people out of their pride well he had a good point and he had all kinds of arguments real convincing too and i think it was then that i halfway got to understand him he was always stirring up stuff though you know he nearly caused a riot downtown in one of the theaters he was with this fay girl see and this indian couple came in and sat down by him man he started to perform you know talking about niggers and mess like that so the indian guy jumped up and started lecturing on american hypocrisy and the ushers came over and everybody was raising cain and all the time the girl was trying to tell him honey they arent niggers theyre foreigners then suddenly the prof said well i didnt know youall were really liberal anyhow he said real loud i just want you to know that im a negro they didnt believe him of course that made him mad goddamn it he shouted im a negro a niggah a bootunderstand a darky the people just laughed at him then he turned to the girl look baby doll im a nigger a greasy spook see and you been sucking my tongue all day that did it they almost wrecked the place i dont know how he got out alive that was his favorite story and the white papers gave it about five lines he was a heckuva fellow and like i said didnt nobody like him worth a damnbut me and a couple other kids and i guess what we liked was the way hed go around popping egosyou ever put a cigarette to a tick anyhow like thatpoptake the dean well hes a good stud but hes the pious type you know always getting up in assembly with the glad tidings and the harkbacktothe religious ideals of the foundingfathers mess anyhow he called the prof in they say to talk to him about going to chapel and all that the prof put a whole lot of points on him so he left him alone for a while well something else comes uplisten im gonna tell it like it is same thing happens everywhere elsewell i tell you some of these campus broads had eyes for the prof so they put a little pressure on him and my man started chopping right and left it caused a big mess but they hushed it up and put him on probation and all that the way they do in big time but they couldnt hush up the chicks though and he had a tough rep with the ladyfolks yessir anyhow next thing i heard he was chopping the deans ole lady no lie man it was something terrible like i dont know why they didnt get rid of the cat anyhow the dean called him in but the prof told him if he didnt leave him alone hed you know make the ole babe quit him and like that yeah man he got into a whole lot of stuff rough parties and things you know that guy even married a prostitute no lie ugly chick toospitterpure scheaffers anyhow he brought her to all the concerts and art festivals and things like that and made people respect her and they did because they were afraid of him and he got a big charge out of it then when he got tired he put the broad down said she was cutting out on him as if he gave a damn well that gives you some ideas of what he was like except that every now and then if you could put up with him you could see that he was just jiving i remember the time i saw him down in the bottom talking with a bunch of tough looking kids i know they were tough i used to live down there he was just cutting up laughing and kidding with them and they were kidding him just having a ball he didnt see meill never forget that id never even seen him smile before that is a friendly smile and here he was laughing like mad and you know one thing he used to dance with those kids he knew it allmambo chacha stroll rubberleg madison shimmy everything he really goofed behind music guys like bartok and miles and thelonious monk you know he really dug sounds some times you know wed go to his place and sit down on this stray pad he had on the floor and hed give us peanuts and syrup and sometimes dates and wed you know try to dig too i and i forgot to tell you the cat could lecture too no lie you name it he knew it i mean really knew it i mean like hed tie up guys who were specialists visiting lectures and folks like that and he was always giving the papers the ass he was a terrible terrible cat i guess he must have been around or so but he looked younger sometimes sometimes he looked older it was hard to place him like ive been saying all along he seemed to change according to the angle that you saw him from or the situation that you saw him in one time i got the feeling that he hadnt made up his mind at all and that he was just trying on selves for size i dont know i had a weird conversation with him about three months before the happenings and it left me confused for a long time but as i think about it now it helped me to realize what was what not only about the prof but about a whole lot of things we were over at his place sipping a lil tea and feeling nice when he starts talking you know halfway to himself first then to me about the situation somehow he always got around to it i was tired of it but i didnt want to hurt the guys feelings so i listened at him take up the white mans burden kid he hasnt got the courage to take it up himselfnot the burden of empire the burden of conscience we are the worlds conscience now as the jew used to be yeah year i was real nice man he could talk all he wanted to remember jesus and simon the cyrene i looked at him well there you have it two ways the nigger taking the white mans burden but also jesus the eternal nigger carrying the burden of the world simon was really riding christs back as we all have done but simon earned the right he was a nigger too he was making me mad but i kept my cool and kept sipping the tea as i said before you cant ignore him baby he keeps pressing you he was very solemn your niggemess is divine boy its the best damn part of you im not a nigger i said i was still cool no he said youre not a nigger youre a negro a colored person thats right youre a damn fool he snapped but maybe one day youll grow up and be a nigger look at me im serious a man has to develop into a nigger hes not born that way the nigger is not necessarily a negro you know the negro is not unique in fact he has no real existence hes just a sunburnt savage or some white mans shadow wherever you find him but the nigger hes alive hes real webster says nigger is a vulgar and contemptuous name for a negro thats what webster says but how would he know he wasnt a nigger nigger is more than a name nigger is a state of being i was mad enough to puke well its a state i dont dig i see you dontso what does nigger mean to you anyhow dont you knowit means that nobody gives a damn about you cause youre black they despise you they spit on you lynch you say you stink you steal youre oversexed youre dumb yes now what about the negroes who call themselves niggers they mean the same thing sometimes he said sometimes they dont when a guy calls his wife nigger he means something else or when he tells nigger jokes where the spook is always outfoxing the white man and chopping the fay chicks nigger means lots of things well nigger means just one thing to the white man a black ape with rheumatism in the joint he smiled curiously yes now why is the white man so fascinated by that image ill tell you why it both repels and attracts him why because its the image of his lost manhood the image of his own primitive amoral self with all its brawling black fecundity oh jesus i thought its the eternal image of the dark force within us the force that civilization is destroying the force with many namesthe devil chango dionysus bacchus the fisher king the green knight gargantua osiris buddha and last but not least jesus christ youre crazy im not talking about your sweet lil blueeyed jesus im talking about jesus the tiger yeah some jazz black jesus the tiger well if he was so much of a tiger why didnt he make like samson instead of acting like a punk youre very young he said sarcastically the fact that he didnt make like samson made him superior to samson he didnt make like samson no he made like a nigger oh man i got up im sick of all this niggerness im cutting i thought you were perceptive he said but youre just like the rest youre sick of the niggerness so youre cutting all right then cut but where the hell are you cutting toill tell you to be a shadow a clown holding your whiteness before you like a mask well the mask doesnt fool anybody but yourself because when mr charley sees you he doesnt see your mask at all he sees a mirror if hes benevolent he sees you as his own smug reflection if hes not he sees through the mirror sees his real self in you and what he sees terrifies him he hates it and scorns it and spits at it because he doesnt have the courage to accept it as himself all right old mirrorhead cut i stared at him he was talking a whole lot of crazy stuff i thought he was blowing his stack but he was real solemn id never seen him like that before thats a trick mirror too by the way he said it also reflects inward and you can also see through it quite tricky boy you can see in it and through it it shows you all kinds of things but its damn sure hard to tell which ones are you i gave him one hard mad look and made it i didnt see much of him after that as i said i was fed up with all that niggerness after all i came to college to get myself an education to make something out of myself hell i wasnt ashamed of being colored and all that but i didnt consider myself any goddamn nigger i dont care what mr charley thought all the shooting and cutting and crapping and raping and scraping i was sick of all that shit i mean damn sick like the man says sick unto death jack and i wanted to rise above that i wanted to be somebody after i got my degrees and things people would respect me well thats what i thought then that was two weeks ago i was young then yeah baby im serious yeah im just but like im now since what happened you dont just chop off pieces of yourself like the prof said and you have to look real hard in the mirror and through the mirror and in all the goddamn mirrors that come flitting your way yeah i guess that if a fay cat calls me a nigger now i wouldnt get mad at all id just kinda look at him and smile anyhow the last time i saw him was at the sitins you remember thats what you wanted to hear about anyway it was a nice day in november when our kids got in on the act we had been reading about the action down in north carolina and thought that maybe we could jolt some egos here in virginia so after this big secret campus rally we slipped downtown and jack we struck hit six stores the first day the white folks were surprised they thought there was an invasion from mars or something and cops were swarming all over the streets with the k mutts ready to chew up any black butt they could but i have to give them credit they didnt mess with us fact they protected us but you could see that they werent too particular we had all kinds of signs you know like the real thingdont eat where you cant buy support our cause segregation is unchristian and stuff like that the kids really trooped out starryeyed and dignified as hell thats the thing that surprised the white folks you know the dignity and the way the kids dressed you know real collegiate they didnt dig that at all man they really must think were a pack of savages all the papers you know well dressed well behaved you know stuff like that man they dont know whats happening these kids tog all the time and theyre just like any other kids it really made you feel good to see them sticking together like that course ill tell you the truth some of those guys didnt really dig the movement you see passive resistance in fact i didnt really dig it not because i was chicken or stupid or anything like that but i have a heckuva temper man and i didnt know whether i could stand listening to some mudgy fudgy call me nigger to my face ill tell you something else wasnt a christian even so the reasoning behind it you know the brotherhood jive well that didnt move me at all anyhow here i was in the mess man im always in the mess anyhow we split up and went to about six stores like i told you we sat down at the counters and tried to order stuff but the babes wouldnt serve us just stood there acting silly trying to pretend that we werent there at all man that really peed me offthey just give you that blank stare like you dont exist its a bitch im telling you i was almost glad when the trouble came first the storemanager came and asked us out we asked him for service he asked us out again so we got out our books and started readingwords you knowi was real tense man my stomach was so upset that i couldntve eaten anything even if they had served me all kinds of weird mess was running through my mind i dont know how we made it but i didnt want to let on like i was nervous we pulled it off for a couple hours then left when we got outside the stuff really started to boil a bunch of young rebs were following us waving reb flags and calling us black niggers and things man i really wanted to get loose but i kept talking to myself kept telling myself about the cause and you know something i started believing in the cause funny man funny there were cops and dogs and reb flags all over everywhere but i wasnt scared anymore not even mad later when i got back to the campus i found out that they had arrested a bunch of the kids that night we gave them a big party next day we started the picket line we had all kinds of rallies and things and everybody kept talking about the cause about the strategy but thats where the hell really started there were about of us in the line it was november baby but hot hotand here we are tramp tramp the spooks are marching and here comes some sonavabitch and throws a block on you and nearly knocks you down now here comes a sweet old lady who turns up her nose like shes smelled something though christ knows she couldve smelled my aching feet and all kinds of expressions on those faces but the worst ones were the blank ones those that didnt pay any attention at all and here you are carrying the goddamn sign not even making a ripple and i thought about the prof and i was digging all the talk about the mirrors and things and i thought to myself that jesus christ himself could be in the picket line and these crackers still wouldnt budge i had been out there for almost an hour absorbing all the jazz when a woman walked up to me and hawked and spat in my lace man i started to swing the sign to cuss to crap to cry but i didnt do anything but try to wipe my face i guess i might even have been crying some i was so mad anyhow i looked up and what the hell did i see abraham lincoln thats rightabraham lincoln you think im crazy i thought i was too everything was getting blurry what kinda crap was this he started talking to me and i thought i was nuts the people passed around us chattering the cars buzzed in the streets and the kids paraded with their signs i was still mad but i could see now that he was phony yet somehow i wasnt sure i wasnt sure of anything as i looked up at him he took out his handkerchief and wiped the snot off my face and said with malice toward none it was the goddamn profi caught his voice with charity for all that big lanky phony that goddamn niggerham lincoln i wanted to cuss him and break the crappy stick over his head he just stood there as though he actually was lincoln then he got in the picket line and nobody paid any attention to him but us but me what was his gimmick was he mocking us again who the hell was the sonofabitch anyhow i was going to ask him first chance i got but as we reached the back of the store a car pulled to the curb and three guys jumped out and started banging on the prof i tried to run round to the front to call the cops but one of them hit me real hard thats all i remember i dont know how we got there but the next thing i remembered was this clearing in the woods somewhere we mustve been a good little ways from the highway because you could barely hear the sound of the cars i was groggy and sick and suddenly i felt this great big throbbing in my skull i put my hand to my head there wasnt any blood but there was a hickey big enough to fool a guinea hen i tried to get up and i fell the bastards had handcuffed my ankles they sure dig the tv i was telling myself wisely and i managed to get to my knees when i realized that somebody was watching me he was tough and tall and red dark hair i remember with the elvis type sideburns the jeans and all the other jazz but no leather jacket just an ordinary gabardine windbreaker he stood with his hands on his hips like an ad for levis or something grinning well now mr niggermr college niggerwe got a surprise for you i didnt say anything i was scared baby no lie say now niggermr nigger we goin fix yall up real fine give you somethin to write home about you like to sit down dont you i stared at him you hear me nigger he kicked me in the chest and laughed when i tumbled over on my back ya wanna sit down next to white women now dont you go on say it say it goddamnit when we through with you you wont wanna sit down for the rest of your goddamn life i mustve looked scared he seemed to get a sudden spasm of satisfactionkicks he took a razor blade out of his pocket and walked up to me and pressed it against my throat and the sweat popped out all over me and i felt this warm trickle down my leg he reared back and roared he was really getting his kicks dont worry mr nigger he said after a while we aint goin kill you just goin make you safe goin make a real man outta you i didnt know what he was talking about but i had read the colored papers and i had ideas and jack i was scared scared sick you rotten mucker fother i was screaming in my mind but the words couldnt get past the vomit from somewhere deep in the woods there came a long animal cry it was the prof theyd done something awful to him i could hear them laughing and cussing they were drunk pretty soon i could hear them coming back to the clearing the dry leaves and things crackling as they walked there must have been about ten or twelve of them two of them were older fellows about one of them had a razor in his hand and another had a dauber that had been dipped in pitch drag him back there with the other one someone said hell do it here let the nigger bleed no dont want no killin just goin fix him up they grabbed me and thats all i remember when i woke up again i couldnt move there was a burning all over my chest and i couldnt move my legs at all like somebody had dropped a big rock on me or something i saw the blood and my stomach gave out i cant stand to see blood i puked all over the place somebody put a wet cloth to my face and my senses started to clear and i saw that it was a cop who did this to you boy he said but i couldnt talk somebody calledit was another copthere were cops all over now they found the prof and brought him out on a stretcher three or four cops gathered around him looking half puzled half amused one of them was finishing the first aid what the hells going on whats the gimmick abe lincoln well he shouldve stayed dead hes in the wrong territory anyhow aw quit it you guys this is some actor type guy looking for publicity he damn sure got it its a goddamn shame theyd denut christ if they caught him talking to niggers this guy is a nigger you kiddin he looks white to me checked his identification didnt help any he had cards for both white and colored their voices were hazy in my mind there was a siren screaming somewhere and dogs barking cops were all over the place i could just see the prof lying there his pants were all bloody and the blood was caked on his face i knew that he wasnt going to make it even with the first aid he was already in shock i retched again but this time i didnt pass out here at the hospital they told me that the hoods didnt have time to rob both my jewels well thats not too bad one is enough but i wasnt worrying about myself i was thinking about the prof and all the crazy things he used to do and just who he really was and why did he want to let himself suffer like that like an animal he didnt have to he couldve told them that he was a white man or something or that he was just trying to gimmick up the niggers picket line it was almost as though he had asked for it what was he trying to prove and who the hell was he and what a hell of a way for a man to die you know i was thinking about that when you guys walked in and you know i was feeling bad man bad then the thought came to me and i dug the whole thing the cat was a nigger yeah baby niggernot nigger like negro but the magic word a by carolyn m rodgers enny loman had enough money to buy two reefers or two pills he wasnt sure which to get he weighed the alternatives the reefers would be mellow he knew where he could cop some good strong grass and he might like the kaleidoscopic effects he got from the weed he felt like digging some coltrane sides tonight but then somebody might be using the gangs layout and he couldnt dig or smoke in peace in that case if he ran by there first to check it out and somebody was thought he there theyd probably ask him what he was going to get into tonight and he would surely end up having to share his jive with someone maybe two or three someones and then he would only have a lightweight high that wouldnt last no time naw he wouldnt do that he could buy the pills that was probably the hippiest thing to do cause fact was you didnt have to do much sharing of them a dude wasnt expected to split em in half and turn somebody else on and everybody knew that one pill made you sick before it made you high so hed have the two pills all to himself but he was wary of them the high was cool except that it made him sleepy and he would go into a nod anywhere any time even while he was talking to someone and especially vice versa and they made him have a loose tired weightless but weighed down feeling then too he had vowed the last time hed had pills not to take any more it had been two weeks ago he remembered what had happened to him he had been on his way downtown to take in a james bond flick met one of his partners lou jean on the kedzie l track lou jean was a poorass puny nigger with no daddy and a parttime momma he had nine sisters and brothers and once benny had seen them fight over two slices of stale bread yeah he had been glad he could help him out they had been partners since last year when they had both got kicked out of school the same day for the same reason gangbanging lou jean had turned him on to two reds and a yellowjack for cents said he needed the dough for something to eat benny had ridden downtown and had stopped at the burger king for a hamburger and some french fries had washed the two reds down with his coke when nobody was looking he had left the walkin and had gone into the roosevelt theatre paid his fare took a seat waited after about minutes he decided to take the yellowjack the reds were too slow he got up and went to the mens room it was empty he took his time and looked into the mirror at his full yellow face he was definitely his mothers child same thick nearly wavy hair and flat nigger nose same heavy set body yeah his mothers genes were as loud and dominant as her voice for a few moments he tried to visualize what his daddy might have looked like but all he could distinguish was a mixture of himself his momma and every man he had ever seen when he returned to his seat james bond was rapping to some broad with big titties and fists full of slick red hair for a second sean connerys face changed colors and was brown like his and the redhead was pearlie his girl yeah it was cool the pills must be working he sat back and relaxed and soon the dialogue was his i dig you baby we could do wonderful things together his body melted into the chair and his head felt like a drunken spinning top he felt that free wild reckless something bubbling up in his chest that made him ache to laugh to bare his teeth like a horse and howl with joy with abandon with something yeah it was mellow after the movie he found his way to the l and somehow paid his fare and got on the train but he took the wrong train and it went south instead of west the next thing he knew somebody it was the conductor was shaking him telling him it was the end of the line he got off the l and went into a restaurant some coffee might help he had puked all over himself in the goddamn restaurant and a barrelshaped black lady had told him to pay his bill and get the hell out he had reached into his pocket for his dough no wallet aw man someone had wasted him on the l while hed been out he found cents in change had enough left over to call his aunt who lived on the south side and to tell her to come pick him up ooooo hed been sick he had puked all over himself in the alley behind the restaurant and he had smelled ugh but all that had happened two weeks ago and it wasnt gon be like that tonight naw he wasnt going on no train rides no movies uhuh none of that shit none of those changes he might go over to pearlies and sit and rap to her and if he got sick or sleepy well she would take care of him see that he either got home or got to bed hell thats what women were for maybe her old lady was gon be out for the evening yeah he would cop the pills then decide what to do he had better hurry up it was almost oclock and the cops were out for blood after the curfew if he got busted they wouldnt do nothing but rough him up a little and cop his pills but shit that was bad enough no pills no money and no high that would be a drag he made it on over to the poolroom found lonnell the local pusher of everything and copped the pills he kidded around with some of his partners for a few minutes then split he was making it on down the street when he saw officer dobel waiting for the light at the comer uh uh fat white bastard officer dobel hated all cats wearing naturals and bennys half wavy hair was past the maybeheneedsahaircut stage if he could just make it to the alley maybe dobel wouldnt bother him tonight he had to get them pills in him that was the main thing dobel might be in a nasty mood and take him down for possession the light changed just as benny made it to the alley he stopped and bent over as if he had dropped something and popped the pills into his mouth he almost choked trying to swallow them dry but after the third attempt they went down he gagged a couple of times and then he was okay as he straightened up and breathed a sigh of relief the squad car pulled up along side the curb and the m cop slowly got out all right up against the wall sonofabitch you know goddamn well youre violating curfew you are under arrest yeah benny thought he had known it was going to happen well he would be cool the pills would begin to work soon and he would leave the funky cops right in their tight sweating skins and soar up into the universe everything was going to be okay at least for the time being he backed against the wall his hands up to show he wasnt protesting or anything and a mischievous smile slid onto his face cmon now he drawled why you dudes wanna mess with me im just a poor country boy out here trying to make it home the top hat motel by charles k moreland jr awn was fast approaching and the black sky was mellowing into a purple tapestry q f gtars an j j ac y clouds leslie parham was racing the saturday sunrise to the top hat motel and his rendezvous with sharon sharon was dark and bony her lean shoulders offered little resting place for the straps of the multicolored sleeveless minidress she wore leslie peered into his rearview mirror at himself surveyed his short woolly hair with a widows peak in front his smooth broad nose and lips with a shadow of a mustache his high hairless cheekbones and thought that he should have been able to get a healthier broad than sharon sharon was practically the only girl who would take a chance with him though and he drove on mumbling he had spent minutes driving by looking at and trying to pick up a girl at th street and western avenue all but two of the half dozen girls there looked at leslies white fourdoor valiant with black wall tires and his dark ivyleague suit and stood where they were whispering that he was a policeman one fat girl in a skirt about a foot above her knees walked up to him and said lets do the thang he looked at her fat thighs which touchedoverlappedall the way down to her knees and shook his head and breathed an inaudible no thanks another girl came up more cautiously than the other and looked at him with suspicion where do you work she asked surprised leslie stammered wilshire and western what kind of work do you do well uh im an artist shit you must be the police the rest of the girls ignored him completely now and he sat there for minutes drove around the block a couple of times and sat there for another five or minutes with the engine idling for a time then stopped the radio on then off the parking lights on the high beams then off altogether after what seemed like an eternity of ignored signals to the girls he pulled the car onto western avenue and headed for home then he saw sharon she was down the hill about half a block from adams boulevard and two white men driving out of the arcadia sanitarium were calling at her she was walking away coolly adjusting the cheap red wig that sat high on her head ignoring them leslie slowed down and looked in her direction she waved at him and bent over to see into the car he slid the car over to the curb beside her you wanna date well yes how much you spending how much is it what i mean is how much do you how much can you spend you got and three for the room well no have you ever dated before where do you work im an art student ive got or dollars okay meet me at the top hat motel down on western do you know where it is leslie said yeah and drove off to the motel when he got there he had trouble parking his car and a man with a beard in janitors overalls told him not to park in the red zone leslie was embarrassed when the man saw him he wished he were invisible the man told him to wait in front of the office that his date would be there soon and then continued a conversation with another man about an foot cabin cruiser in the parking lot sharon came and ushered him into the motel office to pay for the room the office was a dingy slot in the wall there was a single bare light bulb and no chairs the room couldnt have been more than fiveby and the window where the manager stood was covered by a board with only a tiny slot for her eyes and a threeinch one at the bottom for the money do i give her all the money damn you really havent dated before have you naw dont give her but threefifty a pair of varicose white hands counted leslie his change from a five dollar bill and a voice from behind the slot drawled heres the key go to room seven and leave the key in the door when youre finished inside the room which had a coinoperated television and air conditioner sharon was cheerful take off your clothes she said as she quickly unzipped her onepiece dress and wiggled out of her black lace slip oh hell what are you doing she screamed as he reached in his back pocket for his wallet im just getting your money oh i thought you might have been getting ready to arrest me okay sharon stalked around the bed and in and out of the bathroom in her bra garter belt and stockings for a moment or two while leslie removed everything but his teeshirt and socks i better not take off everything he thought she didnt you just relax now while find my vaseline she told him digging through her purse she dug out a tiny bottle and came out of the bathroom then she turned back the bedspread revealing only one sheet flopped down applied the lubricant and told leslie she was ready he was still standing in the spot where he had taken off his last shoe watching her every move asking questions yeah you can wear a rubber i do enjoy it sometimes but usually i dont notice its mind over matter leslie sat down on the bed about three feet from her staring at her frail looking body and the woolly black part of her that seemed to hang from the black lace garter belt he asked more questions and tried to ignore his own organ which seemed to literally shrink into his stomach i do it so my two kids can eat she answered look if you want to hump for a long time or talk a lot itll cost you more money he said he didnt have any more money and sprawled on the bed beside her she smiled at him apologizing for the harshness of her tone and moved over to him and started caressing him look here for five dollars more ill give you some head too she said after a few minutes of caresses i cant afford it i havent got any more money youre clean arent you she asked and proceeded to service him not waiting for an answer leslie lay paralyzed for a moment this is no way to love he thought then he sat upright hey listen forget the rest of it okay im really sorry really he said putting on his clothes i cant tell you how sorry i really feel about this seriously dont think nothing of it oh and my names sharon her head peeped out of the door as she shouted and he walked past the cabin cruiser the crisp morning air chilled him he noticed the sky had turned pink driving home past western and th street he noticed only one girl on the corner two men were standing with her as if they owned the street i would have had more dignity jackingoff he thought out loud as he drove by cursing himself and wondering why men spent their money like that i didnt want her so much as i wanted her to want me the little known band in hollywoods haunted house was really good by leslies standards he had come to see them a half dozen times during their twoweek stand always alone and always optimistic none of his friends had ever heard of the village callers and when he tried in his tuneless way to sing their record which he always heard on the soul radio station he confused them more he stood in the back of the night club sipping a drink and shaking his head with the music he was totally oblivious to the people around him and he wondered how he could manage to get any one of the pretty girls there to notice him he didnt smoke but now he wanted a cigarette when he turned to the cigarette machine behind him a girl in white pants was standing there you shouldnt stand in front of the cigarette machine why not well youll block the light and they need all the light they can get out there to write down telephone numbers oh really yeah really you should come out on the dance floor with me and dance all right but i dont know where to leave my books what kind of books are they poetry leroi jones i write poetry oh yeah leroi jones ive heard of him he wrote dutchman didnt he right on i like the way he writes youre pretty fine you know that oh yeah i mean youre really nice looking thank you she was chin high to the fivefoot inch leslie and she had curly black hair she was only slightly plump but he didnt notice that for almost minutes you know you kind of look like shirley temple oh wow how come ive got to look like shirley temple well your natural its kind of curly and your rosy cheeks make you look kind of like a moppet a moppet oh wow i aint hardly a moppet she laughed they talked until the band announced that the club was closing they walked down hollywood boulevard away from the club and leslie offered her a ride to wherever she was going she had her own car but agreed to let him drive her to a bookstore she wanted to visit the bookstore was closed however so they rode around for nearly an hour and finally settled in a coffee shop for breakfast her name was jeanie im in the black_panther party you ever hear of it she said spreading apple jelly on toast of course i have who hasnt i went down there one time to join even and wow it was a bitch what happened well as soon as i walked in everybody started looking at me like i had a tail then some dude started following me around following you yeah i know when im being followed and this brother was following me they must have thought you were the man yeah well i never went back ill just have to get it on by myself when the time comes dig ive got a little secondhand store down the street from the watts towers and we use that for a meeting place and some of the brothers and the party captain will be there tonight if youd still like to join okay well go now these eggs and hash browns aint saying nothing to my stomach you do kind of look like the man you know you arent are you he started the car no not really i mean look i work for the police department parttime im going to be perfectly honest with you cause i aint got nothing to hide i work for the pig department im an artist i do sketches of suspects from descriptions but i hate those punks down there sometimes when i get a description of a brother that did something you know like shoplifting or something i figure he did it cause he had to eat or just make it i kind of make the picture not look like him so he wont get caught i wouldnt do that though if he hit some old lady in the head or something i shouldnt be telling you all this because it sounds so damn corny but thats the way i feel you know its funny i was just thinking about this good friend of mine she just got out of jail and her husband is still in soledad she was telling me just the other night that if i was lined up with any three other people and somebody was asked to choose who had sold out to the man i would get picked every time right on she laughed i dont mean to laugh but you really would i was out here when they had the watts rebellion in i called it the boston tea party at home in newport i was working for the newport police as an artist then but i actually wanted to waste some people i wished i knew how to make bombs not just molotovs bombs and mines honestly so that i could have wasted some police i saw so much stuff go down in newport it would turn your stomach and i know it must be times as bad in a big city like los angeles no really im not on his side im definitely for the brothers the car slowed in front of a dark building with a large sign which read watts teen center where is the place thats the store ive got to get a new sign made itll either be my favorite things or libra i havent made up my mind yet she said pointing to a driveway for him to park they went inside and were greeted by piles of musty old clothes and broken toys all over the floor the fourroom house had only one light bulb which had to be taken out by lesliebecause he could reach the ceiling without having to stand in a chairand moved from room to room the brothers must have gone home already but why dont you sit down for a while anyway jeanie said leslie sat on a dusty divan and jeanie spread clothes over the already cluttered floor making a pallet mattress which she covered with a bedspread jeanie sat down beside him and they talked she about the panthers he about his paintings that he would hang in her shop to sell before the first cut of the john coltrane album she had put on the record player was over they were rolling on the improvised mattress they kissed long and hard and his fingers and palms moved over her soft body by the end of the third album jeanie was pushing leslie away not now she said softly ive got to check in at the pad but ill see you again and then well have more time dont forget the paintings you promised me and oh ill get a ride to my car in the morning thanks for a nice evening the university of southern californias bovard feld was well lighted and well patrolled panthers with twoway radios monitored and watched the eight or unmarked and black and white police cars that monitored and watched them two dozen bearded peace and freedom party officials in blue chambray shirts with huey newton buttons sat nervously as eldridge cleaver campaigning for the partys presidential nomination concluded his address leslie was more interested in seeing jeanie again than in politics and he constantly scanned the crowd and the blueshirted female panther section for her face he had brought some of his drawings but he left the pad in his car so as not to seem too obvious after minutes of warnings by less prominent panthers and guiltfilled statements by sometimes dishevelled whites the meeting ended and leslie wandered around looking for jeanie leslie it was jeanie calling him leslie over here by the gate i want you to meet my roommate as he approached he saw the delicate looking girl with a well shaped short natural standing next to jeanie his brow furrowed and he wondered where he had seen her before both women were wearing blue sweatshirts with gothic lettering above and below a black cat reading black_panther party this is my roommate sharon sharon it was the the girl from western avenue leslie stood there seconds waiting for the charged silence to explode and leave him with only his shame his teeshirt and his steadily shrinking joint to protect himself well arent you at least going to say hello jeanie has told me so much about you i know damn well you know how to use your lips if just to talk oh yeah how do you do he said hoping she wouldnt recognize his voice damn jeanie shy aint the word for this brother right on jeanie chimed my roomie tells me youre an artist she said youd do a

jeanie said lf more than people were strolling all around will rogers park hurrying to enjoy the last hours of the third watts summer festival leslie fumbled in his mind trying to recall the details touching off the watts riot some drunk and his mother yeah thats what it was when the police started beating up the mother the riot started yeah he thought the anxious energy that spawned the riot had been replaced with a festive air of rebuilding and rededication among the adults but leslie sensed that many of the teenagers though raucous and rowdy in their celebration were still sullen and angry about conditions in watts and neither did the presence of uniformed police in helmets help to allay the tension welling up inside him as he walked from the art show in the center of the park he saw people run past him toward the rd and central entrance to the park he heard shouts and screams from behind a refreshment stand a few yards from the corner he ran up in time to see police dragging a woman into a waiting police car the youths reacted violently as if magically they pulled rocks and bottles from their hats and sleeves and hurled them at the police curses and insults hung in the air leslie trembled until shots rang out he dived behind a rock landscape facing central avenue with about three other frightened people in front of them a black and white police car was parked idling a blue vapor street light barely lit the symbol of the city the goldoutlined black letters reading police and slanted italic letters saying to protect and serve on the side of the police car people were screaming all about him behind the rock one girl swore another cried one man ran from the park shouting tve been shot im shot he ran dashing in and out of the street for three blocks to the doorstep of the watts police substation he stumbled there on the step and fell he died there whimpering im shot a lieutenant from the hollenbeck division had come over when police called a tactical alert as they were clearing the park of all people he recognized leslie who also worked in that division parham the lieutenant said as a policeman searching leslie pushed him toward an exit parham we could use you here in the field go report to the command post at the corner right over there he pointed in the direction of six idling police cars blocking the intersection of rd and central id rather not sir and if its all the same to you im going home now leslie protested the lieutenant was walking away giving orders to some other policemen now and didnt hear his protest a burly blondeyebrowed cop grabbed leslies arm pushing him towards the command post you heard what the lieutenant said now be a good boy and do what the nice man said leslie snatched his arm from the mans grip turned and stood facing him clenching and unclenching his fists and gritting his teeth punk ass he whispered under his breath he walked toward the circle of cars in the middle of the street glass covered the ground all around the police barricade where police had shot out the street lights only the bluish moon and police spotlights lit the shadowy park the stark whiteness of the full moon hanging almost directly overhead made the degree night seem unnaturally cold leslie had his sketch pad in his hand a night so he could not even sneak away under the pretense of going for his work pad go home now goddammit he heard a policeman yell to a crowd of youths go home or go to the morgue one of the boys sauntered casually away from the el taco stand at nd and central where they had been standing leslie watched from the door of the car in which he had been put to work the cop ran up and smashed his gun barrel into the boys back the boy stumbled and turned the officer used his gun again this time on the boys collarbone the boy moaned and fell to the ground and three of his friends started to help him two other cops cocked their shotguns one said just give me a reason just give me a reason leslie felt a chill flash over his shoulders and chest and he dropped his pad and pencil he was afraid again like when he first heard the gunshots his mind raced ahead of his emotions a young boy no older than beaten for what for felonious walking too slow three other boys junior high school kids playing the grown up movie game one false move without the hollywood director to yell cut and without blank bullets leslie heard a scream a shrill womans scream shit naw i aint going home thats my sister in that car and she aint done a goddamn thing bitch shuddup or youll be in there with her leslie looked hard then ran over to the corner where the woman was standing in the street in front of a police car trying to drive off it was sharon he ran up to the policeman officer i know this woman ill take her home and who the hell are you the policeman said putting his gun butt into leslies stomach hard pushing him back a fat sergeant in a shortsleeved shirt ran up he was holding his helmet on his head with his right hand and his shotgun in his left comically as he ran he fumbled and trained his gun on leslie i work for the police department leslie told the sergeant the other cop told sharon that she was under arrest and she shrieked again i aint going shut up dammit the officer said and brought the barrel of his gun down on her head making a clunkingrattling sound as the pump handle shuddered from the blow leslie bolted for the policeman his face looked calm a kind of sideofthemouth smile all but disguised the tears streaming down his face he hit the cop in the back of the neck then surprised more than hurt by the blow the policeman turned leslie leaped into the air with the hardest kick he could deliver to the cursing blondeyebrowed mans groin before his left foot touched the ground again a shotgun blast from the sergeant amputated his leg at the knee two more blasts hit him as he fell away from the policeman the first caused his head to jerk shot from the blonds gun in his face the second laid open his vneck sweater and ivyleague shirt the silent breeze leafed through leslies drawing pad lying on the ground one of the police shoved sharon toward the car her wrists were handcuffed behind her back and a large gash on her left forehead was bleeding profusely closing her eye several drops of bright red blood fell gently on a drawing of the top hat motel as she back with the impact of the buck stumbled past i remember omar by mae jackson mar was a bad revoy lutionist and real hep too he had a fro so v y high that it almost nvr touched the clouds everybody that omar passed would just stop and stare that omar in his red green and yellow danshiki was something else he was so militant that one of his friends had a specially designed tiki made for him man all you had to do was push a button and out from the center of the tiki would pop a blade sharper than lighnen amar was a lover too yes he was he had women running after him from sun up till sun down he had himself some fine looking sisters and they were together too one sister would meet him at his door with slippers in hand while the other sister would be in his kitchenette preparing all kinds of soul food red beans and rice pigtails and cabbage barbque ribsand potato salad like i said before omar was a lover some kind of a beautiful cat militant and coolhe sho nuff had a way with women now some people said it was because of his really bad rapbut i have always maintained that it was because of his dine african features he was six feet one in chtall had a very broad nose and thick juicy lips see he was the type of dude that spent a lot of time kissing it was his custom to kiss every woman he met long and passionately he was what you would call a family man he loved contact and unity now look here omar was also a very good brother the kind of dude that you could depend upon when you were in trouble a naturalborn fund raiser he spent a lot of his time raising bail for his friends who were constantly being picked up bv racist cops and being jailed just for being black you know how this country is when it comes to black folks we are always being harassed and jailed on trumpedup charges well like i was saying before you could always depend upon brother omar especially when you needed bail money or when you were down to your last reefer i remember the successful rebellion that took place in destroyed once known as detroit yeap omar was there he set fire to every white owned business he could see in sight im here to tell you that the brother had to vision the kind that see only white when it comes to destroying i read in one of those white papers that fireboys and over policeboys were killed while trying to put out a fire in an old warehouse building you know how the white press does it they never print the whole truth now that i think about it they dont print half the truth but of course by hanging out on the corner i finally heard how it really happened through some reliable sources three thousand fireboys and over policeboys went running into this old building guns drawn and hoses out trying to be heroes so that they could cop some kind of special citation for something called bravery now when the black community saw this act of stupidity they contacted omar who went over and lead a prayin the kind of prayin that was just pleading for a strong wind and sure enough it came being that the people and their faith were so strong the old warehouse that was built of brick and iron just gave way and caved in now just you imasine that each and every one of the white american boys were trapped and burned to death fire is a mighty powerful thing all right everytime a rebellion took place omar was there to lead the prayin omar and the people got rid of a lot of trash that way that omar knew his business he was a credit to his profession now just as fast as the brother could lead a prayin strike a match to burn a building shoot a gun or push the button on his tiki he could whip up some really hep danshikis in no time flat yeap he was a very talented guy all right he could even beat the bongos with his tongue every afternoon after the sun went down omar would send messages via the bongos to the brothers and sisters in africa yeap like i said that omar could do just about everything a real talented guy if you ask me the brother is what you would call a grassroots intellectual he had read every revolutionary book around such as our folktale by julius lester one of his closest and best friend and black feeling black talk by nikki giovanni a real finelooking sister with a fro alomost bigger than omars nikki weighed pounds and that was with her machine gun on she was real lighthanded if you know what i mean well like i was saying before omar was a real grassroots intellectual he could hold you a conversation on just about any subject from white power to black_power from civil_rights to black rights from freedom schools to liberation schools he knew everything about everything you never could win an argument with him now some people said it was because he was a very emotional person but in my opinion he was just an ordinary aggressive cat just like the brothers and sisters everywhere once he had made up his revolutionary mind on a specific thing wasnt nuthin you could give or offer him that would make him change his mind he was real set in his black ways all right its been seven long months since i last saw omar dig i heard from some brothers and sisters in harlem that racist hunky cops kicked omars door down and walked into his apartment talking some kind of nonsense about them being there in the name of the law the brother got so mad that the first thing he did was reach in his pocket and pull out his comb to get his fro together slipped into his red green and yellow danshiki went into his drawer took out his nationalist flag and placed it on his automatic rifle and blew all cops away in the name of revolution some friends took a trip home yeap went back to africa where they ran into omar that omar they said hasnt changed a bit he had a fro so high that it had finally reached the clouds it was so heavy that he had two beautiful sisters dressed to kill walking beside him just to hold the sides up they tell me my friends that the brother has opened up a bookstore in the window were pictures of malcolm_x leroi jones and rap brown yeap like i said that omar was always a talentive cat a bad revolutionist real hep too the dc blues by sam greenlee reeman left the dif rectors office and j walked directly to the elevator nodding briefly at the directors secretary on the way out he pressed the button calling the elevator to his floor and inspected the attache case he had been presented as his goingaway present it was serviceably large of saddlestitched leather with brass fittings it contained the few things he had cleared from his desk in the office which had been his for years in the suite of offices behind the armed guards and door marked simply director the elevator arrived and he rode it down walked across the vast marble hall to the entrance and waited at the door for the directors limousine he had known that it would not be awaiting him at the steps and he showed no surprise no anger he had waited many years for what he had to do and a few minutes more for a car was no problem it might take him many more years to do what he had planned for so long and an impatient man he had carefully schooled himself in patience he stood at the door looking out into the huge courtyard of the building and out toward the trees that screened the building from the potomac river toward the city of washington hidden by the trees the courtyard was bright with the virginia spring sunshine unveiled by factory fallout he could not hear the birds behind the big glass doors of the entranceway but he knew that they would be singing in the trees that lined the river he had often brought his lunch to eat among the trees there listening to the birds watching the slow current of the river sitting among the pines and sycamore recalling the smells and sounds of summers spent in a boyscout camp in michigan a city boy from chicago he had never lost his awe and love of the woods their sights and sounds the building squatted vast and ugly a marble and granite conglomeration of the worst of neoclassical and governmentmodem architecture an ugly abscess created by bulldozers and billions in the midst of the oncebeautiful north virginia woods a cancerous abscess he thought sending out its tendrils of infection tens of thousands of miles he stepped through the door into the sunshine and listened to the sounds from the woods placing the case at his feet he was dressed in quiet bad taste his suit a bit too light his cuffs a bit too deep lapels a bit too wide shoulders a shade too padded tie too broad trousers too wide at the knee and ankle socks too short he wore large airplanetype sunglasses his hair was closely cropped and there was a thin surrounding of gold around a front tooth his suit was a bit too cheap and his wristwatch of karat gold a bit too expensive he walked with a gangling shuffle his head tilted slightly towards one shoulder and there was always a smile on his face even when alone in the building in which he worked broadening and flashing the thin gold when people approached he was very wellliked and would be missed waiting for the directors car he never once glanced back at the building in which he had spent a great part of the last five years of his life the black cadillac limousine swung into the drive and stopped just ahead of where freeman stood the negro chauffeur made no effort to get out to open the door freeman knew that he wouldnt open the door for him and patiently walked to the car opened the door for himself and climbed into the airconditioned interior the driver started moving before freeman was seated throwing him awkwardly into the far corner of the rear seat smiling gently freeman disentangled himself and leaned back into the foamrubber cushions looking out at the potomac river as they sped toward washington through the bulletproof glass you really going through with it you really quittin yes said freeman and they aint pushing you out i thought so at first but they aint pushing you out i didnt think cats like you ever quit a scene like you got i seen a lot like you in washington but i never knew one to quit on his own your kind love it here you dont even quit for more money someplace else it just dont make sense you really going back to that job you had like they say working with street gangs in chicago yes but this time ill be in charge of the program i shoulda known a title a goddamn title the only damn thing you cats dig more than money special assistant to the director wasnt enough now you going to be a director yourself or did they think up something more fancy the driver snorted in disgust freeman said nothing and they proceeded along the riverside road in silence they moved briefly through arlington and then onto the drive and past the cemetery the big statue of the marines raising the flag on their right they went across the bridge and past the pompous lincoln memorial the phallic washington monument at the end of the reflection pool and just short of the next bridge the jefferson memorial the cherry trees were in bloom a blaze of pink against the green the blue sky above with big fat cumulus clouds floating marshmallowlike against the bright blue sky they turned right on pennsylvania avenue and drove to the white house where the guard waved the car into the drive in front of the white house the driver again did not bother with the door and freeman let himself out and walked into the office annex he was met at the office door by a pudgy redfaced man with nervous mannerisms dan how are you right on time right on time well be going in to see the president in he looked at his watch and then glanced up at the clock on the wall behind the desk of the secretary exactly ten minutes now we go in between the boy scout delegation from east bengal and just before his monthly tea with some of the congressmens wives splitsecond timing around here you know and you know how he is if there is a foulup we have four minutes with him and then its finished hell give you a little present say a few words and then pose for pictures should get some play in the chicago press which wont do you any harm and ill send copies to you in chicago next week i dont know what his present will be hes pretty cagey about that kind of thing but you know what kind of response to give little surprise gratitude thanks and tell him how sorry you are to be leaving the team but i dont have to coach you dan you know what to do hey boy you know were all going to miss you around here remember that time he gave a rebel yell in the taj mahal and you smoothed things over with the indian press we havent forgotten that boy around here not a little bit you were always in there swinging in the clutch yeah sorry to see you go keep in touch now you hear make yourself to home i got to go check on those congressmens wives be right back and then we can go on in freeman sat in a big leather arm chair and looked at the big fourcolor portrait of the president on the woodpanelled wall behind the secretary in a few minutes the redfaced man returned all right lets go now we stand outside his office until the boy scouts come out then we go right in you know the drill they waited at the door until the scouts left beaming each holding a multipurpose jackknife they entered the office of the president the president was seated in his rockingchair his aide bent over and whispered in his ear as freeman approached the president arose and extended a hand thrusting his own quickly far up toward freemans thumb so that it couldnt be squeezed a trick learned from countless campaigns and handshakes well foreman mighty glad to see you again sit down sit down he had heard freemans name incorrectly the aide looked at freeman in a moment of panic freeman ignored his misspoken name and the aide relaxed in gratitude well now son they tell me youre leaving us sure we cant get you to change your mind the general now tells me hes mighty sorry to see you go says you do a good job over there by the river and the general doesnt hand out praise very easy you know yes sir i know and im flattered that he wants me to stay but im afraid i have to leave ive given it a great deal of thought and conscience calls you see ill be going right back where i grew up to try and use my education to help kids who are like i used to be well foreman thats a right fine attitude but dont you think you might be making a bigger contribution for those very people here in washington offer some inspiration for them to achieve to emulate you you know local boy makes good thats a point well taken mr president but id rather make my efforts in a more personal way my small contribution to our great society well now thats good very good we could use you around here maybe speechwriting i like that a small contribution to our great society the president turned to his aide put that down smitty want to see it in my next speech he squinted and gazed out into space as your president it is my humble pleasure to be able to make a small contribution to our great society got that smitty we could use more of your idealism around here foreman i certainly wish you the best of luck i spoke to your mayor last week and they plan to do more in that area im sure he could find room for you in his new commission well mr president i already have a position with a private social welfare agency one i worked for before i came into the government well now foreman never underestimate the good the government does for the people even though i am a firm believer in private enterprise as you know yes sir i recognize the great contributions the government has made toward the lives of the individual citizen and that is at the head of the war on poverty but there have to be increased efforts by private agencies and individuals youre right of course we cant have people dependent on the government to take care of all their problems now can we no sir and i always ask not what my country can do for me but what i can do for my country the presidents smile tightened his aide hastily thrust a package into his hand foreman heres a little momento id like to let you have a little token of my appreciation of your efforts in your countrys behalf freeman opened the package it was a multipurpose pocket knife identical to those handed to the east bengali boy scouts freeman wondered if the congressmens wives would find pocket knives useful he smiled his thanks you remember that time we were on that tour of the east and all that fuss they made because i gave a little old rebel yell in the taj mahal well you sure handled those indian newsmen well but i never could understand why they were so riled well sir its a tomb you know it was a little like someone being disrespectful in the alamo well now that you put it that way but i meant no disrespect yes sir i told them that his aide gave him a signal and the president rose and grasped freemans hand down my way when you give a man a sharp instrument as a present you have to give him something in return so that the friendship isnt broken yes sir here you are freeman slid off his tie clasp and gave it to the president there was a cold silence the presidents grin frozen on his face his aide hurried freeman to the door recovering the president called out now if you get down my way you stop in to see me you hear the president frowned down at the tie clasp in his big hand it was in the shape of a pt boat he walked out into the bright spring sunshine paused on the steps of the white house and looked out at the traffic on pennsylvania avenue he walked to the side of the building to the parking lot the chauffeur was leaning against the fender of the shiny black cadillac smoking a cigarette he looked up at freeman well bigtime the man say you can have the car as long as you want it today where you want to go you can go back to the office i have a bag in the hotel where the airport limousine leaves for national ill walk from here the driver looked at freeman and flipped the butt at him it landed just short of the toe of his shoe freeman looked at the stillsmoking cigarette butt then he looked up at the driver nigger he said if you had hit me with that butt it would have been your black ass the driver stiffened and moved forward from the fender of the car come on said freeman you been wanting some of me for years now lets get it on ill lay your black ass on the white house steps youd like that wouldnt you you out of a job and now you get big and bad in front of the white house no i aint going to fight you here you come down to u street and ill kill you you couldnt kill me on the best day you ever had now you can drive me lets go the driver started around the hood of the car to the drivers seat freeman stood at the door and waited until he had reached the other side nigger open my door they stood looking at one another across the long low top of the car their elongated reflections almost touching the driver walked slowly back around the car and opened the door freeman got into the back seat he told him the name of the hotel where he had been staying since the packers had shipped his effects to his new apartment in chicago the weekend before they stopped at the entrance and freeman passed the check for his bag to the driver he got out then returned with the bag without a word they rode to national airport in silence when they arrived at the terminal freeman got out and handed the driver his plane ticket park the car and check my bag through bring the ticket to me in the bar upstairs he walked into the terminal and upstairs to the bar and ordered a carlsberg he sipped the cold brew until the driver returned heres your ticket bigtime one day im going to kill you go polish the car boy you wont be killing me anytime the driver stood looking at freemans reflection in the mirror to the rear of the bar freeman sipping his beer coolly returned his stare the driver frowned in curiosity he had never seen that expression in the five years freeman had been with the agency finally he turned without another word and left the bar that was stupid freeman thought five years of cooling it and when i blew it it had to be him hell we could probably be poolshooting buddies tasting a bit and chasing chicks but there was no other way the cover had to be complete no holes anywhere it had had to be that way and now he was ready or was he had his mask become him he would find out soon now had he really put them on or had he been putting himself on for a half a decade although trained for it he had never been allowed to be a functioning agent but then that was not why he had been recruited they had never felt he had either the guts or intelligence to function in the field and he had reinforced their thoughts on that score he smiled to himself he had conned them all and in his own way had been the best of the spooks and they might never know it for five years he had been the cia nigger and his job had been to sit by the door what can we say to you that will help you to believe you are learning now about the american revolution the declaration of independence the founding fathers and the constitution and each morning in class you place your hand over your heart and pledge allegiance to the flag and to the country of your birth and it all has meaning for you you are an american and that proud heritage represented by the events and documents and words you are learning is your heritage but soon you will begin to learn other things things which inevitably will leave you in a quandary things which will force you to call into question the meaning of the events and documents and words you have treasured you will learn that for you the heritage in which you have had pride also has emptiness and the knowledge will break your heart we who are older who have traveled the way you must go have not yet found a method of sparing you that heartbreak we want you to believe what you are learning now for the passions and the principles which brought into being the american revolution the declaration of independence and the constitution represent humankind at its noblest we want you to believe in these things even as we concede in sadness that you will need strength beyond what we can give you to hold on to your belief in the world that awaits you dear brothers and sisters this letter may touch on sensitive and painful areas but it is based on the assumption that every contradiction within our struggle must be examined with relentless care and discussed with total cardor throughout the brotherhood of our blackness on the other hand it must also be clear that i do not assume that those of us who work out in the academic halls of the south are any more free from powerful and ironic inner confusions than vou who operate in the north nevertheless there are certain current developments among you which appear dangerousindeed disastrousfrom our perspective we are convinced that no meaningful building of the black university can take place unless at least some of these issues are resolved so i have taken it upon myself to try to articulate our general concerns especially as they are directed to those of you who study and teach on northern campuses let me get to the point in the most brutal manner first and then attempt to elaborate with greater precison as i go the center of our concern is this do the black student and faculty brothers in northern schools realize that much of your motion over the past year has often appeared to encourage the destruction of those colleges and universities where some black students study in the south besides do you realize that such action towards destruction puts you in league with many white northern academic administrators who are ready to deny the future of black southern education ready to manipulate the death of potentially powerful black institutions now let me say more fully what i mean over the past several years for dozens of good bad and indifferent reasons the schools of the north have been discovering that they need black students faculty persons and various levels of blackoriented curriculum as you well know the current commercial value of blackness has not been one of the least of the reasons for the belated and somewhat sudden awakening as might have been expected these white institutions turned increasingly towards the black campuses of the south there they found a readymade supply of black faculty and discovered the presence of some afroamerican curriculum which had not been destroyed by integration in addition they began to enter into serious competition with the southern schools for the best black students all this action was facilitated by the ready access such institutions had to the very financial sources which had been traditionally parsimonious in their help to black schools for some of the same tasks of course it should also be said loudly that the braindraining process was significantly aided by the great hesitancy on the part of many faculty persons and administrators in the predominantly negro colleges to realize that our experience as a people was worthy of serious academic exploration and by their failure to offer the younger black scholars those encouragements which money cannot buy but that is another article then came the assassination of our brother in april and many of you stepped up the pace of your action a hundredfold wherever you were gathered on the northern campuses whatever your numbers you demanded more faculty more courses more black students than ever before freedom now became blackness now so you rapped with articulate vigor boycotted threatened all kinds of things took over meetings classes and buildingsand generally raised hell meanwhile we watched from the south we applauded we laughed at trembling white administrators who seemed ready to offer you everything you demandedsometimes before the words were dry on the leaflets occasionally we joined in the action on your behalf and strengthened our own students in their resolve to their own southern thing as a matter of fact when an increasingly large number of us were wafted through the skies to visit your campuses as consultants and lecturers and to become objects of tempting salary offers some of our egos were momentarily bolstered or our minds momentarily deranged beyond description our black academic forefathers had never known such high adventure we thought now for a variety of reasons a blessed but painful clarity has begun to break into our euphoric white visions we realize now that this situation is clearly neither a matter for laughter nor for selfgratification rather it seems evident that we wereand arebeing tempted to sell out the black colleges of the south and it appears no less evident that many of you wereand areunwittingly acting as agents in the process being used by persons who are not unwitting at all what we see in the new black light is that we are being called upon bv the northern administrators though your voices are often the ones on tie phones to give our energies our course outlines and finally our fullt me talents to these institutions so for instance programs in afroamerican studies begin to spring up from the ithaca to berkeley and we are invited to help staff them all again it also appears that northernbased financial sources are more ready to fund afroamerican studies in rural ohio and upstate new york than in the heart of the black south this means of course that it is possible for the northern schools in the postassassination period to offer salaries sometimes fifty to one hundred per cent higher than the black schoolsto say nothing of space time atmosphere and assistance for research and publishing not only is this happening to us a faculty persons but we watch as you count your numbers on the campuses we hear you demanding more black company especially from among the ranks of the brilliant brothers and sisters on the block and it becomes clear what this means for us it means that recruiters now often black from the north move more fully than ever before into the traditional southern territories of the black schools and offer fabulous scholarships and other financial aid to the best black students available they also offer of course the prestige of their names to a still prestigeconscious black community when collegebourd brothers and sisters weigh these offers against those of the black schoos often latemoving black schools it is understandably hard for themfor you to resist thus the southern colleges face increased deracination on every level by now it should be clear that this southern exposure provides a different perspective therefore it is not a matter of our begrudging you the blackness you so sorely need in those bastions of whiteness rather it is a matter of letting you know how it looks to us for instance as the white administrators of the north and south explain their newly discovered love for black students and faculty and their sudden conversion to black studies we who are the objects of that bulldozing love had to hear move than the words which are spoken we think our southern position allowsus to hear essentially these sentiments from the keepers of the embattled educational establishments we are determind to get our black multitokens up here they say if we dont do it quickly well lose money status and perhaps some of our nicest buildings therefore we have learned well our lessons from the black communitys hero and we are determined to get students courses and faculty members by any means necessary if that involves the destruction of the black schools of the south so be it we never thought very much of them anyway weve got the money and the prestige they havent as everyone knows money and prestige buy everything even loudtalking guntoting black militants indeed just as this letter to you was being completed two black students from northwestern university came into my office at spelman i had met them during one of my visits up north two years before and now they were in atlanta returning the visitand recruiting black students for northwestern just as i was presenting to them some of the central concerns of my letter the phone rang and the long distance operator introduced the voice of an old acquaintancea dean at a prestigious white institution in pennsylvania he said he wanted to know if there was any directory of black scholars available or if i had a list i could give him because his afroamerican student organization was demanding black faculty representation in every department of the college he had already seen a piece of writing in which i had decried the raping of black schools but he was calling anyway he said i told him that i was quite serious in my published position and therefore had no intention of giving him such a list when we needed in the black schools every excellent black scholar we could find at that point he produced a fascinating and revealing response one worth reporting he said you realize of course that there are many persons in the northern schools who have serious questions about whether those institutions should continueat least as black schools and that is one of the reasons why they have no hesitation about attempting to draw from them whatever faculty they can the conversation came to a more or less abrupt halt after that and i reported it to my friends from northwestern for the same purpose that i report it to you to ask whether you have pondered the implications of such attitudes as you make your moves of course when we consider the past performances of the colonizing world the attitude of the white administrators should not startle us the metropolitan areas have had no more qualms about sapping the human creative resources of their colonies in a later period than they did about claiming the physical resources in an earlier more blatant time nor should good intentions becloud the issue for if they do exist anywhere they do not in any way lessen the impact of the attitudes which make the socalled braindrain possible whatever has suited the purpose of the colonizers has been defined as good and necessary whether it takes place between brussels and leopoldville or between new haven and atlanta nor does it matter that the term has sometimes been assimilation and at other times it has been integration ultimately it spells destruction of the heart of the colonized people if it is not stopped ultimately it is reminiscent of harold cruses lament for the cultural now followed by the physical destruction of the heart of harlem finally when we remember the historical attitudes of white northern institutions towards the black schools of the south we are not surprised for the current action fits well their pattern of basic unconcern about the needs of black life what does surprise and trouble us is the way in which many of you brothers and sisters on the northern campuses are participating fully in the patterns of our common destruction i say common destruction out of a conviction that whatever diminishes the life and vitality of any significant black institutions especially those which have been rooted in our history and which are now being pushed to an encounter with our essential blackness is a destroyer of us all so this letter comes as an urgent fraternal message raising what is for us a crucial set of concerns assuming that we are no longer committed to the individualistic ethos of america nor to integration as it has so far been defined and assuming that one of our major goals is the building of new levels of solidarity within the black community i wish to raise the following questions for serious discussion as you assess the total struggle and your own particular situations in the north in what ways may those of us who teach on southern campuses be of greatest help to you how much of our energies should be spent in consulting and lecturing in the north at your request when there is so much business to take care of down here many of you have been involved in attempts to recruit us to teach fulltime on northern campuses urging us to take the to year appointments which we have been offered how do you reconcile this position with the needs of the thousands of black students in the south though i have no inclination to play the numbers game it is important to consider the fact that the black student group usually numbers less than on most northern campuses and is an unusually large figurethough it often represents a miniscule percentage of the total student body on the other hand you ask us to leave campuses with black student populations ranging from to more than if we really intend to make the search for the black university more than good rapping material for a hundred conferences then where can we take the best concrete first stepson a white campus or a traditionally negro one especially when we consider the service the black university must render to its immediate community is it contradictory in the extreme to consider such nationbuilding service coming from black universities in overwhelmingly white institutions one former professor at a wellknown negro university recently announced to the world that he will do his black thing from now on at a predominantly white school he made this decision he said because black schools eventually will be more likely to imitate a good thing if it happens in a white context first without using such words other black faculty persons have evidently taken a similar point of view how does that way of producing blackness fit into our rhetoric concerning the needs of the community is it really more imitation that we must have now considering our sadly limited resources can there be more than a few really excellent programs or institutes in afroamerican studies in this country is it possible that the recent announcements of the creation of at least two dozen such programs will lead to even more dispersion of our black talents rather than to the consolidation we so badly need for this period if only a few such black research and teaching centers can live with significant integrity where should they be developed indeed where will they find nurture during a period of prolonged struggle to move to an even more directly personal level have any of you considered the possibility that it might make more sense to bring black students to a blackoriented professor in the south than to take him away from his campus in other words have you questioned your own locations seriously in the light of our need to gather ourselves together have you given serious thought to your own sense of vocation the building of the black university whether it be realized in one or a dozen locations demands totally committed teachers organizers and administrators who have moved beyond jiving to real work what about you perhaps you dont know that black students in the south on the negro campuses are also calling for more black faculty when will we find them these are as i said questions for discussion though they may sound rhetorical and loaded at points they are not meant to stifle debate if they seem unfairly weighted they simply bear all the freight of my own fullest concerns for our future in this strange land even as i raise the questions though i am well aware of the fact that many of you may have currently excellent reasons for staying on the northern campuses where you are so as we develop those discussions which must question and reexamine both the southern and nothern black academic positions i wish to add a few concrete suggestions for action action which may make it possible for us to serverather than destroy each other where we are now l on the recruiting of black faculty for northern schools if this must be done during these days when the supply of wellequipped blackconscious brothers and sisters is so limited then why not work for the establishment of special visiting professorships rather than outright raiding of black schools under such an arrangement faculty from the south could be invited for one year we could teach one course in our specialty each quarter or semester and be available for many kinds of counselling there would also be freedom from the many ordinary academic pressures of our southern campuses and time as well as secretarial and research assistance could be made available for more research writing and publication at the same time we would not be wrenched away from the southern schools on an indefinite basis in a sense this would be no more than a token presence of course but it represents a temporary measure which might have some mutual benefit while we discuss the questions above and while we seek to increase the supply of brothers and sisters who can do the job on the recruiting of black students there are obviously hundreds of thousands of black students outside of the colleges who ought to be involved in some meaningful experience of higher education since your institutions have obtained funds from many sources for some of this task why not make at least part of that money available in more creative ways for instance a consortium of one or more white and one or more black schools could be created solely for the purposes of recruiting black students through some pooling of funds mostly yours in the north black students could then be approached with this offer here are the funds you need to go through college you can use the money to attend for example morehouse dillard cornell or the university of illinois if you choose a black school we ask only that you agree to spend one of your years on the predominantly white campus strengthening your brothers there if you choose an overwhelmingly white school you will have the privilege of going home for a year in this way black students could take the money from white schools and use it in any way they choose besides under the new conditions now prevailing in both black and white institutions the exchange could not help but be fruitful the issue of finances is a crucial one especially as it relates to the future of black colleges some institutions would obviously serve the cause best if they merged with other schools to create new strengths and expanded facilities but even those which remained need to be enlarged and endowed in ways that black schools have not known up to now why for instance should it not be possible for prestigious northern schools to use their prestige to help obtain special research grants for certain work which can be done well only by black scholars or why should your more affluent northern institutions not be pressed to make other significant financial contributions to the life of these schools they now so blithely seek to rape the united negro college fund might be one general depository others can be found perhaps an autonomous but well funded black educational foundation ought to be established with its single mission the financing of creative ventures in black education this would not exempt the existing white foundations of course it would simply mean that this black institution would be able to give all of its time and energies to the task so far it has been relatively easy to get white institutions to perform certain kinds of moneyproducing acts on behalf of black education on their own campuses perhaps the time has come to press them to use part of their budgets even sections of their endowment funds to help establish such a foundation or otherwise to make longterm substantial investments in the black academic institutions these would of course constitute no more than preliminary steps towards restitution certainly it is no accident that such proposals fit the pattern of what the former colonizing nations must do to be of significant assistance to the areas they crippled finally it is apparent in the current rush to blackness on the part of white institutions that there simply is not the beginning of an adequate supply of persons trained in afroamerican studies it is imperative for usand for youthat we move urgently to fill that gap in ways other than the stripping of the southern black campuses the various institutes and phd programs in this field which have appeared over the past year are obviously meant to meet the need as well as to satisfy you and to keep you off certain backs but i would argue that most of them cannot and will not do the job indeed some of them may die as soon as you stop blowing on the other hand it is only logical that black institutions in the black community if properly funded organized and led could probably do the best job of creating new scholars in the field of afroamerican studies this seems especially likely in those places where traditions libraries and faculties seem at least adequate even now and where students are pressing sometimes reluctant others towards blackness in atlanta that has been our basic assumption and a group of us have moved towards the creation of such an institute for afroamerican studies we think that black students throughout the nation should know this and should ponder its possible meaning for your own presents and futures as some of you know there are in the atlanta university center six negro institutions in various stages of their search for blackness on the faculties are more than persons whose training experience and teaching in the field of afroamerican life and culture are at least significant the slaughter collection of negro literature the georgia state archives and the newly begun martin_luther_king memorial library a documentation center for the movement combine to present unusual library and archival resources on the black experience apart from such tangibles we are also beneficiaries of the spirit of the great pioneering work in black studies done in atlanta by such persons as w e b du bois e franklin frazier rayford logan e s braithwaithe ira dea reid and many others it is against this background of past and present resources that we are now in the process of creating an institute for afroamerican studies under the umbrella of the martin_luther_king jr memorial center research teaching celebration and action are to be the central driving forcesall focused on the life and times of the peoples of african descent i mention the institute here because it will need many things which you can help provide it will need millions of dollars the best staff from every part of the african diaspora students who are ready to take care of business and it must have continuous exposure throughout the black community the schools you attend could help raise funds for this institute for they will need our products both human and informational if they are to be transformed into viable situations some of you will ultimately comprise the staff and student body the plans you now have for afroamerican studies in white settings must be reexamined and challenged by atlanta in short i am proposing that you help this institute become the major black educational creation of this generation you have a kind of leverage in the white world which must not be dissipated in minor ambiguous victories more importantly you have a power which must not be turned against meaningful black institutions the challenge to help create such an institute to break down the many brittle assumptions of conventional american education to move consistently towards our intellectual roots in the struggle for liberationthis is i think a challenge more appropriate to your power as you ponder these matters i trust you will remember that my questions and proposals are meant to be only some of the ingredients in a dialogue which must take place among us the letter is written in the spirit of black ecumenical concern as we move towards a new humanity the words are my own but the concerns are shared by many other persons on the southern campuses we look forward to appropriate response from the north east and west most black people who are seriously concerned about the nature of the black struggle in education automatically embrace the black university concept this thought process is usually based on a taste for the term the security of being included and the assumption that black must necessarily mean liberation but it is a dangerous process unless we as black people discipline ourselves to neverforevenamoment stop our analysis of the man and his subtle forms of oppression and subversion we must require of ourselves honest scientific analysis immersed in our spiritemotions of how educational activities can lead toand be a part ofthe struggle for the liberation of all black people one of the best ways to understand this is to pin the ideological basis of the term as it is used by different people the dangerous uses of the term fall under the ideological position of revisionary neocolonial racism while the progressive forces of blackour strugglemust beare guided by revolutionary panafrican nationalism these are descriptive terms that conveniently cover polar opposites though clearly a systematic analysis would yield more precise types of each however this article is not meant to be merely a methodological exercise but is intended as a working paper for all black people interested in that ideological struggle to understand more fully the correct direction toward liberation we are mainly concerned with four basic questions what are the ideological bases of conflict concerning the liberation struggle for black people whathowwhy are certain institutions playing significant roles in the development of the concept of the black university what are some of the dangers of neocolonial racist pacification and what is the correct ideological basis of our black struggle toward liberation after providing a working definition of each ideological position the meaning of each will be examined through the workings of five institutional contexts related to the concept of the black university by examining several major trends based on the two opposite positions we hope to clarify certain dangers to our struggle and also we hope to begin to underscore guidelines for our liberation struggle the ideological bases of racial conflict in the united states most previous formulations of the ideological bases of racial conflict in the united states suffer from liberal assumptionsillusions black people were to be dealt with as either a topic of intergroup human relations or of minority group relations this was somehow related to the white mans message that everything would be cool anyway since we all live in a melting pot also the only acceptable responsible approach to change was limited to the dictates of the system obviously the same system responsible for our oppression strange forms of racist social darwinisms lurk through this society and haunt us as we will to be free this type of formulation is inadequate surprise surprise because it is simply a function of this society and its white owners and has little to do with where black people are and where we want to go but black nationalism has never been legitimate in the united states since legitimacy was also a function of white nationalism serving to support white supremacy so a major illusion was to propagate integration as the only legitimate goal for black people the integrationists used tostill say that the problem is that some white people who are from the old school will learn in time and will support what is right every major alternative pointed essentially to the whiteisright theory while much of our black reality was either suppressed or ignored black nationalism is an idea whose time has come and with it has come the obvious need to reformulate the structure of our ideological struggle struggle throughout the third world has helped free us from the american integration myth we have come to know of colonial ism and we are becoming aware that we are a colonized people living in the very bowels of the monster our presence in this country is the result of an illegitimate political process whose most damaging contemporary effect is to convince us of our birthright to citizenship ha to call us to be patriotic and to put us eagerly to work to uphold this system many of us have merely been made to internalize the overseers whip and thus to control ourselves indeed we are a colonized people the key problem then is to isolate the major ideological forces which undergird the system and those opposing it our ideological forces today we know the american system for what it is neocolonial racism functioning to pacify black people and to influence black affairs with revisionary subversion the system is racist because white is still right and black people have never been dealt with as peopleslavery has not been paid for which means that we are interpreted as either just becoming white enough to be considered people or that we are merely being tolerated until someone figures out what to do with us or does it a simple example of neocolonialism is when a negro is sent to manage and control black people in place of a white cat though the basic job assignment is the same for either the most progressive black ideological forces constitute revolutionary panafrican nationalism nationalism is beliefsemotions of racial solidarity and pride panafrican nationalism emphasizes two important points for our identity and struggle all black people are african wherever they are we are africans colonized in the americas all africans must unite against our common enemy and join third world liberation struggles our ideology must be revolutionary as we fight a colonialist system our goal is to destroy it and to replace it with a system that speaks to our needs to quote a brother we dont believe that what we want is better than what others have we just believe it has got to be better for us and if two arent possible well fight to the death for ours since death of a kind is our fate in any case so the ideological conflict is between forces designed to keep us loyal to the system oppressing us or to make sure that we cannot get ourselves together to do something about it and the forces of liberation designed to reunite a separated people to mobilize the will of a people to liberate itself from racist colonial bondage with giant steps toward new africa role of institutions the ideological conflict is best understood by examining the role of certain institutions and not the role of particular people as we are so often tricked into believing this is particularly true when were concerned with concepts like the black university we can describe three kinds of institutions two representing the forces of oppression direct colonial control conies from agencies of the federal government private foundations and white universities these colonial forces combine to influence and to direct their neocolonial extensions the predominantly negro colleges the third really shouldn t be called an institution but a growing number of organized thrusts emerging from the black community with the sole purpose of making education relevant toforwithin our liberation struggle colonial forces employ the twofaced approach to black people using one hand to actively suppress us while using the other hand to urge the vanguard forward into full view for the slaughter some see this as a paradox but it is really a vise one that is closing faster all of the time why is it that institutions like princeton harvard yale rockefeller and the u s congress will sometimes encourage small groups or individuals who are to them black nationalist extremists while at the same time refusing to rid their investment portfolios of south african stocks or economic interests supporting racism throughout the usa how can the congress pass civil_rights legislation to help black to become like whites and then persecute adam clayton powell for being just like them you surely can fill in additional questions for yourself neocolonial forces are virtual laboratories for negro citizens who want the security of a place in or at least of white society while at the same time becoming masters of survival culture fun and games here the vise is cloaked in hues of brown a coloration meant to confuseif not to convinceus into acceptance demands for a program more relevant to black needs are usually met with two responses which clearly reveal their position we have always been interested in the study of the negro we have a good library collection and we have a tradition of research and teaching what is left out is that this tradition stopped to years ago and exactly the opposite trend has reached its summit a brief search for current materials and a look at course catalogs will demonstrate the reactionary reality of this sickness we will not support racism and reject as racist the demand for black history especially if it is stipulated that the instructor be black however there is normally no argument when choosing negro presidents for predominantly negro colleges but holy hell explodes when demanding black teachers for black courses new agencies for black education association of afroamerican educators new school of afroamerican thought affro arts theaterschool university system of the nation of islam etc are now developing around the country these agencies do at least three things illuminate contradictions about the education provided for black people prepare people for the struggle and immerse our children in the saving grace of blackness however the new black search is quite obviously in danger of being subverted by the abovementioned colonial forces the positive thrust not only includes the goals being sought but also involves the very process and basic assumptions of education itself and since we have yet to see who will succumb to or reject the seductive hustle of white resources we must proceed to discuss its dangers before we begin to chart our course toward liberation dangers of neocolonial racist pacification since we were taken political prisoners over years ago and are still in bondage we can safely assume that a thorough analysis of the forms and methodology of past oppression will at least provide the basis for perceiving future dangers in a summary fashion there are at least four devices at work for colonial and neocolonial institutions although they are often applied in different ways in the typology of dangers facing the black university concept there are four types of dangers listed each appears to be relevant to both the colonial and neocolonial institutions the term inflated expectations refers to the dangerous possibility that advocates of the black university concept will be lured into the trap of believing in the devils actually believing that fundsresourcespositions will be made available for creative work i was tricked on two occasions in as many years though my action was considerably more naive than what i really believed and was told over and over and over again whew the colonial institutions especially major universities and the ford foundation use their vast resources to blow peoples minds and to cop and while the neocolonialist predominantly negro college has pull here it is not resources but traditions which often trick folks what one discovers is that these traditions are often more manufactured than real and when real frequently have been abused by the colleges reference group conflicts often result from inflated expectations not to mention the serious ego problems facilitated in the process simply put the problem concerns who or what groupblack people are to think of as they prepare to move this is often related to what audiences they speak to where they send proposals for funding where they choose to publish who they relate to as far as colleges are concerned etc the colonial confrontation is classic in that it presents the best traditional form of confrontation blacks directly facing white authority and power the neocolonial problem is ambiguous here as blacks move toward a common analysis and hold onto the goal of liberation as manifested in the black university negroes of all ideological persuasions and experiences move to neutralize to polemicize and to expel blacks from their schools often brotherhood alone prevents a san francisco state type struggle from emerging at morehouse though this pattern is subject to shift at any moment note the recent unpublicized burnings around the atlanta university center following martin_luther_king jrs funeral and a recent campus visit by stokely carmichael an increasingly important concern is how the limited resources committed to the black university concept are being diffused throughout the country dig it the following together brothers are scattered at white schools throughout the country nathan hare alvin pouissant robert browne charles hamilton st clair drake harry edwards price cobbs william grier edgar beckham and those negro schools with black faculty are unique even when every effort is made to stifle their work and to get rid of them there is consequently no center for revolutionary black education and that shouldnt come as a big surprise only the most secure white colleges are announcing grandiose plans for the recruitment of black faculty note the recent ucla announce ment of a plan to hire black professors by fall last there is the problem of definition if lyndon johnson could coopt the civil_rights thrust deceitfully smiling as he proclaimed we shall overcome then black people ought to watch out if the united negro college fund could place an ad in the new york times portraying a negro in cap and gown with the caption black_power then black people ought to watch out but normally colonial forces are the first to move in on ideological concepts note the emasculated verison of the class conflict as compared to what karl marx meant in the manifesto only after a few foundation grants and a few conferences for whites is it normally possible for negroes to use the termand then it is often psychologically difficult for them to sav it without perjorative gesticulations terminological cooptation is a process to confuse the ideological struggle for popular support we must always be aware of the need for clarity and we must never hesitate to provide an understandable analysis for any group of our people and now having looked at the dangers we ought to examine the positive ideological basis for our struggle ideological guidelines for struggle there are five ideological guidelines that fit these discussions though it is in the course of struggle itself that we will define what is ultimately necessary for our liberation these must be as free as possible of the above listed dangers a african identity no other identification is as close to our history and as far from our oppressors the term afroamerican still somehow legitimates the hell of america and separates us through generations from africa our identity as africans is based on the utility it has for struggle only by recognizing the alien character of this country even though it is sometimes tolerable because of our contributions to it can we ever hope to successfully wage the revolutionary struggle b operational unity while it is obvious that one allinclusive organization for black people would be impossible to build it is not impossible to move toward coalitions of groups most national liberation struggles have been based on the operational unity of a diverse set of organizations and we can see moves in this direction with the black congress in los angeles the united black front in washington d c the black congress in chicago and the attempt to build a black peoples alliance in atlanta we must work cooperatively on common goals in order to utilize all resources and for their thousand blows deal one death blow mentioned earlier the whole black revolution is a reaction to grievances too often ignored and promises too frequently forgotten thus there is the possibility of overreaction on both sides it is a painful experience for both the majority and the minority in a society to understand that so much of its fabric is interwoven with racism the desire to eradicate it or to forget it this is a much less feasible possibility in the context of modern society with its mass media and mass communication can lead to many false starts and wellintentioned mistakes the majority of blacks do not want an apartheid society but many will stand with black only causes until society shows that it really means to include blacks in the society on an equal and meaningful basis the black students are quite justified in demanding more coverage of black history and the contributions of blacks to society although some of the black students dont believe that white students should be admitted to these courses black history courses will be of considerable value to white students also certainly the relatively inane treatment of slavery and the reconstruction period by historians deserves correction in the minds of all some definitive works on reconstruction such as that of john hope franklin chairman of the history department at the university of chicago have been written but to a great extent these are not included in the basic history courses that are taken by most students black students are justified in asking that more black counselors and advisers be appointed not that only black counselors can counsel black students but black students should have black counselors available if they want to talk with one also black and white students should be able to see blacks in a variety of positions in the university demands of the type that i have just mentioned are not to develop an apartheid university rather they are to provide for a valid recognition of black people and black students as a part of society and a part of the university the consideration of the black student as a special case in the university particularly at an institution that prides itself on its democratic traditions might appear to violate principles of equality and nondiscrimination but the university as one of the most important institutions of society has a responsibility to help blacks and other minority groups achieve the position of social and economic equality that is implicit in our system president james m hester of new york university for example says that nyu intends to discriminate positively in favor of black students to help eradicate the effects of racism on them although it can be argued that the university should merely reflect the values and traditions of society and create knowledge for the sake of knowledge many people in society look to the university for leadership and guidance in the solution of a variety of social and intellectual problems the universitys concern with black students is clearly within this framework certainly mistakes will be made the black students will make mistakes and should be allowed to learn from them university administrators will make mistakes and should also be allowed to learn from them the black student awakening and the contemporary student activism on americas campuses point the way for the enhancement of the university as an important institution in our society those of us in the university should really hold ourselves in their debt for so forcefully bringing this challenge to us the concern of africanamerican educators must be first with education and only secondarily with those structures set aside for educational activities ie schools this is because the goal is a relevant and productive education for our people education has no absolute standards and can therefore not be limited by any predetermined or already extant systems or structures rather education is an experience in concentrated enculturation which always takes place in the most feasible and culturally expedient location realizing the shortcomings of white american schools the fundamental approach has to be either to make those schools adequate through change or to move elsewhere to administer education and before considering whether or not american schools can be altered sufficiently we have to first recognize the essential need for a new approach to education from a black perspective any educational system must be a viable cultural cell in its particular social complex and must work in conjunction with other such institutions in the society religion legal codes social organizations etc towards affecting coordination and continuity of culture and values in afroamerica most schools have not been such a viable cultural institution established by our people to promote our own general welfare but rather a substandard distortion of white americas idea of education the latter serves as a valid institution in the broader other society and as such has always had to justify the historic and contemporary subordination of africanamericans it has unfor tunately forced many of the same such values of inferiority both intellectual and practical upon us in ways both subtle and overt it has aided in our oppression intellectually it has perpetuated a white lie over black truth in a more practical sense it has given us broken and outmoded tools with which to operate in the larger society thereby insuring our traditional position of economic political and social impotency the normal role of education as a lever for cultural enrichment has lunctioned improperly in our community black students returning to the community hoping to develop its positive aspects have ioand themselves unequipped to operate effectively very little in the educational system has dealt with afroamerica from either a positive constructive or realistic framework the massive unrest among black students today reflects the recognition of this fact the long overdue need for school systems to address the most pointed problems of american society especially as they relate to africanamericans as well as the failure to accurately reflect the history and culture of black people has precipitated this hightide of legitimate discontent hence increased student activism around this issue represents a last call for commitment on the part of american academia towards real and meaningful education nevertheless some african americans have accepted education as the answer and what of them can they not be used as examples of what america holds for the black man first of all they are decidedly in a great minority and can therefore not be a legitimate index by which to assess the present state of afroamerica as a whole and although an increasing number of negroes hold quasimiddleincome jobs this does not obliterate the realitv that although most of the poor people in america are in fact white most of the black people in america in fact are poorfailures in even the american sense a nar row spectrum of economic acquisition and stability moreover the socalled successful negro middleclassman cannot be held up as a symbol of black americanism because in a broader social sense he is also illegitimate laying aside for the moment the whole question of practicality and possibility let us just consider the relation of the middleclass negro to the broader africanamerican community although he is recognized as respectable by the white society sometimes black youth for the most part reject his brand of social success they simply cannot relate to him the questions to which he presents answers are not the most relevant ones in their lives black children are quite aware of the potential insecurities of their lifestyle yet they persist in their ways to attribute this to psychological maladjustment is to assume that schools are more inherently correct than people most black students dont want to be like their family doctor physical education teacher or their case worker they dont want to sell insurance be lawyers or even work in factories as apprentices the social sacrifice inherent in achieving these positions is too great for them they must be offered new alternatives not just alternative ways to become middleclass negroes in addition it is unrealistic to concentrate on enlargement of the black bourgeoisie for this group has its classic creation as a buffer zone between the masses of blacks and the masses of whites it cannot exist without the existence of the other two externally to itself in fact if the masses of africanamericans were to become middleclass negroes they would have negated themselves for there would be no middle only a full realization of a white top and a black bottom comparison of the positions held now by negro college graduates and their white counterparts illustrates this point vividly therefore the absence of respectable africanamericans in the community is not the answer to the problem it is rather a failure of the schools as part and parcel of the system which spawns the black bourgeoisie to be relevant to the community as a total institution from beginning to end its perspective its program and its product have not addressed the needs of the africanamerican such a miscarriage of sociointellectual pregnancy has destroyed the average africanamericans respect for education the middleclass negro succeeds only at the exoense of his soul while the soul ful blackbrother suffers a life of economic insecurity both are equally politically impotent and hence the community is stagnant moreover in respect to soul it becomes apparent that soul is thus more than a music style a way of walkingthatwalk or talkingthattalk it becomes an inner drive whose motor manifestations are present in the aforementioned traits soul becomes that which leads one knowingly in a more meaningful direction than synthetic capitalist christian materialism temptingly invites its a natural thang ie of nature and as such deserves more respect than we often give it it is as maulana ron karenga points out one thing the white man has never been able to deal with because he cant understand it therefore neither his schools nor anything else in his society has ever cannot and probably never will be able to handle it the white boy engaged in the worship of technology we must not sell our souls for money and machines we must move then to resurrect education as a constructive cultural institution among our people aside from the need for white schools to perpetuate the white lie mentioned above other considerations seem to point to the ultimate need for allblack school systems and consequently the nec ssity for africanamerican educators to take stock of their present condition and to prepare for the essential move back to black the concern of all public schools is obviously educating the public in america that public contains a lrge predominance of nonblacks and a considerably smaller number o third world peoples the majority of whom are africanamericans because of their historical and ethnic differences these two groups are decidedly distinct culturally yet the american public education system operating in accord with the countrys meltingpot myth works on the erroneous assumption that there can at once be a basically homoceeos school wsystem to serve all american inhabitants this is in fact a myth because the historical existence of africanoid peoples in america has been one of separateness therefore a balanced blackwhite educational program is a contradiction of both ethnic and historical reality and hence we must consider the alleged massive failure of africanamericans to adapt to the american school system not so much as a psychological maladjustment to be relieved by remedial and compensatory programs which in essence seek to find new ways to stuff the same rotten food down everrejecting throats but rather as a sociocultural mismatch a poorly balanced diet which is indicative of our even broader paradoxical selfcontradictory existence in america in short when there are consistently so many dysfunctional products we must question not only the raw material but the nature of the m machine itself the failure of a round peg to fit into a square hole is not because the peg isnt square but rather because it wasnt made to fit in a square hole in the first place the question can now be raised as to whether or not the present school systems can in fact be changed to meet the needs of africanamericans are such changes realistic more important are they desirable first of all it seems as though no american school has yet affected sufficient changes to satisfy the everincreasing demands of black students at all levels and perhaps this inability is illuminated by two observations on the one hand and already mentioned above since the american schools are part of the total american sociocultural complex a viable institution in that society it must be compatible to the stability of that system unless it either justifies or ignores the historic and contemporary oppression of africanamericans the society as an entity cannot exist to deal with the slanting of curriculum for this purpose would be redundant we all know whats happening there yet we have to also reiterate a need for new career opportunities white schools are structured to meet the needs of the white community our needs are quite different and often contradictory to those in fact one of the foremost designs of a black school will be the destruction of white schools as the legitimate source of education for africanamericans a second point involves the desirability of such a change in highly mechanized industrial america the schools at all levels have become the nations largest baby sitter finding nothing more expedient to do with its youth america offers a hour school week with extra curricular activities for overtime the world of academia has become a haven of escapism specializing in the mass dissemination of functional ignorance justified by tradition and legitimized as education american education tends to be a rather static type of thing so static that it does not apply its most elementary findings to fundamental issues elementary biology is inapplicable to marys divine conception courses in communism and racism are outlawed in the schools the study of them being allocated to exclusive federal scholars like the kerner commission and the house unamerican activities committee who readily admit these are the two biggest problems facing the entire country by the same token black history becomes a nice thing to study but not from which to learn lessons regarding this societys illegitimacy in relation to black people and of course there is always the matter of cooptation white folks taking over our thang for the enterprising white hustler this has always been a good gigeconomically intellectually culturally you name it tragic it is when we realize that africanamericans have been the creative backbone of this country and nevertheless have little or nothing to show for it we have to seek to reclaim our own heritage and to control the definition of our own history and culture in order to preserve a meaningful and accurate definition of our situationpast present and futurefrom our own perspective for ourselves and our prosperity it should therefore be the goal of the africanamerican educator to seek the establishment of a fluid educational structure for reality is everchanging and once established a black education should never need to be revolutionized but rather in a constant state of evolution always putting the present in its proper perspective our education must answer frantz fanons charge what we want to do is to go forward all the time night and day in the company of man in the company of all men we must work out new concepts and try to set afoot a new man black people in america have no power to change the public schools socalled decentralization has yet to prove its viability without real control of its schools the black community that society which the educational system must serve and hence those who must have the power to define education from their own perspective and sufficient for relevance to them has only a tokenistic or advisory function and what is to prevent the dismissal of such advisory entities when political sentiments change in the governing colonial power structure as brother stokely carmichael has pointed out this is preciselv the lesson which black people must learn from reconstruction in this country and so the concern of the educator must not be to integrate by any means necessary the africanamerican student into a basically dysfunctional educational system but rather if he chooses to work within that system to work towards its destruction as a source of black oppression for those who do not wish to accept the cold reality of this there is a sort of alternate approach and that is to merely strive to offer a valid educational experience to the africanamerican student one which evolves from a black frame of reference operates with materials drawn from the black experience and prepares the individual for relevant and effective functioning within and in accord with the general welfare of that society if this can be done within the existing structures then do it but if it cannot be done there it is the clear duty of the africanamerican educator to denounce that system and to seek any means necessary to serve the black community in which his position and realitv ultimately rest no man is any more than the context to which he owes his existence maulana karenga oughout this t land a volcano of student alienation and esentment compounded in the case of black studentsis erupting in the ir form of ephemeral administrative takeovers visavis black students the problem stems in part from the emptiness and subtle racism of the college system in part from the pain of black student experiences in the society which the college system serves black students it is necessary to know are descendants of a people cut off from their attachment to land culture and country robbed of a sense of pride in pastness the roots of identity so essential as a springboard for a sense of collective destiny shut off from involvement in the educational process during slavery it was unlawful to teach a black person to read or write black americans then largely inhabiting the south sought adjustment by way of supernatural rationalizations such as the superstition still extant that if you read too much youre bound to go crazy the problem today though manyfaceted is irritated by the gross invisibility of black students despite their seemingly mushrooming physical presenceon most white college campuses the neglect of the black students needs may be apparent but acutely unnoticed in the scarcity for example of courses dealing forthrightly with the black race its problems and its contributions in american society i sort of thought negroes came here to try to become white a white student leader recently admitted in the wake of a general black revolt the black college students awareness of the psychology of exclusion grows ever keener and he longs at last for educational and political visibility accordingly while the perfunctory nature and general obsolescence of higher education in america plagues white students as well the black student is impelled to seek visibility get it together and move on up and come back home through sharp demands for symbols such as the presence on campus of at least a token number of black professors and courses exposing black history and culture down to the inclusion of hog maws and chitterlings on cafeteria menus which already include beef stroganoff meatballs and spaghetti and occasionally chop suey black students see themselves as windowdressing tokens of black participation in campus life knowing that as individuals they are in but nevertheless wanting general recognition of the fact that they are there this contrasts with the situation of black students on the negro college campus where protest does occasionally reflect racial and color considerationsstemming chiefly from negro college conformity to the mores and values of the white college systembut more typically takes the form of a basic quest for personal freedom the liberalizing of curfew regulations and other aspects of the right not to be treated as children while training to be adults by comparison the white college permits a greater degree of freedom thought not as much as they claim to believe in and not enough to please todays generation of students reared on the permissive approach members of an age group which constitutes an increasing majority while treated as a kind of minority particularly is the white college characterized by a greater spirit of inquiry than the typical negro college this intellectual activity rubs off on the student black students become concerned just as white students are except that whatever problem white students encounter black students inherit plus the dual condition of being rejected or ignored as individuals or as blacks on white campuses located in small college communities blacks live in social isolation aggravated frequently by a skewed sex distribution where their acceptance is superficial even when apparent in less exclusive colleges located in large cities the opportunities for social and romantic philandering are more prevalent in both the greater number of their kind on campus and a relative access to the offcampus black community this quest for meaningful social relations coupled with discriminatory housing and economic considerations increase the black students probability of becoming a campus commuter commuting each day between the black community and the white campus black students experience a daily sense of discrepancy between two contrasting even conflicting worlds one world whose spirit has been largely broken in the quest for the social elevation which the black student now holds dear the other world characterized by a good deal of minutiae which the black student recognizes as profoundly irrelevant to himself his fate and his experience and yet he knows so well that he must wade somehow through this white milieu in search of ratification for the white rat race which is a chore for anybody the chore is simply compounded by the fact that psychologically and otherwise it does not relate so well to what is crucial to the black students life inclining him in too many cases to give up he eventually comes to see it as essentially a bad set this sense of defeatism and despair is reinforced and magnified by the models of failure surrounding him in the black community on top of that exposure to harsh measures of discrimination past or present provoke a feeling of suspicion out of which can develop a negative definition of certain phenomena which the white middle class employs for social acceptance including not merely cultural symbols of status it might become derogatory for example to be seen spending much time with books under the prevailing college system structured so that an individual succeeds best by conforming most to middle class values black students labor considerably less prepared than white students of suburban training and experience to cope they grow naturally and indelibly alienated it might become more in to be pretty good at cards for example which only multiplies the probability of failure in the academic arena the black studentcovertly at firstrightfully begins to question the nature of standards impassionately dangled above his head as obstacles to the acquisition of the stamp qualified recently during a talk at yale university i had the occasion to ponder the blank and in a good many cases openmouthed stares of ignorance from the predominantly white audience when i related how all white students given a test devised by a black colleague and myself had fundamentally flunked all were unable to identify such commodities as hog maws fried pies and butter roll the professorcollaborator and i had been impelled to concoct the test at the risk of falling victims to the fallacy of reductio ad absurdum after a ruckus between black students and white administrators at a predominantly white college over the choice of a professor for a course in ancient black history the administrators choice was a young white fellow armed with an ivy league phd and muchlauded publications in learned journals the black choice of the black students preferred also by many white students bore no college credentials but probably knew as much about ancient black history as anybody extant having recently spent two years haunting the schomburg collection in new york the white professor knew little or nothing about the subject under scrutiny he was quick to admit but continued to cry out with strong emotion that he was qualified the black students who sought to break up his class could not understand why the administration would choose a white man admitting his ignorance to teach a course while rejecting the black man who knew all about it later it occurred to me that a black historian seeking publication in learned journals is placed in a rather precarious position of having to document his work when writing aggressively against the slavery era with references from the writings and records kept by a slave society in which black persons were restricted by law and custom from access to the written word while a graduate student in sociology at the university of chicago ran afoul of academias demand for copious footnoting fleetingly scanning library shelves for instant references from unread books to win high marks and influence professors with padded documentation a harvard administrator in the audience at yale assured me that i did not invent that vulgar practice even so it was for me excusable because unlike my professors who were unable to tell me the identity of the four tops i was culturally deprived i acquired the phd without gross dishonor and that appears sometimes now to count in the minds of some people more than all the good and bad things i have eve done my contempt grew stronger in any case as l discovered the footnoting cliques in references used to buttress white theorizing on the black race not only did i detect mutualquoting affairs i noted that a professor might suggest hypotheses as many did to thesis students who then graciously used some of the professors work for references only in turn to have their thesis used by the professor to document a larger theory based on the hypotheses of the several students i learned further while poring over learned journals that the motivation behind the footnoted expressions of gratitude to wealthy foundations and colleagues was not gratitude alone the fact that a toprated foundation has backed a piece of research gives it the boost of prestige the scholarly custom of sending a manuscript around to sundry colleagues reaps similarly the inference that the reviewing colleagues have given it the stamp of approval this dirty knowledge as one of my professors called it gave me as a faltering black student from a rural district in oklahoma a new kind of confidence many experiences which can turn him either on or off confront the black college student in the typical white college classroom for example he must sit silently bemused while his eminent sociology professor reports solemnly but proudly that his surveys show there will be no riots in chicago because as one suggested early last september only seven per cent of negroes surveyed say they definitely approve of riots a black student might not realize that such a professor like his peers at large is suffering from the bias of democracys myth of majorityrule but the calculator in his brain might quickly register blacks and wonder how many negroes his professor believes sufficient to start a riot the professor himself may later have stood perplexed when rioting broke out in chicago on the heels of martin_luther_kings assassination but he is not likely to alter his methods or standards of scholarly excellence which he requires his black students to accept early in his educational career the black student encounters the subordinating slap of white supremacy modes of communication for instance compel him to lose his ingroup dialect and imitate the snarls and twangs of the white race there becomes thear nine nighyun law lower and so on verbal facility is frankly presented to the black student as the salient ingredient for admission to college although i know young black men with more verbal facility than i will ever have who have either flunked out or dropped out of school beyond this the black student instinctively if only faintly is affronted by the fact that foreign languages required are exclusively of white european origin though oriental languages may be offered as electives this in spite of the fact that chinese is spoken by more individuals than any other language in the world and swahili an african language competes very favorably with german this is just one of the examples of white snobbishness lurking behind the criteria of excellence which by no means however is entirely a product of racism alone running through its history also is a strain fundamentally of a different sort though it too is racial by coincidence in its consequences in the beginning american education particularly on the college level was highly private restricted to the few who were wealthy enough to afford it such persons as social theorist thorsten veblen observed in his book the theory of the leisure class were characterized by a peculiar mentality in which owing to the necessity for displaying ones wealth it was prestigious to be free from productive endeavor any work done could not be remunerative and preferably should be of no significant use to anybody let alone oneself to waste time and to have the time to waste time were the symbols of prestige their educational enterprise accordingly was characterized by a liberal arts approach where students learned a little about a lot of things and a lot about nothing the leisureclass syndrome and its snobbish motivations encouraged a preoccupation with lofty gobbledygook such as footnoting students might be compelled to labor in memorizing the idiomatic expressions and the verbal conjugations of dead languages or more currently languages which invariably fade from the students memory and while remembered are useless in postcollege life as middle class aspirants began to emulate the leisure class and education was largely socialized the principle of exclusiveness was reinforced by the need to stem the flood of recruits to professional occupations hence the student might make as and bs in all required courses only to fail the comprehensive exam or the language test or pass all academic requirements only to fail the bar exam because of political beliefs or color of skin education lost much of its capacity for vitalizing the mind and since the endproducts became more important than the process eventually amounted to a routine assimilation of approved bodies of knowledge a process which fails particularly to inspire a black child of working class origin i sometimes shock students into a realization of the shallowness of the american college scene by walking into a classroom and throwing out a concept preferably with a germansounding name such as zeitschaft whether this is a word i do not know which i might claim to be a concept for a societal condition in which there is widespread feelings of racism or intergroup hostility while students are busy copying down the term i proceed to show how to measure the intensity of the zeitschaft predicament this is accomplished i further instruct by computing an index of racial response an index of racial response by now i am calling it the irr score is computed by observing a sample of persons from two or more racial groups over a period of time say whites and blacks passing or encountering one another on a given street corner during a given day charting the number of smiles exhibited by the individuals comprising the sample and dividing the number of smiles observed by the number of persons in the sample then dividing this by the square root of two while the students are furiously engaged in copying this down virtually slobbering in anticipation of returning to their dormitories where they will ambivalently complain of the difficulty of the course perhaps requesting their roommates aid in calling out the material for memory i step back and explain my desire to have the students see the board clearly inasmuch as i had made it all up i further state that i knew that they did not understand it no more than i had and that they are not being educated in spite of what they are accustomed to believe by merely memorizing a professors fodder and regurgitating it on his test white students it is true are victims of the same condition but it is doubly alien to the experience of black students who moreover are burdened by many another unconscious assumption of white su premacy take the matter of the cultural imperialism which white ethnocentrism produces a white anthropology professor may think nothing of dividing african tribes into primitive and westernized then pointing out that primitive tribes are more characterized by the matrilineal system tracing ancestry through the mother instead of the father while neglecting to point out that this could be a more accurate procedure the black student who first called mv attention to this fact indicated that you have to take the mothers word for it and sometimes she doesnt know herself he swore that a boy in his georgia bayou community came home from school one day and told his father happily that he was going to marry a girl let us call her pearlie mae his father said son i didnt know that you would go that far you cant marry pearlie mae thats my daughter shes your sister dont tell your mamma now the boy moped around then broke down and told his mother what was wrong thats okay his mother consoled you can marry pearlie mae dont tell your daddy but he aint your father sociology classes will discuss the merits of the moynihan report on the negro family incognizant of the implications of moynihans own figures showing for example that for every nonwhite males between the ages of and in new york city there are extra females somebody of necessity must carry a greater sexual burden than rightfully is his share or a number of women will languish via induced celibacy at the same time the condition is being intensified by the disproportionate rates at which black males are dying in vietnam depleting the supply of eligible black males this cold demographic fact will lead to family disorganization and high rates of adultery no matter how moral or stable as social scientists say black sexual codes might be similarly anthropology professors will subject black students to discussions on family disorganization among africans in kenya for example impervious to the fact that much family strife is a product of the christian missionaries importation of an alien monogamy which replacing the existing polygamy evidently geared to the demography and socioeconomic needs of the people displaced surplus wives in order to save them and produced a good deal of the family disorganization which anthropologists get grants and trips abroad to study courses in european history will skip over the slave trade while courses in american history will mention black persons only with reference to slavery and the myth that lincolns restricted emancipation proclamation freed all of them courses and textbooks in literature remain lily white many white students spurred by involvement in civil_rights activities and the daily prominence of the black struggle in news coverage are growing keenly aware of these curious omissions but it is ever so much more painful when the student is black black students who wail about the absence of blackness in white college education accordingly are not trying to destroy american education so much as they are trying desperately to renovate it their compensatory response to black exclusion has taken a separatist flavor for the most part on the surface but it may seem ironic to those who misunderstand them that in the name of black nationalism calling for the presence of more black students and professors they actually are bringing about more desegregation of white colleges than there ever was before the name of the game is the elevation of a people by means of one important escalatorcollege education separatism and integrationism are possible approaches to that end they lose their effectiveness when swayed by dogmatic traces of absolutism they become full ends in themselves it will be an irony of recorded history i have written elsewhere that integration was used in the second half of this century to hold the black race down just as segregation was so instituted in the first half black students now seem to feel that integration particularly in the token way in which it has been practiced up to now and the neotokenist manner now emerging elevates individual members of the group but paradoxically in plucking many of the strongest members from the group while failing to alter the lot of the group as a whole weakens the collective thrust which the group might otherwise muster increasingly black students are turning their backs on the old tendency for negro college graduates to escape from the black community instead of returning to help build it this new mood is born of a greater awareness of the glories of their own past as a people an image they now wish to convey also to others hence the clamor for more black courses and courses taught from a black perspective or dark courses as i overheard one white colleague tell another later translated by a sociology professor into colorcompatible courses in the effort to make education relevant to the black communityand by indirection to the white communitythe communities themselves may be transformed each in its own way and so to speak made relevant to a bona fide education thus black student endeavors not only if successful might bring about a kind of black renaissance they could possibly wield an impact on the entire cemetery of american education during a im y fiv ej ttx day weekend that q r started on nov miqrr more than students scholars and artists from states and more than colleges and universities gathered at howard university for a conference called towards a black university it was the most comprehensive group of great black thinkers ever to focus on this single issue if you ran your finger down the guest list it would fall on names like dr alvin poussaint leroi jones maxroach harold cruse rhody mccoy ossie davis maul ana ron karenga stokely carmichael dr andress taylor and hundreds of others with national and local reputations to the howard campus the conference had the effect of a rock thrown into a pool it caused ripples but two months later the surface of the pool gave little sign that the questions raised by the conference were submerged there however for some like acklyn lynch a social science instructor at howard who helped to design the conference it achieved exactly what he had supposed it would it gave people a chance to get together and start to talk about the kinds of things they were going to have to do it furthered the dialogue he added that he was still talking and exchanging ideas by telephone with people from all over the country people he had met at the conference during those bright warm five days the howard campus was full of dashikis afros undercover fbi agents and revolutionary talk former howard instructor nathan hare had declined an invitation to return for the conference because he said howard students would rather talk about a black university instead of making the university black he stayed at san francisco state college where students were doing more than talking his statement read unless every howard student comes armed with a shotgun and a molotov cocktail they are defenseless against an amos n andy administration lynch reflected later however that talk was all they had intended to do back in the s and s scientists from all over the world were meeting and talking about space exploration but the first flight didnt take place until years later buddy hunt a howard freshman interrupted to say that the black university couldnt wait that long we were all sitting in lynchs office on the third floor of founders library lynch was quick to add that he had not meant that it should he turned from marking final examination papers but you cant have a fiveday conference and after its over go out and build a black university there are thousands of questions that you have to answer first but the prospect of revolutionary talk was enough to bring a reaction from the trustees i quoted to lynch a statement the board had issued to the effect that howard was founded years ago primarily for the education of disadvantaged black people but nothing in its charter will support a black university they said seemingly unmindful that howard years later has very little relation to the really disadvantaged black people who live in the slums surrounding the campus in northwest washington the trustees were making it plain that the school which has produced half the countrys black doctors a good percentage of its black lawyers senator edward brooke supreme court justice thurgood marshall and washingtons mayor walter washington was not going to tolerate anything revolutionary happening to general howards university as one student called it and laughed lynch looked up from his papermarking again the trustees didnt have to tell us that the conference was not designed to have howard become the black university invitations to the conference stated precisely what the conference was designed for the concept of a black university is revolutionary it emerges out of the frustrations of black students educators activist and community leaders who recognize that the present institutions of higher learning have no relevance to the total black community and who realize the contradictions of allowing themselves to be accultured into a society which debili tates black people our responsibility as conference participants is to define the structure and mechanics of that university on wednesday in a twohour keynote speech stokely carmichael told the delegates they were going to have to quit talking and start acting but the conferees had come from as far away as califor nia to talk so they broke into small workshops and met in classrooms and houses in the community and read poetry and prose and listened to jazz and talked the range of subjects was too wide to summarize well in short every aspect imaginable was dealt withfinancial international political curricular artistic athletic technological environmental structural agricultural musical clerical there were workshops digging out the answers to some of the thousands of questions that had to be answered a howard coed tall thin very attractive recalled that some of the most beautiful people in the world were in town for that weekend lynch complained however that only about five percent of the howard student body participated this figure seemed surprisingly low to some of the outsiders who were there that weekend but it was hard to tell the participants from the students who were simply making their regular rounds to classes in the same buildings lynch said he took it upon himself to close the workshop sessions to representatives of the white press he said he was trying to avoid the danger of misrepresentation and sensationalism but others say it was more a group decision which was in part motivated by the planners belief that black people at this stage talk more freely when there are no white people present which meant that some conferees attempted to eject white faculty members one observer said the selection of who was black enough got a little ridiculous a black former howard student who came on his own said he was put out because he happened to work for a white newspaper he said there was a dude a holder of a black belt in karate at the door to cramton auditorium threatening to hurt him if he was caught inside the dude had a list of folks he was going to chop up the former student said the local media reacted with anger white americans perhaps more than any other people on earth get really disturbed when they are discriminated against radio station wwdc broadcast an editorial which started off by saying officially approved discrimination is supposed to be a thing of the past and ended up with howard university chartered by congress supported in large by public money has no right to permit discrimination on its campus emphasis added the administration was in a dilemma it was caught between white money and black students a spokesman for the university said the administration did nothing organizers of the conference said the university closed certain facilities to the conference forcing it to hold most of its last workshops in the gym several outsiders said at the end that there were so few people remaining that all the workshops could fit into the gym perhaps all of the reports are partially correct or perhaps none of them are some participants complained that the conference did not get much support from the community this may have been because the conference was not well advertised in washington by barring the washington presswhich thougl overwhelmingly whiteowned i nonetheless the least segregatec and the fairest of any large citj press establishment in the countn the organizers assured that ven little news would come down fron howard hill to the rest of wash ington but the conference survived al this midway through a major re organization was necessary to keef all the participants from attending the workshops conducted by the big names and neglecting the ones where a lot of the bread and butter work was being done a small group of hard working students planned and made the major decisions at the conference all of them i interviewed said there were many things they would do differently if they had it to do over again but all agreed it was a good first step joey mitchell a howard junior who is in charge of reprinting the official results of the conference rated it a success despite the bumpy road it traveled he has in hand resolutions and about papers that deal not only with the black universitys role but also with the bordering areas of the black mans role historically presently and the future in white society the papers and resolutions are available through the office of the howard university student association which sponsored and paid for the conference the papers and resolutions summarize what came out of the interaction of students artists muslims professors scientists community leaders clergymen poets musicians and intellectuals mitchell said they are first steps which will have to be joined to the next steps taken in new york or atlanta or los angeles or san francisco or somewhere the term negritude created by the brilliant west indian poet aime cesaire and nurtured to maturity by leopold sedar senghor the poet politician of senegal can help us understand where the black writer is in this country today negritude in essence as i understand it denotes that particular quality those certain nuances which are universal to the thought action and behavior of black africans the concept of negritude has been and to some extent still is of fundamental importance in the writings literature of black africans trained in the frenchspeaking areas ie by those writers who have willingly or unwillingly whatever the case may be adopted french cultural habits as part of their lifestyle negritude came into existence not purely as the result of french culture but as a needed reaction to french classical education suddenly black africans stranded together in time of crisis the weak and strong seek out their own in some french bar intellectualizing and rationalizing their existence became keenly aware of the fact that they were blackmen but most important they finally realized this in the most profound terms that were nonwhite too negritude in its final analysis can be considered the antithesis of everything french ie everything antiblack everything white the frenchafrican finally realized that he was accepted by the dominant white french society only because he was willing to subordinate his blackness and become as french as possible this meant among other things that the african had to adopt the dress mannerism culture and religion of western civilization thus the policy of assimilation was used to systematically destroy the mind and total identity of black africans stripping him completely of his africanness his blackness leaving him more french than african thats the context in which negritude grew it became that rebellious force used by the frenchafricans to try and recapture their past their culture their religion themselves and most of all their future with negritude the african writer did an aboutface and decided to exalt seek recreate and contain his africanness rather than continuing to run away from it or to cover it with the appropriate french substitutes this new literary movement to which cesaire helped give birth started in when the parisian review published his cahier dun retour au pays natal journal of a return to my native country which has since been reissued in book form by presence africaine the journal and later poems gave impetus to what is now considered negritude but negritude itself the concept of goes back a little further to about and was called negrismo negrismo started in cuba and was as was negritude influenced by africa and all things african cubans as well as africans had grown up under the white ruling class which tried to destroy everything antiwhite antiwestern or anything remotely connected with africa negrismo grew rapidly and influenced such writers as the cuban poets ramon guirao and nicolas guillen and the puerto rican poet luis pales matos thus the frame of reference that the african and cuban writers used to work in has been established to bring the concept of negritude a little closer to home i refer you to leopold senghors definition negritude is the sum total of the values of the civilization of the african world it is not racialism it is culture it is the embracing and domination of a situation in order to apprehend the cosmos by process of coming to terms with it negritude as we had then begun to conceive and define it was a weapon of defense and attack and inspiration actually negritude is the sum total of black consciousness and when used is not only applicable to literature but to all forms of art eg painting sculpture dance music etc ezekiel mphahlele who most certainly is not a proponent of negritude relates this sumtotal feeling in his the african image it is rather the assimilated african who has absorbed french culture who is now passionately wanting to recapture his past in his poetry he extols his ancestors ancestoral mask african wood carvings and bronze art and tries to recover the moorings of his oral literature he clearly feels he has come to a deadend in european culture and is still not really accepted as an organic part of french society for all the assimilation he has been through as a result frenchspeaking african nationalists have become a personification of this strong revulsion i think that by lightly reviewing the idea of negritude it will enable us to better understand the thought and meaning of blackwriting how alike blackpeople in this country are to the assimilated frenchafricans however in our case the term assimilated can be substituted with the euphemism integrated blackwriting as we view it today is the result of centuries of slavery and forced alienation from africa and onesself weve been exiles in a strange land where our whole lifestyle repeatedly comes into contradiction after contradiction blackwriting to the afroamerican as is negritude to the frenchafrican is the antithesis to a decadent culture that has systematically over the centuries debased and dehumanized us with the fury and passion of an unfeeling computer literature produced by blackhands is not necessarily blackwriting what has to be embodied in blackwriting first and foremost is that consciousness which reflects the true black experience the true afroamerican experience written and related in a style indicative of that experience which may mean as i believe it does new forms and perhaps adaptiveness of present forms black consciousness in any case can be a conscious or an unconscious effort in blackwriting if one is black its very difficult to write otherwise although we must understand there will be a pervasive presence of every and anything that is indigenous to the afroamerican people blackart is a functional art its what the africans call a collective art our art is committed to humanism it commits the artist they commit him in a future which then becomes present for him an integral part of himself the blackwriterartisan works out a concrete situation which means that he commits not only himself but his race his geography his history as well he uses the materials that are at hand and the everyday things which make up the texture of his life rejecting the anecdotal for this does not commit because it is without significance blackart as is african art is perishable this too is why it is functional like a poem is written not to be read and put aside but to actually become a part of the giver and receiver to perform some function to move the emotions to become a part of the dance or to simply make one act whereas the work itself is perishable the style and spirit of the creation is maintained and is used to produce new works here we can clearly see that art for arts sake is something out of a shakespearian dream it does not exist all blackart is social art for peoples sake an example of good blackwriting now in existence is an anthology called black fire edited by leroi jones ameer baraha and larry neal morrow pp black fire includes between its jackets a convincing collection of afroamerican literature its contributors plus its editors move to define and to present a forceful concentration of blackwriting with essays poems short stories and plays this is not to say that every author represented in black fire has contributed a work of art in accordance with my standards but it is to say that every selection of work in black fire is significant significant in that i feel that the test of a good writerpoet is not necessarily in what he says or how he says it but in what his work does to us i mean does the writer widen us does he clear our vision does he add to a deepening of our knowledge does he amplify our total being the saturday review said of black fire the ambitions of black fire make it newsworthy and instructive but the disparity between its ambitions and its achievement is painful and embarrassing painful and embarrassing to whom certainly not to those who contributed to it certainly not to the blackpeople who read it not many at certainly not to me but yes painful and embarrassing to some white boy who teaches english at williams college in massachusetts and has in all likelihood only seen six negroes in his lifetime who feels that just because saturday review sends him the books to review its his responsibility to be painful and embarrassed about it quietasitskept it was supposed to be painful for him and vet this painful and embarrassing reviewer from williams college goes on to say that yet an irreverent reviewer could merely repeat larry neals own statement and say the text could be destroyed and no one would be hurt in the least by it he the saturday reviews black literature authority does not remotely understand what larry neal meant by that statement brother neal was working from an ideological concept so foreign so alien to the western mind that one wonders how such people as the reviewer continue to have such control over blackpeople brother neal was quite clearly talking about the perishability of blackart remember art for the peoples sake art being functional and social meaning that the people will help to shape the art not here forever but until its full meaning has been realized what we have to understand is that every piece of writing in black fire is legitimate regardless of excellence because as with the frenchafricans of negritude black writers are in a process of defining and legitimizing their own worthworks and we dont need the great white pens of the saturday review or other liberal white sheets to sanction what they feel is or is not black literature or literature period black fire helped us to move into our own direction james t stewart points out whats necessary the point of the whole thing is that we must emancipate our minds from western values and standards we must rid our minds of these values saying so will not be enough with that we can easily understand what a b spellman was relating when he wrote there is a school of young african painters who have never seen a european painting and who refuse to be shown one david llorens clears the air when in the fellah the chosen ones the guardian he writes perhaps the starting point is to look at ourselves finally to question our existence not only to question it but also to realize our existence but sister lethonia gee is hipped to a beautiful part of her existence as indicated in her poem by glistening dancing seas all art is the reflection of its creator look at new york city chicago washington d c need i say more where and what you live in reflects you if you created it art is totalbeing it cannot be separated from life thats why we say that blackart is not only social but political which leads larry neal to say the artist and the political activist are one they are both shapers of the future reality both understand and manipulate the collective myths of the race how else could a b spellman write lines like thisc run on home blackpeople the only way to be is to be and unlike the frenchafricans black writers are not trying to address themselves to white people senghor and others wrote firstly for the frenchman not for the african people black poetrywriting is written for toabout and around the livesspiritactionshumanism and total existence of blackpeople black writing in formsoundwordusageintonationrhythmrepetitiondirectiondefinition and beauty is opposed to that which is now and yesterday considered writing ie white literature black fire may not be read by many blackpeople in its present form hard cover edition because of the price anytime a book is more than thirtyfive cents to one dollar you are in trouble to buy a book that costs more would do harm to most black families daily budgets but if possible i suggest that you acquire a copy of black ire steal it borrow it or wait for it to appear in paperback hopefully we can as a people move toward a black printing company so that we will not have to continuously run to the establishment presses to be published finally this is u yrmomma yrhistory yrliterature them is u actually a beautiful reflection understood by u alone others will not our creations are ours no one can really take away yrinnerself if u have one people can napalm other people because they never felt the pain of flesh falling off ones body george washington is their hero because there is nothing better the mod squad and julia are forced upon u in prime tv time because that is their reality not ours the great white hope is just that the great white hope our heroes will be named willie bigger thomas blood pee wee and maniac and will come out of the projects and be hip to richard nixon and lyndon johnson because their fathers were hip to them and their fathers fathers fathers and on and on leroi jones said it anyone who wears shoes would do well to purchase a pair ride them to your nearest bookstore and invest the difference wisely dark symphony free press an anthology edited by james a emanuel and theodore l gross is a must for anyone who happens not to be an authority on black literature and no doubt the authorities few that they are have already added it to their libraries a total of black authors of whom are deceased are represented in the page book of short stories essays poetry and criticism the book is divided into four sections early literature the negro awakening major authors and contemporary literature not the least of its merits are the lucid informative introductions to three sections there is no introduction to major authors essaylike biographical sketches on the four selectees as major authors langston hughes richard wright ralph ellison and james baldwin provide perceptive commentary on their many works shorter biographical sketches are included in the case of each of the other contributors clearly the editors did not in this case request of the authors a contribution of their own choosing the editors did the selecting and they were selective and even though the reader might on occasion wish they had selected a different work by a particular writer he must appreciate their having for the most part provided insights into the reasoning that led to their choices included in early literature are works by charles w chesnutt whose first story was published in and whose racial identity was for some years not made public paul laurence dunbar the master of dialect who died in at the tender age of frederick douglass and w e b dubois one might in reading douglass letter to his master or rereading it as the case might be make certain connections between then and now nuances in his fierce pride remind this reader of current literary celebrant eldridge cleaver and more in this work by douglass there is unmistakably the sense that man achieves goodness by wanting the freedom of others a quality critics have cited in praising the existentialist novels of one john uodike the section is concluded ith a poem and a chapter from the souls of black folk by w e b dubois whose awakening was indeed early one agrees with the editors that no brief selection from his voluminous work could do justice to this man of the world but how schizoid the mind that would make such a recognition and yet omit him from inclusion in major authors or was that politicalas surely must have been the case as regards leroi jones who is represented in the section on contemporary literature by three poems the negro awakening includes the works of james weldon johnson alain locke claude mckav jean toomer rudolph fisher eric walrond sterling a brown and countee cullen it marks the period better known as the negro renaissance the s that era in which black writers came together in their separateness and dived into the literary seas only to come out to borrow a line from claude mckays baptism a stronger soul within a finer frame the scholarship of alain lockes the new negro and the singularly classic work of criticism by sterling a brown negro character as seen by white authors are outstanding in this section the excerpts from cane recently reissued by harper and row as a perennial classic reveal the extraordinary gift of jean toomer the man who so early deserted the naturalistic fiction and who had he not ceased writing most certainly would have contributed much to that deeper exploration of the consciousness psychic and cosmic ongoing in the literature of the past odd years flying home and king of the bingo game by ellison the man who killed a shadow by wright and baldwins sonnys blues are stories that speak for themselves the excellence of the late langston hughes is present in the form of five poems and two hilarious jesse b semple tales and for those who have stubbornly insisted that the literature of social protest was unconcerned with exploration of the ultimate questions hughes story on the road is a brilliant example of their folly in the middle of the depression which marks as well the time of the writing a black man in search of shelter from the cold and snow is felled by the cops the moment he succeeds in breaking down the door of a white church in his unconscious state he dreams dreams that the church comes falling down that christ comes off the cross well ill be dogged said sargent this heres the first time i ever seed you off the cross yes said christ crunching his feet in the snow you had to pull the church down to get me off the cross it is vintage hughes the ethics of living jim crow hidden name and complex fate and notes of a native son nonfictional works by wright ellison and baldwin respectively have in common their autobiographical natures and yet in a most interesting way serve as a reflection of just how diverse were the backgrounds that shaped the sensibilities of the three extraordinary artists contemporary literature features the works of albert murray john a williams paule marshall ernest j gaines william melvin kelley melvin b tolson arna bontemps robert e hayden dudley randall margaret a walker gwendolyn brooks james a emanuel mari evans leroi jones arthur p davis philip butcher nathan a scott jr and julian mayfield it is worth noting i think that the italicized authors contributions to black literature would include their having along with the writers of the early literature and the negro awakening profoundly influenced the others appearing in this final section space will not permit much comment on the works of the above but the short stories of gains and kelley are witness to exceptional talents julian mayfields essay into the mainstream and oblivion brings us into the day that is upon us a day one can hardly hope to comprehend while ignoring ones own writers and persisting in the belief that the prophets were whitedavid llorens it was fisk universitys fit acting president i james lawson v whose voice at the other end of the line asked how soon can you be here for a personal interview i fumbled the key to my office at oaklands merritt junior college between my anxious fingers realizing that relinquishing them would mark the end of my contracted services for the year straining my ear against the friday afternoon summer noises which seeped into the public telephone booth forming static and following the demands of long distance communication in terms of abrupt decision making i startled even myself by answering monday that is if thats agreeable it was with him going home and in a matter of a few days two decades stood between my alma mater and hometown and me for me it was a period of growth mobility turbulence and commitment and i presumed it to be not too different back home i now lived in the suburbs of san francisco bay area in an integrated neighborhood with my dentist husband and five children we wore the badge of acceptance for having made it in the good old american freeenterprising mainstream tradition but already my third teenager to graduate from the local high school in as many years was saying forget it im tired of being exotic a museum piece the social integrator i choose a negro collegeone of those in nashville i pointed out to the young ones the fact that they could very well be sentimentalizing the southern situation since unlike me they had not grown uo in a segregated environment still failing to dampen their enthusiasm i reminded them that nashville was the home that i had been orphaned from and not them they checked me with you better know it for two years i had worked as a parttime instructor in two junior colleges one of these was a nearly allwhite suburban tomorrowlandtype institution the other a ghettofringed urban yesteryear model with over black students having asked myself a few questions such as to whom did i owe my allegiance where were my teaching skills most needed which situation offered the greater reward in humanistic rather than materialistic terms even as i noted the leaded nature of them i knew the proper answer perhaps i always knew it just as most black intellectuals have known it factors such as the vast difference between the two plantsboth of whom i supported through taxesthe aura of academic freedom and exploration which seemed far more prevalent in one the huge investment in terms of personal involvement and extra curricular time which one demanded in order to meet the communitys needs succeeded in clouding the real issue but i had already returned the shiny new key to my office in the suburban school and was ghettobound when i heard that fisk was in need of english teachers black ones and then there was stanford camerons exhortation in the may negro digest come home black intellectuals before its too late you cant go home again seems closer to the truth according to my own personal experience john o killens writerinresidence at fisk has identified the problem of the century and the main job of the black revolution as that of the deniggerization of the world and when he points out that minds enslaved with words must be freed with words it seems he offers a direct challenge to black language arts experts who should play key roles in liberating black consciousness if indeed the midtwentieth century is a world given over to racism the negro college campus is apt to be strategically the seat of neocolonial rule the english department which requires that every student come through its portals for a stamp of approval and a ticket of eligibility in pursuit of academic degrees must be the focal point of conditioning the mind of the negro to accept his role in a racist world if this is true a university such as fiskwith nine of the teachers in the english department white including the past chairman and interim chairmandoes not give any indication of the white mans conditioning of black minds cracking at the seams in fact the disproportion of white to negro teachers would suggest reinforcement of the traditional pattern and should assure the power structure that the seams are uptight going home then is a twoway road and must be paved with good intentions by all parties concerned the total black community of the usa has been duped by institutionalized brainwashing in the schools churches yes even the homes and historical conditioning toward an acceptance of a status of dehumanization and deprivation spiritual social if not actually physical the total white community is diseased with racial delusionsinstitutionalized in the same ways through myth and deed sanctioned by religious creed and lawthereby rendering it incompetent to deal with a democratic nonracist world body in a healthy way our educational institutions reflect the american dilemma in a stark mirror image there are many black intellectuals such as j herman blake negro digest march from the university of california berkeley who see rampant racism at one of americas great universities who sees the institution as an intellectual microcosm of america who sees these campuses for what they arehideous for white draft dodgers exploiters of the scholarship racket racist snobs who use the campuses as country clubs and sports arenas there are many black intellectuals who are disenchanted with the great northern and western colleges and universities where in the spirit of the democratic tradition they have been hired out by the rent a negro agency for the instant integrated look what are his alternatives are the negro colleges and universities ready for him or are they engaged in a historical sweep marked by a headlong rush down the sellout road to integration or intellectual and scholastic extermination of the black man an example which might point out the fallacy of this thinking is that at a time when the ratio of negro dentists to the negro population is at a crisis low level around percent of the entering freshmen at the dental college of meharry medical college one of the twc negro medical colleges were white students are educational institutions faced with the task of educating black people committed to the task which should be within their special province while northern schools are crying out for teachers with a specialty in motivating and educating the culturally divergent child is the negro university training its student teachers to meet this demand the northern and western college having admitted to the historical distortions which have created the american image in all its unreality is now seeking teachers who are aware of the inclusivity of americas heritage are the negro universities teaching contemporary american literature which includes the contributions which have been categorically excluded from mainstream anthologies because it represented black art do they offer courses in revisionist history revolutionary black sociology afroamerican culture anc humanities black art and life political science in the black community black students at many of the california colleges and universities are demanding a black curriculum as a specialty in the black studies department which will ultimately offer a degree and a new career field this of course enables the student so trained to be a more effective worker in community action programs involving minorities does the negro campus provide an atmosphere for innovative programs and a laboratory for testing new methodology the black intellectual must be willing to choose a position which offers more in humanistic rewards than materialistic gains his role as a missionary if he must assume that role at this time must be played out with black principals as supporting members of his cast and on location in the black ghettoes across the land being whiteworld missionaries spreads us too thin and dissipates our energies without the benefits of making racial gains ambition must be tempered with compassion and concern for the black brother on the other hand the black communities wherever they exist must prepare for this second coming they must prepare the way for him this time around he should be the welcomed guest and not the intruder they must lay the groundwork which will result in an acceptance of him in the same good faith as he accepts the challenge the educational institutions must have no doubts about his belonging about the role he is destined to play in reconstructing a healthy american society above all it must be made clear that the black intellectual is not suspect rather the total society is suspect the total academic environment is suspect he has learned his lesson once he has achieved at great odds he has proven it can be done and that he can do it and having accepted the challenge he indicates a willingness to do it again success breeds success he becomes by example hope for the black student he must be kept comfortable in his blackness in order to impart selfassuredness to his students and most important the black student must want the black intellectual back home he must make him feel at ease must make him believe in himself and in his decision to come back where its at the student must enter a partnership with the intellectual to start the wheels of meaningful education grinding at a new alltime high a recordbreaking pace black students must understand that when adam clayton powell admonished the graduating class at howard university to seek audacious power and thereby ushered in the age of black_power he called for a black renaissance resurrected black creativity in all disciplines a rededication toward building black institutions of splendid achievement with intellectual excitement dynamic creativity humanistic idealism none of these can be achieved without black scholars who have key roles in developing this idea from dream to reality this is a reality with a future it is one which can act as a serum to cure the diseases which wittingly or not halfhearted integration attempts have brought to the black communityintellectual mediocrity economic inferiority political subservience going home can and should be a beautiful thing for as adam clayton powell points out we are the last revolutionaries in americathe last transfusion of freedom into the bloodstream of democracy because we are we must mobilize our wintry discontent to transform the cold heart and white face of this nation this is going to be a jjf r somewhat personal ac i count of my experiences baching in a rural black college in the south it is not written in bitterness i liked the school especially the students i enjoyed teaching them i liked my fellow teachers i even liked the administrators and it was great living in the country after escaping from the din and clatter of clashing delusions of grandeur in new york city my connection with the college was an act of desperation on both sides they were desperate because their history teacher suddenly resigned at midsemester and they couldnt find anyone else i was desperate for more complicated reasons ever since i was years old i had belonged to the selfrighteous left to those who felt that because they subscribed to certain beliefs they were automatically wise virtuous and destined to play an earthshaking role in the world i had married into the faith and all my social ties were with fellow believers naturally we talked to ourselves and each other reinforcing our mutual delusions now the only world i knew or could easily function in as the white mother of black kids was shattered i had gone through a sudden perception change it is not easy to describe i suddenly saw people and their interactions in a new way everyone seemed to be wearing a mask and these masks were telling themselves and each other lies the masks were cold and unemotional there was at the same time intense emotional nonverbal communication going on which i was directly perceiving but the nonverbal communication between myself and others was different there was something which i can only describe as spirit which shook them leapt into their eyes flashed there for a moment like a desperate prisoner begging to be freed and then disappeared no one had slipped me any acid i knew nothing about mysticism id been an atheist since i was so there were limited ways for me to interpret all this first i asked myself do other people perceive the way i perceive now or do they perceive the way i used to perceive i watched them for a while and concluded that they only perceive the lying masks but they do not know that they are lying the masks were the limits of their consciousness and their only way of knowing what goes on in the world is what the masks tell each other no one else whom i could observe was perceiving like me the lying masks were interacting with each other and arriving at a concensus which they accepted as reality and people were acting on the basis of this consensus my impression was that very little of what existed in the real world got past the masks i concluded that either i was crazy and they were all sane or i was sane and they were all crazy i had no wav of knowing for sure so i decided to test it out while being very careful not to say or do anything that would get me locked up i would operate on the basis of the reality which i perceived and observe others operating upon the basis of the reality which they perceived and see whose reality was more reliable i found myself back in new york in among familiar places and people really perceiving them all for the first time i couldnt play their games anymore i longed desperately to escape from the circles i had always moved in and to try out my new perceptions on the world out there i went to the college for the interview the president explained to me that they had only been hiring white teachers for a year the board was afraid that any white teacher who would come there would be a communist they hired chinese and east indians but alas they couldnt get enough teachers of any race and finally the board permitted him to hire a few whites he asked me is there anything you have to tell me i might as well know it now yes there is my kids are black are they adopted no theyre my natural children i have some relatives who look as white as you do i have often been taken for a creole im from new orleans i speak french whatever i say around here reaches all ears i could say have you met our new creole history teacher from new orleans thats fine with me when you get your drivers license be sure they get the race right all the teachers except one believed it some of them even began to comment that i was a typical creole type one of the teachers from new orleans asked me where i had lived and i told him the seventh ward which is a very mixedup place i invited a creole friend to visit me and introduced her as my cousin the teachers were convinced but not the students they werent fooled they knew i was a foreigner a gi bride there were debates about me in the dormitories shes irishno shes german no shes italian i showed them my passport to prove that i was born in new orleans they still didnt believe me why do you think im a foreigner i dont have an accent no but you dont act like an american teaching was hard work i had a heavy load i had never taught before and was teaching subjects i hadnt studied in years on one days notice my first minutes in a classroom were memorable i looked down at the faces puzzled to the point of panic their pencils poised above their notebooks not knowing what to write finally i read the same expression on every face what in the hell is this woman talking about i stopped you dont understand what im saying do you they all shook their heads no ok lets start over we spent a lot of time on words words were concepts and once they had a word they understood a lot of things once i used the word paternalism and no one knew what that meant i explained paternalism is when somebody makes you do what they want you to do by acting niceand you better do it or else the students had been taught to obey to learn by rote they couldnt understand why i objected to their quoting the textbook word for word on their exams i didnt copy it i memorized it they were used to the teacher giving them all the questions and all the pat answers to the questions once we discussed a question in class and i closed the discussion without giving them an answer they were disturbed but whats the answer whats the answer there isnt any answer i replied they laughed they had never heard of such a thing most of the students were from the immediate area they were from very poor families with lots of kids they were patient and longsuffering the campus was like a prison it was several miles out of town and there was no public transportation girls were expelled for riding in boys cars the girls had to be in their rooms by pm they couldnt even sit on the porch even in the summer the girls dorm had iron bars on the windows the presidents dogs were released from their kennel to roam the campus at night the teachers favorite topic of conversation was the students how stupid and ignorant they were the students dont count at all said a not very scholarly teacher a university is a community of scholars it exists for the sake of the teachers the school was desperate for phds and the degree seemed to be all important the chairman of my department was an east indian who had just gotten his doctorate from nyu he had never taught knew nothing about this country planned to return to india and enter politics shortly and was very status conscious he pretended not to know his black colleagues when they met off campus then there were several elderly chinese refugees the students couldnt understand their english they cared nothing about the students they let them cheat openly on exams because they didnt want to bother stopping them students were eager to get into their classes because they gave good grades and expected nothing from the students although it was a state college they had something called religious emphasis week this consisted of sermons in which the social order was thoroughly identified with god the students were exhorted to feel eternally grateful for the opportunity to get a college education although i dont think that is a good description of what they were getting right after religious emphasis week we had a class discussion on a statement by napoleon to the effect that the only way to make the poor and downtrodden submit to their lot here on earth is to promise them rewards in the hereafter one of the students thought napoleon had something there the other students indignantly stared her down many of the teachers complained about the students lack of spontaneity they never smile they never show a spark of life after a while we had to close the windows and doors in my class because the discussions were getting so animated when one of my students said i dont know why we should be grateful to lincoln for freeing us he only did it because he had to i thought i had it made there were a handful of students from the outside world most of them on athletic scholarships one student a basketball player from indiana was determinedly hostile to me and influenced the class the day malcolm was killed we both found ourselves explaining to the class who malcolm was one of the students said didnt malcolm preach hate we both answered together malcolm didnt preach hate before the term was over the basketball player was carrying my books to class arent you afraid the students will make fun of you i dont care anything about that he said most of the students were from tobacco farms but the college was in a lumbering area the family that owned the lumber mill owned the town and everyone in it they wouldnt allow an antipoverty program in the area because they didnt want any interference with their cheap help but the college did have funds for student jobs which teachers were given the right to distribute among their favorites the college community was a weird world of makebelieve there were teachers at that school who had worked there for years and had never been to town they didnt even know where main street was these were the teachers most likely to talk about what a lovely advanced progressive town it was how important the college was to the town and how much the black teachers were esteemed by the community i soon discovered that the only way to maintain these fantasies of prestige power and status in relation to the town was indeed not to go there black phds would find themselves addressed by their first names by white store clerks my kids and i were nearly assaulted for trying to buy a takeout pizza from a white restaurant when i told my fellow teachers about it i was advised not to file a complaint if i wanted to keep my job late spring and early summer was harvest time on the nearby truck farms migrant workers arrived from florida on open trucks some of my students told me they had hidden migrant workers who were trying to escape from the camps as time passed recruiting of workers to get in the crops became aggressive students were stopped on the streets recruiters approached small children one morning at oclock i found my nineyearold son dressed and ready to pick corn for a day i had a hard time stopping him the children told me about conditions in the fields they had to look out for the tractors the tractors didnt look out for them it was swampy country and there were poisonous snakes the children were transported on the backs of open trucks three small boys had been killed on the highway the year before the children seemed to be frightened they would come and tell me when they were beaten up i would ask if they told their parents they always said they wont do anything about it i didnt know what to tell them i couldnt do anything about it either one little boy with terror in his eyes was mute my son tried to teach him to speak the ku klux klan was very active in the area and they would hold silent demonstrations lines of cars with confederate plates would parade slowly down main street blowing their horns i got worried about my kids we lived on the campus my son went to school right across the street i told him to keep away from white people especially people with confederate plates on their car he paid me no mind hed bring white boys on the campus to play with him once he told me mom you were wrong about those people with confederate plates on their car i made friends with some of them i went to their house they were very nice kids can make you feel humble sometimes the campus was like an island after i had been there for a week it was hard to remember any other world everything was provided by the school credit was opened up for me in town i rented my house from the school i got my meals from the school but there was no paycheck the first two months i worked there if i needed a few bucks i had to go ask the president to please give me an advance on my salary i was afraid i would be like the sharecropper with his bales of cotton when payday came i thought they would say you owe us i finally worked up to getting paid every month its an isolated ingrown community the teachers each live in their own little world and are afraid to talk to each other they treat each other with the greatest formal respect perhaps to compensate for the lack of respect they receive outside no one is on a firstname basis with his colleagues it is always mr mrs or best of all dr the teachers have absolute power over the students the administration has absolute power over the teachers the local policeman has absolute power over the administration and as the true cliche goes power corrupts some of the students were conditioned to corruption around final exam time some of the girls offered to clean my house and couldnt understand why i refused students complained to me about teachers flunking students who rejected their advancesas if i could do anything about it at the end of the semester i heard that a teacher with tenure was fired for no apparent reason before the summer was over i was fired although i had a contract to teach the next year because a young man who was my friend had registered for summer school no one at the college objected but the local policeman told the president to fire me which he did with much guilty selfrighteous indignation i knew it hurt to be reminded that when it comes down to it the local policeman runs the school i had no hard feelings about being fired what i did object to was the effort to stop me from securing employment elsewhere stating that i was fired for violation of ethical codes and customs which are expected for membership in the college community here which really sounds awful and concluding by i hope for you and yours the best of everything that reminds me of bob dylan theyll stone you then theyll wish you good luck the american association of university professors asked for four months salary for me for breach of contract i never got it i suppose the local policeman would not allow it i was blacklisted all the way to detroit i was hired as a substitute teacher in the detroit public schools and then told that some of the committee members on further discussion had changed their vote a secret memorandum a copy of which some kind anonymous soul at the school board mailed to me stated it would be our strong recommendation that mrs hall not be hired in any capacity by the detroit board of education this opinion is based on her lack of judgment and general background for working in our schools memorandum from gladys v hamilton to miss malorney dated dec file no approved by julie strwn adm asst robt le anderson this officiallyapproved blacklist did not stop albert schiff from writing me on jan suggesting that i complete more courses and reapply for employment with the detroit public schools i was informed by the american association of university professors that there were other complaints about blacklisting emanating from the same school their approach is resign thereby voluntarily renouncing your contract rights or they will do their best to see that you never get a job again i was fortunate because i am also a legal secretary and we got by on that for a while and since i couldnt get a job i went back to school and learned fellowships ill have my doctorate in history from the university of michigan in a few months most teachers in black colleges arent so lucky they cant type i am making this modest contribution to the discussion of the black university in the hope that some effort will be made to raise the degraded position of teachers in rural black colleges to something approaching national standards they are treated like serfs they feel like they are serfs and in fact they are serfs still they are in a better position to change the situation than are the students if the teachers were well organized and got support from professional organizations from the outside i dont know yet whose reality works but it sure is interesting finding out in special issue of the negro digest devoted to a considerauon of the black uni versity concept you editorialized that something is gravely wrong with the conventional approach to the education of black children no longer is arguable much of the problem of course is general there is something gravely wrong with american education period however as always in a society whichbeing racist by nature assigns opportunities and rewards according to race and color those people suffer most who are regarded least and those people in the american society are black people the general validity of this observation should not be a bar to repetitive assertions until all those who are responsible for and involved in education at whatever level in our country not only recognize the deficiencies in our total educational system but are engaged upon meaningful programs to correct what needs to be corrected the important question is how can the system best be changed for black children and young adults in the united states this question takes on some particular connotations since the traditionally or predominantly black colleges and universities have borne the brunt of the responsibility for educating the black leadership of this country many of these schools have compared favorably and still do with other schools of similar size with more resources and stronger faculties in many instances these largely segregated schools did superior jobs with their studentproducts despite the problems inherent in black higher education not the least of these problems being the necessity for combatting and remedying the deficiencies of our general educational system so far as black students were concerned the increasingly complex nature of our society and government beginning with the great depression of the s the technological advances which began with the necessity for a more efficient war machine during the s the acceleration of these developments following the launching of sputnik i in and the ensuing age of cybernation have effected basic changes in our society these changesinvolving environmental conditions manpower requirements and individual and societal attitudeshave created new challenges and opportunities for all segments of our society these challenges and opportunities demand a fundamental and continuing reappraisal of courses of study in institutions of higher education it occurs to me that the necessity for a changed role for the predominantly or traditionally black colleges and universities must be viewed at least partially within this context this suggests an awesomely dual responsibility for the predominantly or traditionally black schools of higher educationie a relevance and validity with regard to black students and black communities and a relevance and validity with regard to the society in which black students and black communities will exist inherent in both responsibilities is the necessity for preparing students to meet the challenges of change in todays and tomorrows world and with respect to both responsibilities the overriding consideration should and must be to give these students that education and training sought after in todays and tomorrows labor market essentially then the education of black americans must encompass at least three objectivesie an increased awareness and knowledge of their heritage and of the contributions they have made throughout history a motivation and ability to render muchneeded assistance and services of various kinds to the total black community and the development of knowledge and skills necessary for gainful employment and satisfactory living in the larger everchanging society in terms of what is necessary for sustained upward economic and social mobility of black americans i think it meaningless if not dangerous to attempt to assign priorities as between these three objectives they are all necessary moreover they constitute the basis for the continuing validity and relevance of predominantly or traditionally black institutions of higher learning these considerations dictate some rather basic modifications in the curricula of our colleges and universities modifications which involve new directions new and different courses and innovatively different techniques and methodologies of instruction moreover there is the necessity for relating our curricula and campus activities more definitively and directly to the needs of the communities of which we are a part none of this will be easy but all is possible with varying degrees of ease or difficulty dependent upon conditions pertaining to particular colleges or universities at fisk we are attempting to meet the challenges represented by the need and desire for black identity dignity and status on the one hand and by the new career opportunities for black college graduates on the other regarding the former we have instituted courses in africancaribbean studies the fine arts literature history race relations sociology and anthropology which focus on contributions problems and developments of black people regarding the latter for example we are in the process of establishing an ambitious program in business administration which will prepare students who choose this area of study for promising employment immediately upon graduation as well as for graduate study in the field we are cognizant of the need to do even more to meet the twin challenges above and are continually alert to the opportunities for doing more we are convinced however that meeting the first challenge should represent a supplement to and enrichment of our basic program and our efforts to meet the second challenge the idea of a black university is not clear to me i hear some advocates say that they want a black university large enough to enroll ten thousand students they mean a new creation this would be a very expensive enterprise if half of the students lived in dormitories cost for the construction of dormitories alone could be easily or million dollars the academic plant to accommodate ten thousand students would cost another or million dollars and this is a conservative estimate such a plant could cost between and million dollars if money of this magnitude is to be gotten from the negro community we can forget it the negroes record of supporting higher education leads me to predict that black people would never give that amount of money if the negroes educational efforts were all centered in this one university and they might be able to get the money from black people who could get them united to give it do the advocates of a single black university expect to get the money from white people white support of negro educational institutions over the past hundred years has been niggardly what would lead one to believe that white philanthropy would be more generous in its giving to a black university than it has been in giving to predominantly negro colleges it should be made crystal clear what is meant by a black university how much of the curriculum would be devoted to afroamerican people how much of the curriculum would be devoted to disciplines other than afroamerican studies would the faculty be all black would the student body be all black if white faculty and white students are excluded do we expect socalled white colleges and universities to exclude all black scholars and black students would the supreme court permit this kind of segregation do we mean by black universities regional centers of institutions that are already in existence as one writer in the march negro digest advocates if we mean regional black colleges and universities the question of the complexion of the faculty and student body must still be asked and answered frankly i do not believe we need to build a new black university in order to get what i think we need nor do i believe we need to concentrate on a few colleges and universities in certain centers of the united states in order to get what we need and must have i believe that there could and should be established in every negro or black college in the united states a division of afroamerican studies which would concentrate on the black mans history and all that he has contributed to the arts and sciences literature and art sports and drama politics and business i believe existing institutions can do this including the institutions that call themselves white this is not enough i have always believed that negro or black colleges should be deeply concerned with and deeply involved in the life of the black community instead of training negroes to get away from the poor and the ghettos they should be trained to help improve the conditions of black people so that the gap between all ciasses of negroes will be narrowed or eliminated there are six million college and university students enrolled in institutions of higher education of which or not more than four percent are black certainly not more than or five percent are black a single black university of would be a mere drop in the bucket but if all institutions of higher learning tackled the problem of black identity through the teaching of afroamerican history and through training to help improve the conditions of less privileged black people we could do now what has been neglected for a hundred years negro students are ready for it now years ago when dr carter g woodson the eminent negro historian was trying to get black students to appreciate themselves and africa he didnt have much success and let me say with emphasis that to get this done we do not have to become racists and drive out all white teachers and all white students with government industry and white institutions pulling black scholars apart to get them there just arent enough black scholars to go around although i can appreciate the current emphasis on blackness and the much discussed black university i am mighty glad that i didnt have to wait years for someone in the late s to teach me to appreciate being what i am black my mother unlettered and untutored did say many times to her children you are as good as anybody this was helpful to me although the white world did not accept my mothers philosophy my heroes were black in my native south carolina fairly often some negro would come along selling pictures or pamphlets of a few negro leaders and pictures of fred douglass booker t washington and paul laurence dunbar hung on our walls in my high school days booker t washington meant more to me than george washington frederick douglass the unyielding negro abolitionist was more of a hero to me than william lloyd garrison the fanatic white abolitionist dunbar as a poet inspired me more than longfellow i heard about crispus attucks and was thrilled the negroes in the south carolina legislature during reconstruction and in the postreconstruction years were men who were held up to us in high school history classes as being great men and not the negrohating ben r tillman and his kind i had identity the thrust now is toward black identity and i have no quarrel with those who advocate it fortunately i have always had black identity the emphasis that the f i young blacks have j ii placed upon the discovery and promulgation of the truth about the afroamerican community is refreshing for so many years the vast majority of us have been in such hot pursuit of the norms of the majority culture that we haveperhaps unwittinglyforsaken our own identity and assumed a false superego that leaves us fragmented persons i say the vast majority this is by no means true of all blacks in i had to take negro history as a requirement for the a b at virginia union university in i had to take negro literature to graduate all the way from phyllis wheatley to margaret walker moreover when in college we wired fred waring and asked him to include our alma mater on his saturday medley of college songs he did judge earl dearing of louisville and i signed the telegram in the fall of indeed some of us have been proud aware conscious and black for a long long time we find it appalling that black students lump all middle class blacks negroes in one ball and condemn them all as spineless accommodationists this is false and arrogant notwithstanding the charge applies to enough to make it valid and because there is a sufficient void in the knowledge and appreciation of the history of american blacks it is understandable that there is a call for a black university since there have been white universities for so long and all other kinds of de facto separate universities serving ethnic and demographic units it is time for blacks to cry out rather recently the jews established brandeis and expanded yeshiva by adding a coed undergraduate program catholics never entrusted higher or lower education to the majority if jews and catholics regard their traditions as sufficiently precious to preserve them in their own schools a black university makes sense the lutherans too what is st olafs moreover public colleges located in pockets of cultural homogeneity have in fact been conduits of a continuity of mores and attitudeseg ole miss lsu georgia tech vmi and the citadel blacks still feel like aliens on these campuses yet a black university faces some very practical problems that may indicate another answer who would finance such an enterprise the idea of racial separation has already fallen on evil days because it has been associated with violence somehow it has not enjoyed a positive affirmative connotation it has been associated with the riots and four letter words this is an awful casualty it is an idea that should be debated on its own merits i cannot see the sponsorship for such an idea forthcoming but the idea need not die aborning a black university is more imminent than many imagine if the concepts of violence and negative chauvinism can be strained out only nine months of planning could accomplish what most have in mind for a black universitv at atlanta fisk or howard since there is no black math chemistry biology or physics what we are talking about is an orientation in history literature social science psychology fine arts and education that is black it means viewing these disciplines from the perspective of a black student standing body deep soul deep in his own culture this implies no hostility no separatism no alienation it could imply a disciplined scholarship that will unearth truths long hidden a bona fide experience of the thought and feelings of black writers painters and musicians a construction of social theories that will have an authenticity for black people the most dramatic results could be seen in teacher education hardly any school does justice to the challenge of the black pupil in its teacher education program but even that would not be enough every university every college should recognize the neglect of black facts and begin to institute programs in black studies interdisciplinary and scholarly there are asian studies indian studies urban studies mexican studies and space studies all sorts of studies black studies can be added with no vast shift in administrative machinery and indeed many are doing just that a third alternative is perhaps more useful the location of city county and state community colleges should take into account the concentration of blacks in the cities centers the appointment of imaginative presidents hustling deans and teachers with common sense to head and run community colleges in the cities centers could turn these opportunities to great benefit for black people an honest relevant curriculum would accomplish again what most of us sense as the mission of a black university the sanguine expectation that a wellfinanced completely autonomous black university can be founded and supported is a forlorn one i fear fine if it can be really good and not makeshift this is too late for another crude botchy handtomouth college to be started otherwise let substantial ongoing private black schools those who have the vision and the freedom convert their present pursuit of western civ to an understanding of man through the eyes of black people let the major public and private institutions embrace the cause of black discovery and let public community colleges in the urban core look around them and act accordingly with integrity and enthusiasm the march edition nr of negro digest on the black university celebrates a significant turning point in the history of american race relations taken together the articles in that edition constitute the most compact statement extant of the quest on the part of young black intellectuals for selfdefinition in the realm of educational theory and technique confronted with the intractable facts of history and culture an apparently growing number of black thinkers reopened with fresh intensity the old debate regarding the purpose and strategy of education for black americans disillusioned with both the conceptual depth of integration as an intellectual construct and with its slow growth as a social reality increasing attention is now being given to the internal dynamics of the black community itself whether this refocusing of vision will aid the struggle for black freedom will depend very heavily on just how faithful it is to the regimen of fact and logic in the black community for this community is not the simple phenomenon that many white and some black writers have taken it to be carter g woodson very aptly asserted in his book the miseducation of the negro that the negro community suffers for lack of delimitation because of the various ramifications of life in the united states the negro community in a sense is composed of those around you but it functions in a different way you cannot see it by merely looking out of the window of the school room this community requires scientific investigation similarly the black college is a complex datum requiring the disciplined approaches of sound theory technique and insight if the realities of its past the dynamics of its present and the promise of its future are to be accurately gauged whether we like it or not what has always beenand what will likely continue to beof critical importance are the interconnections of the black college with the world around it the white world as well as the black world a fundamental assumption of this article is that no important institution within any communitywhite or blackcan be adequately understood through a process of violent abstraction from the setting in which it moves and lives and has its being the article by j herman blake on the black university and its community gives us valuable information about some of the socioeconomic changes now occurring within the black community particularly in terms of the northward and cityward movement of black people and in terms of changes in occupational roles and income levels of black males and females some of these are rather wellknown facts that the majority of black americans now live in the central cities of metropolitan areas that despite higher levels of education the employment situation of black people has changed little from the last hired first fired status that the black female has a better chance of obtaining a job consistent with her education and training than the black male in the professional technical and managerial categories while the black males are more likely than females to be adequately represented in clerical positions that the relative situation for the black man improved between and while the absolute situation declined that the absolute and relative situation of middleincome blacks is getting better and that of lowincome blacks is getting worse these are all important and interesting data but what is their significance for educational mission and strategy the question is not answered directly but answers are sometimes implied and sometimes inherent in the conceptual description of the black university provided by the other contributors to the edition all of the writers assume the absolutely critical importance of transforming the predominantly negro college into a meaningful and relevant instrument of social change the article by darwin turner is by far the wisest and most reasoned description of the total scope of problems and possibilities to be considered whether because of distinct definitions of tasks or for some other reason his is the only article which treats the black university contextually in terms of the hard facts of financing policymaking faculty recruitment and administration as well as in terms of the currently more popular dimensions of curriculum development and public service it is interesting to note that in view of the fact that so many black students today get much of their emotional and intellectual fuel from black and third world oriented thinkers not a single word of the entire edition is addressed to the issue of roles for student involvement in the black university one of the major constituencies of any college and one of the most important bearers of an ethical vocation in history today are students precisely because of their selfconceptions as significant agents of social changea selfimage in the most serious need of careful scrutinyno concept of the prophetic social role of the black university mcworter is complete without dealing in a large way with students if a summary of the arguments can be attempted the authors seem to be saying that somewhere near the heart of the problems confronting the black community is what carter g woodson called the miseducation of the negro this miseducation consists principally in the education of black scholars to feel contempt for themselves and for the black community by failing to confront them with adequate knowledge about themselves both to counter white stereotypes and to bolster their selfconfidence the negro colleges have also failed to develop meaningful helping relationships between black scholars and the balck community accustomed to facile imitations of white middle class life styles negro colleges have failed to plumb the depths of the black experience thus stephen henderson underlines the contention that in the search for identity the black experience is not only relevant it is fundamental and crucial a strengthened sense of identity will produce not only a black university which serves the black american community it will create the indispensable precondition for new linkages with the entire third world a unique internationalism will be created in which according to vincent harding the uniqueness of our approach to the world would be found in our vision through an unashamedly black oriented prism in the academic program and in a hundred other less structured ways the black university would seek to explore celebrate and record the experience of the nonwestern world similarly gerald mcworter views as a key component of the very meaning of blackness the affirmation of an identity independent of the historical human evils of modern nation states the significant problem encountered here is not adequately stated in terms of the simply dichotemy of integration versus separatism the real question is whether this statement of mission and strategy does justice to the facts and the logic of the very black experience it claims to celebrate this writer has no quarrel with the objectives of a black university which seeks to serve the needs of the black community nor with the concern for more adequate study and dramatization of events in the black experience nor with the desire to create unquestionably intelligent and competent centers of learning for black people nonetheless as is well known agreement on specific objectives and even on particular tactical points does not necessarily mean agreement on underlying issues embedded in the strategy itself this writer wishes to focus on but one of such issues with the hope of clarifying some of the strategic questions raised the issue can be introduced by raising a question regarding in exactly what ways does the black ex perience address the problem of racism encountered by the black community in the areas of housing and employment for example what curricular expression of the black experience would relate the black university more effectively to the black community is the creation of a black consciousness in the minds and hearts of black people more important than assisting them with their daily struggle for survival are the two problems the same thing anyone familiar with the long and often bitter struggle in our colleges and universities not only to get black studies but a particular ideological brand of black studies will know that these are not trivial questions in a footnote to a widely talked about but seldom read volume frantz fanon makes an important observation about the decision of the president of senegal to include the study of the idea of negroism in the curriculum if this decision was due to an anxiety to study historical causes no one can criticize it but if on the other hand it was taken in order to create black selfconsciousness it is simply a turning of his back upon history the point fanon is making is that the people are helped not by excessive investments in the study of the peoples culture but by addressing current problems felt by the people of the four authors who discuss the curriculum of the black university three of them mcworter henderson and harding seem to give clear priority to the humanistic sciences henderson is quite explicit that such a university would almost by definition involve chiefly those disciplines which are humancentered ie the social sciences the behavioral sciences literature art and the like moreover the faculty of the university would be staffed with black humanists and specialists in blackness and although he says that the nonhumanistic sciences should have an honored place in the curriculum it is obvious where the resources of such a university would be invested i want to state the strongest possible disagreement with this bifurcation of the black experience it is the logical outcome of a narrow conception of black identity which if actually pursued would isolate the black university even further than some of these same authors say it is today from the black community if as stokely carmichael and charles hamilton persuasively argue the process of political modernization must take place in both the black and white communities in order to treat adequately the problems of racism then a black university which invests a preponderance of its resources in black humanistic studies is seriously disadvantaged in its intentions to help and that prepares them to deal effectively with that world is a basic fact to people in every black community in this land parochial programs of black studies based on uncritical concepts of black identity will not help either our students or these desperately hungry communities such narrowly conceived programs may help some professors and politicians and not a few students talk about helping oppressed people get in by any means necessary to do it right now but such violent discourse only helps the ego of the speaker for that is not political language that is the language of insurrection and it is both misleading and dishonest unless such spokesmen have both the readiness and the capacity to carry forward the action implied if the black university is truly to become the serviceoriented center of research and action that vincent harding desires if it is to use his words to set up skills banks for developing nations and urge those students who do not return to the black american communities to offer their skills to africa latin america and wherever else they are needed then it will clearly have to give the nonhumanistic sciences of mathematics statistics accounting engineering physics et al a very great deal of support such a university would not be able to afford to invest all or even the majority of its resources in humanistic programs there is no reason why such disciplines cannot be construed as within the programs of black studies it is the purpose and strategy of a uinversity which defines its being black studies can be taught for the purpose of condescending to or patronizing black people as darwin turner observed in his article by the same token nonblack courses can be taught for the purpose of helping black people both at home and abroad a functional black university will strive to engage in the kind of teaching and research and public service which provides people with the disciplines of thought and action by which they can mature as persons and help shape the world into a more human place of habitation the irremediable blackness of afroamericans would be accepted both as a fact of life and as a positive value but it would not restrict the experience of black identity to the immediacies of skinassociated cultural values the black experience is one crucible in which we work our way to a vision of and a connection with the human potential in all men a final word by way of illustration ralph ellison has complained that his awardwinning novel invisible man is often misread to imply that it was the blackness of skin of the hero which made him invisible to white americans instead says ellison the heros invisibility is not a matter of being seen but a refusal to run the risk of his own humanity which involves guilt this is not an attack upon white society it is what the hero refuses to do in each section which leads to further action he must assert and achieve his own humanity he cannot run with the pack and do this a functional black university will see the need for instruction in the disciplines of personal moral responsibility as well as in the techniques of social action asserting and achieving ones humanity means that black people are not exempted from the universal human need to develop a personal idiom as well as a group style black people too need the art of transforming and transcending even the materials and patterns of black culture we cannot run with the pack and do this whether the pack is white or black in the words of the spiritual you got to walk this lonesome valley by yourself confronted with a book like how we live contemporary life in contemporary fiction the inclination is to shrug throw it aside and proceed to something more relevant and instructive for black people the time has long since passed when black people should waste their energies challenging the racist assumptions at the base of such books there is much work to be done the task of turning the attention of black people away from the integrationist lures which are allpervasive and toward the possibilities inherent in submergence in their own history and culture is monumental it is obviously wasteful to debate the racists andworse recognizing them merely feeds their arrogance and depravity even so it is important to keep in mind the many millions of black peopleespecially studentswho are influenced by the kind of racist tripe which passes for criticism of black literary works generations of black students have gone out into the world as professionals believing that the white view of black literature is the valid view and there are far far too many black teachers who slavishly repeat the antiblack nonsense they have learned in the nations colleges and universities black students must not be abandoned to the insidious propaganda which holds in essence that black writers rarely produce works of art because of course there is an element of protest in their work only white writers have the objectivity toward race which is necessary to produce art when the subject matter is race pure crap and yet it is propagated everywhere it cannot therefore be ignored as it so richly deserves to be in how we live a big pages expensive anthology compiled by l rust hills and his wife penny chapin and published by macmillan the racist line is presented with startling candor the section dealing with black life and literature is small pages and toward the rear of the book six authors are presented and three of that six are white now here in the editors own words are the reasons why only three black writers ralph ellison james baldwin john a williams are included among some authors many of them thirdrate and unimportant by any truly objective yardstick and read and weepwhy it was necessary for the editors to select fiction by three white writers to provide an authentically literary reflection of how we blacks live unlike the jews who have equal opportunities and can change their distinguishing names and noses and adopt the elite religious and life styles and thus not only melt in but rise to the top in a few generations the negroes have a much longer and more difficult road to follow in order to lose their racial stigma and become plain ordinary americans the editors explain gloriously ignorant of the monstrousness of their presumption and condescension for these reasons and some others the editors proceed blithely there has been no negro renaissance in contemporary american fiction to compare with the jewish renaissance there are at least a halfdozen jewish writers in the absolutelv firstrank of american writ a ing today and there are dozens of others whose potentiality or achievement places them not far behind only two really first rate negro writers can be namedralph ellison and james baldwinand the ranks behind them are almost empty to mention the names of ronald fair ernest j gaines chester himes claude brown william melvin kellev paule marshall and john a williams is to stretch and virtually exhaust the list of negroes from whom we can expect literary fiction of significant interest it is not that negroes are not writing or being published but aside from ellison and baldwin they have not yet produced the kind of writing that satisfies the complex contemporary read white literary tastes and sensibilities this situation will of course change soon the editors write throwing black writers a patronizing bone but up to this time it seems that the dialects and situations of negro life have provided the negro writer with the kind of material that is translatable only into a direct recounting of or protest against the sordid or subtle facts of his oppression and finally this this all the above quotes is all perhaps by way of explaining that two of the stories in this section are by jewish writers and one is by a southern white woman there it is and you had better believe it two jews and a southern white woman are better equipped to write about race because apparently they are not hampered by the kind of material that is translatable only into a direct recounting of or protest against the sordid or subtle facts of black oppression in other words the black angle of vision is literarily invalid true literature on race comes only through the white sensibility to begin with none of the whiteauthored stories is really about black people and there is some question in the mind of this black reader whether those black people portrayed in the white stories came through as living breathing human beings but my sensibility is a black one and in the view of the editors of how we live is therefore automatically not to be taken seriously if after some years i do not know black people and how they live and am incapable of passing judgment on the authentic portrayal of black people and black life then i can learn all that i do not know by reading jewish and southern writers the premise is familiar of course in every facet of american life white people know better than black people what is best and what is the right procedure for black people in his story the nickel misery of george washington carver brown jewish ivan gold writes about a black soldier who simply is not to be believed except in the fond fantasies of white people he speaks in an ersatz amos and andy dialect saying such nonblack things as yons all confused and yall know who copperhaid is that skinny nigrah boy indicating that mr gold might have been more at home with a white anglosaxon boy from the ozarks worse mr gold makes his caricature a blackfaced jewish schlmiel a doubledumb loser with an outsized capacity for debasement which might be common among semites but which is black only in the veiled hopes of white people mr gold in short suffers from the william styronnat turner syndrome the bernard malamud story black is my favorite color is better than mr golds but mr malamud is a better writer than mr gold and an infinitely superior observer of human beings and their behavior black or white however a black lady friend who read mr malamuds story at my request was not impressed with the authors creation of the black female character in the story ornita i guess there are black women like that she said but i dont know them the white southern woman author is the late flannery oconnor of georgia a fine and sensitive writer her black character in the story everything that rises must converge is observed mrs oconnor does not enter into the womans psyche she plays it safe the storys chief character is a white woman with whom mrs oconnor isand should befamiliar a runofthemill georgia racist but here a word should be said mrs oconnor chose one kind of georgia expression of racial bigotry she might well have chosen another two women are likely to confront each other across the racial wall in much less violent terms than two men and yet confrontation between men is more usual a black writer might well have chosen the more usual confrontation and to mr and mrs hills his story would have been unacceptable as literature one thing more the hills state authoritatively that ralph ellison and james baldwin are the only two really first rate negro writers who can be named relegating to mediocrity such superb craftsmen as john a williams paule marshall william melvin kelley and ernest j gaines and totally ignoring saunders redding robert boles carlene hatcher polite and kristin hunter the hills can be excused for not knowing about alice walker lindsay patterson audrey lee louise meriwether and the whole new bundle of black writers just being published and no one expects them to recognize the genius of militants leroi jones larry neal or ed bullins but they have slapped in the face even those black writers who slavishly submit to the white literary dogma which demeans them how we live then is important for black readers and writers for the reason that it provides them with an example of what they must continue to guard against black students in and out of integrated schools must be protected from the virulent racism inherent in criticism by literary gurus like l rust and penny chapin hillshoyt w fuller it has been noted before when the occasion warranted it that no man and no nation holds power forever the greatness that was rome was and will never be again time moves on and fortune changes hands these laws are immutable one supposes however that it might be merely human that those who hold power should behave as if the laws are not inexorable in racist america inheritor and guardian of the old western tradition of rule and exploitation of nonwhite peoples some of the more alert of the oppressors recognize all too well the elusiveness of power and the fact that unparalleled wealth and technology ultimately are no insurors of lasting supremacy on the one level rearguard scientists continue to promote the theory of the genetic superiority of white men on the other level militarists urge elaborate defenses and even preventive warfare against the great nonwhite nation of asia now flexing its muscle with a modicum of the precious technology necessary to challenge the hegemony of the west in chicago a rich newspaper known for its lack of friendliness to the cause of black people everywhere publishes a fullpage color map which sets out to overturn the centuriesold knowledge that most of the worlds peoples are not white by simply claiming as white most of the peoples between china and the sahara the games are desperate and they will grow even more desperate as china grows stronger as black africa begins to shake off the yoke of economic colonialism as the arabs find their unity as the black brazilians recognize their heritage and plot their destiny these peoples to the americans are the niggers of this world and history records what americans do to niggers the indians the japanese the haitians the panamanians the mexicans the vietnamese when he niggers will not to be white there are sane voices out there challenging and warning one of the best of the wests own philosophers arnold j toynbee of england periodically speaks out against the disastrous route the leading nation of the west seems intent upon taking every opposition met by american power can be dismissed as communist and there is outraged denial that america has colonial intentions the vietnamese war for them the americans its a war saving the world against communism and has nothing to do with race mr toynbee explained in a recent interview published in the new york times but americans feel about the vietnameseand the arabs toothey are natives not human beings a native is a human being who is treated as not being a human being dr toynbee keeps trying to put race in perspective what i am trying to do is explain to western people that they are only a small minority of the world the great world is asia and africaoutside the west he says in a time of madness sanity is an obscenity it is easy to imagine the powermad militarists damning dr toynbee to oblivion as a traitor some of the more romantic of the disaffected black americans looking out upon the world with somewhat more wishful thinking than sharpness of perception char acterize the whole third world as in effect a conglomeration of niggers it is not that truth does not lie essentially at the center of such an argument it is merely that adherence to its truthfulness with an overinvestment of faith is extremely dangerous without a dutiful consideration for the subtleties and shadings of power pride and politics money talks persuasively in the councils of nations just as it does in city councils and america is where the money is still events are bearing out the dictum of that great black philosopher and prophet w e b du bois that this is the century of the color line the nonwhite peoples of the world already have demonstrated a need for solidarityat bandung in algeria in cairo in angolaand the growing disparity between the rich and the poor the exploiters and the exploited the west and the remainder of the world can only deepen that need for solidarity as for the black world in particular unity is much more in than a mere hope the murder of patrice lumumba at the behest of the imperialists in the congo triggers a reaction in manhattan and the slaughter of black people in the streets of detroit sends throngs into the streets of daressalaam more important the spirit of panamericanism which du bois nurtured and which kwame nkrumah sought to make a reality burns brightly in the breasts to the shores of senegal there is of thousands of young black men much more than hope there is defrom san francisco to sao paulo termination on the occasion commemorating the twenu tyseventh anniversary of the abolition of slavery frederick douglass unleashed his unparalleled eloquence over the issue of race pride among black people he uncompromisingly denounced any and every attempt directed towards promoting race pride contending that a people cannot be proud of its race or color since it has neither the choice nor the power to be what it is he strongly preached doing away with this supercilious nonsense for him only achievement should give reason for pride if black people were to be proud let it be because we have had some agency in producing that of which we can properly be proud indeed he was proud of his own achievement not because i am a colored man but because i am a man and because color is a misfortune and is treated as a crime by the american people frederick douglass of course remains one of the great heroes in black history and rightly so yet it seems to me that in criticizing the advocates of race pride among black people in incidentally almost exactly the same terms as the critics of todays wave of race pride douglass overlooked certain fundamentals needed for a people to achieve certain goals in life in so doing he authored an oversight which in fact made him selfcontradictory ie he denounced race pride while upholding achievement pride is pride of a people not directly related to the level of achievement of that people what douglass and his fellow critics then and now seem to have forgotten is the essence of the black mans fight namely to repudiate not only the lies that the whites have said about him but also to recreate old truths these lies include that black man was is not civilized that the black man was is a savage that the black man was is lazy etc etcd all these lies of course directed their authors to the killing conclusion that the black man is inferior more than advancing these lies the whites believed them and unbelievable and sad as it is the black man believed these lies about himself having been thus convinced the black mans ambition for achievement became squelched for how can inferiors be positive activists and achievers of great wonderssocial political economic technological and otherwise inferiors generally spend a large share of their time being ashamed of their life and their origin one of the most debasing facts about slavery is the fact that it sought with all the vigor at its command to strip the black man of his pride and confidence as a person and as a people this was of course a conscious design of slavery as an institution the fact is unless a man is decisively stripped of these fundamental human qualities that is selfconfidence and pride attempts to make him a slave become fruitless he will continue to assert himself as a man and will not voluntarily submit to any degradation slave masters were well schooled in these facts and took all necessary measures to make the slave look negatively on his past and thus lose all selfpride and confidence the ultimate result was that the slave ended up loving his oppressor rather than hating him alexis de tocqueville in his perceptive study democracy in america observed that the negro in america preoccupies himself with making a thousand fruitless efforts to insinuate himself among men who repulse him he conforms to the taste of his oppressors adopts their opinions and hopes by imitating them to form a part of their community having been told from infancy that his race is naturally inferior to that of the whites he assents to the proposition and is ashamed of his own nature in each of his features he discovers a trace of slavery and if it were in his power he would rid himself of everything that makes him what he is such is the result of what i call the negrofication process as created by institutional slavery it ought to be clear to even the most elementary sociopsychologist that a man whose whole life is manifested through imitational behavior devotes a large share of his time not in the exercise of creative initiative but in observing the behavior of those he emulates this is a fundamental difference that must be recognized between whites and negroes the first order of business was is therefore to set the record straight top items on the black mans agenda must not only include the need to repudiate the white mans lies about himlies whose roots have grown so deep with years that they now sound like truthsbut also the need to inculcate in the black man a viable sense of selfrespect unless and until this selfrespect selfpride is in his whole soul no man can expect to realize achievement of any great magnitude authentic behavior must replace imitational behavior as a prerequisite to any real political achievement among and by the blacks race pride must underlie black political thought for the most part all it takes is taking what has been said of him and turning it around rather than speaking disparagingly of his land of origin he must seek to create a positive picture of africa acknowledge its greatness past and present and welcome any connection with it he must learn to support his african brethren in his hour of need such as in rhodesia south africa angola and mozambique if this avenue of mutual support were earnestly pursued blacks could create one of the most viable international political machineries ever known it would take only a matter of days for rhodesia to tumble and from its ashes a zimbabwe to be reborn south africa would begin to accept not only a black mans heart in order to save the life of a white racist but also would begin to transplant the whole black mans life in that country into its politicaleconomic mainstream but such functional political activity cannot come to pass until the black man starts taking a positive view of his whole life and creates a sense of pride for what he is the black man must look beyond the economic advantages that have been afforded him by chance or design mostly by chance for as edward w blyden a great black political activist of the th century observed such economic advantages have accrued at the expense of his manhood he continued we have been dragged into depths of degradation we have been taught a cringing servility we have been drilled into contentment with the most undignified circumstances our finer sensibilities have been blunted there has been almost utter extinction of all that delicacy of feeling and sentiment which adorns character a number of questions must be asked of those of us who are committed to the creation of race pride what is the nature of commitment how is it to be realized is the current wave of nationalism sweeping across ghettoville usa or across the world for that matter just one more peak in the black mans history or is it here to stay this last question is being asked in view of the fact that black his tory is replete with occasions and figures closely resembling those of todays movement stokely carmichael during the meredith trial in started chanting we want black_power that chant left nobody black or white indeed no institution untouched edward blyden at the close of the th century demanded some african power of course both carmichael and blyden meant the same thing namely the type of black or african power where our physical pecuniary and intellectual strength may be collected like brother imari biyden was demanding some spot whence such an influence may go forth in behalf of the race as shall be felt by the nations we are now so scattered and divided that we can do nothing in order to bring the scattered and divided black people together both blyden and carmichael recognized the need to create race pride among them for no people ashamed of themselves like to voluntarily get together they realized as did others that no viable political social and economic institutions could be established until the people come together and people would not come together unless there was some race pride the widespread apathy that benights the black belt of america should be attributed not so much to the lack of political education as to the negative selfimage that is prevalent in these communities one of the reasons why the black man has experienced political frustration is that he has operated not from a positive but rather from a negative selfimage base for the most part his whole participation in the political life has been executed via paternalistic guidance bv whites to be sure the black man has made some substantive demands on the political system but the type of compromise or concession that followed such demands were carefully designed into control gimmicks this only engineered more frustration this is a liability to the nation itself what is needed therefore is a call to attitudinal revolutionand that is what it isrevolution without this revolution this race pride the black manwherever he may bewill continue to be prey to the sociopolitical and economic systems of the day while institutional slavery may have disappeared its mark lingers on it is our duty in the words of alexander crummell to cast off its graveclothes and resist its deadly influences this will not only reverse the rule of the black mans political life that is taxation without representation but will create an undying love for our people and as dr w e b du bois noted will substantially reduce the degree of lawlessness and crime among our people by our people if as a nation we must seek ye first the political kingdom as per kwame nkrumahs dictum we must as a people seek a revolution in our attitudes towards each other i would like first to make some assertions g about what negritude s is not this prelimi nary dogmatism is required by the recklessness and abandon with which the word now falls from lipsboth thick and thin negritude is not simply anything black and it is certainly not everything black negritude is not wearing turbans and fezzes though these may be quite alluring it is not tearing up ads for palmers skin whitener it is not abandoning madame walker in africa where negritude is surely present white paint has been used for ritual and cosmetic purposes since the time when the sahara was a land of lush vegetation in africa today from dakar to kinshasa barefoot ladies do not scorn the adornment of wigs imported from paris negritude is not posturing or agitation but reflection not a code but a principle not therapy for the bemused but a modality for the thinking man the word itself which does not come trippingly from the anglosaxonized tongue is a gallic creation it was first employed by aime cesaire the martinican poet in in the poem cahier dun retour au pays natal which we shall translate as notebook of a return visit to my native land here is the passage in french and then in my translation he is describing the geographical position of his native land with guadeloupe above it as well as haiti ou la negritude se mit debout pour la premiere fois et dit quelle croyait a son humanite haiti where negritude rises to its feet for the first time and says that it has believed in its own humanity to deal with this striking neologism of we have to go back in time and extend our gaze from harlem to the left bank of the seine in paris paris is a city of manifestos literary historians recall the romantic and symbolist documents political historians think of those of the revolution and the commune in almost unnoticed there appeared a review entitled legitime defense legitimate defense edited by martinican students it too was a manifesto and in the unfolding of time the movement which it articulated was to become the concern both of literary and political history specifically legitime defense demanded a new west indian poetry which would no longer reflect the french tradition years antecedent but which would respond to the present need of west indian man this significant paragraph occurs in that manifestoi translate the wind which rises from black america will we hope quickly clean our west indies of the abortive fruit of a decayed culture langston hughes and claude mckay the two revolutionary black poets have brought us steeped in red wine the african love of life the african joy in love the african dream of death and already young haitian poets deliver to us lines swollen with a future dynamism we quickly perceive that legitime defense drew nutriment from the harlem renaissance and from the indigenist movement in haiti and i must next speak of these if any single name other than that of langston hughes should evoke for us the mind and spirit of the harlem renaissance it is that of alain leroy locke he was in the words of langston hughes the granddaddy of the movement in dr locke edited the classic anthology the new negro which should be required readings for todays neoafricanophiles here in rich profusion was revealed an intensity of thought and feeling which came as a revelation to america and indeed to the western world in the twenties dr locke looked with considerable insight to the african origins of americas black population and defined a cultural strategy which i have called ancestralism locke had long been a friend of w e b du bois and shared completely with the older man a concern with panafricanism they were repeatedly cultural collaborators i had the privilege of knowing dr locke during the last years of his life and can attest to the fervor with which he tended the flame of afroamerican cultural expression this is an appropriate moment in history to ask ourselves what the significance of the harlem renaissance was to study and appraise it brings forcibly to our mind the fact that much now being hailed as new in the analysis of the afroamerican experience has been known and expressed already this is not to deny credit and commendation to recent spokesmen who have expanded their energies on the killing ground but i feel strongly that young black americans would profit mightily from pondering the maxim those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it the message of the harlem renaissance was wafted across the caribbean to haiti the story has been told with scholarly elegance by professor naomi garrett and i will but sketch the background in the united states occupied the republicthe uniquely black republicof haiti this was part of a pattern of american imperialism which in the name of fiscal responsibility and civic order included the occupation of nicaragua and the dominican republic as well as frequent flexing of muscles in other middle american states it is appropriate to mention in explanation rather than in defense that north american ideas of fiscal responsibility and civic order were honored in the breach rather than in the observance by the motley crew of multicolored middle american governments for the haitian bourgeosie the american occupation was a traumatic experience until these latter years a fundamental praxis of american imperialism was that when darker peoples were to be dealt with it was prudent to send southerners to do the dealing in the light of their long experience in such matters there was an enlightened public opinion in the us which deplored and condemned the fact and the fashion of the american occupation in haiti almost from the beginning yet as late as years after the occupation began american authorities could still be so crass and stupid as to decree that the students in the lycees of haiti abandon their classical studies and study agriculture down with bossuet up with burbank luther to be sure i have often speculated on this strange timing did it take that long for the occupying administration to learn what the haitians were doing in those lycees or was it only possible for them to turn to the problems of secondary education then because it had required more than a decade to restore fiscal responsibility and civic order the generation of haitian intellectuals and writers who came to maturity in this period of their nations history entertained certain misgivings about the civilization western civilizationwhich gave birth to the louts who possessing no apparent culturein the older sense of that wordcould nevertheless entertain no serious doubt of their own superiority to the haitians the reaction was to produce in the latter half of the s and the early s a number of poets and writers who sought a special significance in their african heritage not directly connected with this school of poets but honored by them working apart and continuing a quest he had begun in the s was that remarkable haitian man of letters jean pricemars at last report he was still working a fact that those of us who saw him as ambassador to paris in his eighties can find readily believable he is the creator of haitianism the haitian school of ethnology and with du bois and locke one of the three tutelary geniuses of negritude legitime defense which has led us to harlem and to haiti had a single issue that was sufficient to sustain a climate of opinion two years later in a journal fated to have a longer life appeared letudiant noir the black student here in one endeavor were grouped students from africa as well as the west indies three personalities of the first rank still active still controversial emerge from the team of letudiant noir the veritable fathers of negritude leopold sedar senghor then a student from the french colony of senegal now president of independent senegal and a major french poet aime cesaire then a student from martinique now mayor of fortdefrance deputy to the french assembly poet and playwright in the grand tradition leon damas then a student from french guyana which he later represented in the assembly now a unesco expert and cultural historian here at the origin of negritude we are faced with the essential paradox of the concept and the source of its difficulty particularly for the anglosaxon mind for we have three french intellectuals descendents of descartes and vol taire and children of the concept of liberty fraternity and equality the revolutionary heritagewho through their own experience and even more through the contemplation of the plight of their fellow and lessfavored colonial brethren could find profound disparities in what they knew and in what they felt in their gallicism if i may risk a coarse metaphor i would say that negritude springs at least circumstantially from a view of the backside of french civilization i might raise the tone if i adapt the fashionable jargon of the day and say that the elaboration of the idea of negritude was motivated by black consciousnessspecifically that of senghor dumas and cesaire in france some uptodate people might call it a syndrome rather than an idea but let us abandon the jargon which facilitates and obscures and return to our young men in their dingy paris lodgings they were intellectuals they were colonials they were black they were however from different sides of the ocean please take note of my ethnocentrism when i say oceani mean the atlantic the cultural contrasts of their origins were striking senghor had been born in a senegalese village and spoke only serer until he went to school cesaire had been born in the slums of fortdefrance a tropical provincial french town in many ways and his first tongue was almost certainly a city dialect of creole a language the linguists are still trying to classify damas was a bourgeois from an overseas provincial town but were the cultural contrasts of their infancy and early childhood as profound as they seemed to the casual observeror even to the trained sociologist they came to doubt this and out of this doubt intellectual doubt i hasten to addcame the formulation of negritude for our young men were aware of a kind of fellow feeling a kinship that lay beneath and beyond their immediate origins and certainly a great distance from that which they shared as french university students a kinship which could only be accounted for by some other agency or force there were three possible explanations it arose from temperament from race or from culture but if so from a kind of level of culture not hitherto recognized a literary critic with a psychoanalytic bent would probably not find too great a consonance of temperament in these three men and it was certainly not that race then surely it is the classic european position that race counts and tells in the nineteenth century matthew arnold the highest type of wellbred english intelligence could expatiate loudly and long on the celtic race and show the ineradicable difference between it and the germanic english race while arnold never said the celts were inferior that is what his english readers understood and i think that is probably what his celtic readers understood alsoand did not agree with however in the early thirties despite the great triumph that political racism was enjoying in germany the scientific community was entering a casenotproven plea our young men were then left with the culturehypothesis and negritude i emphasize is a doctrine of cultural and not of racial unity of course there is another possibility which would occur to cynics and skepticsnamely that the fellowfeeling the kinship which they felt impelled to explain did not in reality exist but might have been a product of their imaginings quickened by too little good french food and too much bad vin ordinaire in the fashion of all lordly expositors of difficult subjects i shall dismiss this thesis as trivial the notion of there being a sufficiently broad base of african culture to speak of it as a unifying or at any rate identifyingfactor found in black populations in africa in the west indies and in the american continents we sometimes forget there are two is staggering to most people but it staggers them in different directions absurd say some perfectly obvious say others i would like to suggest however that the whole pattern of recent research concerning what is assimilated during the first years of life will shortly lead us to distinguish between deep culture and broad culture and see that negritudeas defined by its founders is a phenomenon of deep culture frances war ordeal saw the end of letudiant noir negritude like so many other aspects of french life went into the resistance it was nurtured during this period by the climate of existentialist thought jeanpaul sartre was to bring to the theoreticians of negritude a formidable support in his analysis and rebuttal of french bourgeois intellectualism following the war grouped around alioune diop of senegal there appeared the group who brought out in december of the journal presence africaine it appeared simultaneously in paris and dakar it carried the best wishes and congratulations of leading french intellectuals such as andre gide sartre michel leiris and georges balandier the names of senghor cesaire and richard wright also appear in the first issue presence africaine rapidly assumed a unique place in the intellectual and cultural spectrum of france and the world it developed a publishing house whose total inventory is now numbered in the hundreds its first volume was bantu philosophy by the belgian priest r p tempels later defrocked for his views the journal established the society of african culture which in turn organized under the presidency of pricemars two congresses of black writers and artists one in in paris and a second in rome in it was this same society of african culture which in organized the first world festival of negro arts held at dakar under the patronage of senghor i had the pleasure of attending that event and will say a few words about it the festival brought to dakar during the month of april sages and scholars artists and dilletantes journalists and jobhunters and some folks who just plain came some came for the party and some for the pilgrimage some were looking for laughs and some for the vision splendid but there they were splendid and resplendent in the hues of the sun and of the rainbow and it was a joy to see some were disappointed some dismayed many were exhilarated and not a few strangely gratified by the satisfaction of a certain undefinable ineffable sense of participation in a historic moment for despite all the downgrading all the clamor all the claims and counterclaims something did take place in dakar in dakar there was for the first time anywhere an encounter in the realm of art in the realm of the spirit such as has not taken place before whether one calls it negritude brotherhood or ballyhoo the fact is that black and quasiblack people from all over the worldand naturally enough white folks toogathered together to observe and reflect on the spiritual and artistic achievements of black peoples from all over the world freed of the cumbersome sociopoliticoeconomic contexts in which these are habitually viewed and the result was the affirmation of a cultural heritage long despised long deprecated long deplored what are the implications of the concept of negritudeof a uniquely black african cultural heritage for scholarship i will give you an anecdote in response to this query when i mentioned to one of the leading american authorities on african art that i was coediting with a colleague an anthology of essays and studies on negritude she expressed to me the reservations that she and her close collaborator the leading british specialist on african art had as to the usefulness of this concept quite recently when she was visiting me after having read the anthology through from cover to cover she expressed the view that it was a very useful thing to have done in a discussion concerning african art which ensued she was talking about the great variety of idiom to be found in african art then she said if however one takes any number of african pieces and mixes them with other apparently similar examples of tribal art from other parts of the world you can immediately separate the african pieces theirs is a world apart they are distinguished by their theirshe searched for a word caught my eye capitulated by their negritude this expert has been a student of african art for over years and had never needed the word until that moment or to be exact had needed it but had not used it until then when its significance came to to her suddenly like a spiritual illumination much of the nonsense that generations of western scholars have written about black people might have been avoided had the concept of negritude been articulated and understood earlier on the other hand much nonsense is still being engendered and subsidized in ignorance of the concept and not only by whites dangers lie in the other directionchiefly as a result of the industry and energy of the ignorant it has been truly said that nothing is more terrifying than ignorance in action no useful purpose is served by perverting a useful concept of culture into a mystique a counterracism this course has in fact been consciously and conscientiously urged by some but its usefulness i question its morality i execrate the dialectical view which holds that negritude is a necessary antithesis to white supremacy superiority and dominationto blanchitude if you willis worthy of support for the phenomenon viewed thus from a hegelian point of view leads toward the higher synthesis of universalism an urgent goal if we are all to avoid being atomicized but dialects and mysticism apart on the simple and scientifically definable terrain of culture we can state that negritude the notion of a consistent and historically valid nexus of black african values is of irreplaceable value in the continuing task of understanding societies in which persons of african descent are to be found the moslem middle v f i a f east is strategically laid out to form a natgl ural link between africa asja and europe the area forms a bridge between two oceanic areasthe atlantic and its tributaries and the indian ocean and its persian gulf and red sea offshoots the area is generally but not universally understood to include lebanon syria jordan iraq iran saudi arabia the yemen kuwait turkey and more recently the greater part of north africa in comparison to the history of western europe the history of the middle east goes back over years one of the most conspicuous facts about the area is that each of the countries consists of an astounding mosaic of people the mosaic consists of multitudinous details an old bearded man in a white turban will pierce the cold hours before sunrise with the cry prayer is better than sleep a jet streaks overhead as veiled women wash clothes in a nearby stream located near a wide boulevard crowded with the latest model european cars in the bazaar there is the hum of voices transacting the business of the day in government offices bright young men conduct national and international affairs over steaming cups of tea in baghdad one will find black arabs in responsible positions at every turn there are also in this vast geographical area assyrians kurds turks persians bedouins and an assortment of other people whose blood has been mixed with the black african to describe the people and civilization of the middle east is as formidable a task as it is to describe all of the various people and their cultures on the continent of africa however the people including the black persians as well as the blond turks share one common element in life they are all members of the moslem brotherhood the black followers of islam in the middle east are certainly in the minority but they share a dignity and knowledge of self difficult for most westerners to understand indeed many westerners think it is only the reedy quartertone of the music of the area that serves as the unifying thread between the tall black egyptian and the short smallboned syrian the mystique is much deeper than this black people came to the middle east by three routes i from the sudan and surrounding areas to north africa over the sahara desert down the nile and across the indian ocean andor red sea by ship the early followers of muhammad who were traders caravanmen and sailors penetrated the vast area below the sahara the traders were seeking new and expanded trade opportunities the great armies of islam were in search of new converts and extended their conversion to africa but also they carried islam to southwestern europe and as far east as borneo those unwilling to accept islam were enslaved and treated as infidels as one would guess the slaves captured by the armies of islam included all hues black men from africa mongoloids from central asia and white men from southern europe it is unfortunate to have to use the term slave because servitude in islam carried no social inferiority there was no distinction made between sons of women who happened to have been slaves as we will see later and a father who was free and of the aristocracy whereas the majority of black people found in the middle east were brought or came under the influence of islam there is some evidence that there were blacks in persia before the iranians came at least two authorities have indicated that in the persian province of khuzistan which is located on the persian gulf the aborigines were blacks according to two frenchmen dieulafoy and de morgan the people of the susian plain were negroes of distinction herodotus even observed that these men were in no way different in appearance from the other ethiopians then there is the other historical evidence that appears on most ancient basreliefs figures of negroes are seen frequently one traveler brigadier general percy sykes reported in his writings that the whole population of bashakird and sarhad were a puzzle and that possibly the whole area extending from the northern shores of the persian gulf to india was made up of black people at one time ttie greeks in their mythology no doubt recognized the fact that blacks occupied this part of persia they describe darkskinned memnon who came to the aid of troy as the offspring of aurora a white mountain woman and of tithonus the ethiopian god memnon the ethiopian prince as the legend goes leads in battle an army of susians of the persian lowlands and ethiopians today in this same area of persia the visitor will find black people in just about every town and hamlet in the mother of the year in khuzistan province was a negro it is generally known that many of irans outstanding families from the persian gulf region can trace their negro ancestry in tehran today some of the descendants of negroes hold minor positions in government offices and some have their own small businesses in kuwait the negro has historically been a part of the development of that oil wealthy country there are cases where sudanese have become kuwaiti nationals and have moved into high government posts the minister of fisheries be ing a good example of acceptance of a black but a moslem who happened to be black the harathins can still be found in the oases of the sahara in the fetid tihama which is the coastal plain of yemen and in the sweltering valley of hadramut in the hadramut one finds a mixture of african arab and mongoloid many of the handramuti traders have brought javanese and malayan wives back from the east indies to add further to the mixture of races in this part of the middle east the arrival of the moslem missionaries in africa did not receive a ready audience for many years there were unsuccessful attempts to convert africans below the sahara eventually africans realized that accepting islam provided a social and political communion as well as protection and assistance from the atlantic to the china wall it is significant to note that the reason these missionaries probably were so readily accepted was because missionaries of islam accepted their black converts as equals and as part of the moslem brotherhood from the very first utterance of acceptance of allah as their god no doubt this rapid conversion when it began was advanced by the absence of any feeling of repulsion towards black men as often is the case in white christianity although the koran forbade the enslavement of a moslem it did not guarantee him freedom if he embraced islam after enslavement however the liberation of slaves was considered a meritorious act in the sight of god there are many cases where slaves rose to very high positions of trust after embracing islam this explains why slaves were often taken because they were capable of education and responsibility if it were felt that a person was not capable of being a moslem he was killed or condemned to a life of servitude blacks who were formerly prisoners of war captured in raids on villages or were bought on the open slave market later went on to make significant contributions in war science art and literature indeed the contributions of black men in the middle east is a brilliant chapter in an exciting history there were blacks who came to the middle east as hired guards for the caravans that plied the trade routes from china to persia to timbuctu the blacks were fierce fighters and protected the caravans carrying goods from maurauding nomadic tribal raiders wealthy sultans in all of islam were eager to have black men in their private armies many of these soldiers were from the sudan and abyssinia in the conquering armies of the turks many of the leading officers were blacks some of whom were generals the turks rewarded these leaders by making them governors of provinces of the territories captured the bukharis or black cavalry units served as the core of an army these troops were usually quartered outside the palace and were popular among the local women by mixing with white women the bukharis gradually became lighter in skin color nevertheless they always took great pride in their african ancestry and liked to boast about the amount of african blood in their veins the use of these gallant soldiers decreased when european drill masters and officers were hired in the armies during the middle of the nineteenth century militarily another group of highly prized black men were the iron workers that is the blacksmiths gunsmiths and sword makers who traveled with the military forces to the military the smith was a vital member of the company it was known that without wellshod horses and the very best of fighting equipment battles could be lost quite often a family of these highly skilled smiths was attached to royal families and remained with them for generations in harems from marrakesh to istanbul blacks played important roles true many of them were eunuchs as was the custom they nevertheless were influential and highly respected besides being used to guard the chastity of the sultans wives and concubines the black eunuch often served as chief of protocol in the guest house the visitor did well to keep in the good graces with this very important member of the sultans personal staff the extent of the blacks knowledge of political intrigue within the sultans court was highly respected and often the strength of a ruler rested in the competence of his black adviser the sultans son usually received his advice from a black companion who was referred to as brother on matters of love feuds and intrigues the highest positions were reserved for the black member of the sultans court as an example traditionally for many years the holy city medina was governed by one of the leading blacks from a sultans court there are many examples in turkey persia and iraq where influential blacks married into families of lesser nobility than that of sultan and were absorbed after several generations there were cases where a loyal servant was rewarded with the most attractive woman from a harem if he could afford an additional wife he married her to turn the other side of the coin black women were much sought after in the harems and by the ordinary arab it was usually the woman from abyssinia who was more esteemed than any others her child was often the favorite among the other children of the father because of the childs ethiopian blood ali one of the sons of sultan hason of shiraz in persia was the son of an ethiopian mother when his father died he had disputes with his brothers finally left home and ended up in zanzibar where he established a colony sir thomas gibb points out that many of the abbasid caliphs of baghdad were born of black women ibrahim brother of harun alrahid was the son of a black woman ibrahim captured baghdad and named himself caliph he retained this position until forced out of it by almamun the royal princes of the wadai in the sudan who began their reign around claim to be descendants of the abbasids beginning with the fifteenth century and onwards some of the ottoman sultans were offsprings of black women who were part of harems in fact many of the dynasties of monarchs who had black mothers or grandmothers were in power for several hundred years however there was never any stigma attached to this fact of parentage many of the intellectuals or men of the pen were blacks they were active as professors at mosque colleges administered and expounded islamic law from the very earliest times moslem jurists were forced to pay attention to the variety of problems found among different racial groups there was within the legal system a class of lawyers known as the muftis and many of these scholars were from black africa coming from as far east as the sudan and as far west as kano and mauritania they served in government offices under the mamluk sultans of egypt and were officially appointed to sit in the judicial college called dar eladl each of the chief cities of the empire had its own muftis who had been trained at special colleges too many westerners are mistaken to think that the college mosque of elazhar at cairo is the only institution of the kind undoubtedly it was the most important seat of higher education in the middle east but there were some smaller mosque colleges in different parts of egypt similar but smaller college mosques were to be found throughout the middle east and moslem africa there was communication between these institutions as well as exchange of professors at elazhar there were or professors excluding junior teachers and officials among the professors at this outstanding university were black mathematicians and poets the students came from egypt and africa particularly sudan somalia and the region of the niger these black men of the pen are responsible too for projecting an image of strength and pride in achievement the record of the black man in the middle east is still buried and needs to be unearthed his history in the middle east is perhaps the least known and least studied by black scholars and students the libraries and archives from alexandria and khartoum to tehran are waiting for black scholars to begin writing about this glorious history we must remember that the black world does not end in africa but extends into the middle east we must remember that when a moslem in kuwait says all qawmiyya t he is really saying i know about soul too the man best known j r i as malcolm_x lived ii g three distinct and in terrelated lives under the respective names malcolm little malcolm_x and elhajj malik elshabazz any honest attempt to understand the total man must begin with some understanding of the significant components that went into his making the racist society that produced and killed malcolm_x is responsible for what he was and for destroying what he could have been he had the greatest leadership potential of any person to emerge directly from the black proletariat in this century in another time under different circumstances he might have been a kingand a good one he might have made a nation and he might have destroyed one he was a creation of the interplay of powerful and conflicting forces in midcentury america no other country or combination of forces could have shaped him the way he was and ultimately destroyed him with such unique ruthlessness malcolm_x knew before he could explain it to himself and others that he was living in a society that was engaged in systematic destruction of his peoples selfrespect his first memories are of conflict in this respect his early life was no different than most black americans where conflict comes early and stays late in his own words when my mother was pregnant with me she told me later a party of hooded ku klux klan riders galloped up to our home in omaha nebraska one night surrounding the house brandishing their shotguns and rifles they shouted for my father to come out my mother went to the front door and opened it standing where they could see her pregnant condition she told them that she was alone with her three small children and that my father was away preaching in milwaukee the klansmen shouted threats and warnings at her that we had better get out of town because the good christian white people were not going to stand for my fathers spreading trouble among the good negroes of omaha with the back to africa preachings of marcus garvey this was how he remembered his father an ambitious dreamer attempting to maintain himself and his family while bigoted white policemen ku klux klansmen and black legionnaires were determined to teach him to stay in his place the father of malcolm_x was killed while fighting against the restricted place that was assigned to his people in this country much later and in many different ways malcolm_x continued the same fight and was subsequently killed for the same reason every major event in malcolms life brought him into conflict with the society that still thrives on the oppression of his people his mother was born as a result of her mother being raped by a white man in the west indies when he was four the house where he and his family lived was burned down by members of the ku klux klan when he was six his father met a violent death that his family always believed was a lynching after the death of his father who was a follower of the black nationalist marcus garvey his family was broken up and for a number of years he lived in state institutions and boarding homes when he finally went to school he made good marks but lost interest and was a dropout at the age of he went to live with his sister in boston and went to work at the kinds of jobs available to negro youthmainly the jobs not wanted by white people like shoeshine boy soda jerk hotel busboy member of a dining car crew on trains traveling to new york and a waiter in a harlem night dub from these jobs he found his way into the underworld and thought at the time that his position in life was advancing in the jungle of the underworld where the fiercest survive by fleecing the weak and the defenseless he became a master manipulator skilled in gambling the selling of drugs burglary and hustling a friend who had helped him get his first job gave him the rationale for his actions the main thing you have to remember he was told is that everything in the world is a hustle malcolm returned to boston where he was later arrested for burglary and sentenced to years in prison the year was and he was not quite years old prison was another school for malcolm he now had time to think and plan out of this thinking he underwent a conversion that literally transformed his whole life by letters and visits from his family he was introduced to the black muslim movement which calls itself officially the lostfound nation of islam he tested himself in the discipline of his newly chosen religion by refusing to eat pork the event startled his fellow inmates who had nicknamed him satan he describes the occasion in this manner it was the funniest thingthe reaction and the way that it spread in prison where so little breaks the monotonous routine the smallest thing causes a commotion of talk it was being mentioned all over the cell block by night that satan didnt eat pork it made me very proud in some odd way one of the universal images of the negroin prison and outwas that he couldnt do without pork it made me feel good to see that my not eating it had especially startled the white convicts later i would learn when i had read and studied islam a good deal that unconsciously my first preislamic submission had been manifested i had experienced for the first time the muslim teaching if you take one step toward allahallah with take two steps toward you my brothers and sisters in detroit and chicago had all become converted to what they were being taught was the natural religion for the black man his description of his process of selfeducation in prison is an indictment of the american educational system and a tribute to his own perseverance in obtaining an education after being poorly prepared in the public schools while in prison he devised his own method of selfeducation and learned how to speak and debate effectively so that he could participate and defend the movement after his release from prison he started by copying words from the dictionary that might be helpful to him beginning with a he went through to z and then he writes for the first time i could pick up a book and actually understand what the book was saying this aspect of his story calls attention to the tremendous reservoirs of talent and even genius locked up in the black ghettos among the masses it also indicates what can be accomplished when the talent of this oppressed group is respected and given hope and a purpose within a few years he was to become a debater with a national reputation he took on politicians college professors journalists and anyone black or white who had the nerve to meet him he was respected by some and feared by others malcolm was released from prison in when he was years old for a few weeks he took a job with his oldest brother wilfred as a furniture salesman in detroit he went to chicago before the end of that year to hear and meet the leader of the nation of islam elijah muhammad he was accepted into the movement and given the name malcolm_x he went back to detroit and was made assistant minister of the detroit mosque from this point on his rise in the movement and in the eyes of the public was rapid at the end of he went to chicago to live with the leader of the nation of islam and to be trained by him personally after organizing a mosque in philadelphia he was sent to head the movement in harlem in before he was years old in a few years he was able to transform the black muslim move ment into a national organization and himself into one of the countrys best known personalities as the public spokesman and defender of the movement he literally put it on the map this was the beginning of his trouble with his leader elijah muhammad when the public thought of the black muslim movement they thought first of malcolm_x malcolm_x had appeal far beyond the movement he was one of the most frequent speakers on the nations campuses and the object of admiration by thousands of militant youth in his pamphlet malcolm_x the man and his ideas george breitman gives the following description of malcolms appeal as a speaker his speaking style was unique plain direct like an arrow devoid of flowery trimming he used metaphors and figures of speech that were lean and simple rooted in the ordinary daily experience of his audiences he knew what the masses thought and how they felt their strengths and their weaknesses he reached right into their minds and hearts without wasting a word and he never tried to flatter them despite an extraordinary ability to move and arouse his listeners his main appeal was to reason not emotion i want only to convey the idea that rarely has there been a man in america better able to communicate ideas to the most oppressed people and that was not just a matter of technique which can be learned and applied in any situation by almost anybody but that it was a rare case of a man in closest communion with the oppressed able to speak to them because he identified himself with them an authentic expression of their yearning for freedom a true product of their growth in the same way that lenin was a product of the russian people from when he was made responsible for the black muslim movement in harlem the history of that movement is essentially the history of the rise of malcolm_x in public speeches where he nearly always prefaced his remarks with the statement the honorable elijah muhammad teaches us malcolm_x was teaching lessons about the black americans fight for basic dignity that was more meaningfully logical than anything that elijah muhammad had ever conceived he was the public figure most identified with the movement and most sought after as its spokesman louis e lomax referred to him as the st paul of the black muslim movement and adds not onlv was he knocked to the ground by the bright light of truth while on an evil iourney but he also rose from the dust stunned with a new name and a burning zeal to travel in the opposite direction and carry americas million negroes with him in these years malcolm_x was preaching separation and frightening more white people than the social protest organizations that were demanding integration the bold act of refusing integration was a challenge to a society that never intended to integrate the black americans in the first place with this act malcolm_x put american society on the defensive by questioning its intentions toward his people and proving that those intentions were false also he made black america question itself and face reality he identified the enemy of their promise indicted that enemy and still did not relieve the victim his own people of the responsibility for being the instrument of their own liberation to place malcolm_x and his roughhewed grandeur in proper perspective one must first understand the nature of the society that produced him and ultimately destroyed him to a large extent the shadow of slavery still hangs over this land and affects the daily life of every american slavery was the black gold that produced americas first wealth and power slavery was the breeding ground for the most contagious and contaminating monster of all timesracism it was this racism and oppression by white america that convinced malcolm_x of the necessity of black nationalism as the vehicle for black liberation as opposed to integration while he was in the black muslim movement although his black nationalism while he was in the muslim organization was narrow and sectarian this did not prevent him from playing a tremendously important role in the evolution of the black freedom struggle prior to the arrival of malcolm_x on the scene most of white america looked upon the established civil_rights organizations as extremists although most of them were creatures and creations of the white controllers of power but malcolm comes along and says not only do i refuse to integrate with you white man but i demand that i be completely separated from you in some states of our own or back home in africa not only is your christianity a fraud but your democracy a brittle lie neither the white man nor his black apologists could answer the latter argument because they could not answer malcolm in this area they attacked him where he was most vulnerable the concept of separatism and that all white folks were blueeyed devilslabeling him a hate monger racist dangerous fanatic black supremacist etc in reality he was none of these things certainly he didnt preach black supremacy malcolm_x preached black pride black redemption black reaffirmation and he gave the black woman the image of a black man that she could respect the fact that malcolm_x while in the black muslim movement could reject a white person on any term caused most of white amer ica psychological suicide and instilled admiration and pride in most black americans for the egos of most americans are so bloated that they cannot conceive of a black man rejecting them it can be stated categorically that malcolm_x while in the black muslim movement and out of it created the present stage of the civil_rights struggleto the extent that he was a catalytic agentoff stage sarcastically criticising the civil_rights leaders popping a whip which activated them into more radical action and programs he was the alternative with which the power holders of america had to deal if they didnt deal with the established civil_rights leaders on december about two weeks after president john f kennedys assassination malcolm_x addressed a public rally at manhattan center in new york city he was speaking as a replacement for elijah muhammad as he had done many times before after the speech in a question and answer period malcolm_x made the remark that led to his suspension as a muslim minister in answer to a question what do you think about president kennedys assassination malcolm_x answered that he saw the case as the chickens coming home to roost soon after the remark malcolm_x was suspended by elijah muhammad and directed to stop speaking for days some weeks later when malcolm_x realized that there were a number of highly placed persons in the black muslim movement conspiring against him seemingly with elijah muhammads consent he left the movement malcolm devotes a chapter in his book to the growth of his disenchantment and his eventual suspension from the black muslim movement he says i had helped mr muhammad and his ministers to revolutionize the american black mans thinking opening his eyes until he would never again look in the same fearful way at the white man if i harbored any personal disappointment whatsoever it was that privately i was convinced that our nation of islam could be an even greater force in the american black mans overall struggleif we engaged in more action by that i mean i thought privately that we should have amended or relaxed our general nonengagement policy i felt that wherever black people committed themselves in the little rocks and the birminghams and other places militantly disciplined muslims should also be therefor all the world to see and respect and discuss on march he publicly announced that he was starting a new organization in fact two new organizations were started the muslim mosque inc and the organization of afroamerican unity malcolm_x was still somewhat beholden to elijah muhammad in the weeks immediately following his break with the movement at his press conference on march th he said in part i am and always will be a muslim my religion is islam i still believe that mr muhammads i analysis of the problem is the most realistic and that his solution is the best one this means that i too believe the best solution is complete separation with our people going back home to our own african homeland but separation back to africa is still a longrange program and while it is yet to materialize million of our people who are still here in america need better food clothing housing education and jobs right now mr muhammads program does point us back homeward but it also contains within it what we could and should be doing to help solve many of our problems while we are still here internal differences within the nation of islam forced me out of it i did not leave of my own free will but now that it has happened i intend to make the most of it now that i have more independence of action i intend to use a more flexible approach toward working with others to get a solution to this problem i do not pretend to be a divine man but do believe in divine guidance divine power and in the fulfillment of divine prophecy i am not educated nor am an expert in any particular field but i am sincere and my sincerity is my credentials the problem facing our people here in america is bigger than all other personal or organizational differences therefore as leaders we must stop worrying about the threat that we seem to think we pose to each others personal prestige and concentrate our united efforts toward solving the unending hurt that is being done daily to our people here in america i am going to organize and head a new mosque in new york city known as the muslim mosque inc this gives us a religious base and the spiritual force necessary to rid our people of the vices that destroy the moral fiber of our community our political philosophy will be black nationalism our economic and social philosophy will be black nationalism our cultural emphasis will be black nationalism many of our people arent religiously inclined so the muslim mosque inc will be organized in such a manner as to provide for the active participation of all negroes in our political economic and social programs despite their religious or nonreligious beliefs the political philosophy of black nationalism means we must control the politics and the politicians of our community they must no longer take orders from outside forces we will organize and sweep out of office all negro politicians who are puppets for me outside forces malcolm_x had now thrust himself into a new area of conflict that would take him briefly to a high point of international attention and partial acceptance during the last phase of his life malcolm_x established the muslim mosque inc and a nonreligious organizationthe organization of afroamerican unity patterned after the organization of african unity he attempted to internationalize the civil_rights struggle by taking it to the united nations in several trips to africa and one to mecca he sought the counsel and support of african and asian heads of state his trip to mecca and africa had a revolutionary effect upon his thinking his perennial call had always been for black unity and selfdefense in opposition to the integrationists program of nonviolence passive resistance and negrowhiteunity when he returned home from his trip he was no longer opposed to progressive whites uniting with revolutionary blacks as his enemies would suggest but to malcolm and correctly so the role of the white progressive was not in black organizations but in white organizations in white communities convincing and converting the unconverted to the black cause further and perhaps more important malcolm had observed the perfidy of the white liberal and the american left whenever afroamericans sought to be instruments of their own liberation he was convinced that there could be no blackwhite unity until there was black unity that there could be no workers solidarity until there is racial solidarity the overwhelming majority of white americans demonstrate daily that they cannot and will not accept the black man as an equal in all its ramificationsafter having years of racism preached to them from the pulpit taught in the primer and textbook practiced by the government apotheosized on editorial pages lauded on the airways and television screens it would be tantamount to selfcastration a gutting of the ego it would be asking white america to completely purge itself of everything it has been taught fed and believed for years it was this recognition of what racism had done to the white man and the black mind that the following paragraph was and is a keystone of the organization of afroamerican unitys program we must revamp our entire thinking and redirect our learning trends so that we can put forth a confident identity and wipe out the false image built up by an oppressive society we can build a foundation for liberating our minds by studying the different philosophies and psychologies of others provisions are being made for the study of languages of eastern origin such as swahili hausa and arabic such studies will give us as afroamericans a direct access to ideas and history of our ancestors as well as histories of mankind at large more so than any other afroamerican leader malcolm_x realized that there must be a concomitant cultural and educational revolution if the physical revolution is to be successful no revolution has ever sustained itself on emotion when malcolm_x returned from his trip to mecca and africa he completely repudiated the black muslims program of separation their acquisitive thirst for money and property and machine idolatry he felt that they were merely imitating the racist enemy he still believed in separation from his racist enemy but his was an ideological separation to malcolm_x the belief was that the afroamerican must transcend his enemy not imitate him for he foresaw that both the black muslims and the integrationists were aping the oppressor that neither recognized that the struggle for black freedom was neither social nor moral it was and is a power struggle a struggle between the whitehaves and the blackhavenots a struggle of the oppressor and the oppressed and if the oppressed is to breach the power of the oppressor he must either acquire power or align himself with power therefore it is not accidental that malcolms political arm the organization of afroamerican unity was patterned to the letter and spirit after the organization of african unity nor should it be surprising that he officially linked up the problems of afroamericans with the problems of his black brothers and sisters on the mother continent malcolm_xs vision was broad enough to see that the afroamericans were not a minority as the enemy and his lackeys would have us believe afroamericans are not an isolated million there are over million black people in the western hemisphere cuba brazil latin america the west indies america etc and malcolm knew that when we unite these millions with the million on the african continent the black man becomes a mighty force the second largest people on earth and so malcolms perennial theme was unity unity unity the formation of the organization of afroamerican unity and the establishment of an official connection with africa was one of the most important acts of the twentieth century for this act gave the afroamericans an official link with the new emerging power emanating from both africa and asia thus malcolm_x succeeded where marcus garvey and others had failed thus doing this malcolm projected the cause of afro american freedom into the international arena of power when he internationalized the problem by raising it from the level of civil_rights to that of human rights and by linking up with africa malcolm_x threw himself into the crossfire of that invisible international cartel of power and finance which deposes presidents and prime ministers dissolves parliaments if they refuse to do their bidding it was this force i believe which killed malcolm_x which killed lumumba which killed hammarskjold there is another and more potent reason why the american oppressors feared malcolm_x and desired him dead and that is the publicized fact that he was going to bring the oppression of afroamericans before the united nations charging the united states government with genocide many of the oppressors had conniptions when confronted with the prospect of a world body discussing the problems of afroamericans in the introduction to malcolm_xs autobiography m s handler has said no man in our time aroused fear and hatred in the white man as did malcolm because in him the white man sensed an implacable foe who could not be had for any pricea man unreservedly committed to the cause of liberating the black man in american society rather than integrating the black man into that society he was more precisely a man in search of a definition of himself and his relationship to his people his country and the world that a man who had inhabited the lower depth of life could rise in triumph as a reproach to its ills and become an uncompromising champion of his people is in itself a remarkable feat malcolm_x went beyond this feat though he came from the american ghetto and directed his message to the people in the american ghetto first of all he also became in his brief lifetime a figure of world importance he was assassinated on february while on the threshold of his potential about the men of his breed the writer john oliver killens has said he was a dedicated patriot dignity was his country manhood was his government and freedom was his landnew york city november it is years since i racial disturbances first e occurred in the notting hill section of london today again racial violence is a real possibility in britain even a cursory examination of the events of the last decade reveals a marked deterioration in relations between the races moreover the process has been sharply accelerated during the past year to americans now harvesting the fruits of centuries of bigotry the signs are ominously familiar britains colored residents numbering one million and consisting in the main of west indians pakistanis indians and some west africans are but percent of the entire population however when one realizes that in nonwhites totalled only about it is obvious that the influx has been rapid exceedingly so for many in a highly homogenized nation traditionally suspicious of strangers undeniably britons who have long claimed immunity to the bacillus of racial prejudice have now been infected indeed judging by the extent of discrimination in housing and employment the disease has reached epidemic proportions though to be sure many have proven immune according to a governmentsponsored survey released in job discrimination based on race is commonplace employment agencies admitted that colored applicants were referred to a very small percentage of employers labor unions were no more tolerant furthermore coloreds were not acceptable as tenants in fully twothirds of all privately owned property discrimination in auto insurance was also substantiated as in the united states nonwhites who cannot find jobs commensurate with their talents or living accommodations adequate for their families needs have grown increasingly bitter one manifestation of this bitterness has been the emergence of a black_power movement for a short period of time the black_power movement was personified by michael x a trinidadian whose autobiography was recently published while its author languished in prison in november he was convicted of violating that provision of the race relations act of which prohibits incitement to racial hostility his conviction resulted from a speech delivered in reading in which michael observed in i saw white savages kicking black women in the streets and black brothers running away his admonition to the audience was allegedly if you ever see a white man laying a hand on your black woman kill him immediately michael xs life in the west indies and britain studded as it has been with humiliating and degrading experiences sharply underscores the globalization of the color problem in the second half of the twentieth century few of his experiences would sound particularly novel to black americans his militant response to those experiences namely his advocacy of black pow er would be still less novel michael whose father was a portuguese merchant was often reminded as a child by his mother a black barbadian herself that white is pretty black is ugly she actually forbade him to play with negro children she discouraged him from dating negro girls and years later she was shocked and keenly disappointed when he married a black woman in england not surprisingly michael x or michael abdul malik as he now calls himself underwent an identity crisis which he subsequently saw being repeated in his young daughter the girl is fond of drawing michael comments in his book i watch her for a while and every so often i say put a little more black in here blacks a very pretty col or particularly galling to michael was the prejudice which prevented him from working as a british merchant seaman and which required him to sail aboard norwegian vessels in common with black people in the united states he found all too often that the police in the ghetto are the type who think black people are all savages like his friend malcolm_x michael living in a society which rejected him earned his livelihood as a pimp outside the societys laws like malcolm he had affairs with white women which in retrospect he regretted like malcolm he eventually came to grips with the twin problem of a much tarnished racial selfimage and black_powerlessness dropped his slave name de freitas and converted to islam unlike malcolm whose rebirth was made possible by the muslims michael fashioned his own instrument the racial adjustment action society or raas as it is usually called the choice of name had a curious rationale raas according to michael is a west indian word referring to a menstrual blood cloth therefore it symbolizes the way the black man has been drained of his life blood for so long also the word ras derived from arabic is used in parts of africa in ethiopia for example to mean leader or head among raas aims were not only the uniting of nonwhites in the british isles but safeguarding their rights as human beings promoting black ownership of business to reduce dependency upon white capital creating cooperative housing projects and providing legal advice loosely structured the organization attracted pakistanis indians and turbaned sikhs as well as west indians and guianese associate membership was open to sympathetic europeans but it was michaels conviction that white people ought not be accorded a major role in the black freedom movement as in the united states whites have been influential in respectable civil_rights organizations in britain such as card the campaign against racial discrimination the gulf between the moderates and the militants widened throughout and when to the delight of his colored audience michael described englishmen as white monkeys and condemned them for dehumanizing and raping the mind and spirit of the black man he preached black consciousness and reiterated the now familiar phrase black is beautiful in his autobiography michael claims that raas had a membership on paper of after being in existence for one year because an entirely active membership was preferred the size of the organization was cut to some apparently since michaels imprisonment it has been reduced further some defections including that of roy sawh can be attributed to the religious that is islamic character which had been given to raas born in guiana sawh is a flamboyant hyde park orator who had served as its fulltime national organizer by the beginning of raas had been eclipsed by the universal coloured peoples association the ucpa first emerged on britains racial scene in november shortly after its formation when members appeared at a weekend card meeting sporting badges on which the phrase black_power and a picture of a black_panther were displayed president of the ucpa is obi b egbuna who was bom in onitsha in what is now biafra in included in his writings are a play a novel a pamphlet the murder of nigeria and articles on racial injustice egbunas awareness of the plight of afroamericans and his debt to malcolm_x and stokely carmichael are apparent in his writings graphically illustrating this transatlantic racial link was the first issue june of a periodical black_power speaks published by the ucpa it contained an editorial entitled hands off rap brown an ode to malcolm_x a poem by w e b du bois a picture of stokely speaking at the ucpa platform at hyde park speakers corner and a plea to readers to join the ucpa soul brothers now and make black_power a way of life black_power has been defined in a special statement of the ucpa as the totality of the economic cultural political and if necessary military power which the black peoples of the world must acquire in order to get the white oppressor off their backs echoing michael malcolm and stokely the statement talks of cultural genocide and the need for black cultural nationalism in addition it bemoans the denial of equal opportunity to black people in short it bluntly asserts we do not enjoy being black in a whitecontrolled britain the objectives of the ucpa are comprehensive and include the establishment of nurseries for colored children the organization of study groups for blacks to stress racial interests and the formation of cooperatives especially significant is the fact that the problem of black people in britain is seen in a worldwide context the resident of harlem the black angolan and the west indian in londons ladbroke grove have a common oppressor international white power their only solution it is maintained is international black_power ian smith in rhodesia and harold wilson in britain it is argued differ not in principle but in tactics some recent racial developments make such an argument plausible to a growing number of coloreds in england on march after soulsearing and often bitter debate both in and out of parliament an emergency bill to check the influx of asians from kenya was enacted into law this act which affected not aliens but british subjects was later roundly condemned by the international commission of jurists and in april enoch powell a leading rightwing conservative made his inflammatory speech in birmingham on the race question powell conjured up visions of whole areas of the country subjected to black domination and prophesied racial violence unless further colored immigration was stopped and blacks already living in britain were encouraged to depart although powell was relieved of his post as shadow minister of defense popular support for his position was considerable not only did rightwingers and longtime racists rally to his standard but they were joined by dockers as well as workers from the smithfield market on july some smithfield demonstrators marched to whitehall carrying placards reading no sellout to black_power keep britain white and guess whos coming to dinner even passage of a new race relation bill designed to minimize discrimination in housing and employment probably cannot mitigate a sense of rejection deepened by such demonstrations there are indications that powell by polarizing racial opinion has strengthened the black_power movement still quite small it is growing perceptibly for example the hustler the first ghetto newspaper appeared shortly after the powell incident published in notting hill its orientation is black_power of course black_power is not to be equated with violence yet inevitably there is talk of bloodshed in britain the ucpa while it does not favor the use of force believes that the only way to neutralize violence is to employ violence it takes a single match stick to burn london down it takes one angry black man to light that match egbuna has dismissed gandhis passive resistance as ineffective for a small minority and michael x using the idiom of the ghetto has written in anger and sorrow that the black man walking through notting hill says we should burn this place down who brought about ghanas independence the people q who were the moving forces outstandingly dr kwame vv nkrumah after his return from overseas in with an absence of years from his home nkrumah became the secretary of the united gold coast convention he regarded the ugcc as a movement backed almost entirely by reactionaries middle class lawyers and merchants since the executive of the ugcc followed a reactionary course the time was ripe for a showdown this opportunity to bring about ghana independence and to carry on panafrican agitation in africa were what really attracted dr nkrumah back to ghana he had been in london in the honourable company of dedicated blackmen of courage such as george padmore peter abrahams c l r james and jomo kenyatta nkrumah sought the support of the ghana young men and women to push the movement for independence such men as kojo botsio and k a gbedemah joined forces with nkrumah to form an active forwardmoving organization in he broke away from this organization with many others to form the convention peoples party a more dynamic organization capable of achieving the independence which finally crystallized in he also was elected the general secretary of the cpp the organizations which comprised the cpp were the workers brigade the state construction workers the national council of ghana women the ghana young pioneers the trade union congress the united ghana farmers council and the cooperatives the members of these various organizations were members of the cpp and they worked to realize the ideology of the party a member ofthe cpp once said whatever they do the character of the cpp must be clearly manifested for all to see they all have a single guiding light the light of our party ideology this light must constantly be kept bright and full c f lustre and must on no account be allowed to dim for as soon as this happens we are bound to find ourselves in difficulties this first sixpoint manifesto of the cpp illustrated their pragmatic approach to fight relentlessly by all constitutional means for the achievement of full self government now for the chiefs and the people o the gold coast no gradualism o serve as the vigorous conscious political vanguard for removing forms of oppression and for the establishment of a democratic lovernment c o secure and maintain the complete unity of the chiefs and people of the colony ashanti northern territories and the trans olta to work in the interest of the trade union movement in the country for better conditions of employment to work for a proper reconstruction of a better gold coast in which the people shall have the right to live and govern themselves as a free people to assist and facilitate in any way possible the realization of a united and selfgoverning west africa african continent let all fellowmembers remember whether we be trade unionists whether we be farmers whether we be members of the womens council or of the young pioneers that the dominant character which should take precedence in all that we do is the character of the membership of the cpp this character is the guiding force of our ghanaian life and existence and constitutes the bulwark against national treachery intrigue subversion and other unghanaian activities the work of the cpp prior to independence was essentially that for the attainment of independence for ghana since independence the m cpp moved its activities in the following directions a political an upper house of the legislature known as the senate shall be created for the chiefs the eventual adoption of a republican government for the total political independence from britain universal suffrage at the age of direct eitcuons v itn no property or residential qualifications for can didates a strong panafrican movement and action b economic a five year economic plan immediate africanization of the civil service immediate materialization of the volta hydroelectric scheme railway lines to be doubled and extended roads to be modernized and extended canals to join rivers progressive mechanization of agriculture special attention will be given to the swollen root disease farmers will be given control of the cocoa industry board funds industrialization to be carried out with all energy c social education a unified system of free compulsory elementary secondary and technical education up to years of age the university college to be brought up to university status and more new ones established a planned campaign to abolish illiteracy d family assistance a free national health service a high standard of housing program a pipedwater supply in all parts of the country a national insurance scheme in order to achieve these the cpp demanded hard work and sacrifice from its members as well as ghanaian citizenry president nkrumah stated thus to travel this road every member of the cpp every ghanaian man and woman every boy and girl all of us together must work and give service to the nation to the best of our ability even the disabled the blind and the crippled must be equipped in this great crusade to contribute their quota to the total national effort he spoke against the advocates of racialism before ghana attained independence he was against race discrimination whatever form it may take people have not been expelled from the country or prevented from entering ghana because of their color those who were expelled from the country were responsible for such action and it was due to their subversive political activities he has declared my hatred against imperialists can never dwindle but i want everyone in this country to remember is that we are fighting against a system and not against any individual race or color i do not believe in racialism and localism the concept africa for the africans does not mean that other races are excluded from it no it only means that africans shall and must govern themselves in their own countries without imperialist and foreign impositions but the people of other races can remain in african soil carry on their legitimate avocations and live on terms of peace friendship and equality with africans on their own soil social and economic rehabilitation of ghana under the leadership of nkrumah after independence was achieved early in in that years christmas eve message to the nation nkrumah declared my first objective is to abolish from ghana poverty ignorance and disease we shall measure our progress by the improvement in the health of our people by the number of children in school and by the quality of their education by the availability of water and electricity in our towns and villages and by the happiness which our people take in being able to manage their own affairs and no more by alien powers the welfare of our people is our chief pride and it is by this that my government will ask to be judged i think that what follows will show that the judgment on this test will prove to be favorable the problem of social and economic transformation recognized the limiting circumstances from the beginning of nkrumahs rule economic and social change demands some choices either an outright and fullscale dictatorial regimentation and an imposition of a period of privation is adopted or a combination of foreign capital and technicians to participate in certain essential projects with some sacrifice from the citizenry to finance general social and industrial development will have to be made the ghana government made the latter choice following or using a socialist plan which has four parts the stateowned sector joint state and private enterprise the cooperative movement private enterprise the stateowned sector included electricity and water supplies hydroelectric projects arms and ammunition and alcoholic beverages these services and industries were administered by an industrial development corporation on behalf of the nation this corporation ran an efficient factory for making furniture with ghanaian timber instead of exporting timber and later to import furniture at an exorbitant price brickmaking works and a modern printing establishment to produce daily newspapers government documents and statesponsored books the enterprises jointly owned by the state and private companies was largely an intention rather than practice the idea was to insist upon state participation in monopolies whose interests might beor are incompatible with public interests and in infant industries which need state protection as well as those sick industries which might use subsidies what happens in the western european countries canada and the usa why nationalize steel industries in britain why government contracts and trade tariffs in the usa why guidelines to labour and industries in the usa certain industries had suffered during the colonial period to rehabilitate them cooperatives became a very crucial method for improvement and survival take for example the cocoa problems the middlemen exploited the cocoa farmers while the cocoa swollen root disease devastated the cocoa trees to counteract the activities of the middlemen a voluntary cooperative movement among the farmers developed to great proportions their produce had to be pooled together and selling was done in bulk thereby overcoming the exploitation by the middlemen the cocoa marketing board developed side by side with the cooperatives the government of ghana aimed at integrating the cooperative movement with its national economic planning rivalry between the cooperatives and the cmb was unhealthy and as a result the nkrumah government found a solution by establishing ghana farmers marketing cooperatives and finally gave the country an efficient coordination of this aspect of the national economy since the revenue from cocoa was by far the largest source of national wealth it became necessary that a portion of this revenue should be set aside to contribute to the plans for national construction and social development in november at the opening ceremony of the cocoa house the headquarters of the marketing board nkrumah on behalf of the government stated the accumulated reserves of the cmb are public money held in trust by the government for the benefit of the farmers and the people of this country most of the cocoa farmers patriotically accepted this appreciating the security which it afforded them a large percentage of the reserve funds had been devoted to the development of the cocoa industry itself the following are examples of the disbursement of the fund a cocoa rehabilitation and control of the swollen root disease million million b endowment for the faculty of agriculture of the university of ghana million million c donation to the west african cocoa research institute study of cocoa disease and the development of highyielding varieties million million d new hospitals schools social servicesroads water supply clinics and dispensaries and certain projects in the economic development plan million million the cocoa swollen root disease has no known cure and the only practical measure was to persuade the farmers to cut down the infected trees with compensation a national campaign was launched and finally the cocoa swollen root disease was eradicated by cutting them down diamond industry the ghana government endeavored to bring about the africanization of the diamond industry on cooperative lines similar to the cocoagrowers organization this cooperative would train africans to serve as valuers polishers and graders of the diamonds in addition an agency under ghanaian control would be set up in london to place the diamonds on the world market the complete africanization of the diamond industry would inevitably place the wealth in the hands of ghanaians for their own enjoyment the scheme met with violent opposition from the vested interests in the diamond industry domestically and of course internationally england france and the usa delay occurred but by plans had been endorsed by the government to place percent of the ghanaian diamond industry on a cooperative basis and in a marketing board was set up to sell the ghanaian supply to dealers the development of the diamond industry in ghana has been impressive in the output was a little over carats by output rose to million carats valued at million million approximately the world demand for ghanaian diamonds is great since they are mostly suited for industrial purposes the expansion of the diamond industry is part of the diversification of the economy to save it from dependence on one crop king cocoa economists know the danger of oneindustry state it is always in a precarious position if prices fall the whole economy is affected the governments agriculture department followed the national plan to diversify the agricultural sector of the economy the aims were to provide enough food for the growing population and to provide funds for financing the various development projects it also gave balance to the nations economy bananas coffee coconuts copra kola nuts rubber tobacco cattleranching vegetables and fishing were developed according to the national plan prior to the execution of this diversification food had to be imported in seven years from to in conjunction with the agricultural diversification the aiding factors such as the use of fertilizers seed dressing new varieties improved husbandry techniques mechanized cultivation in grassland areas the distribution of seedlings at cheap prices credits for tools and equipment a service of tractors were all established irrigation and water conservation were developed including the construction of dams in the northern and upper regions all these were accomplished within the period of nkrumahs administration the ghanaian pattern of agricultural socialism was well developed stateplanned and serviced cooperatively run comprehensive and nationwide fishing prior to independence was primitive and the supply very inadequate for postindependence fishing was revolutionized the traditional canoe fleet with paddle were motorized fish catch increased cold storage plants in inland areas and cold stores plant and canning in tema were established these have been done to achieve economic efficiency and to transform the diet of the people providing them with adequate supplies of high quality protein which they needed so much the builders of the new ghana realized that for the nation s wealth to be increased so that the standards of life of its people their material conditions health education and cultural fulfillment increased to desired levels their agricultural advance must be accompanied by an equal industrial advance this provides the achievement of a balanced economic and social growth the first need for industry is power electric power for machinery for processing raw materials for facilitating refrigeration for the operating of chemical plants and for smelting minerals to this end the volta river project was geared the volta river varies in flow in the ratio of as much as tol between flood and low water the flood before the dam project was running waste the project is intended to store the water in the manmade lake covering square miles providing a reserve for the low water season enabling a constant flow through tne great dam which will generate the power the lake will provide a new highway to the distant north helping to break down isolation and backwardness a new fishing industry will be created and the square miles of land around the shores of the lake will be flooded each season at high water amenable to intensive cultivation of crops such as rice there is an incidental aspect of the volta river project which is exceptionally pleasing besides the material purposes new modern towns will spring up and some have sprung up the site of the dam and power station will be kept free from ugliness to make it a true attraction for ghanaians and tourists from abroad thereby helping to develop tourism as a source of revenue this project was initiated by the government as a part of ghanas patterned construction its origin was essentially socialist but the project itself is partly public enterprise and partly private enterprise the power development was undertaken from public resources while the development of the smelter remained private enterprise the dam the power station the manmade lake the water highway the distribution of electricity throughout ghanas industrial sector have all been on the side of public enterprise another aspect of the move towards industrialization was the attempt to overcome the key drawback in the development of ghana the lack of a good harbor goods and passengers abroad seagoing vessels had to be transferred to boats some distance from land and rowed through the surf to the dock at accra a modern deepwater port providing berths capable of handling up to tons a year was constructed at tema miles from accra at a cost of million million two new towns were developed as a result of this construction tema new town for the dock workers and tema new village for the fishermen and their families what was the situation regarding educational facilities since independence any noticeable improvement the following statistics points out the facts see statistics during the colonial period tuition cost of books and all the other incidental expenses were paid by parents who had children in school after independence tuition was abolished in primary and secondary schools generous government scholarships were given to ghanaians who study in the universities in ghana as well as those in foreign universities mass education meant more in ghana villagers deep in the forests were under instructors cutting a way through the trees and undergrowth and building fewer roads to the main routes to the towns so that they could exchange their produce for previously unknown goods in the shops and link themselves with the social and cultural development which was sweeping the country they built halls and schools dug trenches for irrigation organized the collection of refuse thereby improving sanitation this was an extraordinary voluntary cooperation in personal progress and community betterment the youth was organized and known as the national workers brigade to perform community service the boys were apprenticed in masonry carpentry plumbing automobile fitting electrical engineering vehicle mechanics and tractor operations the girls learned the marketing of produce food preservation household duties secretarial and office duties they were sent to different camps for their training here was a nation recruiting its youth not principally in military forces but into a disciplined army devoted entirely to constructive community activity as an index of the national economic growth the gnp rose from million in to million in percentage increase was from percent annual growth to percent growth rate in something should be said about the man dr nkrumah the leader of the ghana movement his conception of socialism demands personal services in contrast with personal gain british and american newspaper reports have many times presented a different image the public in these two countries as well as in their satellite nations have been given the picture of a man who sought grandeur and ostentation when corruption invaded his ministers secretaries of departments he demanded that each of his ministers should reveal his income and possessions and how they were obtained the clue to the corrupt behaviors of his ministers was their construction of palatial mansions which they could not afford in their circumstances and salaries he on behalf of the government insisted that they should show examples to the nation that they should surrender all financial and business interests and live at reasonable standard ministers who did not conform were dismissed two among those dismissed were later reappointed partly in recognition of their past service to ghanaian freedom and partly because of their later adherence to principle their abilities and influence dr nkrumah believed in the complete freedom of all africans people of african descent and other peoples of the world equality and dignity of the human being was his first order in life one may question why the leaders of the opposition were arrested and detained for long periods without trial why the disturbances in ghana why the attempts to assassinate him the answers lie in understanding what african socialism means and what was the stage of alien political development in ghana inherited from the colonial administration dr nkrumahs government espoused socialism as an economic system in the context of african communalism which in no way is a prototype of european socialism de graft johnson made this clear when he wrote what our social structure which may be termed communalism cannot cope with is the modern world with its capitalist industries and our task here is to adapt the principles of socialism to our own particular mode of life alternately we can develop our basic traditional institutions in keeping with the basic principles of communalism to fit modern conditions i think we shall attempt both in african political systems there were never opposition parties per se people were active and participated fully in town and village discussions as a body gave their assent and registered their opposition to issues as they arose there was unity in diversity it was the paramount chief who acted as the voice of the people the socialism of africa differs from the european type european socialism was born of conflict the conflict that was sanctified into a philosophy the class war was looked upon not as something evil but as something necessary and good as prayer is to christianity or to islam so civil war class war is to european versions of socialisma means inseparable from the end each becomes the basis of a whole way of life the european socialist cannot think of his socialism without its fathercapitalism such a contradiction africans find intolerable it virtually says that without capitalism and the conflict which it creates within any society there can be no socialism african socialism did not arise from the agrarian revolution it did not start from the existence of conflicting classes in society it started as a family society its objective is the extended family africans have no more need to be converted to socialism than they have to be taught democracy europeans and other imperialists remain ignorant of the fact that socialism and democracy are rooted in the african past which produced contemporary africans these africans acknowledge that socialism must look to wider horizons for the extended family nyerete stated modern african socialism can no longer confine the idea of the social family within the limits of the tribe nor indeed of the nation for no true african socialist can look at a line drawn on a map and say the people on this side of that line are my brothers but these who happen to live on the other side of it have no claim on me every individual on this african continent is his brother the above also portrays nkrumahs socialism every african national leader had been engaged in the supreme need to build a sense of nationhood from diverse racial tribal and religious loyalties this has not been an easy task ghana had this problem particularly in the resistance of the ashanti and some northern peoples to incorporation in a united state it had to overcome the opposition of powerful chiefs regarded as the spiritual heads of communities as well as their political masters such chiefs are no more competent or capable of running the modern state nkrumah also inherited the bitter antagonism of the reactionary professional and business elite who he ousted as directors of the national movement the social disturbances were undoubtedly accented by conspiracies on the part of some of the opposition leaders who by all means were the paid agents of the british and the nato allies and the frustrated members of the cpp to overthrow the regime by assassinating president nkrumah some of those ghanaians who were definitely in the assassination plot which they attempted were apprehended and detained without trial their trial would have meant the death penalty and the pressure of public opinion would have made commutation of the sentence difficult the attacks on president nkrumahs life were misinterpreted by the western press as signs of unpopularity the facts prior to the coup point to a different direction the resistance of the ghanaian anglophiles the subversive activities of the local agents of the capitalist world the psychological poverty of arch tribalists and the unending quest to keep the black man down by the same ugly greedy and wicked imperialists account for the fall of nkrumahs government but not the man the coup on nkrumahs government february dealt a catastrophic blow to the african continent take a statistic of the black world and see the identical damage done to our brave leaderspatrice lumumba of the congo balewa of nigeria malcolm_x of the usa those living but ousted from office president nkrumah and president ben bella of algeria why this pattern the answer is very clear to all thinking peoples the fall of nkrumahs government is the fall of africa and africans his leadership was a pacesetter a guiding star and an inspirational one since the tragedy the continent has fallen into oblivion the portuguese in angola and mozambique the ian smiths and harold wilsons the nazi republic of south africa and their international cohorts are happy ghana and ghanaians are no more independent if we understand what freedom and independence means how can it be free when a major sector of the economy has been taken over by the foreign capitalists ghana is now starting on the path of having apartheid schools the london sunday telegraph of march writes the ghanaian staff of ashanti goldfields are incensed over the setting up of an allwhite primary school by the management and refusal to allow senior africans to form their staff association applications from ghanaian senior staff to enter their children in such schools have been rejected such a school never existed under nkrumah more than private schools with a fee of have been established this is a move to deny the children of any average worker the opportunity for education on the political front paramount chiefs as of february have been destooled by the military regime terrorism is now the order of the day the ghanaian times of february and published thus reports coming from ashanti give cause for serious concern in ashanti and the central regions and indeed in some other places in scattered areas of the country towns and villages in these areas of the country are being subjected to a wave of terrorism and dacoity unparalleled in the history of this country fear stalks the land in many homes there is not a wink of sleep for man or woman armed robbery is showing upward surge because of the lowebbing relations between the public and the police what an insult to human intelligence the militarycumpolice regime has abolished political party organization it has proclaimed that governing a country without any party or parties is the surest way to ensure democracy what an illusion what a contradiction on the economic front the ghana trade union congress which had pledged its support to the nlc is now begging for recognition which it had under nkrumahs government the u s capitalists have grabbed the ghana economy the firestone rubber company has taken over the stateoperated rubber plantations the u s international hotels corporation now controls all former state hotels advertisement for a managerial post for the nowcontrolled hotels stipulated quite clearly that ghanaian or african applicants will not be considered the economy is stagnating despite the assurance given by britain and the u s a that neocolonialism and capitalism will triumph in ghana as a payment for the criminal coup the british promised a loan of and the usa million finally the most outrageous act of the military regime is the sending away in ghanaian airways all the nationalist refugees from angola mozambique southern rhodesia south west africa and the republic of south africa back to their respective places of origin their military and police escorts handed them over to the imperialist authorities for their final destruction such is the situation the democracy and newlywon freedom for the ghanaians and africa the direct causes of the imperialists attack on nkrumah before the independence of ghana the currency authority was the west african currency board established in by executive decree of the colonial office with headquarters in london the wacb was nothing other than a local agent the control of the commercial banks was under the wacb the monetary policy adopted was at the whims and caprices of the wacb and principally at the dictation of london on march three days before ghana became independent the central bank of ghana was established it thus became the sole bank of issue the banker to the government and other commercial banks the fiscal agent of the government in dealing with important international financial institutions eg the international monetary fund and the world bank it also operated for the government in exchange control as the sole bank of issue it had the power to influence the credit situation with a view to maintaining monetary stability in ghana and the external value of the ghana pound the cbg originated a local money market by issuing on behalf of the government day treasury bills this enabled the ghanaians to invest their money domestically it also curtailed the volume of funds transferred out of ghana to britain such transfers were of a high magnitude prior to the establishment of the central bank the central bank created an atmosphere which encouraged the establishment of indigenous owned and operated commercial banks and also the expansion of branches of the older ones between march and november branch banks increased from to this was the breaking of the monopoly position of the british barclays bank dominion colonial and overseas ltd and bank of west africa ltd since the monopoly position was threatened the foreign owners mounted a series of attacks on the nkrumah government we can see how sincere the british position is free competition in britain and monopoly in africa in line with the goal for relative economic independence a reduction in the high shipping costs of ghanian exports the ghana national shipping line was established after formerly all exports from and imports to ghana had been carried by the british shipping firms the profits from such services accrued to britain the prohibitive shipping charges reduced the profit margin that could have gone to ghana passenger service provided by the shipping firms was controlled by the british with the establishment of the ghana black star line national shipping line the charges on exports and passenger services were reduced to reasonable levels the profits became a source of revenue to be used in financing other economic development projects as well as in expanding the shipping lines a third case of monopoly is the air lines colonial ghana had no national airways the air transport was owned operated and controlled by the british overseas airways corporationair france and panamerican air lines with independence and the establishment of the ghana airways corporation the monopoly position of the british was demolished more revenue was thereby secured for ghana the purchase of some aircraft from the soviet union instead of the more costly ones manufactured by the nato countries contributed to the animosity directed at nkrumahs government the african continent had been described as the sleeping giant dr nkrumah called the african allafrican peoples conference in this conference brought political leaders trade unionists nationalists and others from different works of life together for a common endeavourthe complete liberation of the continent from foreign domination nkrumah had declared in his independence message of march that he would not consider ghana free and independent as long as any portion of the african soil remained under foreign control ghana provided free transportation for revolutionary refugees from the racialist nightmare of angola mozambique southern rhodesia south west africa and the republic of south africa it also aided guinea when it elected to be her own boss and to chart her own destiny rather than remain in the french community and be a province of france imagine such an anarchronism part of the african continent a portion of france making black africans frenchmen this destroys the work of nature the colonial nato countries jubilantly anticipated the collapse of guinea when france pulled out taking with it everything including paperclips and toilet tissue before the african continent had been balkanized brothers and sisters husbands and wives and even tribes were arbitrarily and forcibly separated by the unnatural political boundaries drawn by the greedy europeans today some problems that confront african countries are the offshoots of the unnatural boundaries to overcome such unending division nkrumah by political action and marriage involved the whole of north africa in the united and collective effort of breaking down the artificial disgraceful wall that had separated the african land mass and its peoples finally nkrumah with the cooperation of the late w e b du bois and george padmore initiated the dialogue on the possibility of publishing encyclopedia africana for the purpose of placing african historical cultural and social achievements of antiquity in proper perspective for all these reasons the nato powers mounted their attack on this great african one thing is clear to the patriotic african in fledgling states imperialists interest flourish where there is an atmosphere of dissension they are endangered in an atmosphere of national unity and stability some people have accused the government of having too much power over the national economy i have to remind those people that under colonial administration the little postal telegraphic and rail communications broadcasting electricity and water services that existed were all publicly owned and administered nobody domestically or internationally raised a cry of woe but as soon as the ghanaians under nkrumahs direction added an airline a shipping line a central bank loud echoes of dictatorship started to roar in the firmament since then ghana has met with active resistance from vested interest groups within and without in the effort to build a national economy jules ferry premier of france in when he spoke in the chamber of deputies in defence of the colonial policy of the french government stated thus it is not clear that the great states of modern europe the moment their industrial power is founded are confronted with an immense and difficult problem which is the basis of industrial life the very condition of existencethe question of markets have you not seen the great industrial nations one by one arrive at a colonial policy and we can say that this colonial policy is a luxury for modern nations not at all gentlemen this policy is for all of us a necessity like the market itself today as you know the law of supply and demand freedom of exchange the influence of speculations all these move in a circle which extends to the ends of the world colonies are for rich countries one of the most lucrative methods of investigating capital i say that france which is glutted with capital and which has exported considerable quantities has an interest in looking at this side of the colonial question it is the same question as that of outlets for our manufacture the same situation applies to the motives of neocolonialists and imperialists albert sarraut french colonial secretary of state in spoke in stronger terms in paris what is the use of painting the truth at the start colonization was not an act of civilization nor was it a desire to civilize it was an act of force motivated by interests an episode in the vital competition which from man to man from group to group has gone on ever increasing the people who set out to seize colonies in distant lands were thinking primarily of themselves and were working for their own profits and conquering for their own power the origin of colonization is nothing else than enterprise of individual interests a onesided and egotistical imposition of the strong upon the weak you can see who really thinks of nkrumah as a dictator is it the true african no no it is the neocolonialists and their lackeys in ghana and the rest of africa the coup was effected by the imperialists lackeys in ghana in concert with thier international neocolonialist powers whatever might have happened nkrumahs philosophy remains indestructible and will be fostered in africa and in ghana as long as this planet earth exists any persons have wondered what were the characteristics that made marcus garvey a personality to be reckoned how is it that this little black man born in a small island could conceive the idea of redeeming the continent of africa and uniting a scattered race heredity in the first instance played an important part in his life he had a sympathetic heart and an expansive mind he was gentle and softspoken just like his mother but when provoked or on a platform the maroon blood of his father would boil within him and he would roar like a lion in projecting to the world the oppression fears hopes and ambitions of his peopleinto this dynamic personality came ideas and those ideas repeatedly projected themselves in his mind until they developed into idealssomething that must be achieved must be accomplished then the driving urge from within forced action the appalling conditions of his people everywhere cried aloud for a change as he said in a speech everywhere i go i see the poverty misery and suffering of my people i ask where is the black mans government where are his statesmen where is his flag his battleships and planes to protect him from oppression and wrong the answer isthere are none and i vowed to help him free himself and determine his own destiny for nationhood is the highest ideal of all peoples thus he found his purpose in life and pursued it to the bitter end without sparing himself and those who were loyal to him serving his race became an obsession with him and everything else had to fit into his workwife children and relatives must be expendable in this great cause embodied in his slogan africa for the africans those at home and those abroad his motto one god one aim one destiny as a solution to the negro problem in america garvey was vigorously opposed to miscegenationrace suicideas a way out of the political social and economic thralldom of the black minority he protested against the plea of interracial organizations for integration as a final goal for argued he the negro is not now equal to the whites who are in the majority and in powerin all material phases of life so that integration if achieved on a national scale would be unequal integration and therefore humiliating to black americans during the process and they would be absorbed into the white society and thereby lose their identity and any distinct contribution they make to the greatness of the nation the following are some excerpts from his philosophy and opinions which disclose the workings of the mind of this man the mission of the universal negro improvement association is to arouse the sleeping consciousness of negroes everywhere to the point where he will as one concerted body act for our own preservation by laying the foundation for such we will be able to work toward the glorious realization of an emancipated race and a constructed nation nationhood is the only means by which civilization can completely protect itself it is the highest ideal of any peopleto govern themselves while others are raising the cry for a white america a white canada a white australia we without reservation raise the cryand loudly toofor africas freedom to fight for african redemption does not mean that we must give up our domestic fights for political justice and industrial rights it does not mean that we must become disloyal to any government or to any country wherein we were born each and every race outside of its domestic national loyalty has a loyalty to itself therefore it is foolish for the negro to talk about not being interested in his own racial political social and industrial destiny we can be loyal american citizens or british subjects as the irishman or the jew and yet fight for the redemption of africa and complete emancipation of the race out of the unsettled state and condition of the world will come such revolutions that will give each and every race that is oppressed the opportunity to march forward the last world war world war i brought the opportunity to many heretofore subject races to regain their freedom the next world war will give africa the opportunity for which we are preparing we are going to have wars and rumors of wars in another or years we will have a changed world politically and africa will not be one of the most backward nations but africa shall be i feel sure one of the greatest commonwealths that will once more hold up the torchlight of civilization and bestow the blessings of freedom liberty and democracy upon all mankind power is the only argument that satisfies man except the individual the race or the nation has power that is exclusive it means that that individual race or nation will be bound by the will of the others who possess this great qualification it is the physical and pugilistic power of harry wills that makes white men afraid to fight him it was the industrial and scientific power of the teutonic race that kept it for years as dictator of the economic and scientific policies of europe it is the naval and political power of great britain that keeps her mistress of the seas it is the commercial and financial power of the united states of america that makes her the greatest banker in the world hence it is advisable for the negro to get power of every kind power in education science industry politics and higher government that kind of power that will stand out signally so that other races and nations can see and if they will not see then feel man is not satisfied or moved by prayers or petitions but every man is moved by that power of authority which forces him to do even against his will thus spoke garvey in the s it is remarkable that he did not harbour hate and bitterness in his heart against those who doublecrossed him turned government informers and others who used the press to make vicious lying statements against him especially in the garvey must go campaign in america launched by his rivals and which ended in his trial imprisonment and deportation said he if i kept piling up hate in my heart against those who daily seek my destruction my spirit would be poisoned by it how then could i love and serve my people they can destroy my body but they will never be able to break my will or suppress my fighting spirit i have breathed it into the minds of millions of my people the world over no human agency can stop us it is the will of god that this race of mine shall determine its own destiny and take its rightful place as equals among gods children the million dollar question asked by white reporters from news agencies and influential newspapers was mr garvey how are you going to redeem africa he answered in the year africa will be redeemedregardless of the armaments of the imperial powersby emancipating the minds of subjected peoples to realize and know that freedom of thought and action are the inherent right of all peoples after that free thought will devise ways and means to battle its way to freedom the small european imperial nations will fight the big powers for more expansion in africa and asia when this happens the peoples of these continents will get the big opportunity to free themselves as y l things will be too hot for europe to hold what she has as far back as garvey predicted the independence of the west indies in an article in the african times and orient review london he stated as one who knows the people well i make no apology for prophesy ing that there will soon be a turning point in the history of the west indies and that the people who inhabit that portion of the western hemisphere will be the instruments of uniting a scattered race who before the close of many centuries will found an empire on which the sun shall shine as ceaselessly as it shines on the empires of the north today time rolls on and in the year human rights yearwe found nearly all of the territories of africa and the west indies independent and represented in the united nations the negro problem in america has become the white mans problemhow to stem the tide of black_powerwhich is generated by black unity the basic power a small minority of oppressed people can achieve in a majority white nation is to take action in their best interests the new negro is thinking for himself and by himself and not in terms of being an appendage to a white society but with the backing of independent nations of his race and kindred spirit nuclear power is misused to decimate people and to destroy countries but black_power is generated to protect people from injustices and wrongs white supremacists cannot tap its source although they can destroy some of its exponents they cannot destroy the ideal it is in every black man woman and childs heart to get his human rights and to keep them to maintain them against all odds it is the spirit of garveyism it is an ideal a goal a working philosophy it motivates peoples to great achievements it is eternal in the breasts of peoples of african descent everywhere we met almost two weeks before the interview which follows below abdias do nascimento and i he did not have the lingering anxiety i had because when we my wife melba and i arrived at the first reception given for him he leapt to embrace us joy in his eye i then stood back for a little while looking him over trying to assess where he was coming from so now eye meets brothers eye against and across whatever lies of whatever white guidebook there is affirmation in the silences of this movement beyond the superficialities of the oppressors languages we use the language we speak the language of solidarity and brotherhood our spirit claws its way out of the depths of our purposes through our eyes we shake hands again hug brother meets brotherall barriers gone do you know this fool i showed him a copy of negro digest septoct with a photograph of eduardo de oliveira the black brazilian poet who is one of those familiar abominable apologists for white racism nascimento shook his head in disgust nodded a painful yes and asked for a copy of that issue of negro digest to show to the people in brazil abdias do nascimento is an afrobrazilian playwright actor painter director and founder of ten teatro experimental do negro nascimento is in the united states to check out the black theater he would like to see a dialogue between brazil africa and the rest of afroamerica he hopes to have a black arts and culture festival in brazil in to help unite our efforts he would also like to see a black world magazine published in french portuguese and english with contributors from all over the black world because our problems and desires are similar following is our interview as i recorded it in new york dr kwame nkrumah more than any present day vr african leader has stood out as the most articulate and consistent champion of the african peoples struggle against imperialism colonialism and their associated refinements of neocolonialism and racial oppression his numerous books speeches and political activities spanning a period of over twenty years testify to his prodigious labor and dedication in the service of the oppressed people of africa and their equally oppressed cousins in the western world particularly in the united states it is not without significance that among people who were to fire nkrumahs own political consciousness were those remarkable and selfless afroamerican leaders marcus garvey and dr w e b du bois in africa itself nkrumah has been the most consistent advocate of the twin goals of total african liberation and unity he has seen that without total liberation africa could never control her own destiny or realize her full potentiality he has also seen that without political unity african independence would remain nothing but a shell protecting foreign interests bent upon the plunder of the wealth of the continent and the economic subjugation of its people while it is true that the african people have in general sacrificed considerably to attain their political independence that independence could only have value for them to the extent that it was linked up with genuine economic independence many of the miniscule states of africa which presently boast themselves politically independent are unlikely ever to attain a genuine allround independence they will remain prey to those who wield the levers of economic power they will remain in other words neocolonial client states whose economic lifelines and political orientation will remain essentially at the beck and call of foreign interests it is on this general and valid ground that nkrumah has called for a union of african states such that the independence for which the people of africa have craved for centuries may become meaningful unity would result in the pooling of energies and resources it would constitute a bulwark against foreign attempts to exploit the young states of africa without it each small state must remain prey to foreign intrigues and manoeuvres much as in latin america nkrumahs prognosis on the likely fate of small disunited states in africa has already been amply shown to be valid numerous coups already have taken place all over africa and in most cases directed against progressive regimes seeking to bring about the genuine independence of their countries while no exhaustive study has been made to show whose hand was behind these upheavalsalways a difficult exercise given the nature of the casethere is little doubt that foreign interests were involved to a more or less decisive extent certainly nkrumahs analysis of the ghanaian coup which overthrew his government in february leaves the reader persuaded to the view that this was not a purely ghanaian militarypolice putsch the hand that fired the gun against its own government was indeed ghanaian the brain that hatched the plot or fomented its execution was not but how did the coup take place who spearheaded the revolt why what explains its apparently easy success and what future for independent africa the above represents some of the questions nkrumah has sought to answer in this book for analytical purposes the book may be taken as consisting of three interconnected themes the onset and mechanism of the coup itself the internal ghanaian political situation and the lessons for other african states that the ghanaian experience provides we shall try to deal with these themes in turn hereunder i dr nkrumah had left ghana on february on an official trip to hanoi to try to discover possibilities of ending the vietnam was as early as possible he was going to hanoi at the invitation of president ho chi minh on arrival in peking on the th however he was to learn from the chinese government that a coup had that day taken place in ghana immediately a decision was made to discontinue the trip to hanoi and a statement was issued to the press urging the people of ghana to stand firm and resist the illegal usurpation of power by the army and police in addition various assignments were given to the officials accompanying the president prior to the return to africa of the entire party surprisingly however these highranking officials seemed completely stunned to paralysis by the coup and seemed more concerned about their own personal fortunes under the new order than about resisting the illegal seizure of power thus for example foreign minister a quaison sackey a former ghanaian united nations representative and president of the general assembly of the un was instructed to go to addis ababa to represent the legal government of ghana at a meeting of oau foreign ministers but he chose instead to fly to accra the miiltarypolice junta quickly put him in jail on arrival though he was soon to be released it is significant that the only politically reliable people in the presidents party at this time of tremendous shock and stress were the security officers and members of dr nkrumahs personal staff it is these loyal individuals who accompanied him to guinea where he has remained to date as for the actual coup itself it appears that the major figure here was police commissioner john harlley it was he who maintained contact with two junior army officers emmanuel kotoka and akwasi afrifa whose two garrisons were used in the storming of key strong points in accra on the early morning of february with their commissioner at the very center of the plot the police of course offered every facility to the advancing troops indeed the only serious resistance the soldiers encountered was at the residence of the army chief of staff general barwah and at flagstaff house the official residence of the president general barwah refused to join the conspiracy and was shot on the spot by kotoka at flagstaff house tremendous resistance was offered by the presidential guard regiment for many hours until the guard was overpowered by superior numbers and weaponry some of the reasons for the coup will receive mention subsequently it is interesting however to note that these were far different from those which kotoka and afrifa gave the troops under their command the soldiersmany of whom are apparently illiteratewere told that the coup had to take place because a nkrumah intended to send them to fight the ian smith regime in rhodesia b nkrumah also intended to send them to fight in vietnam and c with the departure of the president for north vietnam there was in any case no government the army it was pointed out had to take power or else someone else would the russians it was revealed were already installed in a tunnel under flagstaff house and more of them were on their way to ghana to take over the government pp this jumble of fictitious and inconsistent argumentations apparently sounded plausible enough to induce the troops to action the important thing here however is to note how a coup which was hailed elsewhere as popular and justified had to be backed up with a series of falsehoods by its instigators in order to sell it to presumably reluctant soldiers for if a country is lying under the boot of an oppressoras ghana has been alleged in the western press to have beenwhy should it even be necessary to explain in detail that the country deserves to be liberated above all why invent reasons to explain why the action is necessary the probability seems strong that the plotters were not fired by any high national ideals their action sprang essentially from personal and power motives and therefore had to be backed up by a stream of hysterical demagoguery which could at least give a semblance of plausibility if not respectability to their actions but why is it that the coup was not greeted with any widespread popular resistance this is after all one element which antinkrumah propaganda has seized on to substantiate the allegation that the coup was popularly welcomed nkrumah suggests several factors that explain the apparent welcome that the coup met from the ordinary people first the army made it clear that any resister would be summarily and brutally dealt with the case of general barwah has already been referred to several other lesswell known people were similarly savaged moreover all top party and government officials were rounded up early in the exercise so that the masses remained leaderless at a crucial stage in the process of arresting the soldiers did not scruple to torture and severely beat up their victims for example professor kojo abraham at that time vice chancellor of the university of ghana and a noted scholar was severely beaten before being thrown into prison the manuscript of a book he was writing was publicly burnt nazistyle while he was taken into prison pp second nkrumah points out that resistance was slow in coming and when it did start it remained largely underground the april attempt at a countercoup seems to bear this out third there were certain elements especially in accra who genuinely welcomed the coup because the previous government had been unmindful of their special interests the relatively privileged professional and business strata including the famous accra market women no doubt chafed under the various austerity measures which the economic development of the country had made necessary they resented having to make sacrifices when independence should have meant the arrival of the golden age in any event these elements plus those released from prisons in order to give way to the thousands of new inmates together with others who were sheerly intimidated by the show of militarypolice power paraded in the popular demonstrations to which so much importance has been given in certain circles another reason for the lack of much overt resistance may well be a more general one in an underdeveloped country where communication lines are limited and centralized the advantage in any contest for power tends to go to whoever can seize these lines of communication at the outset seizure of communications means the ability to transmit messages favourable to one side immediately and widely the opposition is in this case put at a decided disadvantage for not only is it incapable of putting its case across it has also virtually to fight on terrain chosen by the dominant group since it is the latter which through its control of official communication channels selects the issues for debate no wonder then that most coup leaders place the radio station the post office etc as priority targets on the way to the seizure of powerthe ghanaian coup was as already indicated engineered by the leadership of the police force in collaboration with certain segments of the army but excluding its top personnel the new regime came to rest on three institutional pillarsthe army the police and the civil service bureaucracy the new government christened the national liberation council or nlc comprises four army officers and four police officers the chairman joseph ankrah is an army officer whom nkrumah had earlier retired but whom the young putschists pressed back into service to give an aura of respectability to the junta it appears that the civil service generally fell into line with the new order without a murmur without the collaboration of this service the junta would no doubt have found it well nigh impossible to run the country neither the police nor the army could have taken effective control of the state machinery on its own or in combination the civil service it appears was quite happy to facilitate the militarypolice grab of power we will return to this point later the one thing that stands out about members of the ghanaian junta and a factor which nkrumah deals with at some length is their utter lack of any political experience none of them had ever been involved in politics before the coup none of them ever took part in the liberation of their country from colonialism on the contrary several of them had respectable posts in the colonial army and police force both of which were used by the british imperialists to suppress the freedom movement which dr nkrumah and others successfully led indeed one of the junta members police officer deku played some part in the arrest and imprisonment of nkrumah himself in the preindependence days when the british colonialists were engaged in the harassment and suppression of nkrumahs proindependence convention peoples party in view of all this the reader may well ask for whom then did these latterday patriots choose to liberate ghana when their country was a happy hunting ground of british colonial exploiters they not only did nothing to liberate it they zealously collaborated with the foreign exploiter to suppress those who struggled for a genuine liberation now that the fruits of that struggle were beginning to flourish our loyal police and military officers come on the scene topple their own countrys popularly elected government while mumbling hypocritical phrases about national liberation the evidence for the inference that the juntas loyalties are to foreign imperialists and not to ghana or africa does not have to be derived solely from nkrumahs book a member of the junta col a afrifa has himself written a book on the coup the ghana coup london frank cass in this book afrifa argues among other things that the coup became necessary because nkrumahs panafricanist goals were misguided he makes clear that the quest for african liberation and unity was wrong that what was necessary was the strengthening of ghanas relations with britain and the british empire now known as the commonwealth in his own words organization of african unity or no organization of african unity i will claim my citizenship of ghana and of the commonwealth in any part of the world i have been trained in the united kingdom as a soldier and i am prepared to fight alongside my friends in the united kingdom in the same way as canadians and australians will do how could we be friends belonging to the commonwealth and stay out in time of commonwealth adversity here then is a mind trained to be loyal to its imperialist master and a mind which becomes outraged by any suggestion that an independent african state has any right to stay out in time of the empires adversity whatever that might be this slavish hankering for a return to the womb of the mother country is not confined to the members of the junta the prominent civilian supporters of the regime are generally men who have in the past shown their hatred of complete independence for their country as nkrumah points out p some of these men eg dr busia even petitioned the british government in the s against granting independence to the then gold coast arguing that the country was not yet ready for such independence the coup has presumably given them an opportunity to put their peculiar principles into practice it will be interesting to see what sort of politicalconstitutional contraption they will put together for the newly liberated ghana as already indicated one feature of the men spearheading the coup u in ghana is their common record of loyal service to the british colonial regime that preceded the nkrumah government the question naturally arises as to why nkrumah continued to maintain an army a police force and a civil service all of whose top officers were largely a carryover from the colonial past if you are going to set up a revolutionary government dedicated to radically new policy orientations and programs surely the last person you want to work with is the erstwhile defender of the imperialist presence why then did nkrumah assume that he could pursue his radical policies at home and abroad with the assistance of the inherited forces of conservatism and reaction nkrumah argues that his pursuit of both ghanaian socioeconomic development and panafricanism necessitated the africanization of the state structures wherever possible he points out for example that ghana would have presented an uninspiring picture in panafricanist circles if its national army were british officered p it was therefore necessary to put africans in charge and the individuals available for this were those who had served in the colonial army or police force this reviewer remains somewhat unimpressed with this argument the africanization argument is fraught with all kinds of illusions after all what is the difference between a whiteofficered army and a blackofficered one if both sets of officers owe allegiance to foreign interests in ghana it seems quite evident that army officers like afrifa steeped in british traditions and modes of thought as revealed partly in the above citation from his book were as much a liability for nkrumahs government as any actual whitefaced british officers would have been to suppose there was any advantage in substituting black officers for white regardless of the ideological orientation of those same black officers was quite illusory when we look at the civil service bureaucracy we are again struck by the prevalence here too of the colonial hangover as in the army and police as already suggested the civil service seems to have welcomed the armypolice coup warmly and to have proceeded to serve the new regime quite loyally how is it that these bureaucrats could switch political masters just as easily as women change fashions nkrumahs answer here is that the civil service had a tradition of serving whatever government was in power and that therefore they went along with the new regime p here again one feels this is only a very partial explanation after all the ghanaian civil service cannot have had any tradition of serving whatever government was in power it can only have had experience of two types of governmentthe colonial and the postindependence governments if the suggestion in the book is that the civil service even in the colonial era developed the tradition of serving any government the inference is quite wrong the colonial regime was one and the same throughout the colonial period no matter how frequent the turnover of british governors and top officials might be these were changes of personnel not of system it is therefore quite erroneous to say the civil service had a tradition of serving any government a more accurate judgement is the one nkrumah hints at when he observes many of the senior officials all originally served with the old colonial regime which had opposed trade unionism and socialism in any form and was against any real representation of the people in government behind the scenes the civil servants always looked back to the colonial times when their senior membersin practice ran the country p what emerges from the foregoing discussion is the existence in a country like ghana of several significant centers of powerarmy police and bureaucracyall of which were manned at the most vital sensitive levels by personnel whose political loyalties were at best equivocal nkrumah gives several illustrations of the unreliability of some of these top officials thus for example at one time he asked the attorney general to investigate a case of diamond smuggling it transpired that the linchpin in this operation was a certain white man who had some years previously been deported from ghana he had however been readmitted into the country after his deportation order had been revoked by police commissioner harlley see above harlley of course had no such authority by then he simply used nkrumahs name to revoke the deportation order without bothering to obtain the presidents permission the information relating to the deportee and his contacts with top officers of the ghanaian police force was passed by the attorney general on to the chief of the civil service so he could pass it on to the president the said chief however did not see it that way and the information never reached the president until much later though even then it did not reach him through the usual channels see pp it is clear that the army police and bureaucratic apparatus in ghana were fertile ground for intrigues and any foreigninspired attempts to subvert the government of the day with officers of such unreliability and doubtful loyalty any foreign interests intent on removing nkrumah from power would have a relatively easy time of doing it this possibility seems to have in fact been exploited by at least one foreign power let us quote the author himself in ghana the embassies of the united states britain and west germany were all implicated in the plot to overthrow my government it is alleged that u s ambassador franklin williams offered the traitors million dollars to carry out a coup detat afrifa harlley and kotoka were to get a large share of this if they would assassinate me at accra airport as i prepared to leave for hanoi i understand afrifa said i think i will fail and declined the offer so apparently did the others and who is this franklin williams who allegedly attempted to buy ghanaian army and police officers to kill their own president let us again allow the author to speak it is particularly disgraceful that it should have been an afroamerican ambassador who sold himself out to the imperialists and allowed himself to be used in this way it was this same man who deliberately lied when he publicly described the coup as bloodless however his treachery provides a sharp reminder of the insidious ways in which the enemies of africa can operate in the usa the uncle tom figure is well known p the lesson from all this is that those progressive african governments which would survive the strains and stresses of the present era in the world must keep constantly on the look out for the enemy from without and from within in these days of neocolonialism a foreign power bent on toppling the government of some small underdeveloped republic does not have to dispatch an army to accomplish the purpose all that is necessary is to find some reliable natives willing to act catspaw for a fee and to pay them accordingly the result can then be hailed from the rooftops as a great victory for democracy and freedom and the former leaders can then be denounced and maligned as if they never made any positive contribution to their country hence in ghana today nkrumahs contributions to ghanas achievement of independence to the economic development of his country to its educational and social advance and to the struggle for african liberation and unity etc all these tremendous contributions are deemed unworthy even of perfunctory mention by the partisans of the nlc instead all the praise is being heaped on the foreign business men who have been scouring the country in a desperate attempt to make a fat buck whilst the going is good the african revolution if it is to succeed at all will never do so on the basis of indiscriminate alliances and compromises between progressive forces and decadent proimperialist elements what is required is the establishment of a thoroughgoing revolutionary movement based on mass support and participation and resting on a politically reliable institutional base the revolution is made by the people it is for the people its survival and the realization of its objectives belong with the people its makers the objectives of the revolution cannot be attained through the agency of those whose sympathies lie elsewherepfumo dzvuku sam greenlee author of the novel the spook who sat by the door says that eight american publishers turned down his novel and that he finally had to take it to england to get it published it is easy to understand why the spook who sal by the door is perhaps the first black revolutionary novel to be published by a whiteowned commercial publishing firm either in america or england this is decidedly not to ignore the black commandos by juiian moreau a revolutionary novel which was privately published in now with mr greenlees novel out there in the world of books where it cannot be entirely overlooked there is a good chance that an american publisher will be persuaded to consideror reconsiderit and since nothing is more imitative than a commercial publisher perhaps attention will turn in turn to mr moreaus novel this however is an occasion for discussing mr greenlees novel in brief the novel concerns the adventures of one dan freeman a bright young man out of chicagos south side who travels the familiar route from grating poverty up to middleclass comfort via government employment mr freeman even achieves one of those firsts the black bourgeoisie is known to pursue with such passion and that in this case is the heart of the story dan freeman is selected as the first negro member of the central intelligence agency cia and he gets the chancethe coveted opportunity to sit by the door so that all the world knows that the cia is integrated but author greenlee has more things up his sleeve than the rise to eminence to one enterprising bourgie and satire is one of them his treatment of the machinations of dan freeman in the world of politics and power is light slick and hip seriousness nevertheless lies at the center of freemans adventures and at the core of the novel dan freeman is no ordinary bourgie he is one of a breed that is going to be the key to any real alteration of the oppressive american system he is an undercover revolutionary the bulk of the novel deals with what dan freeman does whento the astonishment of nearly everybody he resigns his prestigious government position and returns to chicago to do social work among the troublesome gangs in the city and it would be unfair to potential readers of the novel to tell what finally happens beyond the fact that the novels climax is a kind of watts turned upsidedown it is not unfair though to say that very little that happens is by chance dan freeman who was smart enough to grow up in the ghetto with a record clean enough to clear him for the cia is a young man of very special talents most of which are also possessedundevelopedby thousands of similarly bright young men on the street corners and in the poolrooms and dan freeman sets it as his special task to help develop those latent talents and to give them a new direction the first reaction to mr greenlees novel is applause here is a book which presents a black hero who is both angry and clever a combination which seems all too rare in the racial hustings but even more important the man is committed and he has translated his commitment into practical patterns of action designed to empower the black community in one area where power counts mr greenlees hero begins where the heroes of many black novels end with the knowledge that he lives in a racist society which gives no evidence at all of lifting the real barriers against black freedom and mobility he has faced that reality and made his own decision on the surface he has decidedas his counterparts are expected toto make the best of a bad situation and grab what comforts and advantages are made available to him he has it made with a playboy pad a sleek imported sports car lots of bunny broads and a sophistication garnered from traveling over the world and on the periphery of high places as a favored government employee but mr greenlees hero is cursed with honesty and a clear vision he knows that the life he seems to be living is an illusion and so he rejects it the other life is more dangerous of course but it is the only one he can live and still respect himself dan freeman then is an authentic black hero a revolutionary man andas suchhe is more than a little welcome upon the literary scene but while mr greenlees black hero is both timely and appropriate he does not breathe adequately as flesh and blood mr greenlee strives understandably to stress the superficially the phoniness of his heros personality when superficiality and phoniness are aspects of his cover and yet there are only occasions when the depth and complexity and ambiguity of dan freemans character emerge selfevident undeclared by the author a serious flaw of the novel is the absence of an object against which dan freemans humanity might be bounced he is too much purposeful too little warmth and yet some of this is possibly intended as a writer mr greenlee is swiftpaced and competent even when he dwells a bit too attentively on details of scene and gesture his style is quick and orderly the novel is brief and it is perhaps designed as an entertainment a book to be read first and savored for a long while afterwards the books hero is portrayed as a man of action sureminded and determined and that might be the characterization the author wanted to emphasize in any case the spook who sat by the door sets a publishing precedent it is about a black hero who goes systematically about the business of putting black_power to one of its more effective uses and that is revolutionaryh w fuller he began to feel the prickle of boredom running down his spine and not for the first time that day he thought how extraordinary it must be to be able to talk to a woman of his own kind in an intelligent fashion the black skin shone on his impassive face as he listened to the beat the ebb and flow of talk around him and what the lights glow on the so casually plunging necklines of the women in the room why he wondered was it that a woman of his own african race could walk calmly down the street with her breast swinging bare as she suckled her infant while white women like the fat blonde who sat next to him this evening with her breasts covered but only just demanded attention for her body he was well aware that he could have heror any woman in the room for that matterfor the taking he was not the only african to have belonged to this consciously leftist drearily bohemian group of white people the hit and run liberals others had told him a little about the group but knowledge killed desire and the white skin that should have fascinated repelled him the blonde was saying something to him now he listened i think these meetings of ours are wonderful dont you ncato the husky tone filled her plainest remark with a sexual meaning she was wearing a skirt made of patches of brightly colored material and a black blouse and as she leaned forward to talk to him the blouse fell open the neckline loose displaying the soft rolls of fat right down to her navel she was an improvement on the others he thought he liked her blunt use of his name without prefix or title or query yes he said his tone was flat they are interesting and all the time the false air of comradeship was about him stifling like a cloud of smoke the whites were too hearty the blacks too obsequious there was an unreality about it all she was flirting with him now rubbing her shoulder against him leaning towards him suggesting that she might give him a lift homeand to bedin the big green buick that belonged to her husband he rose to his feet suddenly and looked down at her forcing a smile thank you he said i will walk home i have a headache the cold air outside was like a bath after the stink of perfume and liquor and cigarettes and he came out into it with a deep sense of loss and loneliness education could cut a man like himself off from his own people the women of his race were still chattels to be bought and sold to work and to bear children if he wanted to marry a girl of his own color he would have to look for her in the states and according to all he had heard that didnt work out too well either the men of his race if they were educated became different enslaved with white mens ways and fashions white mens drink and women it is like the loneliness of frankenstein he thought there are no words for it but the sharp air of winter was like a creamy hand on the flesh of his face and as he climbed the hill to the native location the ghetto of the black people the moon shone through the short fir trees until they stood up like dark tufts against the horizon they are like african hair he told himself and suddenly with a great excitement he knew that he must paint them he switched on the light in the bare little room that served him as study and living quarters in oneand pulled out his box of oils and the thick pad of woven paper he always used because it was cheaper than proper canvas he worked swiftly his mind still seeing the queer dark tufts in the moonlight he used the stubs of his brushes to get the cotton wool effect of the trees it was well into the night before he was finished the exhilaration was with him still as he started to put away his things it was probably the best he had done yet he was so carried away by it that he scarcely heard the soft tap of fingers on his door it was the blonde what do you want he asked and then angered by the disturbance the intrusion on his privacy he said brutally do you want me to go to bed with you she flinched a little at that but she answered him evenly enough frank speech was always encouraged in the group no she said i was passing and saw your light still on it was a good five miles out of her direct route home then she caught sight of the picture which he had propped up against a jug on the table the better to look at it ncato that is pretty have you just finished it i didnt know that you painted he said nothing to that for part of him the greater part was artist and was predominant over the part of him that was african as an artist he liked to hear his work being praised even by this bitchblonde she could not take her eyes away from the painting it was as if she had transferred her desire for his body to his painting he saw behind the light greygreen eyes the avidity of her the animal need that was there he saw her wet pink lips i want that picture she said petulant now how much do you want for it what will you take it was late and a great weariness overtook him and the loneliness he looked at the picture memorizing it i do not want it he said in the flat expressionless voice that he normally used you may have it he placed it in her outstretched grasping hands mass education meant more in ghana villagers deep in the forests were under instructors cutting a way through the trees and undergrowth and building fewer roads to the main routes to the towns so that they could exchange their produce for previously unknown goods in the shops and link themselves with the social and cultural development which was sweeping the country they built halls and schools dug trenches for irrigation organized the collection of refuse thereby improving sanitation this was an extraordinary voluntary cooperation in personal progress and community betterment the youth was organized and known as the national workers brigade to perform community service the boys were apprenticed in masonry carpentry plumbing automobile fitting electrical engineering vehicle mechanics and tractor operations the girls learned the marketing of produce food preservation household duties secretarial and office duties they were sent to different camps for their training here was a nation recruiting its youth not principally in military forces but into a disciplined army devoted entirely to constructive community activity as an index of the national economic growth the gnp rose from million in to million in percentage increase was from percent annual growth to percent growth rate in something should be said about the man dr nkrumah the leader of the ghana movement his conception of socialism demands personal services in contrast with personal gain british and american newspaper reports have many times presented a different image the public in these two countries as well as in their satellite nations have been given the picture of a man who sought grandeur and ostentation when corruption invaded his ministers secretaries of departments he demanded that each of his ministers should reveal his income and possessions and how they were obtained the clue to the corrupt behaviors of his ministers was their construction of palatial mansions which they could not afford in their circumstances and salaries he on behalf of the government insisted that they should show examples to the nation that they should surrender all financial and business interests and live at reasonable standard ministers who did not conform were dismissed two among those dismissed were later reappointed partly in recognition of their past service to ghanaian freedom and partly because of their later adherence to principle their abilities and influence dr nkrumah believed in the complete freedom of all africans people of african descent and other peoples of the world equality and dignity of the human being was his first order in life one may question why the leaders of the opposition were arrested and detained for long periods without trial why the disturbances in ghana why the attempts to assassinate him the answers lie in understanding what african socialism means and what was the stage of alien political development in ghana inherited from the colonial administration dr nkrumahs government espoused socialism as an economic system in the context of african communalism which in no way is a prototype of european socialism de graft johnson made this clear when he wrote what our social structure which may be termed communalism cannot cope with is the modern world with its capitalist industries and our task here is to adapt the principles of socialism to our own particular mode of life alternately we can develop our basic traditional institutions in keeping with the basic principles of communalism to fit modern conditions i think we shall attempt both in african political systems there were never opposition parties per se people were active and participated fully in town and village discussions as a body gave their assent and registered their opposition to issues as they arose there was unity in diversity it was the paramount chief who acted as the voice of the people the socialism of africa differs from the european type european socialism was born of conflict the conflict that was sanctified into a philosophy the class war was looked upon not as something evil but as something necessary and good as prayer is to christianity or to islam so civil war class war is to european versions of socialisma means inseparable from the end each becomes the basis of a whole way of life the european socialist cannot think of his socialism without its fathercapitalism such a contradiction africans find intolerable it virtually says that without capitalism and the conflict which it creates within any society there can be no socialism african socialism did not arise from the agrarian revolution it did not start from the existence of conflicting classes in society it started as a family society its objective is the extended family africans have no more need to be converted to socialism than they have to be taught democracy europeans and other imperialists remain ignorant of the fact that socialism and democracy are rooted in the african past which produced contemporary africans these africans acknowledge that socialism must look to wider horizons for the extended family nyerete stated modern african socialism can no longer confine the idea of the social family within the limits of the tribe nor indeed of the nation for no true african socialist can look at a line drawn on a map and say the people on this side of that line are my brothers but these who happen to live on the other side of it have no claim on me every individual on this african continent is his brother the above also portrays nkrumahs socialism every african national leader had been engaged in the supreme need to build a sense of nationhood from diverse racial tribal and religious loyalties this has not been an easy task ghana had this problem particularly in the resistance of the ashanti and some northern peoples to incorporation in a united state it had to overcome the opposition of powerful chiefs regarded as the spiritual heads of communities as well as their political masters such chiefs are no more competent or capable of running the modern state nkrumah also inherited the bitter antagonism of the reactionary professional and business elite who he ousted as directors of the national movement the social disturbances were undoubtedly accented by conspiracies on the part of some of the opposition leaders who by all means were the paid agents of the british and the nato allies and the frustrated members of the cpp to overthrow the regime by assassinating president nkrumah some of those ghanaians who were definitely in the assassination plot which they attempted were apprehended and detained without trial their trial would have meant the death penalty and the pressure of public opinion would have made commutation of the sentence difficult the attacks on president nkrumahs life were misinterpreted by the western press as signs of unpopularity the facts prior to the coup point to a different direction the resistance of the ghanaian anglophiles the subversive activities of the local agents of the capitalist world the psychological poverty of arch tribalists and the unending quest to keep the black man down by the same ugly greedy and wicked imperialists account for the fall of nkrumahs government but not the man the coup on nkrumahs government february dealt a catastrophic blow to the african continent take a statistic of the black world and see the identical damage done to our brave leaderspatrice lumumba of the congo balewa of nigeria malcolm_x of the usa those living but ousted from office president nkrumah and president ben bella of algeria why this pattern the answer is very clear to all thinking peoples the fall of nkrumahs government is the fall of africa and africans his leadership was a pacesetter a guiding star and an inspirational one since the tragedy the continent has fallen into oblivion the portuguese in angola and mozambique the ian smiths and harold wilsons the nazi republic of south africa and their international cohorts are happy ghana and ghanaians are no more independent if we understand what freedom and independence means how can it be free when a major sector of the economy has been taken over by the foreign capitalists ghana is now starting on the path of having apartheid schools the london sunday telegraph of march writes the ghanaian staff of ashanti goldfields are incensed over the setting up of an allwhite primary school by the management and refusal to allow senior africans to form their staff association applications from ghanaian senior staff to enter their children in such schools have been rejected such a school never existed under nkrumah more than private schools with a fee of have been established this is a move to deny the children of any average worker the opportunity for education on the political front paramount chiefs as of february have been destooled by the military regime terrorism is now the order of the day the ghanaian times of february and published thus reports coming from ashanti give cause for serious concern in ashanti and the central regions and indeed in some other places in scattered areas of the country towns and villages in these areas of the country are being subjected to a wave of terrorism and dacoity unparalleled in the history of this country fear stalks the land in many homes there is not a wink of sleep for man or woman armed robbery is showing upward surge because of the lowebbing relations between the public and the police what an insult to human intelligence the militarycumpolice regime has abolished political party organization it has proclaimed that governing a country without any party or parties is the surest way to ensure democracy what an illusion what a contradiction on the economic front the ghana trade union congress which had pledged its support to the nlc is now begging for recognition which it had under nkrumahs government the u s capitalists have grabbed the ghana economy the firestone rubber company has taken over the stateoperated rubber plantations the u s international hotels corporation now controls all former state hotels advertisement for a managerial post for the nowcontrolled hotels stipulated quite clearly that ghanaian or african applicants will not be considered the economy is stagnating despite the assurance given by britain and the u s a that neocolonialism and capitalism will triumph in ghana as a payment for the criminal coup the british promised a loan of and the usa million finally the most outrageous act of the military regime is the sending away in ghanaian airways all the nationalist refugees from angola mozambique southern rhodesia south west africa and the republic of south africa back to their respective places of origin their military and police escorts handed them over to the imperialist authorities for their final destruction such is the situation the democracy and newlywon freedom for the ghanaians and africa the direct causes of the imperialists attack on nkrumah before the independence of ghana the currency authority was the west african currency board established in by executive decree of the colonial office with headquarters in london the wacb was nothing other than a local agent the control of the commercial banks was under the wacb the monetary policy adopted was at the whims and caprices of the wacb and principally at the dictation of london on march three days before ghana became independent the central bank of ghana was established it thus became the sole bank of issue the banker to the government and other commercial banks the fiscal agent of the government in dealing with important international financial institutions eg the international monetary fund and the world bank it also operated for the government in exchange control as the sole bank of issue it had the power to influence the credit situation with a view to maintaining monetary stability in ghana and the external value of the ghana pound the cbg originated a local money market by issuing on behalf of the government day treasury bills this enabled the ghanaians to invest their money domestically it also curtailed the volume of funds transferred out of ghana to britain such transfers were of a high magnitude prior to the establishment of the central bank the central bank created an atmosphere which encouraged the establishment of indigenous owned and operated commercial banks and also the expansion of branches of the older ones between march and november branch banks increased from to this was the breaking of the monopoly position of the british barclays bank dominion colonial and overseas ltd and bank of west africa ltd since the monopoly position was threatened the foreign owners mounted a series of attacks on the nkrumah government we can see how sincere the british position is free competition in britain and monopoly in africa in line with the goal for relative economic independence a reduction in the high shipping costs of ghanian exports the ghana national shipping line was established after formerly all exports from and imports to ghana had been carried by the british shipping firms the profits from such services accrued to britain the prohibitive shipping charges reduced the profit margin that could have gone to ghana passenger service provided by the shipping firms was controlled by the british with the establishment of the ghana black star line national shipping line the charges on exports and passenger services were reduced to reasonable levels the profits became a source of revenue to be used in financing other economic development projects as well as in expanding the shipping lines a third case of monopoly is the air lines colonial ghana had no national airways the air transport was owned operated and controlled by the british overseas airways corporationair france and panamerican air lines with independence and the establishment of the ghana airways corporation the monopoly position of the british was demolished more revenue was thereby secured for ghana the purchase of some aircraft from the soviet union instead of the more costly ones manufactured by the nato countries contributed to the animosity directed at nkrumahs government the african continent had been described as the sleeping giant dr nkrumah called the african allafrican peoples conference in this conference brought political leaders trade unionists nationalists and others from different works of life together for a common endeavourthe complete liberation of the continent from foreign domination nkrumah had declared in his independence message of march that he would not consider ghana free and independent as long as any portion of the african soil remained under foreign control ghana provided free transportation for revolutionary refugees from the racialist nightmare of angola mozambique southern rhodesia south west africa and the republic of south africa it also aided guinea when it elected to be her own boss and to chart her own destiny rather than remain in the french community and be a province of france imagine such an anarchronism part of the african continent a portion of france making black africans frenchmen this destroys the work of nature the colonial nato countries jubilantly anticipated the collapse of guinea when france pulled out taking with it everything including paperclips and toilet tissue before the african continent had been balkanized brothers and sisters husbands and wives and even tribes were arbitrarily and forcibly separated by the unnatural political boundaries drawn by the greedy europeans today some problems that confront african countries are the offshoots of the unnatural boundaries to overcome such unending division nkrumah by political action and marriage involved the whole of north africa in the united and collective effort of breaking down the artificial disgraceful wall that had separated the african land mass and its peoples finally nkrumah with the cooperation of the late w e b du bois and george padmore initiated the dialogue on the possibility of publishing encyclopedia africana for the purpose of placing african historical cultural and social achievements of antiquity in proper perspective for all these reasons the nato powers mounted their attack on this great african one thing is clear to the patriotic african in fledgling states imperialists interest flourish where there is an atmosphere of dissension they are endangered in an atmosphere of national unity and stability some people have accused the government of having too much power over the national economy i have to remind those people that under colonial administration the little postal telegraphic and rail communications broadcasting electricity and water services that existed were all publicly owned and administered nobody domestically or internationally raised a cry of woe but as soon as the ghanaians under nkrumahs direction added an airline a shipping line a central bank loud echoes of dictatorship started to roar in the firmament since then ghana has met with active resistance from vested interest groups within and without in the effort to build a national economy jules ferry premier of france in when he spoke in the chamber of deputies in defence of the colonial policy of the french government stated thus it is not clear that the great states of modern europe the moment their industrial power is founded are confronted with an immense and difficult problem which is the basis of industrial life the very condition of existencethe question of markets have you not seen the great industrial nations one by one arrive at a colonial policy and we can say that this colonial policy is a luxury for modern nations not at all gentlemen this policy is for all of us a necessity like the market itself today as you know the law of supply and demand freedom of exchange the influence of speculations all these move in a circle which extends to the ends of the world colonies are for rich countries one of the most lucrative methods of investigating capital i say that france which is glutted with capital and which has exported considerable quantities has an interest in looking at this side of the colonial question it is the same question as that of outlets for our manufacture the same situation applies to the motives of neocolonialists and imperialists albert sarraut french colonial secretary of state in spoke in stronger terms in paris what is the use of painting the truth at the start colonization was not an act of civilization nor was it a desire to civilize it was an act of force motivated by interests an episode in the vital competition which from man to man from group to group has gone on ever increasing the people who set out to seize colonies in distant lands were thinking primarily of themselves and were working for their own profits and conquering for their own power the origin of colonization is nothing else than enterprise of individual interests a onesided and egotistical imposition of the strong upon the weak you can see who really thinks of nkrumah as a dictator is it the true african no no it is the neocolonialists and their lackeys in ghana and the rest of africa the coup was effected by the imperialists lackeys in ghana in concert with thier international neocolonialist powers whatever might have happened nkrumahs philosophy remains indestructible and will be fostered in africa and in ghana as long as this planet earth exists the sixties was for v rt v black americans a ii decade of spiritual ins quiry and of emotion a j discovery jhe three most important discoveries might be summarized in the following slogans black is beautiful the third world the american dream is a nightmare none of these slogans constitutes a new finding indeed they represent on the intellectual level rediscovery since an attentive read ing of the molders of black thought in this century will find their clear enunciation in marcus garvey w e b du bois and a philip randolph like all slogans which substitute generality for the elusiveness of the particular insight of the pertinent analysis these acquire in the wake of mindless iteration the shadow of ambiguity and the possibility of confusion a slogan is not a pro gram and lung power is not brain power nevertheless the consciousness of self indicated by these slogans is a necessary first step in the selfrealization of black americans a reahzation only possible when the question of identity has been answered black people in america are a people at once of and apart from the abstraction america this complex situation is the imperative with which all black analysis and all black movement must begin neither the simplistics of integration nor of separatism represents mature responses to this reality in this light our slogans when interpreted in a simplistic manner simply serve to keep the brothers in the wilderness black is beautiful it is also ugly it is ugly when a leader of one of the baddest bands of blacks sips tea with a few woollyheaded whites at a white university and tells them that the students of the black college across town are all uncle toms the third world exists but it no more represents unity or virtue or the affirmation of man than the first or the second do japans investments in south africa betoken afroasian unity does the warfare in which black ibo and black hausa fall at each others throats represent black virtue is the stride cretinism of chinas cultural revolution morally superior to russian imperialism in czechoslovakia or to us murder in viet nam finally who are the denizens of the nightmare are those who buy avidly the insolent chariots of detroit and the most expensive products of the shoemakers art exclusively white are those who in search of identity create a new cosmetics industry really abandoning the merchant mentality of the good old american way in favor of a new black bit a great deal of clarity is needed if the selfconsciousness of the sixties is to become the selfrealization of the seventies selfconsciousness must become a tool in the analysis of the world if it is to become a weapon in changing it at present the newly gained selfconsciousness is being squandered in signifying and putting down white folks bourgeois negroes uncle toms and everybody who does not agree with younamehim when time is not being used in this fashion it is being used to devise time and energyconsuming cults in which neoand pseudoafrican costumes are expected to slap the man in the face is he slapped who is slapped most of all i deplore those activists passivists who can profess no knowledge of the past but who go right on discussing it judging it reviling it a good case can be made for ignoring the past while building the future i am not the one to make such a case but the irony is that those who seem to want to do so cant they are paralyzed by a verbalizing virus which keeps them exorcising the demons whose meaning they deny here indeed is the challenge of the seventies to break the enervating cycle of ritual and rhetoric and replace it by the propulsion of rigor and reason to conserve the energy now expended and exhausted in fulsome denunciation and utilize it in the construction of institutions and modalities arising from the consciousness of self beyond this plane of industry lies the prospect of selfrealization itself a commencement not a conclusion hat lies ahead w f for black americans is precisely what happed t them alm st years ago when the reconstruction came to an end the gains made during this second reconstruction were negligible and they were made under liberal administrations those of kennedy and johnson during the first reconstruction a multitude of laws were passed but were not enforced the same thing is happening now this nixon administration is a repressive one and black people know it therefore unless the repression and oppression become unbearable think black people will cool it until nixon and his bosses ruin the nation then move once again under liberal administrations everywhere we look we see racism the tone set by the nixon administration being blatantly practiced there can be no doubt about it we see it in the officials elected by the citizens of various cities see it in the police behavior we sec it in the workers in the churches in the armed forces yea it pours like vermin from the woodwork black people everywhere are in trouble nonwhite people everywhere are in trouble and i think the major task of black art is to defineate the political and social situation because it is the most important one survival depends on it ours and theirs hs black people we are presently faced j with the most critical jkand s phisticated de cisions concerning our colonial status to become thoroughly americans assimilation to separate in some manner withdraw or to seize total control of america revolution within each of these three general goals there are complexities and contradictions that we still must struggle with we are not struggling with them now since the advent of the national anti poverty programs and white americas sophisticated dying vampirecultures cooptation of soul and danshikis et alindeed since whitefolk have been allowed once againto be intricately immersed within our ideological struggles from pantherism commitemism to doyourownthingism rugged individualism updated with soul many of our brothers and sisters have been busted and have their asses over political hummers brothers and sisters weve got w to stop and check ourselves out where are we going nowhere but were doin it with soul and thats all that counts what do we want as a people as a nation we really are not sure are we a people a nation we really are not sure if we were a people a nation the least we would do would be honest with ourselves and each other check out our brothers and sisters from the socalled cultural nationalists to the panthers afraid of black criticism readv to blow you away if you dont support them or if you criticize them check out the poverticians and movement hustlers hovering around cutting up folk for the best position to receive the piddling chumpchange they say they are robbing and fooling the man for we militantly confront the man so that we can cooly negotiate for a piece of the rancid pie our militant intellectuals our militant activists our militant politicians still have much allegiance to and fear ofwhite america check it out our students struggle for black studies courses and more black students at white colleges for the sake of becoming better americansnot for the sake of aiding in the seizing of control in america there are militantand often violentconfrontations with the cracker for brothers and sisters to join the racistcapitalist unions for the sake of becoming better americansnot for the sake of revealing the racistcapitalist contradictions around the role of black workers we have returned to integrationist meetings and rallies primarily because the mediaprojected black_panther party is working from a white radical preworld war ii marxistleninist ideological frameworkrather than deal with the history of consistent white radical racism and copouts from the arrogant crusades through toussaint louverture gabriel prosser w e b du bois albizu campos george padmore kwame nkrumah to today in essence our present movement is passionately caught up in the moral political and cultural decadence and perversion of white america deep in many of our brothers and sisters hearts there is the heated desire to be president of the u s president of the imperialist ford foundation to be a rich gov rockefeller with soul to produce and act in a soulful am curious type flick have we forgotten our historical destiny fear not the number and education of our enemies against whom we shall have to contend for our lawful right let no man of us budge one step and let slaveholders come to beat us from our country america is more our country than it is the whites we have enriched it i with our blood and tears so said good brother david walk er in and yes after years we have almost forgotten being bedazzled by the trinkets and brothels of a white nation suffering from general paresis if we do not take up brother walkers call today what will lie ahead for blackfolk will be psychedelic slavery the ultimate in peaceful suffering the ultimate in white bestiality our race would be reduced to moonfolk excavating resources for whites if we move to separate our act of separating may satisfy some of our psychological needs but separatism does not destroy white racism or white capitalism and it certainly cannot destroy white imperialism we must and will fight for national control and independence from america as heroically and spiritually as our vietnamese brothers and sisters as our puerto rican brothers and sisters our mozambiquen azanian and nambibian brothers as well of our panamerican and third world brothers and sisters because we are the part of the panafrican race most strategically placed within the belly and brain of the white beast because we are the most technologically advarceo of our race because we indeed did and do enrich this country with our blood and tears and because we have a moral and spiritual commitment to our slave ancestors and to our indian brothers and sisters who heroically defended their nations against arrogant bestiality because of these things and because of our panafrican and third world brothers and sisters strugling against white racism and imperialism we must we will let no man of us budge one step and let slaveholders come to beat us from our country s e anderson ed bullins sc jrtfche test of fire and rita steel lies ahead for ii black people presivsl dent richard m nixon shows it more each day cutting off welfare and social benefits slowing of the economy antiinflation to whites niggerdeflation to blacks continual wars advocacy of compulsary birth control lies doubletalk tricknology and fascism the blackman will be forced to survive or will perish at first the desperateness of his situation will cause him to react in suicidal manners such as killing his brothers in feuds organizational coups community purges and other types of madness fostered by blackskinned men who have white minds those blackmen who come together in brotherhood and black love may survive but only the most together will only those that strive to be black and righteous will all that can be done now is to create to build or organize to defend to expand to plan and go forward into the future in unity black america is the key to black liberation africa is the lock ready to be sprung we must free all the africansourselves in america and of course those in the motherland ed bullins need systems of v r t all kinds that are rer yy i sponsible to black s people one brother j i who is otherwise very together said he was going to a white publisher to get his book published his explanation was that the publisher could effectively distribute the book what the brother preferred not to see was that a black writer whose book goes through a white distribution system will find that his thoughts are going to whites first and foremost for that is what the distributor is aiming at white money in addition to that the white publisher is editing for a white public the book may have been written for black people but it will end up edited for the white public meanwhile the white man is the intermediary he allows us to speak to each brother by way of him i do not think i have to explain the dangers in that we are just going to have to build our own publishing and distributing systems as best we can values ethics will lead us into program and that is where values should take us around the wisdom of black people brought us to the intuitive state of rip it down rip their institutions down around and on the wisdom of black people proposed the additional idea of alternative institutions or systemslanguage dress economics religion education community control what became known as black_power not a new idea but a renewed idea when the cry for black_power went out the first thing the man did was to throw some black spokesmen in front of cameras asking them to define black_power allowing them to speak through him i forget those definitions i know to me and many others black_power meant independent spiritualeconomicpoliticalcultural power for us black people one thing the man noticed was that the spokesmen differedemphasized different areas like politics economics or culture concepts united in the phrase black_power but the man deliberately projected those differences as confusion and since then the result has been actual confusion the reasons for the confusion are not simple but one of the main reasons was our lack of a value system andor ideology philosophy or system of thought if you prefer no system of basic concepts truths historical examplesrationalizedwhich would allow us to analyze with clarity act with full confidence toward a goal or goals have one more point to make we may be the only people in the history of the world who so wholeheartedly send our children to the enemys schools to be instructed then we wonder why we have an historical discontinuity why the children hate their elders why they hate themselves the emphasis here is on children coming back against black parents that in several ways meansleads to selfdoubt lack of confidence in ourselves and in each other ultimately we will have to develop an ideology for only from an ideology can a substantial lasting value system come lack of actual ideology was why for example some of garveys followers fell for naacpism integration marxistleninsm capitalism as soon as garvey was dead some of his top people fell those various ways lack of ideology was not the only problem but it was a central one until we come up with an ideologyworldview if you prefer we wont stand much of a chance against the ideologies of the west the three cs capitalism christianity communism marxistleninism these are the alternatives we have been given the roads we have been allowed to travel we have to have the nerve we have to ask ourselves after the fighting and bloodshed what then marxistleninism freud einstein j p morgan will the master still be master of our minds even in his death if he is master of our minds how different will our fates be how different our leadership how different our world we have to ask ourselves that now figuratively speaking the first half of the twentieth century was that period when the black americans were rehearsing for a show that they never put on the road the promise of freedom dignity and citizenship was dangled before us like carrots before a rabbit until we realized that the promise was a lie and that we did not like carrots anyway out of this realization the demand for black_power and black history was born the circumstance produced what i call the black and beautiful age thats where we are now and what lies ahead for us will depend on how we move out of this age to another one that will be the real test of our ability to handle the power that we have been demanding before we can move to our next stage of development and responsibility we will have to ask ourselves some hard questions and we will have to answer them honestly if the next stage of our history is nation building do we know how to hold a nation together we are collectively black and beautiful but does this fact help us to know what makes an airplane fly or how to cure a stomach ache what lies ahead of us will be determined by how well we take an inventory of ourselves and how we react to our findings in this kind of world being black and beautiful means very little unless you are also black and powerful tij will come in the rii form of notes ideas ii and nonideas passing hrou h me like time passes through the year month the world personal notes will be personal keeping in mind that im a black man first then poet reflections in hour thoughts which both kept me awake and forced me to sleep my new found ability to sleep four to five hours a night indicated a new maturity a short preface ive traveled from coast to coast and halfway around the world which means that ive been able to communicate mainly listened with brothers and sisters from san jose california to the university of new york from sir george williams university montreal canada to toogaloo college mississippi from luther college docora iowa to the university of algiers algeria north africa from those points and many smallerlarger points in between i traveled deliberately to give and receive positivenegative messages lets view together from a poets bridge leadership is not as we knew i i it the concept of leadership has to be redefined keeping in mind he who controls the image controls the action i find very little difference between all the news thats fit to print and the worlds greatest newspaper the two papers mentioned and others are only moderate examples of that which is wrong with this country and im sure if confronted none of them would acknowledge that neither truth nor the positive in terest of black folks is a part of their makeup americas image makers developers of myths and the destroyers of weaker men crazy is what they called malcolm_x stokley carmichael and rap brown crazy was their assessment of w e b du bois and paul robeson crazy is the adjective used to describe marcus garvey kwame nkrumah ameer baraka leroi jones etc crazy is crazy only when black people move in an uncrazy way to confront the real craziness of the world actually crazy is crazy only as the crazy canwill define it the new leadership is us each one of us we as a body of one will have to reflect that which should bethat which is necessary too often weve assigned roles to our leaders we must now assign these roles to ourselves we must become the malcolms du boises and nkrumahs of tomorrowdo not ask of others what you are not willing to givedo yourself reflect that which is necessary what it means is are we serious and what are we willing to sacrifice our children are watching us and we must not become the new pimps of tomorrow tomorrow is tomorrow if we want one tomorrow is tomorrow if we canwill define it to define and legitimize our own existence is the basis of a continuous existence europe may be a myth but it would be very difficult to prove that it is congress is one of the most corrupt institutions in the na tion but these are just words if no one believes it this white boy may be a sissy a punk and very unhip but he is also undeniably the worldrunner europeans define what europe is those there and those here members of congress define what corruption is those that are and those that are the white boy may be the adjectives indicated above but obviously that doesnt interfere with his running of the world our movement is to awaken the consciousness of blackness of ourselves the closed societies naacp sclc sncc the black_panthers all black fraternities and sororities core and anymost socalled black organizations that are moving to liberate us we are black men and black women human beings we cannotmust not be forced to become something unnatural such as organizational robots each organization mentioned above demands of its members that they reflect that organization and not necessarily black people in order to become a part one has to meet certain prerequisites such as become less blacker become more blacker do not wear a tie wear a tie seek integration seek segregation change yrname do not change yrname seek black culture demean black culture read only this read only that being political not political enough power comes out of here power comes out of there wear yrhair this way wear yrhair that way quote this brother quote that brother get high dont get high formal education self education wear a suit wear dashikis bare arms dont bear arms etc etc the new class division one group of negroes saying that other negroes are not relevant and blacks saying that afroamericans are not relevant and vice versa weve created such divisions among ourselves that our personalities change as television programs do this year its in next its out our actions move as the group does im not advocating a return to strict individualism which in itself is just as harmful but a movement toward combining all efforts which allow and encourage constructive criticism and constructive actions how can one black person blackball another we must move from ego satisfying pettiness and superficial idealism to the real world its popular individualgroups to say that they are going to use the man mainly for their own limitedpersonal goals but if we become products of the realworld well begin to understand that its very difficult to usemake use of the man that uses the world unless one is equipped to do thatand division is not part of that equipment it requires all our talents and most of all it demands of each of us the willingness to listen learn act and grow a man with an ethic a history and spiritual guidance is the beginning of a people with an ethic a history and meaningful spirituality ive often come across black people who wander throughout the world thinking they are a modem day meursaultraskolnikov or frederick henry and have never heard of bigger thomas harry ames or tucker caliban you reflect whatwhere you are if a brother moves throughout the world quoting camus or dostoievsky understand thats where hes at if he digs rubinstein and janis joplin thats where he is to move people from that point its necessary we must do it without alienating them its not to impress one with ones knowledge but with ones actions the values which we believe in cannot necessarily be taughtbut may have to be demonstrated if the ethic history and spiritual life you advocate is important be it your being it will be the most effective attractionor distraction this is the age of power the powerage the vietnam disaster could not exist if the majority of white people in the unitedstatesofamerica did not want it to exist the united nations would not be as ineffective as it is if this country didnt want it that way brothers malcolm_x and martin_luther_king jr would be alive if we could have backed up their words how does one bring down a monster without becoming one if you see a blackman walking around with a perpetual smile on his face its not because hes happy the basis of power is land land is the only hing that nobody nowhere is making any more of we can buy these bell bottoms next year if they are still in style but that mustang next yearbut land is going actionfast and that white boy is hip to it for hes all over the world taking it future of the j negro in america is inextricably tied to the future of america i j there is no country at the present time that offers the promise and the hope for our people as does this nation america then must solve her remaining problems by the use of her ideologies so well expressed in the declaration of independence and in our federal constitution the remaining vestige of the social evils of racial prejudice discrimination and separatism must be abandoned and the doors of opportunity must be opened widely to all americans so that they may seize every opportunity and assume every responsibility for making this nation a great just free and democratic fellowship american negroes must now do more than seek their rights they must also work to preserve the rights that are now available and to take their responsibility with other citizens in the economic cultural moral and spiritual growth of the nation with the ballot now given the future for the negro in politics is greater if the negro himself will accept the fact of a biracial culture and work in it and through it to gain further rights and to make further contributions with the scientific age upon us negroes must do all within their power to develop skills and to become as strong intellectually as any other groups so that their ability will render them essential and worthy workmen in the ongoing culture of this nation if the negro divorces himself from his nation and from responsibility as a citizen and resorts to exploits of destruction and bitterness he shall move from the heights already attained to lower valleys of privation servitude and despair the future of the american negro is with the nation but also with himself d only knows what lies ahead for black americans and as we review the events of recent monthsthe obvious failure of thepoverty program the spurious efforts toward black capitalism americas refusal to reorder its value system increased activity of black snipers renewed efforts at minority repression and the not often publicized schism ranks of black leadersnot be blamed for wondering if even god in all his infinite wisdom knows if anything is to point toward new directions for black americans it will be the budding unity which seems to be welding blacks together local coalitions and black united fronts are forming across the land this should inevitably lead to the creation of a national union of blacks made tenacious and invulnerable by the sweet smell of economic and political victories in neighborhoods communities and cities yet there is a warning which must be made as black leaders pitch the rhetoric of promise to the clamoring throngs for in the past the white man has craftily raised the expectations of black folk knowing that the fulfillment was certain to lag behind today however these rising expectations are largely due to the new black instrumentations which are producing a symphony of hope scored with notes of selfdetermination black nationalism black pride and revolution if fulfillment does not catch up to expectations this time the brothers fury will be unpredictable because his own leaders will have been the ones who dangled the succulent but evasive fruits of freedom what lies ahead for black americans depends as much upon the black individual as upon the black leader and it depends upon the quality of the efforts of both today we talk black we talk tough and we talk revolution rhetoric can substitute for revolution if we see revolution as the movement of a body in an orbit or circle with all the black talk one must wonder if we are indeed in orbit caught in a frustrating circle going nowhere but revolution is also a complete and drastic change and this is the revolution which black americans must not talk but experience america which has been the land of the living dead for black people will never know the revolution about which so many are talking until resurrection comes to the black man individually and in total the movement has reached its most crucial stage rising expectations are near the summit as dr martin_luther_king jr saw the promised land black americans j are beginning to catch sight of the dream black leaders are providing the glimpse and if the movement gets locked in orbit if the freedom train cannot pull away from the circular track utter despair will shroud black america and the dream may always be a reverie the ultimate success of the movement is not in the hands of those we choose to make our leaders for no matter how great their talents they cannot lead if the multitude will not follow our leaders sometimes march at cross purposes leaving the multitude bewildered not sure which way to head the black masses must rise person by personfrom the american graveyard and declare their godgiven freedom this cannot be accomplished from the halls ol congress nor from the white house the freedom to be a man cannot be bestowed by any leader white or black living or dead from them

black a tom or supernegro digest november tom the complainant was a doctor at an interracially attended symposium he got the laugh he also got the explanation he was unable to request he is not a laughable figure for he represents the confusion of the numerical majority of negro america an indiscriminate component which includes the elite the middleclass and the poor who view black as suspect and threatening to the known quality of their daily existence if the sixties have had any positive affect it may be that the turmoil has forced a black minority to examine its premises clarify its definitions and reevaluate directions from this kind of individual and group introspection a certain commonality of thought has emerged and there are explanations we can say we move toward the trauma of the seventies with clarity in certain respects our methodologies may be disparate and our goals variedbut collectively we do know what black is and what it exacts the path to revolution is the only future course left for black people there is no other alternative that has not been tried repeatedly in an exhaustive search to save the humanity of those most inhumane but the forgiving quality of our african traditions must now be suspended we must commit ourselves to the task of constructing a new world a world of men not beasts a world where love is what time it is and people have evolved beyond hate the ofay has sinned against god we are gods righteous warriors and must rise as gods ourselves the black revolution must burn the earth rid of the white boys curse so that love can reign and we can become who we were really meant to be our immediate future must will be based on the following two processes the resolution of our identity crisis black becomes the positive reflection of ourselves versus the alien whites and when we really rebel and become our true african selves we will then have started acting out our true role in the postamerican future of the world and in order to sustain and reinforce this new identity new cultural forms will emerge utilizing myth ritual symbol and values but the cultural solution to the identity crisis is necessary but not sufficient black people must move toward a common analysis of the world a political analysis there can be no revolution without a common political analysis our analysis must be scientific not poetic based on the entire world scene and not one local or national situation and provide a concrete alternative for the future rather than a vague vision of mythical tomorrow we now find ourselves in the preliminary stages of developing in these two ways culturally and politically however to over develop either independent of the other is to deny the possibility of total revolution total black revolution involves both requiring a unification of the cultural and the political what can we expect j flnrr from the seventies of course these times move too fast and too strangely to predict the future history like nature has this strange habit of creating mutations as the african in the americas is a mutation of history itself and therein lies our destiny i will chance to suggest trends that i deduce from the sixties we can expect greater military preparation on the pigs part and frequent violent conflicts with them we can expect new subtle forms of cooptation of articulate black people the communication and education industries are already moving in this direction i expect black studies especially on white campuses to turn into a monster in the s think that in we will find dozens of colleges turning out hundreds of blacktalking bourgies with phds in malcolm_x and john coltrane what a horror revolutionary institutions like malcolm_x university in durham will prove to be the relevant education centers community control of public school education will continue to be a national issue coalition politics with white people will prove for the umpteenth time to be a very dead end large numbers of black individuals particularly men will continue to intermarry and so define themselves out of the struggle there will be a further decline of large national organizations and an increase in the number of local programs designed to meet the specific needs of a given community it will be the unified efforts by these local programs acting in concert that will produce the synthesis that we need to move to a revolutionary stage this will produce a dilterent kind of leader one with little national charisma but with a functional local constituency there will be a radical revival of interest in local politics as black and white people struggle for control of municipal governments panafricanism around the writings and speeches of osagyefo nkrumah and malcolm will be the dominant ideology black people will think of something to do that no one black or white ever had the slightest no am certain tion that they would do of this i nz jahn in the j nr appendix of his book ii neoafrican literature a history f black writing stated that as of january there existed no magazine in the united states concerned exclusively with africanamerican literature the statement is rather remarkable when we consider that soulbook black dialogue and the journal of black poetry were all publishing by then the statement thus submerges a whole literary movement the emergence of these journals and others similar to them was the literary enactment of the crisis of the sixties the break with the west through them black literature reorganizes itself serving the cause of blackness by analyzing its suppression and recreating its images and its myths their role is thus revolutionary and since the building of a black national consciousness is conceived of as urgent by those who write in the revolutionary journal it must be accomplished on many levels the immediate outer realities call for a reporting of the facts of oppression for a mobilization of forces for sociopolitical analysis the soul within and the fragmented community require an imagemaking mythbuilding symbolization of that reality political activism and poetry can thus complement each other it is not the subject matter which distinguishes sociopolitical literature from esthetic literature here the subject matter is really always the same black survival through identity and strength but the fiction or poetry of survival is rendered through imagery through symbols through experimentation with different rhythms with different syntactical forms with a different vocabulary through the indirectness of its statement about our condition the revolutionary journals thus attest to an allinclusive view of the black experience and it would be a mistake to pass them by in the vain search for evidences of the literary expression of a people neatly fractured off from life as is too often the case in old tired societies with nothing left to fight for it would be a misreading of the times all the journals with which we are concerned have certain things in common in addition to their double development political and literary all of them show a noncommercial orientation they have operated on limited funds and a missed edition has not been infrequent they are distributed principally through black dealers and by subscriotion they thus are written by black people for black people and it is rare that a white writer appears in their pages as did ted vincent in soulbook with manv editorial reservations and a letter to the editor of black dialogue from a rather pompous white reader of the first issue states in part i cannot find one word in this black dialogue which comes from one of you to me one of us the advertising is limited to black bookstores black publishing companies the other black journals except the first two issues of black dialogue had some advertising from radical white groups the editorial boards tend to have overlapping membership a number of the poets and writers publish in all of the journals most of them do not publish in white journals or anthologies we can isolate the following aspects as typical of the literature appearing in these journals the black community of brothers those who share our condition and with whom we work for the common liberation may be perceived as national western hemispheric international or the community may be perceived as bandungthe whole of the nonwhite world the existing black culture may be glorified in a conscious effort to build a sense of identity from the immediate past or it may be rejected as the heirloom of slavery and a new or modified cultural image projected which incorporates bandung elements andor draws on the prewestern past a gap may exist particularly in the early phases between the political and the esthetic consciousness ie one writer may single out certain aspects of reality as having immediate relevance in practical life yet another may be symbolically working through other aspects in his art similarly either the sociopolitical or the artisticliterary thrust may have greater emphasis or there may be a shift in emphasis there is a sustained mythbuilding process which creates new gods and renovates the universe and which provides the black community with black or bandung heroes or restores those heroes to it which white society has sullied and submerged behind negative terms and concepts among the revolutionary journals several types can be isolated those which have local contributorship and readership and deal with local issues those produced on college campuses by black student organizations those which have or are seeking wide representation and wide readership in the black community it is impossible to discuss all the journals here i could list perhaps thirty some of which are now defunct which to my knowledge have appeared in the past four years or so and which share all the characteristics listed above however soulbook black dialogue and the journal of black poetry are the most important ones in terms of age and consistency of publication circulation and how wellknown the contributors are through these three we can analyze some of the developments which characterize the genre as a whole black dialogue provides a good study in the growth and development of the revolutionary journal the first issue resulted from efforts by a group of san francisco state college students much of this first issue is local in tone but succeeding issues come more and more to reflect black america generally the editorial board expands at present the board has regional representatives from new york headquarters san franciscowest coast the midwest southern united states africa in terms of content black dialogue has come to include art forms particularly graphic other than literary there are issues in which political writing dominates winter in which political and artistic content is almost equally divided julyaugust and the latest issue spring contains no political articles although political concerns are evident in other ways eg the fullpage announcement dont let them destroy harlem stop the state building with an illustration showing angry blacks pelting a corralled grinning lindsay and cohorts this is by no means the essential criterion by which to judge the magazines maturity the growing evenness of tone which was not there in the first issues is a surer indication the political articles of the first issue show an acute awareness of the international character of black literary expression and of the right of a society of people to nonannihilation ie nonabsorption by the west and to nationhood whether that society is african or africanamerican but the intellectual analysis has not yet been internalized and the fiction and poetry show us still to be in the painful break with white society still tormenting ourselves with the moribund integrationist experience the literature shows us still on the lonely quest which preludes the discovery of peoplehood as a lived experience this attitude is replacedyou can see the process from issue to issueby a sense of group purpose by a growth a hope a conscious creation the personal poems now acquire an archtypal sense which the earlier ones lack the poet is not a black man he is the black mannegative images of black society tend now to have behind them a missionary message we know the trickery that exiles us and still we dance ed spriggs autumn black images are now projected on the cosmos as we now begin to perceive ourselves as universal beings our souls are open skies and childrenzooming across green places larry neal autumn soulbook more militant than black dialogue it is the quarterly journal of revolutionary afroamerica and more consistent in tone and format appeared shortly before black dialogue and also on the west coast berkeley racist usa soulbook publishes a proportionately large amount of political analysis but its short stories and poetry are an important part of its format frantz fanon on the political front aime cesaire on the cultural are frequently featured written about and translated articles and communiques keep us posted on liberation movements everywhere soulbook thus embraces as brothers all the bandung world we black people realize that we have something in common with the majority of the worlds peoples we are all nonwhite and we are all oppressed by white cedric little soulbook the theme of throwing off the shackles and the call to arms of the revolutionary writings is transmuted in the poetry into various motifs and that of castration is one of the most prevalent by ritual reinactment of the death of virility the poet gives himself andor his audience a chance to be reborn into manhood black soldier marched home hung up his balls patricia bullins soulbook when deranged vipers sliced through your black genitals my body was one huge bleeding ball k willy kgositsile soulbook black bourgeois man he got no nuts left one in desk drawer wife got other one in pouch tween her legs bobb hamilton soulbook the journal of black poetry unlike black dialogue or soulbook is mainly concerned with one phase of literature but the journal also expresses activist concerns within its literary format and yet maintains a consistent tone and approach to do this it relies heavily on pictorial expression the center spread for instance of the fall issue shows an outline map of the united states cut into two jagged halves one half of the map bears part of a photograph of young black men behind bars the caption directly over them reads usa and above that the label others in the other half of the map black hands clasp each other in brotherhood and above the heads of a family unit black man woman and child a raised black arm clasps a rifle the caption above reads afroamerica and above that selfrule also the journal often includes essays which in discussing black art or culture look inevitably to the political aspects when black people talk about black consciousness or power they are speaking indirectly of nationalismwhether cultural political or economic we are cultural slaves dig it victims of what bro harold cruse calls cultural imperialism askia muhammad toure rolland snellings spring black culture and black survival are after all one and the same thing if we compare chronologically the issues of all three journals we discover that the literature which glorifies the subculture works in dialect works which describe the black woman in very sensual terms works which accept or glorify cohabitation occur most clearly in the earlier issues of soulbook and of black dialogue and that the embracing of african and eastern symbols and images some experimentation with the forms within these cultures is most clearly illustrated in later issues of the journal of black poetry clearly there is a widening of the potentials here for a renovated literature and a forsaking of chauvinism as too confining in the work of the poets to give us back our heroes and to provide us with new ones two types of black men are always sung jazz and blues musicians otis redding ornette coleman charlie parker and above all john coltrane and political activists chaka nat turner marcus garvey patrice lumumba and more than any man any time anywhere malcolm photographs and drawings of malcolm as well as poetry abound in these journals of course poetry about malcolm is not confined to those writing in the journals so much of it exists that it has been anthologized for malcolm poems on the life and death of malcolm_x broadside press it is a sign of malcolms growing status as the source at which to renew our faith in our destiny that his example is invoked in a black dialogue editorial to help two groups within the black community see the way clear to settling their differences his actions in life have become symbolic of the destiny of african americans the statements and comments made by brother leroi represent a step eastwards in african american culture that was prophesied by the epic journeys of el hajj malik el shabazz malcolm_x to mother africa the holy city mecca and the middle east askia muhammad toure journal of black poetry fall the choice of adjective epic is indicative malcolm is the epic hero of our struggle of our journey toward a new consciousness toward a new nation his significance far more than historical is mythological these three journals with which we have dealt did not exist more than five years ago yet their writers and thinkers many ot whom are now in their thirties existed long before then as writers and thinkers somewhere in the black communities the journals emerged to fill the need for that meeting place for members of the black community wherever that community may exist to quote black dialogue through these journals and the many others which have sprung up since current black literature is being grouped and diffused digested and in a sense even created the revolutionary black journal made its appearance at that moment in our history somewhere in the midsixties when black people began to forsake civil_rights and integration and began to seek out a sense of self they exist as one manifestation of that intense looking inward to see what we really wanted the direction and developing quality of black literature can be but imper fectly seen if these journals are ignored the revolutionary black journals attest to a growth toward nationhood in an everexpanding harmony with the nonwhite universe they are an important index of the measure and meaning of the sixtiescarolyn gerald he s have seen us move from nonviolent protest and hopes of integration to selfdefense violence black pride and hopes of black_power our movement has been swift we have suffered losses but we have made gains however feel we are not in a period of flux a time of indecisiona time of double trouble our leaders have either been coopted into the system are in exile in jail or have just plain copped out stokely is in africa but moving in a very positive direction huey is in jail eldridge is in exile rap is under house arrest the brothers are fighting each other on the west coast and in the process have lost the people infighting continues on the east coast malcolm is dead and nathan wright has integrated so throughout black america we see sad spectacles such as these gang warfare between black militant groups a group of black college students in detroit donating a statue of a black madonna sculptured by a white artist and donated to a white college black studies programs turning into agencies for spying on black people the crime rate among blacks continuing to soar a black female vocalist on tv supposedly promoting black pride but sporting a blond afro wig black nationalists in harlem losing valuable time protesting to whites about a state office building for what we have always had to struggle for our survival in this land are we so fat now that we can relax or drop our guard i think not but unfortunately far too many of our people are doing just this we are not developing and expanding black philosophy white culture continues to preoccupy much of our thinking and doing every white fad that comes along we pick up too many of our people are hooked on the beatles mod squad and white rock festivals we are not preparing ourselves for economic depression or recession the only farms we have are those run by elijah muhammad and a few determined black southern farmers remember all that money we spent on the poor peoples campaign in washington with that kind of cash we could have purchased two counties in alabama or michigan white economists are preparing now for a serious economic slowdown while we prepare for revolution with old obsolete rifles owning a few farms to feed our people is not the whole answer of course other things are needed we need to explore realistic self defense for survival we need to establish economic and diplomatic relations with black people in africa and latin america we need to further define and expand black culture black history is wide open for more study research and writing we must stop the systematic education genocide of black children i think part of our problem is our evaluation of the situation here too many of our militant brothers are convinced the philosophy and or tactics of che guevera marx engels or mao can be applied to our problem here when our thinking moves in this vein we are easy prey for the white radicals who tell us that the problem here is a class struggle and as soon as black and white workers overthrow the white capitalistic power structure well all march hand and hand to a class less integrated promised land damned lie the problem in america is racism oppressive white racism against black people whites may be socialists but they still tend to be racists check cuba since the revolution garvey warned us to beware of white radicals he called them greeks bearing gifts if we cant trust white radicals then it follows we cant trust the white power structure our only alternative is to turn to ourselves i know its hard for many of us to do this its so easy to hook up with whites they have a lot of money and a lot of expertise but they also have a long history of tricking black people i just finished reading where one of our leaders is advocating that black people support the peace movement ridiculous unless you want to spend another ten years marching with the enemy nobody wants peace anymore than black people for weve been at war for over years but joining with whites for anything is a waste of time history has proven that as soon as the crisis is over its open season on black people and our so called white friends are nowhere to be found here are some examples paul robesonwhen the going got tough he was deserted by his white radical friends world i war i and iiunprecedented lilynchings of black people followed each war reconstruction after the civil warall the white liberals and radicals were in full bloom it i seemed for awhile that real liberty equality and power were coming to black people but the northern republicans liberals and radicals at that time sold out to the southern whites in order to get dixie support for rutherford b hayes for president of the united states the klan began to ride black officeholders were killed or kicked out of office and the wholesale murder of black people reared its ugly head again we were not prepared to protect ourselves because we had depended on our socalled white friends for our protection they deserted us then and theyll do it today only black people are the salvation of black people there are no ifs ands and buts about it we must turn to ourselves for our own survival and liberation wish my black activist brothers could understand this simple rule read the philosophy and opinions of marcus garvey its all there we live in a racist society that never has and never will care anything about black people that might be a hard pill to swallow but its the whole truth let us begin to forge real black unity we must stop begging someone else to do for us what we should be doing for ourselves we must learn to sacrifice to build and to fight effectively margaret walker sums it up beautifully in the closing lines of her poem for my people in the united states and in africa the caribbean islands and in other parts of the world where people of african descent are numerous the s was a period when we discarded one set of illusions and took on another inasmuch as the seeds of conflict and achievement that are planted in one decade are harvested in another the s can only be understood when looked at from the vantage point of the s this is where our present day illusions began in in the case of henderson vs the united states the supreme court ended diningcar segregation on railroads by requiring them to permit negroes to occupy any empty seat in the diner instead of being confined to a partitioned section this decision was based on the interstate commerce act the justice department joined the plaintiff in this case in the same year president trumans committee on equality of treatment and opportunity in the armed forces reported that black americans were still barred from of specializations in the army despite announced policy to the contrary gwendolyn brooks became the first afroamerican to win a pulitzer prize in poetry for her collection of poems annie allen another fresh writing talent emerged in the presence of william demby whose novel beetle creek see page was a literary success and he was hailed as one of the new writers of promise in the following year in the case of mckissick vs carmichael the university of north carolina law school was opened to negroes by court order in the political campaigns of all political parties from republican to socialist had statements in their platforms declaring their abhorrence of discrimination and pledging assistance to the black voters of this country we had the illusion that we were entering a decade of great promise then other things awakened us to a reality the white citizens council became active as a reaction to the supreme court decision outlawing segregation in the schools in the s reached a ceremonial climax before it was well under way in the presence of the historical march on washington on reflection this event that was supposed to be the monumental turning point in the fight for jobs citizenship and dignity for black americans turned out to be one of the greatest picnics in history in my opinion it accomplished absolutely nothing the march on washington was really a march in washington the power structure let black americans and their white allies indulge themselves but did not yield one iota of the power that man needs to make himself free for a while after the lethargy that followed the march on washington set in the attention of black americans turned toward africa where nations were becoming free almost by the week the africans were indulging in illusions too soon the international colonial power structure started destroying the leaders of these countries through assassinations and coups as fast as they came to power yet the great personalities continued to emerge both in africa and the united states one of the most spectacular to emerge from the black proletariat was malcolm_x as the s drew to a close the decade might be called the period of our great illusions and our naivete we frightened white people with something called black_power but they didnt stay frightened very long before they began to either destroy the black_power apparatus or to buy its leaders looking back on the s and the beautiful hopefulness of a civil_rights movement that was born and died before our eyes i think it is that decade of the black mans beautiful dreaming before awakening to a new reality that reality is that freedom is a hardwon thingt is not left by one generation to and all important lesson in the the other freedom is a thing that s the decade has been his each generation must take and se master teacher and some of his cure with its own hands if the longawaited maturity has emerged black man has learned this simple from itjohn henrik clarke the two groups of peopl e for whom the black_power movei ment was a matter of life and death were the white liberals and the wouldbe black bourgeoisie james baldwin for all we may come to think of him was the one who jammed the white liberal in a corner and made him choke in his guilt and leroi jones continued it in the early part of the sixties the liberal didnt know where the hell to go in reality his conception of black people was worse than most of us would think he really didnt know the black american and in most cases thought him basically a free spontaneous noble savage the liberal when he came to think about the paucity of black revoltsthere was not really a paucity of them was ashamed of blacks in fact before the black_power movement few whites felt any pride in the achievements of blacks consequently the black_power movement brought black pride and identity not so much to ghetto blacks as it did to white liberals who now can feel proud of their blacks feel proud of the fact that blacks finally are accepting themselves finally creating a black culture finally becoming aware of the white mans pernicious politics for the white the black was invented with black_power before that there were only slaves stupid selfhating niggers who wanted to be white what a weird view of history the wouldbe black bourgeoisie was in the same position as the white he couldnt jump off into the black bourgeoisie because that had been blown he couldnt go back into the ghetto because thats not the american way of life and so he jumped off into what the mass media and the present government termed black_power naturals are beautifuland there were some beautiful black sisters before them too my mother was onebut i suspect the people who were starving before the inception of the black is beautiful craze are probably dead by now what i am suggesting is that one must be very careful with the media for the simple reason that it always does the reverse of what it pretends to do in its attempt to inform the public it only succeeds in providing content for itself the media in other words a televised account of a police attack on the black_panthers becomes finally the content for the newsit becomes television but of course if the show is viewed by another black_panther he will say if someone asks him what he is i watching i am watching this brother talk about the pig which is real if most viewers would respond thusly the image would be a ii true image of reality it would be true protest and not merely a mirror reflection the media is counterrevolutionarythat is it is against destroying itself hence against destroying the white viewer whom it pacifiesbecause the moment protest is introduced into the media it ceases being protest and become the news a new tv show about spooks etc it is true that the media is one way of getting recognized but the error in this is that most people confuse the presentation of a problem with the solution to the problem the impact of eldridge cleaver in society obscures for many the fact that thousands of black men are in prison because of the injustice of white society television has come to belong to nixon and the white liberals who argue that the problem is not racism but class the latest technique is to have blacks on television yes but to have them putting each other down on screen one evening i watched four shows where there were blacks putting down blacks there is the black cop who puts down the black criminal they had james earl jones saying things like man if racism is your bag youre a drag the black employer puts down the black employeethe assumption being that blacks are racists against themselves if you want to understand the media check this out leslie uggams show she is always kissing white boys and talking sex with them enough to make you puke is the whitest show on the air right and sly and the family stone who are maybe the blackest thing going appear on leslie uggams show why because when it comes to media there is only media it is not simply a matter of saying that black actors will do anything for a part or that a performer will appear on anybodys show for the money like the fifth dimension can be seen on the woody allen show right alongside billy graham its all media although it certainly looks that way but rather they are into a thing which cuts across other categories like politics race sex etc the sixties should have shown us the way the media works against the black man that is the industrialized black man and the seventies should reveal the wavs the media j orientated black man will deal with that in the seventies i suspect black criticism will be keener than it has been in the past will be keen enough for example to detect that the media itself is racist literacy is a technique of the media which has always worked against black people when the white man discovered africa he called the whole continent illiteratethat is pagan voodoo deserving of slavery etc but how could africa be illiterate when it didnt have a literate tradition the white man made the black slave believe he was a slave because he was illiterate and how could the slave defend himself unless in fact he was literate when however the slave did become literate literacy is also christian moral whiteness he became bonded in a way he had never been before he was bonded to white culture and the only way he could free or even explain that bond was to become whiter or rather more literate when the slave learned to read for the first time he experienced the modern white mans sense of guilt and alienation for he felt cut off from his own experiences here is the confession of a slave pennington which is supported by the confessions of other slaves like frederick douglass vassa booker t washington after he learned to read i was made to feel that whatever else i might do i was not qualified to do that as i have myself alienated from himgodby wicked words was deeply convicted of the guilt of my own sins against god the black writer today must be aware of the influence of literacy on his art he must be aware of all the sideaffects of this medium car insurance c v owning a car is usu ally a necessity espe dally in areas where public transportation is inadequate and people have to travel long distances to get to work the high prices and declining quality of care the rising cost ol repairs and maintenance are painful enough the cost of financing cars is a great burden especially when the owner has to pay out large sums for car insurance while he is paying for the car sometimes paying interest on the insurance as well in the black community flybynight insurance companies which often go bankrupt leaving their clients holding the bag in case of an accident prey upon their victims by charging astronomical rates there are families of working people who pay a thousand dollars a year just for car insurance to cite once more my own experience when i lived in detroit the only liability insurance could get involved paying a year and signing a contract to renew the policy at the same rate for additional years when i moved to ann arbor i got the same coverage with a reliable company for i worked for many years in negligence law offices dealing mostly with auto accident cases worked in plaintiffs work defense work and for the defense office of a large insurance company and my conclusion is that car insurance is a fantastic racket which milks the policyholders and the victims of accidents for the sake of the insurance companies the doctors and the lawyers engaged in the business it is estimated incidentally that half the income of the lawyers in this country comes from accident cases here is the problem no one can collect damages no matter how great their injuries unless they can prove that the other party was wholly at fault for the accident and the injured party did not contribute in any way to the accident a vast field for litigation is created and many people with serious damages are not compensated because they cannot prove that the other party was entirely at fault furthermore insurance companies will settle claims for minor injuries just to avoid the expense of defending them but in cases of serious injury no expense is spared in defense the case is dragged out to force the victim to settle for less than the case is worth and the more serious the injury is the less likely is the compensation to be adequate then if the victim finally collects about onethird goes to his lawyer another big chunk to the doctors who testify for him charging witness fees in addition to fees for treatment then there are the defense doctors many of them with highsounding titles and qualifications who havent practiced medicine in years since they find it more lucrative to spend their time testifying in court for insurance companies the obvious solution is an insurance commission which would collect a reasonable fixed sum with each car license with which to compensate victims of auto accidents for personal injury and property damage regardless of who is to blame for the accident extreme cases of negligence or recklessness would be a criminal not a civil matter this solution would afford much better protection to the public at lower cost and eliminate the race tax on car insurance guaranteed annual wage or negative income tax this simple and reasonable substitute for the welfare system would eliminate the cost of maintaining a bureaucratic structure manned bv social worko ers who play a largely negative and destructive role in the black community concretely i have in mind the complaint of an adc mother that investigators from the welfare department had broken down her door trying to catch her sleeping with her husband tax appropriations we need to proclaim a new equality equality of public services it is grossly inequitable to allow the congregation of wealthy families into communities where they provide themselves and each other with lush funds for schools hospitals parks and recreation sanitation and every conceivable public service leaving those trapped in the cities to suffer with only a fraction of the funds per capita which is spent in the suburbs the principle should be established on a statewide if not a nationwide basis that tax funds for municipal services be allocated to each community on a per capita basis dismantling and decentraliza tion of municipal government once equitable funds have been provided municipal functions should be localh controlled on the basis of small community units breaking up the purposefully blind corrupt and irresponsible bureaucracies of our large cities police and municipal courts jails and juvenile homes education health sanitation housing inspection the licensing of businesses parks and recreation would come under the control of the local community with officials elected locally and directly responsible to the community inmates of jails and juvenile homes should be transferred to the control of the communities from which they come all jail sentences pronounced in the past should be reviewed by the new community courts capital punishment should be ended as a largely black mans punishment municipal employment and business ownership andor management would be by people residing in the community stores which overcharge customers or sell poorer quality or smaller selection of merchandise than in suburban branches would have their licenses revoked the community could hire comparison shoppers from among local housewives to visit suburban food chain stores and compare price and quality the drug traffic i will conclude with what i believe to be the most vital question that is the illegal drug traffic it is obvious that those who profit most from the drug traffic have little to fear from the police and the courts which are supposed to be protecting the publie hardearned dollars are poured on a grand scale from black pockets into the coffers of the underworld it is hard to overestimate the extent of drug addiction in the black community official estimates are ludicrous i have a friend who was brought up on w th street in harlem of all the boys who grew up on his block he is the only one who is not either dead in jail or a street addict the situation in michigan is not much if at all better the fact that the medical establishment in michigan suffers from selective blindness does not change the real world out there the illegal drug traffic is an extraordinarily ruthless efficient exploitative mechanism fueled mainly by heroin a desperate need for drugs is created and a corrupting structure pervades the community sale of drugs is one important means of supporting a habit pressure is immense to create new addicts to serve as customers spreading the structure into ever widening circles thus a pecking order is established in which survival depends upon ruthless exploitation of the next man or woman and at the outer fringe of the expanding pyramid are those who live by theft and prostitution victimized by the police a mass of highly motivated criminals is created street slaves lie hardearned dollars are poured on a grand scale from black pockets into the coffers of the underworld it is hard to overestimate the extent of drug addiction in the black community official estifor the organized underworld which collects au leaving the street addicts half starved and half naked avidly recruiting new victims in order to take some of the pressure off their own backs endless tribute is paid by the families of addicts who try to keep them alive and off the street many addicts work sometimes holding down two jobs in an effort to support their habits without resorting to crime as a historian of afroamerican slavery i cannot resist the temptation to compare the relatively crude means by which slaves were forced into theft and prostitution with the much vaster more efficient more impersonal means employed in our cities today in the cities of the spanish empire theft and prostitution were carried out thinly disguised as slaves working for themselves in return for bringing back a certain amount of money each day to the master a spanish law in forbade masters from sending their female slaves or free black women out in the street to sell things and if they do not bring back the profits which the masters suppose they should they send them out at night to whatever torpor and dishonesty leads them another spanish law of makes the situation even clearer we have been told of the harsh punishments which some masters inflict upon their slaves even for making small mistakes with the scandalous abuse of sending black and mulatto women out to earn a daily sum most of them going out in public nude causing a great scandal and committing many mortal sins in order to bring to their masters the money they require in brazil travellers were shocked by the large numbers of respectable brazilian ladies who lived off the immoral earnings of their female slaves male street slaves were engaged largely in theft clearly the system is more efficient now the masters do not own any particular slave who they had to pay a lot of money for so they dont care whether an individual slave lives or dies they dont need to punish their slaves they have the police the courts and the jails for that and if these are not enough they have the national guard and the army in fact they never see their slaves the only time they notice them is when they threaten the social order then the masters deplore violence rioting and crime in the streets no one even slightly familiar with how openly the drug traffic is carried on in the black community can doubt that it is thoroughly protected but there is an aspect of the protection afforded by the institutions of our society to the drug traffic which is less familiar that is the intimidation of the medical profession by federal narcotics agents who dont seem to worry about the drug traffic out in the streets so much as that maybe a medical doctor will have enough professional selfrespect to treat an addict i approached several doctors about treating addicts and their response was very enlightening one said theyll investigate my income tax another an eminent member of a state commission dealing with alcoholism and narcotics addiction said he knew nothing about addicts had never seen one and panicked at the suggestion that perhaps the experience would be enlightening another more humane and courageous doctor explained that he had treated an addict and received a visit from federal narcotics agents who scrupulously examine the prescriptions handled in drug stores they asked the doctor why he was treating this man the doctor insisted upon his right to do so thereafter a pharmacist who filled his prescriptions reported to him that federal narcotics agents had been around asking if he thought that the doctor was a drug addict at a highly respectable ritual held at the university of michigan last january attended a panel on medical aspects of drug addiction i asked the members of the panel from the floor why doctors are so afraid to treat addicts a psvehiatrist who practices in detroit answered that the problem no longer exists since the american medical association had accepted new guidelines allowing physicians to treat addicts thereupon i took out a pencil and paper and asked for the name of a doctor in detroit who would treat addicts he said to write to him and he would send me a list i wrote he never answered our society treats addicts worse than lepers were treated during the middle ages they are ostracized like lepers but unlike lepers they are refused medical treatment i talked to a man in new york who told me he was refused admission to four different hospitals when he was suffering from acute serum hepatitis because he had needle tracks on his arms whatever socalled treatment available until very recent years has been a monopoly of the psychiatric establishment which now has a big stake in its obviouslv false theories o of addiction but patients are a necessary evil if you want to get grants and so the psychiatric establishment clings desperatelv to its besieged positions essentially they blame the victimthe usual pastime in our societyby denying the physiological basis for addiction claiming that addicts choose to use drugs and can choose to give them up elaborate and very expensive hospitals and detention centers are set up sadistic group therapy sessions are indulged in to cure the socalled addictive personality the victims are supposed to beg the psychiatric establishment long and hard for treatment to prove how motivated they are thats supposed to be therapeutic and when the treatment fails the doctors blame the patients and change the patients instead of the treatment there is a very effective medical treatment for heroin addiction it is safe very inexpensive and widely applicable so far this treatment has been made available to relatively few addicts not for medical reasons but because only a few private doctors have begun to treat addicts the treatment involves substituting methadone taken once a day orally for heroin methadone is a synthetic narcotic it allows the addict to function normally it is not debilitating like heroin the dosage does not have to be escalated it does not produce euphoria it simply represses withdrawal symptoms and drug craving it costs about cents a day the treatment was developed by dr marie nyswander a psychiatrist and dr vincent dole a biochemist a husband and wife team at rockefeller university in new york dr nvswander after many years attempting to treat addicts at the united states public health hospital in lexington kentucky concluded that psychiatry was irrelevant to the problem and that heroin addiction is basicallv a metabolic disease there are nearly patients in the program which is now supported by the state and city of new york dr nyswander found that the socalled addictive personality disappears when the drug cravings are satisfied and concludes that heroin addiction is not psychogenic but results when drugs are made available to large numbers of adolescents normal adolescent curiosity would prompt experimentation and physiological predisposition would make addiction inevitable for many of these youngsters the black community has had to face the problem of availability of drugs for many years the problem is somewhat more recent in middle class white communities although there are methadone programs in a number of states there is no such program in michigan i am interested in contacting people especially medical doctors who are willing to initiate treatment either in their private practice or through an institutional framework it is often said that street addicts are very hard to get to know ive found that on the contrary its easy all you have to do is treat them like they are human this is such a unique experience for them that they are shocked into a trusting relationship it may sound strange but my faith in humanity was restored by getting to know street addicts who live by theft and prostitution in spite of the frightful degradation of their lives their desperation their helplessness they go on living maintain a wide margin of decency and a great deal of compassion for each other when i ask myself if i believe that i could survive physically or morally under those conditions my answer is no when i was studying the methadone program in new york i talked to and listened to the conversations of several patients on the program some of them had started methadone maintenance treatment in jail they were speculating about why there was a twoyear waiting list to get methadone treatment one patient said they cant open it up to everyone because if they did seven out of the eight floors at the tombs a large prison in new york would be empty and the wardens would lose their jobs i believe that this profound insightful statement says more than all the thousands and thousands of words in the riot commission report a year after the great detroit uprising we see one new building going up on the skyline of detroit it is an extension to the jail the only other major construction projects noticeable are more expressways to get out of town on and so beyond all the rhetoric it is obvious what the power structure has faith in not a word is required just look at the detroit skyline and during the merciful silence perhaps a few people will have enough courage to perceive our nation the way it really is and enough love for and faith in our nation to try to change it dr kwame nkrumah the first african leader to win independence for his people in our time has written a new book handbook of revolutionary warfare international paperback like everything written by nkrumah ever since the declaration to the colonial peoples adopted by the panafrican congress held in england this book is a call to colonial peoples to unite themselves for the struggle against imperialism and colonialism this latest publication is particularly significant however because it represents the reflections and projections of an african leader who having ruled an independent african state the nation of ghana for nine years was then deposed by a combination of internal and external neocolonialist forces kwame nkrumah has felt the harshest blows that the imoerialist enemy can deal but these have only made him more determined to fight this fact itself gives us an insight into the revolutionary spirit of the man a spirit which is continually reinforced by his scientific analvsis of the period in which we live nkrumah is always mindful that we are living in a period of worldwide revolution and counterrevolution and that revolution is not a matter of a single day or a single battle but entails a long struggle in the course of which setbacks and retreats are inevitable it is this tenacitv of spirit and consciousness of worldwide revolution and counterrevolution backed up by continuing scientific evaluation of the movement which distinguishes such great revolutionary geniuses of our period as mao tse tung fidel castro and ho chi minh from the moment that nkrumah became president of independent ghana in march he made clear that independence for ghana was only the beginning african nationalism had now been established in the gold coastthe new ghana he wrote in his autobiography published on the eve of his inauguration from now on it must be panafrican nationalism our task is not done and our own safety is not assured until the last vestiges of colonialism have been swept from africa in the declaration of fundamental principles adopted by the new nation ghana explicitly offered to surrender its hardwon sovereignity in order to further the development of a union of african states in april only one year after the celebration of independence nkrumah called together an allafrican conference of independent african states to pledge themselves to the eradication of colonialism on the continent freedom fighters from all over africa among them patrice lumumba found in ghana the political organizational and material resources to fortify them for liberation struggles in every african colony from south africa to algeria and from kenya to the congo when the french imperialists retaliated against guinea for its decision to leave the french union by destroying everything and anything from railroad ties to light bulbs that the guinea people might be able to use to develop their country nkrumah responded by sending millions of dollars in aid and ghana and the republic of guinea united to form the nucleus for a union of african states thus in action and not just in words kwame nkrumah in power dedicated all the resources he could muster to the cause of panafrican unity and the continental struggle against colonialism no wonder therefore that to this day the leaders of such progressive african nations as guinea tanzania and zambia refuse to recognize the counterrevolutionary military regime which now claims to rule in ghana the recent political history of africa can be divided into two main phases which obi b egbuna president of the universal coloured peoples association the british black_power organization has called bg and ag meaning before the emergence of ghana and after the emergence of ghana respectively frightened by the specter of ghana independence the british french and belgian imperialists devised a new strategy of giving political independence to other african nations after a period of negotiation to ensure their continued dependence upon the mother country as a result in the s dozens of other african nations have celebrated their independence each enjoying all the trappings of sovereignty in the form of black presidents black parliaments black judges and black policemen but in most cases as the handbook makes clear this independence is only a sham independence since economic power remains in the hands of international finance capital and each nation is too small to be much more than a supply depot to these international corporations legally and politically these nations have sovereignty and independence but in fact they are dependent neocolonialism has taken the place of naked colonialism all over africa these independent nations continue to struggle on each one separately in a pathetic and hopeless attempt to make progress while the real obstacle to their development imperalism mainly in its neocolonialist stage is operating on a panafrican scale before the african people can defeat neocolonialism they must rid their minds of the geopolitical map of africa which the imperialists drew up at the berlin conference of in place of this map with its little red green blue and yellow pieces each representing a sphere of influence carved out by the various imperialist powers for their own purposes african freedom fighters must substitute a new panafrican map based on the conception of the armed struggle which is now necessary to liberate the entire continent of africa on this liberation map there are only three kinds of territories liberated areas contested areas and enemyheld areas liberated areas are those which having achieved some political independence through the mobilization of the masses make themselves into a base or beachhead for advancing the liberation of other areas which are contested or under enemy control contested areas are those ruled by weak puppet governments and where the revolutionary forces are wellorganized and so close to seizing power that the government is only superficially in command enemvheld areas are those like south africa where the police state nkrumah stresses the need to clarify the goals of the revolution the nationalist phase is a necessary step in the liberation struggle but must never be regarded as the final solution to the problem raised by the economic and political exploitation of our peoples he points out the danger of unity for the sake of unity in fact the oau organization of african unity is in danger of developing into a useful cover for the continued sterile action of conflicting interests the only difference being that in the context of one big brotherly organization reactionary tactics are camouflaged and applied through all the subtleties of negotiation he calls for a political party linking all liberated territories and struggling parties under a common ideology he insists on the equality of women women may join the training centers on the same basis as men and be eligible for the same responsibilities and authority in this period when the black movement in the united states is searching for clarity and direction it can derive inspiration and guidance from an african leader who at every stage of his political development has made public the principles by which he has guided his actions james boggs undoubtedly one of the most dramatic events to occur within the last few years has been the emergence of the black_panther party as a moving force within american society the black_panther party as is generally known was founded in oakland in by huey p newton and bobby seale the oakland panthers derived their name from the black_panther party that was organized in lowndes county alabama by the students nonviolent coordinating committee sncc the purpose of the sncccreated black_panther party was to challenge the legitimacy of the racist political structure in lowndes county this was to be the first programmatic expression of the ideal of black_power as defined by sncc using the black_panther party as its vehicle sncc confined itself to educating and organizing the disenfranchised blacks in lowndes to the importance of the vote in the local primary election in sncc unsuccessfully ran an entire slate of black candidates in opposition to the democratic partys lilywhte slate of candidates obviously influenced by these developments newton and seale felt that a similar operation was needed in the urban ghettos of the north the major distinction however was that they saw the need to organize black people around the issues of selfdefense and police brutality rather the vote as a result the black_panthers have now progressed to the place where they emphasize a total workers revolution in america rather than the simple acquisition of group political power in limited area where blacks happen to be in the ma jority as the panthers view it it i no longer a question of reforming th democratic or republican party or of creating a few more jobs in the major corporations for qualified blacks but of completely liberating black people from the racist oppression and economic exploitation ink herent in the american system this light it was only a matter of time before the inevitable revealing in side expose of the panthers was written gene marine senior editor of ramparts magazine has undertaken this task in his work plainly titled the black_panthers bantam marine has sought to capture in print the flavor of the panthers cataclysmic impact on the contemporary american scene marine somewhat apologetically reminds the reader in the beginning of the book that he is a white man seeking along with the rest of white america to learn just what makes these young outspoken black jacketed young black men and women tick as marine puts it i try to be sympathetic to anything i want to understand and write about but the more i work on the subject the more i know that sympathy is not my primary feeling deep in my white possibly racist probably unrevolutionary heart i am afraid of the black_panther party it is fairly certain that the black_panthers will not provide these readers who think of themselves as politically aware with any new facts or insights into the workings of the panthers marine though does present a systematic and concise recount of the panthers past activities the author step by step details the important events in which the panthers have been involved he also gives a wellbalanced look at the personalities involved such as newton seale and eldridge cleaver who the general public has come to intimately associate with the panthers marine however while honestly trying to state the panther case has not attempted to probe at any depth the ideological currents that have produced an organization like the panthers he also does not adequately discuss such questions as what are the historical precedents for the establishment of such a group what are the implications of revolutionary black nationalism as opposed to black cultural nationalism what are the main theoretical distinctions between the panthers and other supposedly militant groups such as core and the nation of islam do the panthers genuinely represent the feelings of the black masses in addition to these questions there are of course many other aspects to the panthers that marine has neglected to touch upon marine as the typical groping white radical cannot really be blamed for any of the books shortcomings in these areas he is white it is difficult if not impossible for a white man any white man no matter how sympathetic to the black struggle or how radical he may profess to be to really understand the complex aspirations of black america the problem for the white writer is doubly compounded when one adds to this scheme the ingredient of a black group that talks and acts as if it hates every value and institution in american society the problem here is even more confused when one considers the myriad of lies and distortions that the racistcontrolled mass media has foisted on the american public about the panthers not to mention those other groups that are demanding basic changes in the american social order little by little though the word is slowly getting out to the masses of people that they too are being victimized by a corrupt and repressive system the black_panthers if nothing else is a positive contribution to those forces that are trying to clear the obstacles blocking the path to black liberation for this reason alone i recommend for those trying to grasp the meaning of present day events that the black_panthers be checked out for as cleaver has warned if youre not part of the solution youre part of the problem earl ofari when i think of the w home town of my youth all that i seem to remember is dust the brown crumbly dust of late summerarid sterile dust that gets into the eyes and makes them water gets into the throat and between the toes of bare brown feet i dont know why i should remember only the dust surely there must have been lush green lawns and paved streets under leafy shade trees somewhere in town but memory is an abstract paintingit does not present things as they are but rather as they feel and so when i think of that time and that place i remember only the dry september of the dirt roads and grassless yards of the shantytown where i lived and one other thing i remember another incongruency of memorya brilliant splash of sunny yellow against the dustmiss lotties marigolds whenever the memory of those marigolds flashes across my mind a strange nostalgia comes with it and remains long after the picture has faded i feel again the chaotic emotions of adolescence illusive as smoke yet as real as the potted geranium before me now joy and rage and wild animal gladness and shame become tangled together in the multicolored skein of goingon as i recall that devastating moment when i was suddenly more woman than child years ago in miss lotties yard i think of those marigolds at the strangest times i remember them vividly now as i desperately pass away the time waiting for you who will not come i suppose that futile waiting was the sorrowful background music of our impoverished little community when i was young the depression that gripped the nation was no new thing to us for the black workers of rural maryland had always been depressed i dont know what it was that we were waiting for certainly not for the prosperity that was just around the corner for those were white folks words which we never believed nor did we wait for hard work and thrift to pay off in shining success as the american dream promised for we knew better than that too perhaps we waited for a miracle amorphous in concept but necessary if one were to have the grit to rise before dawn each day and labor in the white mans vineyard until after dark or to wander about in the september dust offering ones sweat in return for some meager share of bread but god was chary with miracles in those davs and so we waitedand waited we children of course were only vaguely aware of the extent of our poverty having no radios few newspapers and no magazines we were somewhat unaware of the world outside our community nowadays we would be called culturally deprived and people would write books and hold conferences about us in those days everybody we knew was just as hungry and illclad as we were poverty was the cage in which we all were trapped and our hatred of it was still the vague undirected restlessness of the zoobred flamingo who knows that nature created him to fly free as think of those days i feel most poignantly the tagend of summer the bright dry times when we began to have a sense of shortening days and the imminence of the cold by the time i was my brother joey and i were the only children left at our house the older ones having left home for early marriage or the lure of the city and the two babies having been sent to relatives who might care for them better than we joey was three years younger than i and a boy and therefore vastly inferior each morning our mother and father trudged wearily down the dirt road and around the bend she to her domestic job he to his daily unsuccessful quest for work after our few chores around the tumbledown shanty joey and i were free to run wild in the sun with other children similarly situated for the most part those days are illdefined in my memory running together and combining like a fresh watercolor painting left out in the rain i remember squatting in the road drawing a picture in the dust a picture which joey gleefully erased with one sweep of his dirty foot i remember fishing for minnows in a muddy creek and watching sadly as they eluded my cupped hands while joey laughed uproariously and remember that year a strange restlessness of body and of spirit a feeling that something old and familiar was ending and something unknown and therefore terrifying was beginning one day returns to me with special clarity for some reason perhaps because it was the beginning of the experience that in some inexplicable way marked the end of innocence i was loafing under the great oak tree in our yard deep in some reverie which i have now forgotten except that it involved some secret secret thoughts of one of the harris boys across the yard joey and a bunch of kids were bored now with the old tire suspended from an oak limb which had kept them entertained for awhile hey lizabeth joey yelled he never talked when he could yell hey lizabeth lets go somewhere i came reluctantly from my private world where you want to go what you want to do the truth was that we were becoming tired of the formlessness of our summer days the idleness whose prospect had seemed so beautiful during the busy days of spring now had degenerated to an almost desperate effort to fill up the empty midday hours lets go see can we find some locusts on the hill someone suggested joey was scornful aint no more locusts there yall got em all while they was still green the argument that followed was brief and not really worth the effort hunting locust trees wasnt fun any more by now tell you what said joey finally his eyes sparkling lets go over to miss lotties the idea caught on at once for annoying miss lottie was always fun i was still child enough to scamper along with the group over rickety fences and through bushes that tore our already raggedy clothes back to where miss lottie lived i think now that we must have made a tragicomic spectacle five or six kids of different ages each of us clad in only one garmentthe girls in faded dresses that were too long or too short the boys in patchy pants their sweaty brown chests gleaming in the hot sun a little cloud of dust followed our thin legs and bare feet as we tramped over the barren land when miss lotties house came into view we stopped ostensibly to plan our strategy but actually to reinforce our courage miss lotties house was the most ramshackle of all our ramshackle homes the sun and rain had long since faded its rickety frame siding from white to a sullen gray the boards themselves seemed to remain upright not from being nailed together but rather from leaning together like a house that a child might have constructed from cardsa brisk wind might have blown it down and the fact that it was still standing implied a kind of enchantment that was stronger than the elements there it stood and as far as i know is standing yet a gray rotting thing with no porch no shutters no steps set on a cramped lot with no grass not even any weedsa monument to decay in front of the house in a squeaky rocking chair sat miss lotties son john burke completing the impression of decay john burke was what was known as queerheaded black and ageless he sat rocking day in and day out in a mindless stupor lulled by the monotonous squeaksquawk of the chair a battered hat atop his shaggy head shaded him from the sun usually john burke was totally unaware of everything outside his quiet dream world but if you disturbed him if you intruded upon his fantasies he would become enraged strike out at you and curse at you in some strange enchanted language which only he could understand we children made a game of thinking of ways to disturb john burke and then to elude his violent retribution but our real fun and our real fear lay in miss lottie herself miss lottie seemed to be at least a hundred years old her big frame still held traces of the tall powerful woman she must have been in youth although it was now bent and drawn her smooth skin was a dark reddishbrown and her face had indianlike features and the stern stoicism that one associates with indian faces miss lottie didnt like intruders either especially children she never left her yard and nobody ever visited her we never knew how she managed those necessities which depend on human interactionhow she ate for example or even whether she ate when we were tiny children we thought miss lottie was a witch and we made up tales that we half believed ourselves about her exploits we were far too sophisticated now of course to believe the witchnonsense but old fears have a way of clinging like cobwebs and so when we sighted the tumbledown shack we had to stop to reinforce our nerves look there she is i whispered forgetting that miss lottie could not possibly have heard me from that distance shes fooling with them crazy flowers yeh look at er miss lotties marigolds were perhaps the strangest part of the picture certainly they did not fit in with the crumbling decay of the rest of her yard beyond the dusty brown yard in front of the sorry gray house rose suddenly and shockingly a dazzling strip of bright blossoms clumped together in enormous mounds warm and passionate and sungolden the old black witchwoman worked on them all summer every summer down on her creaky knees weeding and cultivating and arranging while the house crumbled and john burke rocked for some perverse reason we children hated those marigolds they interfered with the perfect ugliness of the place they were too beautiful they said too much that we could not understand they did not make sense there was something in the vigor with which the old woman destroyed the weeds that intimidated us it should have been a comical sightthe old woman with the mans hat on her cropped white head leaning over the bright mounds her big backside in the airbut it wasnt comical it was something we could not name we had to annoy her by whizzing a pebble into her flowers or by yelling a dirty word then dancing away from her rage revelling in our youth and mocking her age actually i think it was the flowers we wanted to destroy but nobody had the nerve to try it not even joey who was usually fool enough to try anything yall git some stones commanded joey now and was met with instant giggling obedience as everyone except me began to gather pebbles from the dusty ground come on lizabeth i just stood there peering through the bushes torn between wanting to join the fun and feeling that it was all a bit silly you scared lizabeth i cursed and spat on the ground my favorite gesture of phony bravado yall children get the stones ill show you how to use em i said before that we children were not consciously aware of how thick were the bars of our cage i wonder now though whether we were not more aware of it than i thought perhaps we had some dim notion of what we were and how little chance we had of being anything else otherwise why would we have been so preoccupied with destruction anyway the pebbles were collected quickly and everybody looked at me to begin the fun come on yall we crept to the edge of the bushes that bordered the narrow road in front of miss lotties place she was working placidly kneeling over the llowers her dark hand plunged into the golden mound suddenly zingan expertlyaimed stone cut the head off one of the blossoms who out there miss lotties backside came down and her head came up as her sharp eyes searched the bushes you better git we had crouched down out of sight in the bushes where we stifled the giggles that insisted on coming miss lottie gazed warily across the road for a moment then cautiously returned to her weeding zing joey sent a pebble into the blooms and another marigold was beheaded miss lottie was enraged now she began struggling to her feet leaning on a rickety cane and shouting yall git go on home then the rest of the kids let loose with their pebbles storming the flowers and laughing wildly and senselessly at miss lotties impotent rage she shook her stick at us and started shakily toward the road crying black bastards git long john burke john burke come help then i lost my head entirely mad with the power of inciting such rage and ran out of the bushes in the storm of pebbles straight toward miss lottie chanting madly old witch fell in a ditch picked up a penny and thought she was rich the children screamed with delight dropped their pebbles and joined the crazy dance swarming around miss lottie like bees and chanting old lady witch while she screamed curses at us the madness lasted only a moment for john burke startled at last lurched out of his chair and we dashed for the bushes just as miss lotties cane went whizzing at my head i did not join the merriment when the kids gathered again under the oak in our bare yard suddenly i was ashamed and i did not like being ashamed the child in me sulked and said it was all in fun but the woman in me flinched at the thought of the malicious attack that i had led the mood lasted all afternoon when we ate the beans and rice that was supper that night i did not notice my fathers silence for he was always silent these days nor did i notice my mothers absence for she always worked until well into evening joey and i had a particularly bitter argument after supper his exuberance got on my nerves finally i stretched out upon the palette in the room we shared and fell into a fitful doze when i awoke somewhere in the middle of the night my mother had returned and i vaguely listened to the conversation that was audible through the thin walls that separated our rooms at first i heard no words only voices my mothers voice was like a cool dark room in summerpeaceful soothing quiet i loved to listen to it it made things seem alright somehow but my fathers voice cut through hers shattering the peace twentytwo years maybelle years he was saying and i got nothing for you nothing nothing its all right honey youll get something everybodys out of work now you know that it aint right aint no man ought to eat his womans food year in and year out and see his children running wild aint nothing right about that honey you took good care of us when you had it aint nobody got nothing nowadays i aint talking about nobody else im talking about me god knows i try my mother said something i could not hear and my father cried out louder what must a man do tell me that look we aint starving i git paid every week and mrs ellis is real nice about giving me things shes gonna let me have mr ellis old coat for you this winter god damn mr ellis coat and god damn his money you think i want white folks leavings god damn maybelleand suddenly he sobbed loudly and painfully and cried helplessly and hopelessly in the dark night i had never heard a man cry before i did not know men ever cried i covered my ears with my hands but could not cut off the sound of my fathers harsh painful despairing sobs my father was a strong man who would whisk a child upon his shoulders and go singing through the house my father whittled toys for us and laughed so loud that the great oak seemed to laugh with him and taught us how to fish and hunt rabbits how could it be that my father was crying but the sobs went on unstifled finally quieting until i could hear my mothers voice deep and rich humming softly as she used to hum to a frightened child the world had lost its boundary lines my mother who was small and soft was now the strength of the family my father who was the rock on which the family had been built was sobbing like the tiniest child everything was suddenly out of tune like a broken accordion where did i fit into this crazy picture i do not now remember my thoughts only a feeling of great bewilderment and fear long after the sobbing and the humming had stopped lay on the palette still as stone with my hands over my ears wishing that too could cry and be comforted the night was silent now except for the sound of the crickets and of joeys soft breathing but the room was too crowded with fear to allow me to sleep and finally feeling the terrible aloneness of am i decided to awaken joey ouch whats the matter with you what you want he demanded disagreeably when i had pinched and slapped him awake come on wake up what for go way i was lost for a reasonable reply i could not say im scared and i dont want to be alone so i merely said im going out if you want to come come on the promise of adventure awoke him going out now where to lizabeth what you going to do i was pulling my dress over my head until now i had not thought of going out just come on i replied tersely i was out the window and halfway down the road before joey caught up with me wait lizabeth where you going i was running as if the furies were after me as perhaps they wererunning silently and furiously until i came to where i had halfknown i was headed to miss lotties yard the halfdawn light was more eerie than complete darkness and in it the old house was like the ruin that my world had becomefoul and crumbling a grotesque caricature it looked haunted but i was not afraid because i was haunted too lizabeth you lost your mind panted joey i had indeed lost my mind for all the smoldering emotions of that summer swelled in me and burst the great need for my mother who was never there the hopelessness of our poverty and degradation the bewilderment of being neither child nor woman and yet both at once the fear unleashed by my fathers tears and these feelings combined in one great impulse toward destruction lizabeth i leaped furiously into the mounds of marigolds and pulled madly trampling and pulling and destroying the perfect yellow blooms the fresh smell of early morning and of dewsoaked marigolds spurred me on as i went tearing and mangling and sobbing while joey tugged my dress or my waist crying lizabeth stop please stop and then i was sitting in the ruined little garden among the uprooted and ruined flowers crying and crying and it was too late to undo what i had done joey was sitting beside me silent and frightened not knowing what to say then lizabeth look i opened my swollen eyes and saw in front of me a pair of large calloused feet my gaze lifted to the swollen legs the agedistorted body clad in a tight cotton night dress and then the shadowed indian face surrounded by stubby white hair and there was no rage in the face now now that the garden was destroyed and there was nothing any longer to be protected mmiss lottie i scrambled to my feet and just stood there and stared at her and that was the moment when childhood faded and womanhood began that violent crazy act was the last act of childhood for as i gazed at the immobile face with the sad weary eyes i gazed upon a kind of reality which is hidden to childhood the witch was no longer a witch but only a broken old woman who had dared to create beauty in the midst of ugliness and sterility she had been born in squalor and lived in it all her life now at the end of that life she had nothing except a fallingdown hut a wrecked body and john burke the mindless son of her passion whatever verve there was left in her whatever was of love and beauty and joy that had not been squeezed out by life had been there in the marigolds she had so tenderly cared for of course i could not express the things that i knew about miss lottie as i stood there awkward and ashamed the years have put words to the things i knew in that moment and as i look back upon it i know that that moment marked the end of innocence people think of the loss of innocence as meaning the loss of virginity but this is far from true innocence involves an unseeing acceptance of things at face value an ignorance of the area below the surface in that humiliating moment i looked beyond myself and into the depths of another person this was the beginning of compassion and one cannot have both compassion and innocence the years have taken me worlds away from that time and that place from the dust and squalor of our lives and from the bright thing that i destroyed in a blind childish striking out at godknowswhat miss lottie died long ago and many years have passed since last saw her hut completely barren at last for despite my wild contrition she never planted marigolds again yet there are times when the image of those passionate yellow mounds returns with a painful poignancy for one does not have to be ignorant and poor to find that his life is barren as the dusty yards of our town and too have planted marigolds the louis theatre opened its new season last weekend with the monster and no use cryiri two plays showing different aspects of the black revolution the monster a one act play by ronald milner depicts the dilemma of black students on the nations campuses here they must confront a professional negro and deal with him if they are to realize any selffulfillment they devise a strategem to make the professional negro reveal his true self he is the dean of the college by day he walks with the blacks talks the talk dresses in their style and wears a natural wig by night he sheds this and goes into his otner bag white one brother discovers this with a number of other brothers and sisters and plans a solution to the problem presented by this dangerous duality and duplicity as staged by pemon rami at the louis this play achieves the desired results in the opening weekend however it suffered from some technical drawbacks mainly lighting one whole circuit went out the acting could be improved and it no doubt will be as the play runs raybon myers playing ali the leader of the revolutionary students must be credited with a fine performance the rest of the cast was only adequate for the opening milner once again demonstrates his deft touch he is a remarkable playwright the dialog catches the mood of the movement and the characters are as beautifully drawn as one could expect in such a short offering black theatregoers will remember milners whos got his own it has enjoyed successful runs in new york los angeles and at the louis in chicago no use cryin is bill harris first olay to be produced it shows that he las an ear for the speech of black people this is a fulllength play though rather short as plays go the entire play is set in the living room and kitchen of a black factory worker in a northern city the family consists of a father mother a teenage son a teenage daughter and a preteen son this family suffers from an identity crisis nobody can identify with father he in turn is frustrated in his efforts to provide his family with lifes luxuries which he was denied his frustration is exemplified by his drinking wasting money and bullying his wife and children his main line of reasoning runs a son should be more than his father he constantly replays his childhood for his children his oldest son meanwhile completely rejects his fathers notion of what constitutes manhood he is not content to be a secondclass citizen he lets this be known by striking out against anyone who tries to put him into this category this lately has been mainly his employers and the police the daughter is a student with heavy interest in black history and culture she wears her hair natural to the chagrin of her father the younger son identifies very closely with his sister the mother is rather docile trying hard to keep her family to the second annual conference of african and africanamerican studies in the undergraduate college will be held

dates from tombstones he splashed through mudholes and puddles peering into the darkness finally he saw a city of light and walked there he was standing in a crowded night club an orchestra blared and laughter rose in the smoky spaciousness of the highceilinged room all the people were orientallooking the women wore red chinese dresses and the men wore black flowing robes he walked among the cluttered tables searching for his mothers face at the back of the room he came to a small dimlylit bar there were six bar stools all unoccupied his grandmother stood behind the bar grinning toothlessly and wiping a crystal goblet he sat down the old woman placed a clean towel on the bar before him and then she reached under the bar and brought forth a golden machete she gave the machete to him he wept he was a small boy again a brown lamb child with a rainbow mind scrambling for love and a tender patontheback he was cold again afraid and earthbound full of frozen rage tonguetied and trembling he was shushed tweeked crooned to kissed nuzzled and clucked and shoved into a corner his mother took his arm and led him to the door opening the door she pointed out into the black night and said little nigger get out of here he was sitting in the front pew of the church everyone was singing precious lord the pulpit was made of gold the preacher rose and stepped forward to the pulpit the singing stopped as the preacher started to pray one of the deacons started to chant the spiritual leaning on the everlasting anns other voices joined in the singing the slowly increasing rhythm of the singing began to move him and he started to sway from side to side and hum all his fears vanished and he felt joyous and deliriously happy he ran forward and fell before the pulpit crying loudly i repent i repent the singing stopped the preacher stopped praying the room became quiet as he rose and turned to see the congregation stand up the people wore halloween masks and stood mute and frozen he held out his arms to them speechless and silently imploring their forgiveness he was naked and standing before the electric chair which was painted orange the death chamber was pale and empty but above him in the gallery sat all the oriental people from the night club they rose en masse pointing to him and screaming kill kill he stepped up on the small platform and sat down a hooded figure came forward and adjusted straps and buckles around his arms and legs the room turned blue then purple then blue again and finally blackness came he needs these rotten monotonous days he must never forget them must never forget the pain the silent aching pain of black life in the slums he must never forget the hunger and the shame his suffering must not be unlike the suffering of his slave ancestors his anguish must now give birth to beauty and pride kill him crack his black skull is he no less the man for all his faults and highyellow skin than his african forebears is he less a man than the white rapists who stole down into the slave compounds through midnight shadows to brew the wide spectrum of bastard offspring destroy his family unit hide his history much of it is your own history your violence is manifested in his behavior for you are he and he is you the pnk dream the city is rosy pink from the moons midnight glow a running man sprints across an empty street stopping before the ywca entering the building he dashes into the girls dormitory and with a gleaming machete disembowels a sleeping virgin clutching the girls bleeding heart he runs out through a rear door and melts into the jungle as he lopes through the sweltering jungle foliage african drums resound in the night locusts cling to his damp black back and murmuring watusi children shout simba simba as they dance around his fallen gasping body he crawls to the witch doctors hut still clutching the bloody heart the traffic light dances up and down and noises from the traffic stream echo his airy dreams he leaps aboard the clanking trolley car vibrating from shinbone to shoulder he angles his tall frame into the hardbacked seat beside the pinkcheeked white girl whose muskscented perfume invades his breathing he fulfills his need to be punished and says hello white girl she is dollfaced with a button nose and from her poreclain ears hang jade earrings her ruths curls thick and electric frame her blue eyes which dart birdquick and fearful in curious captivity his nearness his black male nearness rasps on her dainty awareness he forces her into conversation flushed with an urge to be hated daring her refusal needing her disdain and contempt her tender neck blushes red as she smiles heroically opening the closed areas of her face she becomes a beautiful black girl stamping her tiny foot she screams for attentiona pregnant sheba in a tenement trap she turns white again her face pinched and hard from too many orgasms she shouts get the torah get the book he does not answer staring into his empty wine glass seeing the bizarre mau mau rites the senseless assassinations and the quizzical look on his mothers face the pregnant blackwhite girl strides toward him raising her skirt certain of her feminine magnetism he falls to his knees the room becomes a cathedral a smil ing priest touches his shoulder and blesses him the christ statue is a black christ as it smiles down from the rood strains of ave maria drone softly and shafts of sunlight crisscross the rooms quietness he counts the shadows that loom across the empty lonely room quiet earlymorning hours fill the hourglass slowly and sleep will not come to him above him in another tenement flat a strident voice cries out from the terror of nightmare and frustration he turns to his small radio jiggles the red dial searching for a connection with the real world hunger and need make a poet of him oh pauline where are you baby how long must i yearn for your soft embrace i am a wounded tiger trapped and caught in steel and concrete ripped open and bleeding in the darkness i need you now as i fight my way through these murky corridors i need to touch your breasts your lips you are my invisible venus lost somewhere in the streets waiting to be slain by the ticktock beat of blues and rainyday sadness the death dream running from dark shadows in san francisco he stopped and kissed an old flower woman bought roses from her and ran across the golden gate bridge shot and bleeding as he ran he shouted im guilty guilty do you hear save me save me the old woman saintly in her ancient sadness wiped away his blood and made the sicn of the cross she gathered up her flower box and moved on into the stygian night he framed his tearstreaked face against the windowpane rubbed his swollen wounds and heard the plaintive wail of a crapshooter bet i hit somebody fade me he heard the peal of cathedral bells calling the faithful to worship the sleeping girl naked and lying facedown on his bed groaned and murmured as wispy shadows weaved dark patterns about the room he looked down at her exposed flanks curved and symmetrical and they reminded him of the bomb restins somewhere in a silo threatening the unborn future while furtive dynamiters were creeping into black churches to spew their death and ignorance across the face of the world he stumbled into the small kitchen and slumped down at the table he started to write on a note pad he felt a thundering pumping in his veins eyes apop he felt himself soaring into a glittering humming nothingness he felt himself reaching high for a soft kiss from eternity the naked girl padded into the kitchen to find him slumped across the table he had written two lines on a tablet the girl picked up the note pad and read dear world light a

trees lined each side of the street but they seemed suspendedfloating above the flowers and shrubbery of the square neat lawns a brilliant orange sun sped across the noonday sky moving easttowest and westtosouth never still his shadow danced around him as he ran stumbling down the street shouting father father he sat crosslegged in the basement wine bottle in hand his blind friend howard reclined on the linoleum carpet humming the blues and scratching himself the house shuddered violently and split open they floated above the shifting scene giddily reaching for the flying debris his mother ran across the undulating lawn calling to them he sat in the last pew over the heads of weeping mourners he could see a bier surrounded by flowers many of which were limpid and bloodstained canada lee stood in the pulpit reciting elegy written in a country churchyard an invisible choir sang a dirge as two nude african girls appeared at his side and escorted him down the aisle to the coffin he looked into the coffin and saw himself he screamed as he gazed down at the lifeless man lying in the lush grey casket the death figure was dressed in african ceremonial robes and a shrunken chrysanthemum was clasped in its lifeless hand a howling chinaman draped in a torn white sheet and hood crashed through a stained glass window he was shouting dirty communists rotten anarchists people screamed and fell to their knees as the death figure floated up from the coffin slowly as he watched himself float above the howling people he saw the chinaman fling gold coins among the frenzied mob

caint take you there aint nuthin in chicago a monkeywoman like you can do the white dream the room is circular with a high mirrored ceiling the windows extend from the ceiling to floor each bordered with gold and white drapes the walls are white and their roundness gives him an odd feeling of shifting dimensions in the middle of the room is a large white round bed upon which lies a young nude black woman she is lying on her back breathing rhythmically with her arms flung akimbo she turns over and her dark muscular form is in stark contrast with the rooms brightness there is no other furniture the windows seem sealed how did he enter he walks around slowly watching the nude woman she stirs looks at him and smiles he stares up into the mirrored ceiling and sees her body reflectedbut not himself he searches the mirror for sight of his own image as desire creeps down into his loins he yells where am i wheres my reflection he claws at the air seeking some tangible reason for his absence in the mirror seeking acknowledgement of his existence the voluptuous black female roots herself in the middle of the round bed crooning softly sweetie you didnt make it you just didnt make it he rips away his clothing tearing it wildly from his body naked he stands with arms outstretched staring up into the ceiling he sees only the woman he turns to face her wanting her to see him to see his maleness and rising desire to realize the reality of his presence he leaps upon the bed prepared to drive her mocking laughter from the room as he reaches out to grab her the room darkens and she becomes a large green and yellow boa constrictor the snake begins to weave its head hypnotically he throws himself backward choked with fear he feels himself caught and gripped in the hands of his mother and father who shove him forward into the coiling grip of the serpent he croaks in wordless terror as he is enveloped within the icy coils which slide and move smoothly around his body from somewhere outside the room he hears the tinkle of glasses and sounds of people laughing and talking as the coils tighten nausea boils up in his throat darkness descends he is alone and shivering the bed is empty the room has become glowing red the ceiling is now transparent exposing a clear blue sky spotted with occasional fluffy clouds he crawls to the edge of the bed and finds himself hovering over the edge of an exploding world with the burgeoning of v unct black studies courses vv a all over the country thanks to the forceful and resourceful efforts of the black community there comes a need to assess and place the works of the black writers of immediate concern is the evaluation of those works now in paperback which are or will be of particular use to school and university teachers one of these is the novel beetlecreek by william demby now in paperback from avon books already we have had an assessment of the novel by robert bone in his the negro novel ii a merica rev ed new haven yale university press i would tend to disagree with this critics overemphasis on the existentialist nature of this interesting work and instead i would like to stress its human content biographical details supplied by bone p have some bearing on the novel william demby was born in clarksburg west virginia in the heart of the mining region which provides the setting for beetlecreek his education at west virginia state college was interrupted by two years of army service in italy on his return he was able to finish his degree at fisk university thanks to the gi bill he graduated in being interested in art as well as literature he returned to italy to study at the school of art at the university of rome where he has remained to write screen plays for roberto rosellini his recent novel the catacombs new york random house strikes one as reminiscent of the fellini world of roman society of deeper significance dembys creative writing contributions to the fisk herald while at the university have a cosmopolitan strongly gi antifascist flavor for example in an undergraduate story published in december and called saint joey a white teenage gang led by a religious fanatic decided to murder an old recluse who has upset the racial mores of the community the antecedents of beetlecreek are obvious in beetlecreek the gang becomes a negro one the old recluse turns into bill trapp a white living on the edge of a negro community the nightriders which the visiting pittsburgh youngster johnny joins is fascist in its fanaticism and sadism and has sufficient motive force to make johnny turn from his new friend bill only to return as a crafty enemy while understanding the relations between the life and the art of demby robert bone overstresses the existentialist core of beetlecreek judging by his criticism the novel is an elaborate framework for the main characters to ask themselves the question what do i want of life and then because they have no positive goals the attempts at assertion following the questioning lead only to their own destruction without doubt this kind of patterning is apparent in the story but ones interest is absorbed far more by the unusual situation of white recluse bill trapp living as the white minority in a negro settlement and more especially by the very human way in which the recluse tries to break through the barriers a lifetime had erected and which kept him aloof from human companionship in the last analysis beetlecreek is a human document not an existentialist one to substantiate this last point one may first assemble the existentialist evidence of robert bone p and then show how the novel goes beyond this philosophical base in its impact at the beginning of the novel bone explains bill trapp terminates years of solitude and thus displays the celebrated courage to be of french existentialism set against this striving for life is the deathliness of the beetlecreek community conveyed through the barbershop crowd narrowness and defeatism the funeral scene shallowness and hypocrisy the persecution of bill trapp cruelty the community is a ghost town in a more profound sense than its having exhausted its coal deposit for bone the plot itself revolves around the frustrated negro artist david with whom john is staying the boy is meant to be only a shadow of his host although it is hard to see how this description fits one so lifelike continuing the existentialist explanation bone shows that david is trying to break out of the stagnation of beetlecreek by attaching himself to a childhood sweetheart who is visiting the town but she has the death kiss of the big city upon her for a moment he makes the right choice by supporting bill trapp against the prejudices of the community but he gives in before the mass hysteria of the other townsfolk john who has left his sick mother in pittsburgh is lonely like david but one feels that bone is overstressing the likeness when he equates the adult loneliness of david with that of the boy john also supports bill trapp until he later betrays him under pressure from the nightriders gang the similarity with davids betrayal seems merely situational unless one wants to fit everything into an existential framework bones summing up of the affinities between the two cases seems farfetched in the light of the evidence he states it is true the existentialist definition of evil above all of david and johnny who suffer their creative powers to be perverted rather than endure a spiritual vacuum p but the boys humanity is being squeezed out by bones cerebral interpretation not by the actual story for instead of being an existential cutout johnny appears in the story as a very real human being in order to put the philosophical base in the background where it belongs one should note the evidence in beetlecreek that makes it stand as an ordinary story without the props of existentialism the picture of the old recluse at the start trying to open the chrysalis of solitude is not overpainted nor superficially rendered always when he looked in the mirror his eyes were different sometimes they peered from out of the broken glass asking an unanswerable question sometimes they were angry and damning sometimes they were sullen and brooding too often they were the eyes of a dead man jellied and blank william demby beetlecreek new york rinehart co p when johnny johnson invades the loneliness of may farm the old man is spurred on to companionship he ran to the mirror and looked at himself he tried to smile for years and years he hadnt washed his teeth he found a broken piece of comb and tried to do something with his hair he was conscious of a change of life in him a change that seemed to have come suddenly but he knew was prepared for years before p meanwhile in the town mary davids wife is having her own battle with a selfimage this character is consistently portrayed as truly feminine in her hopes and fears her life centers around the womens club of her church and her animosities center around mrs tolley the president she imagines herself standing in front of the ladies presiding over a meeting as if in shame for what she was doing she pulled the blankets over her face to hide the grotesque expression of dignity she had shaped her face into imagining herself in a black dress saying to the ladies this meeting will now come to order p throughout the novel marys anxieties concerning her standing at the club and for her stall at the upcoming parish fair afford an extra human background to the main plot as the novel closes david is eloping bill trapps cabin is on fire but mary is basking pleasantly in selfadulation after the success of marys bestest gingercake stall to see john and the recluse merely as existential figures is to miss the warmth of feeling displayed by the old man towards the boy and the latters own troubled reactions towards bill trapp the old man centers his return to companionship around the young negro every morning found him up and about long before dawn he was restless and spent his time doing unnecessary things he mended the traps and pruned trees working always near the road hoping to see the colored boy hoping to see any human walking towards his place p eventually he is accepted by the townspeople because of his generosity and he appears among them as a pied piper hordes of children ran shrieking up and down the street he tucked in his belt straightened his hat and boldly began to walk past them p johnny on the other hand is torn between a poetic world in which he sees all nature and all men as kind and the other world of harshness but solidarity in the gang true in the end he succumbs to the pressures of the gang and obeys the summons to bring forth the gasoline that will destroy trapps home but his previous mixed feelings are very much those of the young adolescent they do not need the existentialist philosophy to prove them true demby writes well of this younger consciousness from the time john shows compassion for the beetle to the time when the youth feels that other irrepressible feelings are stirring in him everything he did was frozen out there in front of him so that right after he did it he could look at the action examine it and measure it and say to himself how funny it was and wonder if it was really he who had done it p david the frustrated artist has similar troublings of spirit in which the consciousness feels that other forces are beginning to stir and black enameled death that he had seen the funeral of mrs johnson of beetlecreek represented everything of beetlecreek and was like the restlessness and dissatisfaction of the birds only inside him swarming and swooping inside him filling him with vague fear and shame preparing him for something telling him warning him separating him from the things that were happening around him apart from him pulling him along towards things that he could not see or know p but one does not have to see both john and david as examples of the same existentialist patterning in demby both survive as human beings even the subsequent betrayal of davids renewed artistic yearnings is not to be seen as caused by some inhuman force crushing him the author uses a convincing irony to show davids being trapped by his own aspiration not surprisingly the artist david finds beetlecreek a womb in which one is suffocated and this feeling of being trapped throws him upon edith in his frustration he sees her as different and really alive but his charged emotion has caused him to misjudge the situation as demby implies at the very end of the novel when david is eloping with edith she barks at him once inside the coach in a dry scraping voice dont always be so goddam loveydovey he has given up one painful situation for another sufficient evidence has been introduced to show that the human content of beetlecreek far outweighs the existentialist patterning that is brought in by bone as interpretation let us begin to be honest with each other by first being honest with ourselves there is no precedent for revolution in this country among blacks we of us are a revolutionary party and we have come to set a series of precedents we have decided that we must first deal with the cultural revolution others have disagreed with it the disagreement has not disappointed us emotionally however ideologically the position and opposition to the cultural revolution in time and context tends to be incorrect we have said before that th red book is better read it has no relevance if we never read enough to refer to it intelligently it is mao the master who hat taught us weapons are an important factor in war but not the decisive factor its people not things that are decisive the contest of strength is not only a contest of military and economic power but also a contest of human power and morale if weapons are not the most decisive factor but people then what are we to do with weapons and what path must we pursue with the people us has said and continues to say that the battle we must fight now and always is the battle for the minds of black people and if we lose that battle we cannot hope to win any other battle therefore the slogan pick up the gun is simply a slogan not a program or an ideology nor a value system that would make us victorians for if mao is as correct as those who refer to him would have us believe then what we should concentrate on is not the weapons but the people how can we win the people that is the question it is not a question of how can we kill the enemy for the people must decide that that is necessary themselves or the vanguard will vanish and the revolutionary party which has placed itself in a front position will fall flat on its face and history will hide all of them if we concede that mao is the master and revolution is the reality then words are wasted on discussions of weapons for as mao says again although barehanded the masses can subdue the enemy and then he goes on to say in our daily life is there any object that cannot be used to kill the enemy or any type of action that cannot reduce or destroy his fighting strength since the principal function of an armys weapons is to simply destroy the enemy and or reduce or destroyhis fighting strength therefore we must win the will of the people so that they will have the will to be a nation or the first stage of national development is a cultural nation ie a group of people with a common value system that gives us the will to be together to share and fight together and to seek the sovereignty as a political nation so that we can defend and develop ourselves with national effectiveness the problem with most people who do not understand cultural nationalism is that they see cultural nationalism in terms of a narrow definition of culture which deals with the arts whereas we of us which is a revolutionary party with a correct revolutionary ideology seek culture as a total value system and institutions to maintain and develop that value system it is no accident that mao says to the chinese that they must combine nationalism with internationalism for in developing it further he says that only by fighting in defense of china during the revolution that they could achieve national liberation and then make it possible for other people to achieve their national liberation therefore we see it as a mistake to make a distinction between cultural nationalism and revolutionary nationalism when nationalism today by its very nature has to be revolutionary if it is for liberation from the colonial power which rules a peoplebecoming if liberation is the chief goal as all wouldbe revolutionaries repeatedly reveal to us then any movement toward liberation puts one in conflict with the people in power and that conflict creates the context for the revolution but what must be understood is that no one can save us but ourselves we must speak for ourselves we must develop our own ideology as we of us have done in terms of kawaida every revolutionary struggle has proved that you cannot import revolution again it is mao who tells us in the fight for complete liberation the oppressed people rely first of all on their own struggle and then and only then on international assistance because revolutions are similar but at the same time time and circumstance bring about differences and not paying attention to differences will ultimately lead to defeat one last reference to mao is appropriate in terms of his concern with the chinese maintaining their culture we have said that mao has made marxism meaningful only by absorbing it and then transcending it that is why we know marxism is for the western people not black people too he said in the new stage that even in relationship to marxism we chinese must adopt a national form before we can find marxism useful and we should never subjectively or mechanically apply it let us stand as a people first speak our own language develop and reinforce our own culture and revolutionary ideology and make revolution rather than references to other peoples revolution the red book would never be relevant if mao had not won and we have always thought that he has done himself a discredit by calling himself a marxist and the young chinese proved this by calling themselves maoists we of us understand that the revolution can only be made when the people desire that they are a people and want to make it and culture is the cement that binds blacks together therefore it is absurd to make a distinction between cultural nationalism and a suprastructure for all different types of nationalism since culture is a total value system including religious nationalism political nationalism artistic nationalism and even what may be called atavisma return to the past because one cannot deal with the present and refuse to face the future this is the year of reconstruction let us reconstruct labeling our brothers will not leave us with fewer problems the enemy seems to endure in spite of the debates i but if we as revolutionaries surj vive by that very survival we prove that the enemy is not invincible young james alan mcpherson might rejoice in the fact that a man is defined not by what he says but rather by what he does the short stories collected under the title hue and cry little brown and company leave little doubt as to what mcpherson can dohe can write short fiction as well as anyone living in america who is under and make all the more inane his dust cover utterings see october negro digest about trying to keep the color part of most of them far in the background where these things should rightly be kept in the very first of his stories a matter of vocabulary a tale out of what obviously is the authors background mcpherson tells us with rare tenderness how he learned about being black and that sense of blackness is not absent in any of his stories where in the honesty of the telling it is expected to be found indeed as revealed in a story called private domain mcpherson knows something of the exasperation and the futilityof trying to flee from ones blackness but i suspect that his selfimposed estrangement from black writers of his own generation has left him believing that someone would deny him the right to speak also of the identity crisis peculiar to young whites in america which he does remarkably well in the very same story anyone who has sat in morning court in an american city will recognize the old men in the second row in mcphersons story an act of prostitution as a perfect metaphor for the millions upon millions of good citizentype americans who never fail to be entertained by their countrys absolute lack of moral authority mcpherson tells his story with a hand restrained in such a way as to prevent the reader from divorcing himself from the cruelty of its characters it is a story about the powerless at the mercy of the powerful but it does not neglect to demonstrate how a showing of power by the former can quickly alter the style as well as the behaviour of the latter for most of us a lifetime will be too short a period in which to see all the lonely people so clearly as mcpherson sees them but on the other hand neither will most of us throw off the chains that keep us from admitting as mcpherson has admitted that all the lonely people are ones self it is the story of a young man who does not find in his being a user of women a reason for feeling morally superior to a weak and altogether pathetic homosexual he suffers therefore no less for his inability to let himself be used by the desperate man than he does upon refusing the sexual advances of a girl for whom he had selfishly made plans before discovering her to be unattractive at the beginning of the story the young man deceives one woman into believing that he wants her in order to get away from the homosexual she had only been a convenient and manly excuse for getting out of that shop without having to give an aging fairy specific reasons why i would not have a scotch with him perhaps the american male in his terror has come to view woman as nothing more than an object through which he might escape facing himself and other men a mystery at the bottom of which might rest the key to the american females fastgrowing determination to be something other than a woman all of which suggests a state of affairs about as sad as mcphersons gracefully told story in which the character is forced in his flight to take satisfaction in a certain affirmation of something a certain pride a sense of some small and sensual accomplishment a solo song for doc is the story of something old something dying and about the people who however unrecognized invested it with a flavor and a style without which it would have been something quite different and who moreover loved it even as they came to hate and fear it and know that it like them had had its day it is about the railroad and the black men who ran on the road finally it is about america in the writing of this story mcpherson makes it unmistakably clear that he has acquired keen and reliable insights into the lives of the masses of black people who go day after day year after year to those unspeakable jobs where they perform in such a way as to appear fairly content with the rules and the rule of the white man his however is the insight of one who knows that what they feel in their bones is not easily measured by their appearance it is of course an insight the full value of which will not be realized until the architects of the revolutionary vision have begun to listen to the people with an ear half as good as mcphersons james alan mcpherson is a craftsman who writes with authority about this america and the people who live and fight and grow dull and die here he has experienced this country and its people rather widely in a short time his writing ought to be celebrated for the clarity with which he comments upon the quality of american life which our best vision would have us avoid mcpherson writes with a quiet power that rips away at the minds deeply buried illusions and works its way into the soul like tears of humility understatement in his hand is as revolutionary in its way as was truth in the mouth of malcolm in his title story he speaks of a black girl being married by nature to a cause and i for one hope that he will consider his own words for i see no rational reason for him to deny that he is a black artist volume of black artists on art is an attractive production editors samella s lewis and ruth g waddy two enterprising west coast artists have gathered a group of artists of varying talents and viewpoints in the covers of the first real attempt at the firstclass framing of black artists in a book since cedric dovers american negro art c the book is very now and very conscious of the mood among the bulk of todays black artists and intellectuals concern about the present moment and black consciousness in fact animates the book there are photographs of some of the works of the artists featured in the book but there also are statements from the artists about their motivations their impulses and their craft in her introduction miss lewis a member of the faculty at california state college dominguez hills outlines the context of the book a truly valid system of aesthetics should be derived from the culture of its inhabitants and should reflect the prevailing spirit of the times in a manner that involves all groups residing within the society this direction would provide for a concept of relationship that would include both commonalities and differences since it is the difference that sharpen or give vitality to the commonalities it would seem that the necessity of a culture to accept and respond to such diversities is a requisite to creative production many pages could be written concerning art and its relative importance from a cultural standpoint it can be briefly stated however that the control of this cultural empire is and percent from the white group this is not because whites are more cultured but because they control the economy and consequently dictate the specific aesthetic standards miss waddy speaks to another aspect of the same theme art is not an intellectual exercise approached through structural learning emotions styles and practiced in museums galleries and private collections art is spiritual the primary function of which is for the benefit growth and improvement of the human animal the artists are quoted as to their views on art and some of them of course are out there on cloud nine holding forth with cliches and irrelevancies some like david p bradford have joined cold reality and beauty into a theory of black art a black art must have the rhythm freedom and excitement of a john coltrane solo as well as make a statement to its viewer mr bradford says black art must be folksy and natural by this i mean it must derive from pure talent and not from the arrangement of light bulbs and tin foil for the experience of black folk in america have been a folksy experience and black people the world over are close to nature and the natural process of things in nature mr bradfords work is presented in color as is the work of a number of the artists represented in the book there are photographs of all the artists plus a brief biographical statement about each of them in the back of the book since the book is billed as volume the assumption is that a volume or volume will follow in such a case the complaint that the editors have been narrow in their selection of artists would not be valid there is however no indication anywhere in the book as to whether there will be other volumes or when or what area the subsequent volumes will cover it is hoped that future volumes will pay attention to the dozens of superb artists in such cities as detroit chicago philadelphia new york and washington dc volume of black artists on art seems to place emphasis on artists in the locality inhabited by the editors the book is designed by howard lee it is published in two editions a hardcover and a paperback by ward ritchie press of los angeles riverside drivehoyt w fuller im done crying by louanne ferris as told to beth day m evans and company is primarily a story of a black woman whose energies are spent in providing for her family and in proving herself worthy of the vocation she has chosen the author has presented miss ferris story in an alive hardhitting fast paced manner in which no words are wasted the events of louannes teenage marriage early pregnancy and semidesertion by her husband are related in plain lan guage when louanne becomes the sole support of her two sons she finds employment in a big city hospital as a kitchen aide and from that moment the bulk of her story is devoted to exposing the deplorable conditions in the institution she does this in a rather methodical manner beginning in the kitchen and proceeding through to the various wards the emergency room the operating room and the morgue in each instance her observations and descriptions of conditions seem brutal but are in most cases pathetically true the city hospital as an end of the line institution must admit anyone this includes the victims of abortions the junkies and the cats who get knifed every saturday night the malpractices the misjudgments and abandonments on the part of its staff are clearly spelled out by miss ferris as she progresses with the aid of a seriously dedicated but roughmannered registered nurse kilpatrick from kitchen aide to nurses aide to practical nurse to miss ferris a particular job regardless of its title is to be performed cleanly efficiently and with concern for the patient unfortunately she meets with indifference and all too often hosility on the part of her coworkers in her efforts im done crying is more than an exposure of hospital negligence it is also a commentary on urban ghetto life characterized by narcotics the numbers racket and illicit sex these conditions and their existence in the hospital environment presents an angry but interestholding plot characterizations are sensitively presented the reader is introduced to some dedicated persons such as dr durand who had the roar of a lion but sincere concern for all patients and contempt for staff malpractices the inspiration which miss ferris receives from nurses kilpatrick and lome offers an infinitesimal degree of brightness to a somewhat hopeless situation miss ferris story is quite aptly titled she was done crying after she had held many dying patients and after she had seen her son die from a then incurable kidney disease her determination and consequent survival offers a degree of hope to others like her this is a disturbing story but one which will be read and reflected onjo hudson the impotent talk endlessly of power beyond talk we do nothing i do not trust fervor fer vor is the preferred weapon of the impotent we know who we are where we are were slaves caught in a world constructed against us we know what and where we wish we could be it would be good to live masters of our own selves in a world weve constructed to meet needs of our own the disaster of the black man lies in the fact that he was ensla ved but behind us our past has been an endless disaster our present is sheer impotence and ahead of us even fools have begun to see destruction the black man has no ontological resistance in the eyes of the white man overnight the black man has been giv en two frames of reference within which he has had to place himself his metaphysics or less pretentiously his customs and the sources on which they were based were wiped out because they were in conflict with a civiliza tion that he did not know and that imposed j itself on him the catastrophic drift could be stopped if we could think clearly about where we are decide where we want to be then act to move ourselves from here to there but thought is difficult talk is easy decisive action is impossibly hard and talk is so beautifully cool thats why the hottest sou food is never in short supply its brand name is bullshit in a week of days we do our ordered bit to keep this white world going above us above our people weekends we meet to trade bold lies about our freedom lost and found our power lost and found our femininitv our mas mf culinity whether they were ever lost before they were found above all we talk of our identity also lost and found anv boastful kind of talk just so long as it keeps us from having to look into the nausea the uselessness the impotence of these our lives at the risk of arousing the resentment of my colored brothers i will say that the black man is not a man our enslavers assure us weve been free these many years one of us looking far into this world were bound in and deep into his own soul came up with the truth another murderous white lie the white man in the capacity of master said to the negro from now on you are free we are not free we re not even able to achieve our humanity says fanon were damned souls aborted creatures suffering in hells created by white people to sustain their crass heaven the central fact of our lives the central statement in all of fanons work is simply this were slaves the black man is a toy in the white mans hands until weve looked hard at this fact not as a metaphor not as some poetic figure of speech but as a rockhard statement of what we are we cant even begin to understand fanon and without understanding him well never get where we need to go we may move without him but only blindly wasting energy if this coherence is not present there is only a blind will toward freedom with the terribly reactionary risks which it entails our enslavers have found a new sport these days they speak of our anger black rage is a marketable passion now slickly packaged after hot processing then advertized and hustled through exclusive middlemen a while back the going commodity was black nonviolence and the cats hustling that were priest priests not prophets prophthe settler keeps alive in the native anger which he deprives of outlet the native is trapped in the tight links of the chains of colonialism the natives muscular tension finds outlet regularly in bloodthirsty explosionsin tribal warfare in feuds between septs and in quarrels between individuals ets die lean railing against their peoples suffering fighting fate priests have always managed to live well off that suffering times have changed though our slavery hasnt a new breed of priests psychiatrists have sprung up not to live off the collective pain of whole congregations but to deal in individual suffering in all commercial privacy money continues to change hands from sufferer to soothsayer but now its not a collection its a fee in place of holy scriptures to keep the faithful good and blind there are profane scribblings aimed boldly at the marketplace offering the exciting experience of black suffering to enslavers so hardened they need this splashing in someone elses blood so they can feel alive in our haste to join the scramble for the gold they drop we have forgotten rage is not the disease not even the only symptom but one among an infinity of symptoms at their root not on the marketable surface lies the real sickness we are a people destroyed a conquered people conquest is a violent destructive happening it turns the conquered into broken pliable things objects upon which the conqueror acts handling shaping manipulating them a manichean world fanon calls it strange new word but check it out it describes the universe we live in its a persian idea meaning a never ending conflict between light and dark the idea has a simple moronic appeal light is good darkness is evil from this everything follows automatically whatever is light in color is morally good everything dark is bad its a perfect descrip tion of the kernel idea around which all white culture is constructed it is the primary idea white men have worked so aggressively and so long to impose on the entire world it is the governing rule of our slave lives today the most important effect of the success of this idea is this all white people are born with inherited advantages on which to construct their lives all black people are born with inherited disadvantages they must spend time overcoming if theyre to have any kind of existence at all life in this our world is arranged with this main concern how whites can keep and increase their advantages and at the same time keep us so tied up in our disadvantages we cant do anything but suffer impotently this is the tone of life wherever the dominant power is white in america latin and anglo all over africa in those parts of asia still under white western power in australia that the original process of our conquest was violent and destructive we all know by now the destruction of africa the killing of our people the scattering of part across the earth to build a material heaven here for white christians and jews the rest remaining slaves in our homeland working to make a better life for europeans we know of all that violence this european opulence is literally scandalous for it has been founded on slavery it has been nourished on with the blood of slaves and it comes directly from the soil and the subsoil of the underdeveloped world the wellbeing and the progress of europe have been built up with the sweat and the dead bodies of negroes arabs indians and the yellow races but after this first knowledge we risk a dangerous ignorance our conquest was not a momentary act of violence that staggered our ancestors alone and then was ended our conquest was only the beginning of an endless violence our present existence is this violence continued sharpened and refined institutionalized and made such a permanent part of our lives we often suffer it without being able to understand or even notice it were things not human beings we have dreams of the human beings we could become but this western world is built to crack our dreams and wishes to break us down till our best desires shrink and vanish to be replaced with the small mean hustling ways we use to survive personally from one slave day to the next at the risk of arousing the resentment of my colored brothers will that the black man is not a man it is a world constructed to keep us slaves eternally this world in which our enslavers pursue their peculiar happinesses with such deadly ruthlessness and we learn to make adjustments to constant pain apartheid is not some sickness peculiar to the white south african soul it is the whitest most brilliant expression of western judeochristian values in africa wherever the word of white westerners is law life is arranged so white people experience it as a blessing and it hits us with the force of damnation whatever could not be molded to the shape of these their values white people in their attack on the world have simply killed south africa has a racist structure now i shall go farther and say that europe has a racist structure genocide is not a twentieth century german invention it is the root of white western values everywhere the exact basis on which white civilization rose here in north america in south america in australia in africa it is the prime method for keeping western values alive in vietnam today except the boers the americans are the only modern nation that within living memory has completely driven the autocthonous popula tion off the soil tha t it had occupied in this connection it is worth noting that the carbs experienced the same fate at the hands of french and spanish explorers and slavery isnt something we suffered accidentally and which white people stopped when they saw it was bad it is simply the destiny of all people living under white mans rule if weve grown up thinking apartheid was some special abomination in a far off place that genocide was one mad germans game and that slavery ended when some lying white man said it did its because white civilization lives on many kinds of violence and were victims of that special violence meant to kill the mind in this fanon was no exception bom in on the small french west indian island of mar tinique he grew up in a world so messed up with white western values he didnt fully realize he was black until adulthood as a youth he was clearly convinced he was a frenchman his delusion of belonging in a white french society should not be strange to black people who still consider themselves americans fanon as a young man merely went along with certain assumptions we still consider normal the west indian does not think of himself as a black man he thinks of himself as a west indian the black man lives in africa so deeply did he believe these assumptions in fact that during world war ii when the germans conquered france fanon just seventeen and quite unaware of his own slavery went off to europe to fight in defense of french freedom have remarked that certain things surprised me whenever there has been any attempt at insurrection the military authori ties ha ve ordered only colored soldiers into action they were tmen of color who nullified the liberation efforts of other t men of color the war apart from hastening his maturity generally brought him into contact with people and situations that filled his mind with questions provided him with a few answers and a multitude of hunches to work on the most important of these questions and answers came from his encounter with the reality of africa under european rule military service gave him a chance to observe western civilization in action as it affected the arabs of north africa west indians fighting on the french side and senegalese soldiers also in the french army later he was to remember wondering why the french were so concerned to indoctrinate arab africans against black africans and vice versa and why white officers always sent in black soldiers to kill other colonial peoples fighting for their freedom some ten years ago i was astonished to learn that the north africans despised men o f color it was absolutely impossible for me to make any contact with the local population i left africa and went back to france without ha ving fa thom ed the reason for this hostility with the end of the war fanon went back to france registering as a medical student at the university in lyon he had always been an intense kind of person and as he grew this quality did not disappear it got deeper realizing he lacked that cold steadiness of nerve he would have needed to be a surgeon he chose to specialize in clinical psychiatry he had no difficulty qualifying fanon who was not one of the breed of supernegroes who do fantastically well against black competition but are content to sink with a grateful sigh into mediocrity once they bump into whites his was an active intelligence that grew more alert when faced with aggressive whites instead of getting paralyzed life at the university in lyon seems to have been pleasant enough for fanon he did not suffer for lack of personal friends he married a french girl and answered suspicions that he was making a sick choice by declaring he was going into marriage with both eyes wide open the truth of that remains a private matter but its worth noting that his wife continues to live in algeria as a citizen it was she who in june in response to the french philosopher jean paulsartres antiarab proisrael position after the israeli attack ordered sartres preface dropped from all subsequent printings of fanons most important book the wretched of the earth wish to be acknowledged not as black but as white who but a white woman could do this for me by loving me she proves t h a t i a m worthy of white love i he nigerian civil war nrl represents one of the j ii r most significant active symbols of the african strugge or a larger measure of self determination and unification of the exploited people of the nonwhite world being pursued today baldly stated the nigerian civil war represents the confrontation between the positive need for unity in the national politics of africa and the temptation to seek to continue the subservient status of the continent through the fragmentation of its parts the tragedy is that this confrontation is not as openly ideological in terms of white versus nonwhite interests in nigeria as it was in the congo but the fact is that at an even more profound level than in the congo this is the true nature of the forces that keep the nigerian civil war going the federal government of nigeria has waged a most benevolent war against the forces of division ever since this is a fact that must not be lightly passed over i have worked in war zones for more than a year now and have been an eyewitness to the fantastic restraint of the federal troops what is happening is quite the opposite of naked howling savagery painted by secessionist propaganda had the surface quarrel that gave rise to the crisis remained the only issue in the war reconciliation might very well have been effected within a few short months of the start of the war but if we look back quickly on the way in which the crisis was brought into being we will discern that these deeper influences were at work every step of the way postindependence nigerian politics like postindependence politics in most of africa were largely controlled not by the desires of the masses but by the manipulations of foreign power politics and international economic interests in order to ensure the preservation of their interests the large powers with economic interests invested in the nation as well as those with economic prospects in view in the nation sought to woo and to win the allegiance of the nations rulers the pressures brought to bear on the leaders of the young nation in this way led to the inevitable result of alienation between the masses who were led and the leaders who were supposed to lead corruption and disregard of the basic democratic principles of political action became the norm one industrialist an englishman whose factory employed more than nigerians in enugu before the war admitted to me that in the postindependence political era just before the crisis broke his benevolence exercised a measure of control over local politics according to how many jobs he would promise to certain supporters of certain candidates an oil executive a dutchman has told me that similar influence was wielded by his company in port harcourt while this syndrome which was widespread in the nation was not the only factor responsible for the breakdown of the democratic experience in the nation it is symbolic of the type of influence which foreign interests wielded in the political life of the nation at the same time the nigerian army was undergoing a process of change and growth having only been handed over to the full command of nigerians in it must of course be remembered that african armies are for the most part inheritors of the colonial military tradition of oppression rather than protection the change to an army of protection and defense from that of an army of oppression must give rise to traumatic problems especially within the officer corps the army has to identify on a benevolent level with people whom in its initial stages it was employed to coerce thus when as a result of the machinations of the politicians who sought to remain in power by cultivating the support of the nations economic enemies the gulf between the nations people and its leaders grow so wide that a full scale civil crisis was precipitated the young officers who saw in the ills of the nation the ills of their army sought to remedy both by attempting to eliminate in one stroke retrogressive elements in the military and political institutions in the nation tactical errors brought down the first attempt in january the coup did not give rise to a government led by those who started it instead it had the effect of eliminating a sector of the political experience of the country without being able to replace it with the planned political alternative hence it soon became obvious after the january coup that the governmental direction forced upon the new leaders was for the most part directed by the sentiments of the coup leaders who were then in prison or in hiding and had no real basis in any long term decisions taken by the new leaders of course such a situation was bound to lead to dangerous ambiguities in the process of political existence and identity in the nation and in the struggle to grasp the very ideals of the men whose incarceration had brought them to power the new leaders especially the southern hierarchy led by major gen johnson ironsi seemed to be indifferent to some of the most blatant betrayals of those same ideals in the execution of the january coup the most tragic of these was the fact that owing to previously men tioned tactical errors the ibo political hierarchy was virtually untouched by the events of january while the north west and midwest lost nearly all their most prominent and active leaders naturally the increasing trauma of tribal and intertribal suspicion raised by this situation was ripe field for the nations enemies they did not hesitate picking the lines of weakest division the foreign jackals moved in early they sought and in some cases found willing listeners in all sections of the country among the new leaders as well as among the people they concentrated particularly on the east and the north in the east they spoke of northern domination of the troop force of the army as a potential threat to the south in the north they spoke of eastern domination of the key posts in the officer grades in the army as being a continuation of the evils that should have been destroyed by the january coup what they were in fact doing was reading the already outlined ambiguities of the situation and heightening them along unnatural lines being fully aware that the new government was insecure in its directives because it was a government by default they felt that they could stave off the eventual correction of the january mistakes which would give rise to a truly national government working for the selfsufficiency of the community and against the continued ascendancy of external interests in the economic life of the nation tragically this trick worked to an extent and a line of suspicion was drawn between even the younger officers in the army the insensitivity of the ironsi regime to this problem was remarkable if the realities had been realised early enough and the ironsi hierarchy had been able and willing to take the drastic step of honoring the ideals of the young january coup leaders then the july mutiny would have been staved off but this did not happen the july mutiny however was the best thing that could have happened at that time because it succeeded again by default in placing the issues of division squarely before the nation ironically just as the january coup could be said to have failed so can the july mutiny be seen as a failure neither action resulted in its primary aim but remarkably the failure of the july mutiny seemed to give rise at last to a government that was prepared to honor the ideals of the first coup when major general yakabu gowon stepped in to quell the mutiny he did so with a full understanding of the native grievances of the mutineers for this reason he did not seek to berate them but rather to soothe their feelings and to promise that if given a chance he would head a national government that would seek to correct the grievances that they sought to eliminate by violence in a peaceful manner obviously such a promise was not in the best interests of the nations enemies and what is more the implied government would obviously be forced to review the basic causes of the alienation of the governed from the governing in an effort to heal the breach now it became necessary for the foreign interests who were the driving force behind the continuation of this alienation to step up their efforts to maintain a position of strength in nigeria by finding and supporting any internal movement that might promote division we can now only speculate on the reasons why this search bore greater fruit in the east under lt col odumegwu ojukwu than it did in the rest of the federation under major general gowon while both are young men one ojukwu had been openly contemptuous of the mutineers in july while the other as has already been pointed out was courageous enough to admit that native grievances existed but to express the opinion that such grievances could not be remedied by the method chosen it is therefore not surprising that ojukwu should have felt that his own stand which he was not prepared to change would not be popular within the framework of a reconstructed government that based its premise of justification on the recognition of the verities inherent in the grievances exposed by the july mutiny thus it was that right from this point in an effort to gain some semblance of legitimacy for his own stand ojukwu found it necessary to overplay the essence of ethnic divisionalism present in the upheaval and to project this essence upon the national situation in such a way as to impress foreign groups with the hysteria of purported genocidal persecution given his peculiar histrionic and oratorical talents it is not surprising that he was highly successful but his success was also to a large measure predetermined by the fact that his stand suggested division and was therefore sympathetic to the dilemma of the foreign interveners whose interests were being threatened by nigerias thrust towards selfsufficiency at this point with the above outline as our guide we must examine the present state of affairs in the light of its internal shape and effect one of the first things that major general yakubu gowon tried to do was to bring about a reconciliation of the divisive forces within the army these efforts were supported at the highest level by the senior officers of every region except the east as a result a deadlock within the army developed and the last and most publicized attempt to break it was the aburi conference which took place in ghana in it must be pointed out that this conference came after ojukwus highpowered drive to ethnicize the social problems of the nation in keeping with his july stand had culminated in the muchpublicized killing of several thousand people of both eastern and northern origins in the north and in the east thus it was that aburi which should have been a military conference was really a political confrontation however treating the crisis on the military level only enormous concessions were made to ojukwus stand it was agreed that for an undefined interim period troops would be confined to their regions of origin this might not seem in the best interests of the principle of unity in the nation but as has been said before major general gowon had pledged to settle the critical situation by methods of peace and he seemed prepared to compromise his own position of power even to achieve this however immediately after ojukwu returned to enugu he met with his advisers and some foreign sympathizers and announced that the stage was now set for the final thrust to division it now seems most likely that this remarkably insidious conclusion was prompted by the fact that even before deciding to go to the conference ojukwu had been in touch with his foreign backers and had been promised their unqualified support in the event of his deciding to pull out of the federation after this last ditch move it even seems likely that none of the western powers who were then observing the nigerian situation closely were sure that the degree of rapport reached between the different parties at that meeting could actually be reached ojukwu was aware of this and did everything he could at that meeting to maintain the state of deadlock when he was unsuccessful in this he found that the only chance of success for the force of division lay in ignoring the very points that he had won in the meeting and going ahead fullsteam towards his goal of a separate nation this surmise is borne out by the fact that his own eastern advisers were wary of his proposed trip to aburi feeling that just such a degree of rapport might be reached his trip to aburi was undertaken in an atmosphere of the closest secrecy even at the point of his departure from his regional capital enugu aburi was the greatest surprise that ojukwu and his foreign supporters ever had but it is interesting to note that the first signs of division in the ranks of his native advisers especially in the military forces appeared immediately after the aburi conference and culminated eventually in the death of two of the guiding lights of the original january coup major nzeogwu ibo who was the most idealistic and fearless initiator of the original effort in january was taken out of the jail in which he had been placed by major general ironsi and forced to lead secessionist soldiers at the early battlefront near nsukka there he made an attempt to escape from the rebel side into the nigerian lines but was shot by a nigerian sentry whose alertness played no truck with political ramifications to this day senior officers in the nigerian army lament this misfortune the other highly idealistic ibo officer major emmanuel ifeajuna who sought to effect reconciliation after the aburi conference was executed for his pains by col ojukwu in enugu in september just before enugu was liberated by the federal troops but all this is a bit ahead of the sequence of events the nigerian developments following the aburi conference featured major general gowons repeated pleas for another conference to iron out whatever differences might have given foreign interests a loophole for influencing col ojukwu to ignore his most concrete gains furthermore the redeployment of troops according to their regions of origin was started but had to be halted when it became apparent that another clause of the agreement eschewing violence as a solution for the crisis was not apparently sufficiently engrained in the actions of and principles of the secessionist army commanded by ojukwu since they were then discovered to be involved in large arms deals through the agencies of such nations as portugal and south africa it was at this point that the lagos government led by major general yakubu gowon decided to turn its efforts to some of the more profound political decisions necessary to secure the future stability of a united nigeria the problem of minority ethnic groups seeking a measure of autonomy through the creation of separate states within a unified federation of states forming one united country had been for a long time one of the most pressing political problems in the nation as has been said before because of the insidious influence of foreign politics on the political life of the country prior to the military era this was one of the most vocal and visible symbols of the alienation between the masses who sought this type of unity and the politicians who sought to subjugate the labor and political forces represented by these demands in order to control the flow of foreign wealth stolen from the nation into their own pockets the federal government under major general gowon addressed itself to this problem with remarkable zeal and after a series of pulsating meetings in lagos it was decided that eight new states should be created in the nation bringing the total to this had the effect of equalizing the ratio of mass representation on the councils of central government in the federation and thus ensuring the almost immediate elimination of domination from the top which ojukwu professed to fear however when the minority forces in his own region welcomed the lagos move ojukwu prodded openly by foreign backers refused to heed their demands for a rethinking of his position in the crisis and instead declared immediate secession from the federation thus coercing more than six million of the people under his nominal rule into a state of seige these are the facts of the start of the war and they form the basis of any true understanding of the present state of the crisis that of a benevolent civil war waged from a position of unity by the federal military government of nigeria and resisted from a position of division and neocolonialist support by the secessionists led by odumegwu ojukwu all that i have said so far is a prelude to the message that i wish to impart to all black activists on the side of the forces that seek selfsufficiency and consequent self determination for black men within the nonwhite community of this world we cannot in the light of the true political implications of this war afford to make decisions or utterances harmful to the cause of unity in this nation or helpful to the forces of division in it to do so will be to condone the intervention of our emotional and economic enemies in any internal and fraternal quarrel that we might have as i said at the start of my message the nigerian civil war is one of the most significant symbols of our struggle against such intervention today the secessionists have of necessity to seek such intervention in the form of socalled aid in this light ojukwu has addressed his wonderful sense of drama to dramatising the emotional issues involved and the ethnic divisions in the country in an effort to raise the bogey of genocide and starvation as his last ditch justification for promoting the division of this nation having impressed these lies upon the moral vanguard of the neocolonial forces through agencies of religion and relief he has succeeded in sustaining his rebellion by having arms and foreign currency procured for him by these white agencies under the pretext of carrying out humanitarian duties two examples of the way in which this is done will suffice to expose the true nature of the secessionist rebellion since the socalled biafran currency is not negotiable by virture of lack of material solvency the secessionist regime obtains foreign exchange by having some of these white agencies pay the amount of money meant for the purchase of local foods into foreign banks the foods are then bought from the farmers in the rebel areas in nonnegotiable currency and given to the relief organizations arms bought in switzerland france and the u s are flown to a central pool in lisbon from where they are flown by quota to sao tome a portugueseoccupied island off the nigerian coast out of which relief organizations flying to the rebel areas operate from there they are put into relief planes along with an equivalent weightload of relief materials to be flown to the rebel areas where such planes are not allowed to land unless radio signals from sao tome indicate that the proportion of weapons to food being carried is correct these are only two of several such devices employed by the rebel regime in pursuing its aim of perpetuating division in nigeria we cannot afford to lose sight of the fact that the nations engaged in ensuring the workability of such devices are nations dedicated to the external subservience of africa and the black race to their own burgeoning economic ascendancy i have written this as an appeal and explanation black brothers working in their various ways towards the ideal of unity and unit strength for our people in several parts of the world have written asking me to clarify for them my own relationship to this crisis in this black nation because i am here you black brothers have cited my earlier writings on the subject of black force black unity black love these are the issues at stake here and only the unity represented and pursued with benevolence and dignity by the federal government without pandering to foreign sentiments can achieve the forward movement of these issues in this crisis i can only hope that this small attempt at clarifying the position will convince you that i am working towards those same ideals that we have spent so long so much of our racial lives crying for the war is nearly ended today i work for the federal government in enugu i am involved in helping to repair the bruised feelings of ibos whose leadership betrayed them into this disaster from my vantage point i can swear by all that is sacred to our cause that the nigerian army works even harder at this than it does at the business of fighting a fraternal war notwithstanding the impression given by secessionist propaganda directed by european publicity experts and which panders to the popular european belief that all black actions are savage actions the area now held by the rebels is infinitesimal the two states in the east which were created out of the minority areas there are completely free of the secessionist army reality and reason demand that in these lights those of us who are africans born outside of africa should now address all our efforts and selves to supporting nigerias cause the unity of blackness and the dignity of man wherever we are whenever we can i have lived in both worlds black and white north and south i lived in bedfordstuyvesant in brooklyn in watts in the detroitinner city and worked as a secretary in a variety of law offices usually temporary jobs which covered a great deal of law as it is practiced now after living in ann arbor for two years and becoming somewhat acquainted with the intellectual elite of michigan i am convinced that the perception gap is a fundamental factor in the racial crisis making it impossible for wellmeaning whites to begin to cope with problems which we all now realize are decisive for our future there are i think two fundamental causes for the perception gap first of all it is difficult for is very foreign to their own experience they tend to project the framework of their own thinking and experience to the life situation of other people and cannot perceive a world which is very different from their own second people tend not to perceive things which are very unpleasant upsetting and undermining to their security to understand to even state the extent and forms of exploitation to which blacks are subjected in this country involves perceiving a very unflattering picture of the state of the nation given this perception gap much of what is said about the racial crisis brilliant as it may be in terms of internal logic even when it is sincere rather than manipulative is alienated from reality and many of the programs funded expensive as they may be solve nothing the unconscious assumption behind these programs is a liberal illusion the liberal assumes that his own wealth and status is due to his virtues rather than to his privileges and from this false assumption flows his solution to the crisis remake blacks so that they become as much like whites as possible like god making man in his own image these efforts produce a thin stream of verbose aggressive efficient automatons who are placed at certain points in the structure where it is convenient to show a black face the cost of buying off militants goes up otherwise nothing changes the problem is whites even scholarsexperts on the race crisiscannot admit to themselves a simple fact which every poor black knowshas to know from daily if not hourly experience blacks are pushed to the wall because the black community is ruthlessly exploited by parasitic elements in the white community through legal semilegal and illegal means and these parasitic elements are bolstered and protected by the institutions of our society generally whatever is corrupt in the united states is multiplied and magnified to the point of grotesqueness in the black community what the french historian francois chevalier calls the law of the strong operates because blacks lack wealth power and influence they are least able to defend themselves the crucial problem is to pinpoint the legal and illegal mechanisms by which the black community is exploited and to destroy them thereby bringing about an essential redistribution of wealth and power in favor of the black community at the expense of the parasitic elements in the white community much can be accomplished through direct community action many changes are beyond the control of the black community and involve changes in local state and federal laws dealing with for example credit insurance taxation appropriations health and welfare crime and punishment as well as changes in the structures of municipal government i will briefly outline several of these parasitic mechanisms and make proposals for their destruction credit a prime target of the detroit riot was the easy credit store especially the furniture store aside from looting and arson notes of indebtedness were searched out and destroyed by the rioters the credit problem is agonizing blacks have great difficulty getting credit when they get it they pay huge interest rates usury laws do not apply to consumer credit stores which offer credit to blacks stock highpriced shoddy goods for which they deny responsibility once the contract is signed aside from consumer credit finance companies pawn shops and illegal loan sharks who collect with the gun charge escalating interest rates if pawned articles are lost or stolen the pawn shop is not legally responsible in a city like detroit where there are a handful of big employers workers live in a state of urban peonage working endless hours in a vain effort to stay on top of a hopeless accumulation of debts collection practices are barbaric collection agencies harass workers at their places of employment threatening their jobs in most states including michigan a workers wage can be seized for debt this practice is called wage garnishment at most places of employment including the auto plants a worker loses his job and is blacklisted if his wages are attached twice i would suggest a fourpronged attack on the credit problem legally restrict interest rates in consumer credit license and inspect the practices of stores doing business in the black community revoking their license for overcharging and denying responsibility for defective goods restrict collection practices outlaw wage garnishment make it illegal for a creditor or collection agency to harass a worker at his place of employment make it illegal to fire a worker for nonpayment of debts make lowinterest or interestfree loans available on the basis of need through government funds credit record or the filing of personal bankruptcy would be irrelevant to obtainina such loans imprisonment for debt when i was working for a law office in detroit a black factory worker came in with summonses to appear at the same time before two different judges on nonsupport charges for two illegitimate children in detroit an illegitimate child costs the father a month minimum and a legitimate child obviously one of the reasons for the high illegitimacy rate this man also had a wife and two children by her his story was six months before he had been working obediently in a factory when he was arrested for failing to pay traffic tickets since he could not pay them he was imprisoned for days he lost his job because he went to jail and had been unemployed for several months he had recently found another job but meanwhile he had fallen behind in his child support payments the lawyer asked him how much money he had he had but he left it with his wife to buy groceries in case he went back to jail the lawyer wouldnt take his case because he had no fee to give him this story illustrates a problem we have debtors prisons in this country full of mostly black men who are unable to pay their way out perhaps it is reasonable to put a man in jail if he is able to support his children and refuses to do so but to present a poor man with the choice money or jail when he has no money is barbaric i propose a sliding scale for traffic tickets so that the amount paid for each offense is in proportion to income fines should be minimal for people with low incomes end all forms of imprisonment for debt make the amount of bail bonds proportionate to incomehousing i would like to tell you about my own experience withhousing in detroit i moved into a furnished apartment which i rented by the week in a slum neighborhood on the east side the outside doors were badly hung from the frames and they would not close the wind blew snow into the apartment the wiring was so bad that if you touched the walls you got a shock waste water backed up into the kitchen sink when i complained to the health department the response was unless it is unsafe or unsanitary we cant do anything about it the landlord made a habit of coming into the apartment while i was working and abusing my son pulling the plug out of the refrigerator and doing other presumptuous things after he pushed my son down the steps one day i went to the police station to complain the police had to ascertain my social standing before they knew how to respond the first thing they asked was what kind of apartment i lived in the address whether it was furnished or unfurnished and if i paid by the week or by the month since it was furnished and i paid by the week that meant i had no rights at all they treated my complaint like a big joke and said its his building he has a right to do whatever he wants in it because i complained about conditions in the building my rent was substantially increased and i was given an eviction notice home ownership in itself is no solution once again the real estate racketeers create an expensive restricted market for blacks to buy homes then they profit again from barbaric practices when it comes to financing the purchase of a home i will cite my experience working in a real estate office in bedfordstuyvesant these brokers were buying very old dilapidated houses for about cash they made no repairs they just smeared cheap paint and laid cheap linoleum down then they arranged a discounted first mortgage from the bank for substantially more than the original purchase price they had already made a good profit then they sold the house with the first mortgage from the bank collected a down payment of to and put a second mortgage which the real estate brokers held of to the purchasers were paying to for the houses payments came to around a month which involved several members of the family slaving for years at lowpaying jobs to meet these payments and the homeowners are then at the mercy of crooked housing inspectors home improvement racketeers etc etc i remember an old lady who made her living scrubbing floors who came in apologetically to make the payment on the second mortgage she was two days late because she had been sick the real estate agent put his arm around her shoulder and patted her saying thats all right granny we knew you would pay my proposals are outlaw real estate agencies and brokers home improvement and construction companies should be carefully licensed legal fees scheduled work inspected for quality and home improvements financed at low interest rates through antipoverty funds criminal penalties for fraud in home improvements should be enacted apartment houses should be transferred from private ownership to cooperative ownership with individual titles to apartments allowing the occupants to deduct interest payments from their federal income tax low interest loans for purchasing homes with no down payment should be made available according to need rather than to credit standing the object is to eliminate private landlords real estate brokers and home improvement racketeers schools there are battles going on now especially in bedfordstuyvesant over community control of the schools let me explain to you once more from my own experience why i strongly favor dismantling the big city bureaucratic control over the school system and placing control in the hands of the community my son went to the fourth grade at a public school in detroit that was quite a school the children were not allowed to play on the playground since it was used as a parking lot for the teachers cars the patrol boys and girls were required to report their friends for playing on the playground one of the teachers was shaking down the kids for money he was furnished with indigent supplies for kids who couldnt afford them which the children had to buy from him for a day or they got a grade of zero the principal would not allow the children to bring their own supplies to class because she thought it was not neat for children to walk down the hallways carrying school supplies thus the teacher shook down the kids the big kids shook down the little kids the little kids shoplifted to get money etc etc the teachers maintained order by hitting the kids with a wooden paddle my son does not believe that his teachers have a right to hit him and when he was threatened with a beating he stayed home i got a call from the truant officer told him the whole story about the school and he got very agitated and said things like oh so you dont like the detroit public schools and ive worked in this neighborhood for years and no one has ever complained to me about the school and menacingly those are very serious charges even coming from children and if i were you i would complain to the school board i explained that i already had also that was moving out of the neighborhood because of the impossible conditions in the school he insisted that i tell him where was moving to and what school my son would be going to i declined to furnish that information the response of the principal was no child has ever been mistreated in this school they are all perfect nothing is ever wrong and if you complain you might get locked up or have your kid locked up after the july insurrection we drove past the school hoping it had burned down the teachers cars were still parked on the playground the signs saying no ball playing allowed were still up the only change was the fence was about ten feet higher to keep the kids in during class time and to stop them from destroying the school after school hours in his third book of poems dont cry scream brother don vs d lee urges us to know nothing less than the real enemy the real enemy one way to really appreciate what a lifesaver this kind of knowledge can be is simply to ask the question what could serve us as a blacker test for recognizing our real leaders our real sources of information insightselfassessment and direction we as black people cannot pay enough real tribute enough real attention to our real black leaders for the seriousness with which we check them out as well as preserve and keep them on our course is a clear measure of the seriousness with which we take ourselves and our efforts as a people to get out of this white prison were in the story of the games the real enemy runs on us to separate us from our own strength is not a very bad way to check out our real history in this place and furthermore nothing reflects the story of the need for solidarity more vividly than the story of black writers black literary history is loud and endless with scenes of brothers and sisters stripping each other of their arms while at war with the real enemy i saw this suicidal conflict in a very dramatic and instructive context just this past semester among black students in my english composition and literature classes at the university of wisconsinmilwaukee the two black warriors who got stripped were marvin x and jimmie garrett their plays take care of business and and we own the night the vitally black liberation lessons to be learned from them both were lost in the fury of a loud and false dispute which of the two plays was revolutionary that both were and continue to be was an answer that was quickly lost on most lord the warriors argued each other down and really went into an act ripping and slashing and nearly trampling all over the varying substance for black salvation which they should have been gathering and cherishing and recultivating towards their own black growth and their own black awareness what was lost is the simple fact that both writers are revolutionary because they are deadly serious about black unity both were looking at some of the major things that work against the efforts to keep black families together the chief conflicts concerning father and son and mother and son marvin x looks at the disastrous consequences of such a split while garrett examines one of the primary causes a white set of values joe simmons and his father never talked to one another about anythingnot even sports by the end of the play he is determined never to make that fatal mistake with his own children in garretts play johnny had to fight his mothers worship of whites at home as well as the real enemys police forces in the streets where he dies with the pale knowledge that his own mother was incapable of looking upon him her own sonor any other black manas a man now these black playwrights and their plays constitute a sort of revolutionary teamwork a very crucial and singular division of labor and what confused many of my students about the revolutionary nature of both plays was their preference for one form of revolution physical combat over another and less spectacular form they mistook the least visible for the least real but while its true that johnny and lil t and the rest of the brothers pitted body against body arm against arm concrete weapon against the government weapons of the cops they were just as concerned just as determined to pit their consciousness against the white consciousness of people like johnnys mother the acquiring of a black sense of purpose is the real rebel featured in marvin xs work though the primary business which joe simmons takes care of is the achievement of a new sense of duty as a black son and potential father he and his running buddy wes also take on the cops who nearly ran them down and over after a party we witness two different kinds of resistance at work both of which are seen as necessary to our black survival brother marvin isnt offering us both only to have us choose one the bargain is simply three black lessons for the price of two he isnt saying choose but see check out the connection between the arm that resists and the consciousness that resists black liberation depends finally on black commitment which in turn depends on black consciousness on black understanding understanding depends on knowledge or information which in turn depends on communication especially communication of the information that can only be transmitted from the old to the young remember joes problem he didnt dig his old man enough to speak to him there are times when i cant speak a positive word for eldridge cleaver especially whenever i recall the game i caught him running on readers which means us in an uncommonly vicious assault on james baldwin you need only open soul on ice to see what i mean there are a number of other places in that remarkable book where the real enemy rules supreme by using brother cleaver as a tool for cutting down the informationpacked lifeline connecting us to the thirties and forties of richard wright and chester himes and langston hughes the forties and fifties and early sixties of gwendolyn brooks and baldwin and malcolm_x instead were hooked up with some fantasy place were hooked up to dim twisted confuseblackpeople words featured in such pieces as the primary mitosis and convalescence and to some extent the white race and its heroes these are for the most part tributes to dream to wishful or incoherent thinking in a book that is otherwise notable as much for the downtoearth clarity of cleavers views as for his stunning language even though on first reading cleaver struck me in the main as the most incredible stylist since baldwin and jones the fact that his ideas were also an extension and elaboration of theirs was not altogether lost on me for instance much of the burden of soul on ice is given over to the conviction that american society is run by intricate lie machines on every level of public life intricate lie machines that produce deliberate confusion among the people here we have at least the sound black forehead of a sound black leader coming into view of course the suggestion that there are talents that precede cleavers talents that elaborate positions cleaver himself is able to stand and build on would be pretty hard to find in a piece like his notes on a native son his description of himself as one of a generation of baldwin readers like myself is truly an absolutely hypnotic tribute to baldwin his picture of him as a wright reader as a person who actually knew wright personally in the late forties when he was going through his own early paces as a writer is another affair this connection between the two so alive with lessons for anyone concerned with the inevitable writergeneration gap is in cleavers hands simply unrecognizablewhen it is present he doesnt depict these two writers as significant steps in a common thrust but as two detachable halves of the moon we are to use only one half of their combined light here take the wright side just throw baldwin and his perfumed prose over the shaky bridge into the watery darkness where rufus floats right where he done got drowneded and in another country at that but we want both brother cause both belong to us every bit as much as you cleaver do and allah would never forgive us for accepting such a selfcrippling selfblinding bargaineven from a brother don l lee had told me about cleavers article on baldwin long before i ever heard of the brother probably before i even heard of ramparts i had checked out calvin herntons double job on baldwin though in his white papers for white americans so by the time soul on ice came out i was ready to go into my act the result was a piece called incest for brothers this defense of baldwin though deadly earnest was no starched sheetpulling exercise it was a whole lot of writers fun it was one of the most liberating experiences ive ever gone through as a writer it was a real breakthrough for in order to bring my rescue plot off i had to break away from things i admired most about the baldwin essay for my purposes the finely graded sense and elaboration of the baldwin sentence just wouldnt do only cleavers own surrealistic sweeps would work so i took cleavers name calling attack as my rescue model as i tried to indicate before the stunning defiant verbal acrobatics of the cleaver style were not lost on a styleconscious dude like myself baldwins best qualities are based in large part on controlled utterance on the precise and exact elaboration of an idea or sentiment while the panther brothers sweep comes in part from the flair and very earthy resources of a brother jumping bad i also anticipated the incorrectness of the current dictum among the panthers which holds that fire cant be fought with fire that you have to use water to put it out no good i understood part of my mission using just the opposite principle baldwins mode of clarity would not work would not penetrate the lively but hysterical nonsense that paraded through cleaver and hemtons makebelieve but deadly play at critical analysis the only precise way to handle those shapeless semifreudian puddings was to resort to a farce of my own what does a baldwinite know about farce i knew what mrs rothenberg my cool advanced expository writing teacher taught me only a few months before reading cleaver she introduced be to mr jonathan swift and what did she hip me to about that irish cat why the use of what white english departments call a persona jesse b simple is a black persona a bar i stool philosopher a real character invented by brother langston hughes as a fabulous mouthpiece who were the makebelieve characters i invented to reply to cleaver and hemton why brothers eldridge and calvin along with uncle richard and father baldwin though i was offended by the namecalling tactics of the two brothers that wasnt the point of my dispute with them what truly angered me was this if youre going to write about another brother especially writers like wright and baldwin why not do so in a way that makes theour lifeline between them and us more clear not more pale more visible not deliberately hidden and more secure not shaky we are a desperate people and when you disguise the nearest exit the clearest way out youre not only being frivolous youre being a real black criminal black leaders not only need to be recognized by black people and celebrated they also need to be taken seriously once theyre spotted they need for their own collective welfare to be looked at and listened to ruthlessly close we cant afford anymore never could white divide and conquer bargains if cleaver cant help us toward the most rigorous selfexamination and selfcriticism when he opens his mouth to us as a writer then we have every right to view his mouth as a weapon turned against his own people now since baldwin is quite a veteran of disaster a man like cleaver himself and huey newton who has known very precious few survivors in this place the presumption never entered my mind that i was defending baldwin he can look after himself well enough a little panther namecalling or a lot shouldnt shake him too much harm it is we the people who have been turned upon and messed with who dont need our vision tampered with but expanded and deepened enlarged in the same way as is the case when reading cleavers lazarus come forth or on becoming or the christ and his teachings we are a desperate people looking for a way out of this prisonplace and nobody knows this better than brother cleaver himself we need our black artists to help us see ourselves see where we are where weve been where were headed baldwin no less than cleaver can show us this we need both and then some we need to see baldwins real weaknesses in order to see our own just as we need desperately to dig his real strengths and our own its a white game to discuss a black artist with the purpose of disguising and discrediting what hes really saying and we expect white lie machines like the whole white mass miscommunications networks including white publications to misuse and mangle the clear black voices that are saying things the black minds that are organizing things for our mutual benefit but can we afford to take the works of our own less than seriously look at them without raising real questions and real issues can we afford the game of pitting our joe simmons against our johnnys who would deny that we need to dig the issues and dilemmas the marvin xs and jimmie garretts create for them and us so that we can check out how theyre dealt with or not dealt with since the plight upon a black stage is simply our own beyond racism by whitney m young jr mcgrawhill book company is a curious book for two reasons first a heavy despairing hand wrote it it unfolds all of the brutalizing horrors of the black ghetto in cold sparse prose that seems to float somewhere between frigid clinical accounts and terse newspaper reporting mr young documents the hell of the young black child presents convincing data and details on the miseducation of black youth and simply lays before the reader the black mans political emasculation and economic exploitation these are harsh words how much more bitter are the lives that these words describe yet the black mans story is being told every day in every medium and in every kind of voice ranging from violent hysterical bellowstorn from the bowelsto the cold statement of fact and appeal to reason mr young chose the latter to make his point perhaps that is what is frightening about his book hp seems to be delivering the benediction in a way the final act is really over no it hasnt been lived but we all know it by heart and when we hear whitney young saying unless we can devise ways to admit black people to full participation in the social political and economic life of the larger society the bitterness and despair of the impoverished black masses will bring about the destruction of the cities we know down deep we fear when we close our eyes we see our cities settling into waste lands but black folks are indeed a strong people they are a people that survived years of criminal oppression we arise daring to hope the second curious aspect of this book is that it has a profound yet subtle and contagious hope in its lean lines ive never been so aware of both emotions in reading a book he quotes frederick douglass and raises pride and hope for in douglass we see the black mans complicity in his own hell and his salvation if there is no struggle there is no progress those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground they want rain without thunder and lightning find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both item by item area by area whitney covers them all from education to employment from police brutality to discrimination in housing and with the innocence of the youth of today he proposes he tells america what it can do to right its wrongs many of the proposals i have discussed arc practical ones which could be implemented tomorrow if america really wanted to use its resources in a rational manner to create an open society these are embarrassingly naive words they are uttered in simple honesty and seemingly with a simple faith whitney young sweeps me along with his quaint openness i say yes it really could if it wanted to yes if america wanted to and here lies the rub the jaded soul suspects the worst the despair and hope that spring from beyond racism reveals a great deal about mr young and perhaps a little about the black spirit the justified castigation and utter condemnation of america by blacks are matched with a deep faith by them that the american society can become an open one extending to all the economic educational and social opportunities now set beyond the prospects of most blacks if a revolutionary lacks this faith then he is confronted with alternatives that should lead him to a foreign land since there is little chance for a real revolution of flesh blood and steel here without a doubt the most militant revolutionaries will adamantly deny this faith but find themselves hard pressed to explain what all of their violent words are about and minor defensive actions forecast if not a faith that by some shout words and shock america can find its way to make good at long last on a promise it made to oppressed peoples this blend of despair and hope are what make mr youngs book a curious offering perhaps the black mans faith in america may be the faith by which america saves herself in addition to faith the author has a straightforward message he wants america to develop an open society a vision of an america that glories in diversity and respects the unique contributions and traditions of all of its people the open society will unite whites and blacks in true equality banish poverty rebuild the cities in greatness and he has practical suggestions for accomplishing these goals community control is suggested as one step toward rebuilding black communities the argument is persuasive certainly the evidence seems quite clear that black people are less tolerant with extremists than whites community control is nothing new most white suburban communities control and direct their local school systems and it is considered a good thing the argument that community control will perpetuate segregation is brushed aside for the ghetto has never known integration in the first place besides it is deeply dishonest to criticize community control solely because blacks want to accept a white decision not to integrate and extract from it the power and benefits that come from controlling ones schools economics and politics but again all of this logic tells just one thing the issue has never been community control the issue is racism mr young wants the highest level of government involved in the effort to habilitate america he suggests the appointment of an executive vice president for domestic development concerned with the poor and the plight of the cities it would be the responsibility of the executive vicepresident to coordinate a national effort to rid the land of poverty and to rebuild our dead cities hopefully the working poor the aged and the unemployed poor would be provided with economic security local state employment services would be transformed into national computer she kept on rereading the letter stop runp ning even nonthink ing animals stop iicv v u running you have a capable mind stop running before you are destroyed a tear trickled down her cheek why had he decided to write a letter instead of talking she looked at the letter you doubted your parents teachings but you would not question them instead you exiled yourself to europe you doubted europes humanism you doubted western values but you were afraid to question history so you exiled yourself into negritude you stopped straightening your hair and started raving about egyptian civilizations songhai empires and zulu warriors of old but that was still running you are afraid to assume responsibility sometimes you try to sound worldly and cold do what you have to do that is what people do you are wrong people do what they want to do you cannot do what you want to do you are afraid and it was not the first time that he had been critical of her ways since they had met a few years and many disagreements ago they had met at a mutual friends house the snow outside had dared them to leave as warmly dressed as they were and the snow had won the battle because hadnt they decided to stay until it had subsided and then they could freeze their way home in the slosh without having to cope with the sleet he had sipped drink after drink and she had not seemed to drink much of anythingnot even water they would talk for a while then he would go over to the window and look at the snow then get back to his drink and shake his head a little as if he were in deep thought it was after one of those trips from the window that he had said but the tide wont subside you cant sidestep so rage and blaze they burnt the mask and left the hue blue after the red blaze so with the mask gone we dance and laugh less and less and the world is blue but you cant stay blue though nor sing the blues any more she had wondered if he were slightly insane this young man talking like some kind of mystic as he talked more and more seemingly more to himself than to her or the other woman she had felt uneasy particularly if he looked at her but then again she had thought whatever he looked at he didnt seem to see he seemed to be looking way beyond it he had gone to the window again then came back and said it has subsided now ill see you home if you dont mind he had paused for a while then addressed his drink as usual young lady your little bottoms up before we leave the two women had tried in vain to suppress their almost embarrassed smiles it was cold and sloshy outside when he hailed a taxi she had wondered if she was doing the wisest thing by letting him see her home she wanted to be with him because she was intrigued by the way he talked but she was at the same time afraid to be with him because she thought he might be insane and if he were there was no telling what he might do for no reason she was conscious of she believed there was warmness and a kindness about him while this was going on in her mind a taxi stopped for them and when he opened the door of the car she just went in as though she were doing something she had no control over very much like ones actions or behavior in a dream he went in after her and started talking you know the best thing youve got going for you is that you have not lost your mask but it is walled in now she believed more and more that he was more than likely insane what is this mask thing you keep talking about thats what im talking about you dont know it because you have been taught not to but why do you think you do some of the things you do for instance here you are you do not really know if you should let me see you home or not you are afraid of me and you are not afraid of me your better judgment tells you not to do it but in spite of that for whatever reason you have let me see you home how do you i mean unh it is written all over your face again she wondered she was quiet for a while she wondered if he had some power some kind of extraordinary sense of perception which enabled him to see things going on in her mind without her saying them where are you from she asked him and she wondered why she had asked the question sun valley he said sun valley seemingly more as a reflection than as an answer to her question a long time ago your tribe did too thats where your mask comes from the sun still shines over the valley but most of the masks are obsolete or veiled and chaos and confusion abound in and around the people the taxi stopped at her address she realized at this point that she wished the ride had been longer if he was insane in some kind of way she thought there was some sort of method or order to it he scribbled his telephone number and gave it to her thats in case you want to call me some day the taxi took off to take him home he has some nerve she had thought what made him think she would want to call him but she didnt throw away his number the following day it snowed some more then it stopped and the temperature plummeted to below zero a wind arose and raged and howled in the streets and the citizenry for the next few days like an army losing morale retreated more and more indoors in the daytime the sun went on its way across the city like a teasing woman indiscriminately exposing herself but not yielding to anyone and balese kept thinking about reaitse particularly when she looked at the sun that gave off no heat was he somewhere looking out some window what would he be saying about the sun in that weird way he talked she wanted to hear him talk she called him i hope he doesnt think l would be interested in dating him or any nonsense like that she thought as she dialed his number hello unh reaitse this is balese we met at yea i know im glad you called i was just thinking about you and o damn she thought he does have some silly notions after all he must think hes got a good line talking all that weird abstract nonsense o unh you know i was calling to thank you for taking me home the other night yea yea i know that but like i was saying i was just thinking about you and the imprisonment of the mask in the name of some silly god who doesnt even have respect for life you are a funny man sometimes but the world is even funnier he went on talking he told her how in sun valley centuries ago the people had used masks to study human nature the mask was never a reproduction of the human face in the mask the face was transfigured to enable men to delve deeper into inner man in their language also the people never spoke directly about a thing they spoke around it so that it stood out more clearly then some day another tribe had come in from the sea at first the sun valleyians had thought these people might be some gods or ghosts and they had given them food and presents to make them feel at home as it was customary to treat peaceful strangers or to make peace with them should they be some angry gods or ghosts systematically the strangers from the sea had destroyed the ways of the people of the valley they had imposed their gods and their traditions on the people of sun valley they had cut up the land as they pleased deposed the kings of the valley and held the sun valleyians in bondage and now we laugh less and less he said finally and you do not even have memories of tales told by the fireside then she had known he was not insane but why the hell couldnt he talk straight about things talking like hes telling some fairy tale to some little child like that the conversation had gone on much longer than she had imagined it would she was somewhat puzzled and happy when she found him conversant with whatever she brought up for conversation they planned to get together in a few days and they did for the next few weeks they saw each other often mutual attraction developed between them or they grew into it they loved each otherthey felt and believed crazy woman hed think about her some day we might even get married months later they moved in together planning to get married they enjoyed each others company and had no significant disagreeable arguments that is until the day he told her they were almost complete strangers because she was perhaps unwilling to demolish the walls in which she was imprisoned are you high she had giggled thinking he was not serious no im low mama and the world is a blue mess im not your mother yea your biggest problem is that you are not anythings mother you do not even mother your ideas or mode of living whats that got to do with us being strangers the walls around you and the shadows prevent you from seeing anything as it really is including you you are not even in love with me you are in love with what you think i ama necessary distortion because you see me through the eyes of some woman you dont even know nor understand through the eyes of everything that denies the validity of your very existence you must be out of your mind she tried to control the flow of anger churning in her the problem with you is that you are so afraid you always settle for the most convenient answer and if there is no convenient answer you run like i said before you must be out of your stupid mind you see thats what i mean you even use anger as a means to run away but look acceptance thats where it has to start no not anger acceptance you have to realize and accept that most of the things you learned before we met the complex set of symbols you use to perceive the worldwere an attempt to bury you if you could look at it without pitying yourself and accept it then vomit the crap wed be getting into something thats what i mean when i tell you to break down those silly walls and unveil your mask because that other mask you wear every morning is a lie you smear all that junk on you to hide the real you its not the smear thats in question its the implications of the thing and when i point that out you rage or call me insane and she raged too this time more than she had ever raged before she raged so much that she left and rented a room at the ywca sleep teased her but would not come to her bed that night not only was she still exasperated she had not slept in any bed without reaitse in quite a while for the first time in her life she could hear the eerie stillness of the night when the city was asleep finally as the sun approached the eastern horizon pushing the dawn before her balese fell asleep regret accompanied reaitse that night and anguish sneered at his mind accompanied by drops of despair threatening to engulf and occupy his heart but no tears son dont cry he mused worlds full of stale tears and pain and those havent solved a single problem yet no balese i am not at wor with you all im saying is when you mistake artificial light for sunshine you are in danger woman and woeeternal unity of opposites you do not try to shut your eyes to the existence of things balese whatever things unless you want to dig your own grave i know your heart wants to strive but the walls but how expect me to watch you sinking low even in goldplated mud and just let you go when things dont jive together when you cant dance and even the air sticks a poisoned finger at your song it is time to create new wombs for a rebirth and come bursting out on the other side of time dancing laughter out the wilderness he couldnt fall asleep at the break of day he went to the beach he had always loved to watch the unrestrained movement of the waves as they leapt to caress the rocks this time he could not bear it they made him miss balese even more he went back home as the city was beginning to bustle deaf to the noise of man and machine balese woke up too late to go work but she really didnt care she hadnt planned to go anyway she called at work to report she wasnt feeling well after a quick shower she went out for a cup of coffee she was no longer angry at reaitse she thought about how happy they were together most of the time and when they were happy he was oceans of fun she smiled to herself remembering a conversation some day they had been discussing their immediatefuture plans when hed said some day ill take off to the sun with my son he loves to play with the sun how come he believes hes a god like the sun what are you not telling me do you have a son or something every day gives birth to him i see him in your eyes too youre a funny man sometimes she went back to the ywca and called reaitse hello lostandfound he teased her the words pulsed with a monumental love and she knew it he didnt wait for her to ask any questions baby let me try to explain a few things we live in a filthy world when that comes up to the surface and you see it it shakes up your inner stability because you dont want to accept that it is really that filthy im not coming back then i think you should wait and check things out thoroughly before you take a plunge like that you might regret it you might not be very happy why would i not be happy after taking the plunge why is die plunge not happiness when the filth of the world is not immediate you are happy happiness meaning what relative amount of enjoyment of life or existence out of becoming aware of things in the world you mean more than that what kind of happiness then well lets see explained by the absence of other things at midnight dying to get home instead of some hotel by yourself giggling and fooling around like a baby thinking of things that are not frustrating what ever do i think of that is not frustrating a number of things as simple as for instance looking forward to a vacation but is that happiness only because you are there its not always things but ideas your ideas concerning certain people even me you how my presence physically or in your mind how physical sexual no just being at the same place at the same time doing what doing nothing isnt that sexual if you want to limit it to that but i thought it was much more than that ill be right home she felt so much stronger than she could remember ever having felt before she didnt know why or how but this conversation had left her feeling strong enough to do anything she desired to do and right now her number one desire was to be with reaitse she had left the ywca and gone home to reaitse never again to leave because of a disagreement they were married a few months later and they could say they were happy and they would not be telling a lie occasional disagreements were there but then whose household is without those now there she stood looking at the letter reading and rereading it as though it were all in a dream perhaps it was hadnt it been that very morning that they had been so happy just before she left for work she had asked him reaitse can you be anything you want to be no baby you can be only what you really are if your life is an attempt to be reasonably happy and at peace with other men and nature why because you live under the sun you are a funny man she said getting ready to leave you know you had a funny dream last night he said what

the wrong black man from rumor and inaccurate newspaper reporting from the oppressive claustrophobic heat of a florida midsummer and from the irresistible orgiastic wave of rage and destruction that

had set foot on algerian soil it had been a brief visit a stopover on a voyage south to the new republic of guinea in algeria was an armed camp with the french colonial masters firmly in control soldiers and gendarmes were everywhere arms at the ready and many of the public buildings were protected from guerilla assault by layers of barbed wire i had entered the city from the liner foch with two young africans one from abidjan the other from brazzaville and we had moved about with relative freedom until we reached the famed casbah the incredible labyrithine quarter made famous over the world by hollywoods film algiers starring charles boyer and hedy lamarr the armed guard at the entrance to the casbah politely but firmly turned the three black visitors away offering no explanation beyond the simple statement that entrance was forbidden the africans having no urge to defy the guard suggested that we move on which we did ending our tour at one of the many sidewalk cafes which dot the citys main arteries however when the young africans returned to the foch i set out again to find access to the casbah and finally succeeded by simply walking past a french guard as if he had no right to challenge me inside the quarter i found it impossible to dispel the aura of mystery and the vague suggestion of danger this was after all simply a community of peoples with customs and a lifestyle different from my own and it was merely insulting of me to adopt toward it the attitude of disrespectful westerners capitalizing on the difference to give an impression of evil in paris an algerian friend had given me the name of a young freedom fighter in the casbah and set out to locate him the search led to a little a rab kiosk deep in the middle of the casbah where a group of hardbitten men finally encircled me then hassan the young man whose name had stepped forward i was on trial who was i where did i get his name what did i want how did i get past the guards into the cash ahthough frightened had only admiration for the cold nononsense manner in which the arabs confronted me i explained simply and honestly how came to have hassans name and how i managed to enter the casbah and they believed me the tension was relaxed they laughed they invited me to the home of one of the men where we drank coffee and talked of african liberation afterwards they walked with me down a twisting street to the entrance above the great plaza we said goodby as i strolled out a guard stopped me he asked for my papers and i showed him my american passport what was i doing in the casbah he asked didnt know that it was closed to tourists and that it was dangerous but msieur said to him mustering my best french i am a black man the algerians have no need to harm me we are fighting the same war woodie king jr has told me that ed bullins is leaving for algiers tomorrow we sit eating sweets and drinking coffee talking of black quartet the four plays woodie is producing across the street at the little gate theater i am pessimistic he is optimistic the previews open a few days away the run begins july he feels the plays still will be running in september doug turner ward comes in his play reckoning opens in september at the negro ensemble company theater i think four years ago at the new school for social research richard gilman said black playwrights were incapable of producing mature drama ward was there silent the headline in the arts and leisure section of todays new york times proclaims from the black experience a new kind of theater and the roads now lead to algiers there is a connection between the sudden explosion of black drama on the stages of america and the staging of a panafrican cultural festival in algiers what richard gilman was saying of course is that black playwrights are unimportant because they do not speak to white america in the terms the cadences and with the substance white america demands of them the proponents of black drama say simply that they speak on their own terms in their own cadences and with the substance of their own lives and experiences and to hell with the richard gilmans of this world and in algiers the black world mounts a resounding support to the black dramatists with real power behind them black writers will be free only then a moment ago in the savarin cafe the incredible fact confirmed the americans have landed on the moon the americans have landed on the moon it is not merely that i cannot get with this adventure that i do in effect resist it it is also at bottom that i wish it were not an american feat they are planting the american flag on the moon claiming the moon disclaimers of possession to the contrary notwithstanding perhaps in simple truth there is no people anywhere any better qualified technologically or emotionally suited for preeminence in the exploration of the cosmos but i have grave fears for all the worlds if this means they will be at the mercy of the american mentality how can the third world winby playing the power game or by setting the two monster nations against each other the air france airliner finally lifts off the ground minutes late for which the captain apologized over the pa system in three langauges time it is in keeping here we go into the fog out over the atlantic gaining or losing time i am never sure which in the six hoursplus journey to paris already one of the stewardesses has come to ask me if i am not someone she remembers from a previous flight quite recent i smile and say no it is possible of course that she was on the flight from amsterdam to paris last may but i think not i dont even remember if i flew air france in in and yes but she would hardly remember that far back it does not matter i am always being mistaken for someone else i dont understand it perhaps it has something to do with time and place perhaps i am someone elsesitting aboard the caravelle waiting for the plane to take off for algiers the french ground crew is still fussing with the plane in the bus riding from the terminal to the plane i watched the faces and the attitudes of the french and algerian passengers the french are still the rulers haughty remote the algerians remain the ruled the mark of oppression is there the docility the herdinstinct the absence of confidence the deference and all the algerians are in shirt jacket tie the key figure the wispy little frenchman wearing kid gloves in midjuly looking down his nose at the algerians the quintescent colonialist an insignificant man elevated to importance by the fact of his europeanness among the barbarians and i think it is always so the colonist rules with the complicity of the colonized why should these algerians tolerate a creature like the frenchman an academic question in dakar the black intellectuals play at being french you should come and live here your pace is too swift in america you could have a villa servants and the squalor of the medina the algerians are wearing french clothes there are none of them in boubous or jellabas how do they feel about their traditional dress they are probably very much like the african evoluesexcept that even the most europeanized black africans occasionally will wear boubous dashikis and agbabas and black americansthose who want most to be american are terribly threatened by dashikis they accepted the nehru suits and jackets and some of them even wore the mao shirts but dashikis thrust upon them images they cannot yet accept how they welcomed the tom mboya article chiding black americans for seeking to identify with africans by affecting those symbols of african povertysandals and dashikis the white press of course gave wide coverage to what was intended as a slap in the face to the black nationalists but as usual neither the white press nor its sycophants the black integrationists have much understanding of the black consciousness movement the spiritual identification with africa and the third world has little directly to do with literal emulation of african clothing and customs it has more to do with a rejection of things western spirit in the east but the fact that mboya seemed not to know the difference tells a great deal about mboya and his apparent suggestion that africans want to and shouldadopt european style clothing seems almost naive nothing seems sillier than africans racing around in all that heat wearing shirts ties and suits to say nothing of shoes and stockings why shouldnt they wear boubous sandals and dashikiswhich are perfectly suited for the climate why should affluence and sophistication be equated with the wearing of the impractical clothes of europe watching the thousands of algerian young men thronging the streets they are everywhere in noisy groups sitting on curbs standing at bars and bus stops simply roaming aboutone is impressed with several facts first of the utter waste of potential manpower and political power harnessed the energy of all these youths could transform algeria into an important country and possibly a wealthy one also one is aware of the absurdityno the monstrousnessof such a handsome and vigorous people being ruled all these decades by the french and beyond that of course one considers the absurdity of the white races long hegemony over the other races of mankind and finally in the streets of algiers one understands the outrageousness of little israels successful defiance of the entire arab world one acknowledges of course israels great debt to america for her success the problem of all the worlds underdeveloped people is highlighted here properly politicized indoctrinated in an ideology which would mobilize both their sense of racial pride and their sense of destiny the young men of algeria could literally overrun israel trample it to death the afroamerican center is for all practical purposes intent merely a showcase for the black_panther and for all party eldridge cleaver handled himself very well indeed at the press conference today kathleen cleaver very pregnant looked lovely she was subdued wifely stokely carmichael was in the garden of the hotel st george talking with charlie cobb and the washington d c delegation when we junius griffin and i returned stokely has behaved with maturity refusing to allow the press and provocateurs to draw him into a nonperformedproductive feud with cleavers forces cleaver also has commendably although the two men have some fundamental disagreements they seem to understand that no real purpose can be served in airing these differences before the world and mostly antagonistic press the world still belongs to the white man though decreasingly so they move about with assurance and control which the formerly colonized peoples have not yet mastered in their bones and which consequently they emulate rather clumsily but emulation is the key what they need is their own style their own approach what is most important about the presence here of eldridge cleaver and stokely carmichael lies in the movement toward unity of all african peoples the political implications of their reception on this continent are profound two of the revolutionary leaders of the american blacks exiled for their beliefs and activities have found refuge in africa defiance of the great economic and military power of america raymonde and jean briere and his wife on monday that makes a total of five familiar faces from dakar in the lobby this morning the pretty little black american girl from milwaukee valerie stopped to chat she is it turns out making it on her own working with the horace jenkins filming crew and accepting the patronage of an american lady she lives she says in paris and came down to algiers on a fourthclass boat there is another pretty little black girl down from paris she was imported for the cast of hair took a few days off three of the young people manning the black_panther party exhibit indicated that they now use paris as headquarters a healthy trend young blacks increasingly prowling the world traveling not only will broaden them it will make it all the more improbable that returning home they will adapt to the role america has designated for them the group from washington has a certain quiet endearing style balanced without illusions but not without humor charlie cobb reports that the bookshop is finally in the black jean wheeler smith who has been working on a novel indicates that she is wrestling with the project im not sure i know what a novel is jimmie garrett looks more like everybodys goodnatured kid brother than a playwright and there is vinie burrows a startlingly beautiful woman with her nineyearold son and fouryearold daughter in tow why isnt she better known why dont black americans pay homage to their own she has been invited to eastern europe but she has not been seen in chicago i have been told by mme briere that her husband jean the haitian poet is busy writing a poem to be dedicated to president hourari bournediene and i do not wish to disturb him and yet i feel it important that he know of the presence of two members of the new generation of black american writers and that they know who he is and so i introduce him to ed bullins and don l lee thinking of jean and of amadou mahtar mbow who also is on the terrace with his wife raymonde and their son it occurs to me that the black world is a far more complex and integrated one than we sometimes realize jean for example is in exile from haiti living in senegal where he is a key member of the cultural arm of the government and his wife is americanborn senegal haiti and america are linked in them with the mbows another country franceis brought directly into the linkage raymonde is haitian i met her in when she and mahtar visited her sister mme raoul beauvoir who lived in my building in chicago she was educated in paris where her father still lives and where her son is in school mahtar comes from an old and respected senegalese family once based in ancient st louis at the northern tip of the country when i first went down to senegal for a stay of several months in december mahtar and raymonde were teachers in the equivalent of a special american high school there was considerable feeling among black educators in the country that mahtar should have been president of the university of dakar but that institution wasand iscontrolled by europeans leopold senghor was aware of the popular sentiment favoring mahtar apparently for he later elevated him to minister of education i do not know what combination of forces or events prompted president senghor to switch mahtar from education to culture perhaps the continuing unrest in the university which is pressuring for africanization of the university but mahtar is in algiers as minister of culture and of course as leader of the senegalese delegation to the symposium a personable and intelligent man with no illusions at all as to what africa must have and of what will be necessary to get it jean briere informs me that mercer cooks wife vashti who i first met in dakar when mercer was ambassador died several months ago in washington not only that but he says that mercer is with his son in chicago i come all the way from chicago to africa to discover that is language the only barrier to closer ties between the afroamericans and the algerians watching stokely carmichael moving about the terrace and the gardens of the hotel chatting with old friends and with representatives of african governments i think that perhaps at long last the era is ended wherein the boldest and most imaginative of our young black men are predoomed to an early death or to eternal crippling by imprisonment all perceptive black americans know that american prisons are filled to overflowing with some of the finest minds and the most aggressive spirits from the black community but their very ingenuity and vitality of course insured their defeat in a racist and repressive system like americas such men are indeed great threatsnot to the precious american law and order of course but to american duplicity and conspiracy against equal opportunity and justice the list of villains who are in fact black heroes is long el hajj malik el shabazz marcus garvey angelo herndon paul robeson eldridge cleaver leroi jones in the past strong black men who defied the system had no place to go once the forces of repression cornered them and those forces tragically include those moderate negro leaders who always can be trotted out as examples to the black community of what an acceptable negro ought to be but now the black worldand increasingly portions of the third worldis the new refuge the game stokely has elected to play is no less dangerous in africa than it was in mississippi but then stokely knows that very well he has walked openeyed into his new adventure the stakes are very large indeed and all the world knows that the cia plays for keeps those who respect stokely will be pleased to know that he wears a new maturity and wears it well he lives now in a remote villa in the mountains in the interior of guinea where the climate is mild and he works closely with deposed kwame nkrumah in the former rulers campaign to reclaim his position of leadership in the country he led to independence when will stokely return to americawhen i have accomplished something worthwhile is his answer the days of innocence when thousands of bright black youths put their faith in sncc seem eons away not a mere three or four yearsthe site of the festival symposium on african culture its reality its role in the liberation struggle in the consolidation of african unity and the economic and social development of africa is this sprawling sumptuous complex on the sea kilometers from algiers the conferfence center is an integrated unit with one of the pleasantest auditoriums i have ever seen fully equipped for simultaneous translation of speeches into three langauges french english and arabic it sits on a hill above the splendid white beach and a score of huge villas stretch out beyond the complex was built for a major united nations conference two years ago there are shops several restaurants a security center a press center several luxurious lounges a postoffice the speeches are boring perhaps the collected papers will make a book of some interest but there is no fire no inspiration they are all diplomats the spokesmens countries are all dependent upon the colonialist powers for crucial aid and so they are wary careful very intellectual and general in their attacks and condemnations the real talk the meaningful dialogue is being held where it is being held at allin the hotel rooms over dinner at the hotel allite and the st george in the two or three posh restaurants around the city the exception to the general blandness of the speeches was understandably the address by the representative of the democratic republic of vietnam vice minister of culture haxuantruong he dealt even the speech of alex la guma the exiled writer from south africa seemed pale and full of cliches and yet it was a real speech dealing with the oppression of the nonwhite peoples of his homeland what will all the talk availfor that matter what will all the dancing on the stages and in the streets availwhat africans need are guns and the will to use them is it true as president boumediene said in his opening address that culture is a weapon in our struggle for liberationwell of course i think it is true the people will not demand guns and they will see no need to use them until they understand who they are what their possibilities are and the forces which stand in the way of their realizing their potentialities i do not regret not having seen all the theatrical presentations and the dance troupes most of them i saw three years ago during the first world festival of negro arts at dakar they are delightful but they become monotonous after awhile when reginald wilson of detroit and i went up to the museum of fine arts to see the special exhibition of african art we ran headlong into african bureaucracy and pageantry we could not see the show until after the dignitaries had arrived and been escorted through although we arrived at the appointed time however the exhibition at dakar would be extremely difficult to match the arts and crafts exhibits in the university center in town were generally absorbing the stuff shown would sell well in shops in america i went again alone into the casbah which no longer seems even mysterious the people no longer feel shut off from their own city it belongs to them i bought five dinars worth of candy and tried to distribute it to the children but so many of them descended upon me with such fervor that i realized that it was a mistake a friendly arab rescued me and to show his thanks for my kindness to the children insisted that i be his guest for drinks at a cafe at the base of the casbah ted joans was a discovery i have known of the mans work for a number of years but meeting him was a joy marvin x has written of don l lee that don is a poem ted is a poem a warm unaffectedbut tremendously affectingman as free as a man is likely to be it was fun tramping over algiers with ted and don and michele russell watching ted in his enthusiasm and guilelessness being as alive and open as a child i missed the meetings with a fatah the single group present more popular with the hordes of algerian youths than the black_panthers but i went down to see their headquarters they are indeed heroic figures they apparently are particularly interested in making contact with the american blacks and vice versa a fatah is stronger than any arab government strong enough to cross all the frontiers to command the sympathy of arabs everywhere it is both comforting and unsettling in the struggle to come will there be a force in the black community able to excite that kind of support dissidence a meeting of writers is called by joseph o o okpaku editor of the americanpublished journal of the new african literature and a handful of writers and interested persons show up i have not much time for i want to talk with mahtar mbow before i leave the city okpaku is concernedand rightly so i feelabout the irrelevance of the presentations at the symposium he talks of the writers descending upon the club des pins in a group seizing the mircrophones and proceeding to deal with real revolutionary ideas and means none of the american writers are present perhaps they have not heard of the meeting there is an american girl from new orleans who is working with some international agency in monrovia i ask her if the liberians are still behaving like bad caricatures of white american stereotypes of africans and i suppose that i pressure her into some admission that in some cases it is true they still dress up in full formal regalia in all that stifling heat she says but she likes the country john d a okai the ghanaian writer is there i do not tell him that i have seen his poem in the new issue of african artstarts dafrique because i do not remember what it is about and cannot truthfully say whether i like it he does not seem stuffily british it is good to observe but i find myself wondering why he is living in london the question is dangerous i know from experience and i have no right to ask it and yet being concerned as i am with the acquisition of power in all of black africa i am always disapproving unfairly or not of the bright and talented africans spending their energies in europe and america janheinz jahn his friend ulla and his elder son are present i do not tell jan that the new york times has asked me to review his new book new african literature a history of black writing for i am not certain i have time to read the book and write the review by the august deadline there is a south african present a colored who identifies himself as a writer but i do not ask him to repeat his name unlike okai he seems veddy veddy british and i find with regret that i am depressed about the whole assembly and have no wish to get involved i find myself supporting the idea of dissent from the formal papers being presented at the symposium and yet i wonder what resonance can be achieved by the objections these people will make are the black africans and the algerians reaching out to touch each other today chatting with ben enwonwu the nigerian sculptor the impotence of africa was brought home to me anew enwonwu is growing old he speaks now of all the old onesof langston hughes and paul robeson and peter abrahams one dead one quite seriously ill and one in quiet exile in the hills of jamaica enwonwu is serving his country diligently at the festival not missing a single session although he is obviously tired and wishes to relax more important still he is so busy at home with matters of official government concern that he has no time to create and what is an artist who cannot work he wants desperately to be free and yet a sense of patriotism drives him on with his mundane chores but he is disheartened at the same time by many things at home he seems not to be sure that his countrys leaders are certain of the path they have taken or that they are fully conscious of the terrors which have been unleashed in the taking of that path and he is heartbroken about the treatment of wole soyinka the great playwright who is going blind in prison like most of the rest of the world enwonwu cannot understand how his own country can be party to the cruel punishmentperhaps the destructionof one of its leading artists but the detainment and treatment of soyinka illustrate the precariousness of political power in africa and if political power is so uncertain is to be so jealously guarded how can the government turn its full attention to the acquisition of economic power which alone will bring about the true liberation of africa i am thinking now of the evening in detroit after my return from guinea in entertaining my friend fred hart williams block club with my photos and artifacts from africa the forced expressions of enthusiasm from the polite middleclass ladies the uneasiness provoked by the lecture and finally the little canadianborn man whose parents had fled slavery in kentucky to the free soil of canada turning impatiently flush with the success he had made of his life in america saying we are not africans look at us we are as much white as black and dont tell us about colonialism we read the papers we see television we know how most of the people in the world live and we are much better off it was a terrible moment but it has passed fred hart who was embarrassed by his old acquaintance would be proud of the new crop of young blacks moving out over the african continent to find and enrich their past to nourish their roots but more than that of course so much more the new ones have no hunger to be embraced by america they will surrender no portion of their dignity to that passion they have turned eastward toward the spirituality and the peace of africa and the orient their natural sphere it is not simply courage which permits them to say no to america and her values it is also a recognitionboth guttural and instinctivethat the emptiness of those values lead only to death africa is both the old world and the new boumediene knows that kwame nkrumah knows it julius nyerere knows it patrice lumumba also knew it it is a dangerous knowledge epilogue we are aboard the air france caravelle flying north over the mediterranean toward europe junius griffin tries to pay for champagne with leftover dinars and the french hostess tells him we dont accept algerian money i am not annoyed the positive feeling toward the festival and all that transpired there in the anomalous white facaded city now fading in the blue african mist cannot be ruined by the arrogance of frenchmen why do i feel positivei suppose the feeling has as much to do with the relative efficiency of the algerian handling of the difficult business of processing housing and managing the sudden deluge of thousands of visitors as it does with the conviction that the elusive and somewhat enigmatic hourari boumediene will lead his country toward true independence and power there were frustrating moments i admit but the algerians were generally accommodating congenial understanding and considering that they had no experience in mounting and conducting an event of so monumental a magnitude their performance was superb i find that i have no reservations about the countrys internal political situation it is a revolutionary government and even the detainment of ben bella while regrettable can be explained in that light what of ben bella i asked young abdul the hotel guide he is well msieur it is a question of the security of the revolution i did not ask of moise t shorn be for that might have been interpreted as an accusation and tshorn be was not worth the semblance of concern the benedict arnold of the congo the quisling of africa it is of course a question americans will ask ignoring the implications of the denial of leroi jones right to leave the country the cia it is always an interesting game at gatherings of disaffected blacks to speculate on the identity of the american agents and some grow paranoid in the process labeling innocents all in the game in the taxi hurtling through the mrv ing streets en route to the airport i noted that i had not seen a single train in a week even though had been whisked in test pilotstyle along the corniche adjacent to the tracks several times i was thinking of industry there are many factories the french les piedsnors invested much of themselves in the usines around the lovely country and one understands why they held on so tenaciously but that is in the past algiers is moving forward and with defiance and she wants to take the rest of africa with her godspeed the black aesthetic by ameer baraka doc s aesthetic m ea n

is hot let i t burn more brightl y let it light up all creation the intent is the guide the direction as maulana karenga las said all that we do as black artists must commit us collectively to rev olution collective and committing the purpose itself is the spirit path without the spirit the blackness is a mask of minor interest a stutter or a n ote li qht i tlc tnswer and tjunderst and this is to be committed through faith to its existence poetry isjingling lacewithout purpose light has a style blackness is a force all the power must be summoned from everywhere it exists as real power its

more energy the combinations exist and will exist the double clutching tripple stopping tipple tonguing intelligence is evolving and learning and meditating at incredible speeds the new poetry is structures of governmet and shapes of cities the boomaloom of words will shape a vision scattered from johnny boys mouth and carry all the street noise as mass music and sphere image to destroy and

and clothe them in the beauty of god that is where its at and yeh man do it well incredibly well black poetrywhere its at in the amount of black poetry being published we have also seen a change in style and subject matter at this point being written that is to say all brack poets dont write the same kind of poetry or all black poems aint the same kind they differ just as white poems differ do and ju st as white poems come in sonnets ballads or whatever i have attempted to place all black poetry in several broad categories all of which have variations on the main form very few poems are all one type or another it is possible and probable that a poem will be three or four different types of poetry at one time that is a signifying poem will be a teachin spaced py ramid poem here are the main head mgs signifying a open b sly c with or about teachin rappin coversoffa rundown b hipto c digupdcoatpull spac ed spiritual a mindblower fantasy b coolout bein selfreflective a upinself b uptight c deajinswingin love a skin b space spiritual c cosmic ancestral shoutin angrycathartic a badmouth b c f acetoface two faced warningconfrontation irony jazz a rifiin b cosmic trane c groun ded lewis du wah a ditty bop b bebop pamid getting us to gethe i buildingnationhood some of these categories are self explanatory and familiar most poems as previously stated fall into more than one category which to my way of thinking attests to the flexibility of black writers unconsciously i think poets fall into their bag or bags and it is no discredit to a writer if he chooses to deal with only one form or two or three however a black writer will be classifiable in at least one of these categories although it is conceivable to me that black writers are creative enough to uncover forns which are yet to be acknowledged we will know if the writing is black briefly i am going to give examples of several of the headings and then devote a large amount of discussion to signifying poetry since it has reached an exciting unprecedented level of sophistication in the written word the teachin poem is a poem which seeks to define and give direction to black people the two examples chosen and quoted in part here are ronda daviss towards a black aesthetic and barbara mahones what color is black if tomorrows black poetry will not explain what is but be it then pens will be electric with feeling igniting and the paper shall become the poet and the poets shall be earthclouds and mahone black is the color of ronda davis my little brothers mind the grey streaks in my mothers hair black is the color of my yellow cousins smile the scars upon my neighbors wrinkled face the coversofj rundown hip to dig up or coatpull are basically the same type of poem so the terms can be used interchangeably there are many many examples of this kind of poem today for example cleveland webbers poem from his recently released book of poetry afica africa afica in america the people are in all the areas we occupy little parts of air telling little lies taking little trips at least days a week or don ghetto streets get empty while internalized in a suffering too old to l lees poem on nigerian unity the pig be is little niggers killing little niggers the weak against the weak the ugly against the ugly these poets hip you to something pull the covers off of something or run it down to you or ask you to just dig it your coat is being pulled the spaced poem is very beautiful and many black poets after writing a lot of signify ing coversofj or shoutin poems find that an inner calm becomes and inherent in that a mystical and positive way of looking at the black mans relationship to the universe ameer baraka leroi jones has a poem called black people this is our destiny and i quote from it here we go to meet the realization of makers knowing who we are knowing how to live and what life is we must spin through in our seven adventures in the endlessness of all existing feeling all existing forms of lif e the gasses the plants the ghosts minerals the spirits the souls the light in the stillness where the stortn the glow the nothing in god is complete except there is nothing to be incomplete the pulse and change of rhythm blown flight to be anything at all vibration holy nuance beating against itself a rhythm a playing reunderstood now by one of the st race the primitives the first men who evolve again to civilize the world the space d poem returns to the spiritual wisdom of our egyptian african forefathers returns to the natural laws the natural state of man before subhuman massacres spaced poems say that our ancestors are in the air and will communicate with us as is the case in jones no matter no matter the world is the world a broke dead genius moved on to dust will touch you one night and the stacked dust of a gone brother will hunch you some father you needed who left you we speak of the vibrations positive and negative and we believe again in what we have never truly deniedthe power of nommojuju and the collective force of the positive spirits moving in time with the universe in our poetry we sing of sunra and coltrane and their lifemotion which is sound the new black poets believethatwe are the seventh dimension as the seventhsun son they further believe in the overallimportance of the astrologicalsigns of people the writer is sagittarius no the dream is to utilizeour beginning to conceptualize and direct a black endthatisas beautiful as our beginning the mindblower poem may seem similar to the spaced poem but the two are not to be confused there are basic differences mindblower poems seek to expand our minds to break the chains that strangle them so that we can begin to imagine alternatives for black people they seek to ridicule and mutilate that which may have formerly been esteemed often these poems predict an awful or glorious future and are gorier than the spaced poem sometimes the a w ful predictions are for black people oftener for subhumans larry neal in his book black boogaloo in an untitled poem says we gathered in the open place piled their symbols one on top of the other their flags and their death books took their holidays rolled their platitudes into nice burnable heaps gathered and piled this stuff from the stink pots of the earth which they have made so in the distance their cities burn we piled their histories skyward with destruction acknowledgement to our ancestors and gods then we light it singing by contrast is jewel latimores folk fable but the niggaswadnt hip wadnt hipped until they was copped too to work in the mines on the moon the ships had promises had names that all the niggas knew names like jesus heaven freedom to take the niggas to a new world when they was shipped to the moon mainland sold to companies who was bidden while the chasemanhattan bank supervised the auctions or ebons poem the statue of liberty has her back to harlem two other alternate titles excluded isaw them bayonet her spine and pin her th birthday to a cross whereithung dank and slimcy it hung like stagnant death in shallow pools vomiting blood on poets and mothers and flower children surely he was talking about them and he is a master of the gory every poet has written a bein poem in fact most poets start off writing them just writing about the way they be they friends be they lovers be the world be an example presented here is one of my own from my book songs of a blackbirdits me bathed and ashy smellin down with revions aquamarine me with my hair black and nappy good and rough as the ground me sitting in my panties itsme inthe sky where pharoah and coltrane playing and its me screammmmmmmming into the box and the box isscreammmmmmmming back inkuluse karma and allpraise is due allah we are now getting more more more lovepoemsfromaboutblack men and women such is this fragile jewel of barbara mahones the poem with your permission combines skin space spiritual aspects as they should besmooth surf aces are easy i would rather deal with what moves you explore the fire and texture of your soul with your pert nission i would chart a course across your skin and travel all day all night up and down that rocky road and one black warrior william wandick writes spears of honey my eyes took your slender fingers dreamed on them they thinned imagination to a queen called shebanefertiti deeming you royalnessmakinga fetish of your hand and there are love poems for all black people such as ronda daviss poem about the wine dipped woman and we need more and more more the shoutin poem is perhaps at this time the most familiar to us all for awhile it seemed to be the only kind of poem being written it usually tells the subhuman off or offs him with word bullets an example of the fa cetoface poem which is an aspect of the shoutin type is one written by sonia sanchez in her hardhitting book of poetry h omecominggit the word out now to the manboy taking a holiday from murder tell him we hip to his shit and that the next time he kills one of our blkprinces some of his faggots gonna die a stonecolddeath yeah the last category with which i will deal briefly is the two fac ed poem as kids we used to call a person twof aced if they grinned in our faces and talked about us behind our backs in poetry this concept takes on similar but broader meanings for example i will use my poem you name it will write about things that are universal so that hundreds maybe even thousands of years from now white critics and readers will say of me here is a good black writer who wrote about truth and univesal topics i will write about people who eat as it was in the beginning i will write about people who sleep s now i will write about people who fuck and ever shall i will write about babies being born world without end i will write about black people repossessing this earth ahmen iwould hope that everyone who reads the poem catches the two facededness irony implicit in the theme signify ing poetry holds a specialfascination for me probably because icould notcan not signify and have always admired those who can from a literary point of view it is a significant exciting aspect of todays poetry iknow and you know that we have always signified on the corners in the poolrooms the playgrounds anywhere and everywhere we have had the opportunity we sig with somebody about somebody and if we cant be open about it we sig on the sly langston hughes character simplesignified with his landlady his partners his girlfriend everybody and richard wright deals it in black boy however to my knowledge no grotlp of black writers has ever used it as a poetic technique as much as todays writers it is done with polish and the audienceslove it too much signifying can be negative ithink however most of todays poets are very conscious of how important positive vibrations are and few have carried signification to an extreme in the main it is being used for constructive destruction a quick or lengthy look at the poetry of don l lee nikki giovanni or sonia sanchez shows that these three poets signif y with their readers and the objects of their poems signify fuh days wallace for president his mamma for vicepresident don l lee andmemorial the supremes cuz they dead soniasanchez or nikki giovanniever notice how its only the ugly honkies who hate and of course the master of it all ameer baraka leroi jones on wigs starter why dont you take that thing off yo haid you look like miss muffet in a runaway ugly machine imean like that signifying is a way of saying the truth that hurts with a laugh a way of capping on shutting up someone getting even talking bout peoples mammas such its a lovehate exercise in exorcising ones hostilities its a funny way of saying something negative that is obviously untrue like you look like you been whupped wid uh ugly stick or saying something that is negative as niggerstanding on the corner thought him was cool him still standing there its winter time him cool signifying is very often a bloody knife job with a vocal touch it moves in progressions sometimes and it is both general and specific in black boy by richard wright we are taken through a dozens scene or signifying scene to me they are the same and each phrase is labeled in terms of its significance you eat yet uneasily trying to make conversation yeah man idone really fed my face casually i had cabbage potatoes confidently i had buttermilk blackeye peas meekly informational hell iaint gonna stand near you nigger pronouncement how come feigned innocence cause you gonna smell up this air in a minutes a shouted accusation nigger your minds in a ditch amusingly moralistic ditch nothing nigger you going to break wind any minute now triumphant pronou ncement creating suspense yeah when them blackeyed peas tell that butternilk to move overthatbuttermilk aint gonna wanna move and theres gonna be war in your guts and your stomachs gonna swell up and bust climax as you see every line leads up to the cap the final one and the last statement is based on a reality that all blacks know peas buttermilk cabbage potatoes will cause you to fart it is a fourtofour balanced way of mak ing love to while poking hurtfun at ones self and ones lifestyles a great deal of what todays poets do is hit run signifying or another way of saying it spot signif y ing that is they do not usually sustain the length of a standard signifying circle but they are traveling too fast they hitand keep on moving to the next pointyo mamma your daddy too or booing senator ribicoff no pretty man himself but at least out of the beast category nikki giovanni the poets signify withabout a whole lot of people in one poem hitting one then another and usually though not always one theme holds the poem together when two people signify with each other one feeds the other for progression dramatic buildup to impact but the object of ridicule doesnt have to be around or vocalresponses can be imagined or drawn from the poets own experiencesyou followed him niggers all of youyes you did isaw ya implied response no i didnt don llee now because signifying often contains such a broad base of truth it has been known to cause in fact it is famous for causing a fight or a death it can get too down too real so true and personal it uncovers too much if the signif yer can really get down and in grammar school the last word was yo mama is uh man the second party who cannot move his tongue to balance the scale may use his fists to do so or his knife or both and it is a matter of pride no black person wants to be sigged about or capped all over no black person can listen to some jignifying without responding in some way it pulls us in and we identify with the bad signifyer obviously this style of poetry has the power to involve black people and to move them it is a familiar mover and is probably the most dynamic type of poetry i have mentioned up to now itrust thatihave initiated here arather complete incomplete picture of where black poetry is at some may quibble with the actual attempt to i label what black writers are doingothers may take issue with the labels i we do not it cannot be said too often want subhumans defining what we be doing there is no human reference point and objectivity does not really exist in criticism there is perhaps reason tempered by a good strong sense of what is reasonable what is fair ultimately ones lifestyle is his point of view black poetry is becoming what it has always been but has not quite beedand we have love and the spirit of our ancestorsto guide us good evening regal lady what can we do for you queens are a bit out of date these days replaced as it were by a royalty of spirit so though you are queenly indeed we cannot crown you ruler of a realm however there are few other roles you cannot play upon lifes broad and varied stage what is your fancy is it something unpretentious but highly essential such as housewife nurse secretary teacher or is it somethingmore complex and challenging physician for example or attorney at law or scientist or actress or artist we are preparing the way for youfor it is our pleasure as well as our duty to do soand in return we ask only this of you honor your past treasure the words of playwright lorraine hansberry have sustained one of the most
