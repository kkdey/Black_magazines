in the souls of black folk web du bois £ observes that black  americans must so to speak look at the world through two separate lenses one lens scanning the scene as it is on the surface while the other refocuses according to the adjusted meaning for the black individuals lifechances consequently the black ego consists of two selfimages one black the other white between these two selves there looms a continual lifedeath struggle in which the white self is an object to the subjective black self the black self is spontaneous and natural restrained and restrictive for the black individual the drama of thinking conceiving judging believing reasoning deciding reacting expecting  in short existing is to resist the tyrannical impositions of the exterior white self on the stage of existence today the mirror of the black persons looking glass self is white contradicting and negating the black ego this dooms the fainthearted black individual to think in a white framework confusing and contradictory contending on the pushpull scale of color prejudice pushed from the security of what otherwise would be his blackness into the grasping abyss of an alien and destructive whiteness yet unlike other animals man while influenced by phenomena external to himself is not a slave to his circumstances past or present where lower animals rely on instinct and the nature of the habitat man is capable of resorting to strategy and reasonthough many do not indeed mans scientific name homo sapiens is translated thinking man although scientists also toyed with then discarded the label homo loquens or talking man which admittedly characterizes the major ity of us accurately but in a fundamental sense man is distinguished from other animals by his ability to thinkwhich is in the ideal sense an important prelude to thinkingand is capable of choosing between two or more ideas or alternatives rejecting one or both of them cicero was aware of this in his treatise on friendship when he stated wise men are instructed by reason men of less understanding by experience the most ignorant by necessity beasts by nature history let alone the biographies of individuals is a testimony to mans ability to rise above the surface of his circumstances as black men are now beginning to do said cicero further vivere est cogitore to think is to live it is not merely to contemplate the dictionary lists  connotations of thinking we have chosen one of them to keep continually in mind be obsessed with as he thinks model airplanes all day long in other words to think is to live to think black is to live black to think black is to feel black look black so far as we can and be black to think black is to question whiteness and its values and the contradictions and irrationalities of white society however thinking black does not addict oneself alone to combating whiteness to do so would place the black individual all over again in a neosubordinate role reacting instead of initiating action to react to whiteness exclusively is to fall victim to a kind of reactionformation this in a roundabout way itself acknowledges the supremacy of whiteness it gives rise to symbolic behavior enslaved by the dictates of white decrees it is like a fighter always on the defensive seldom or never putting forth an offensive thrust absolute negativism is rigidly defensive a good contestant needs both a good defense and a good offense but most of all a good offense thinking black far from getting bogged down in dogmatic nihilism is based on a philosophy of pragmatic positivism more about that later we may divide the processes of thinking black for the purposes of discussion into a sixpronged attack the plasma of black thinking the plasma of black thinking may be categorized as follows pphysiognomy llanguage aartifacts ssickness mmathematics and aaudaciousness  physiognomy this refers to the system of defining white characteristics as desirable black as undesirable which must be reversed in order to think black the motivations behind the negative physiognomy of blackness have a  long history from the beginning blacks subjugated in slavery were subjected to a system of whitewashing this included control over their minds bodies and souls even down to the present day black individuals are brought up on a diet of diddies such as the black race was lured to america with stories of tanks of molasses and flapjacks growing on trees one of the rhymes which may be heard asserts that you can tell a chinaman you can tell a dutch you can tell a nigger but you cant tell him much now a white man was born with a veil over his face he can tell you things  years before they ever take place but a nigger was born with a sack over his ass he cant tell you a damned thing until its done passed this defines the black race called negroes ie niggers as inferior another goes like this if youre white youre all right yellow youre mellow brown stick around black stand back they also may talk of wanting nothing black but a cadillac many parents contrarily avoid references to color or race within earshot of their children some touch the backs of their hands to indicate a black person rub the palms to refer to a white individual many black children accordingly grow up thinking of themselves coneludes princeton psychologist bertram karon the negro personality as inferior defining impressive attributes of the black race as undesirable for instance the sensuality of full hips and full lips become in a turnabout way degrading the thin lips and flat hips of white women alternatively are held out to black women as models for emulation many black women will starve themselves puny in the effort to lose the major attributes they possess while coveting for example the horselike legs of white women many black women are impelled to fry their hair to imitate the stringy texture of white womens tresses when anybody knows who has ever chanced to see that there is nothing so beautiful as a black womans freshly washed hair the intricacies of the curls are impressive indeed to behold a work of art it is almost enough to make a man believe in god while whites bake themselves all day to get rid of their whiteness blacks disdain the sun and hug the shade in search of whiteness as children we were laughed at when suntanned and deterred from drinking coffee with the warning that to drink coffee would make us blacker the preferential physiognomy of whiteness is apparent when black men and women grown and gray after the freedom of barefoot days as children purchase shoes too small in order to restrict the sufficiency of their pedal foundations  language the language of white america has exhibited a builtin force destructive of the black individuals selfconcept white is the color symbolizing purity while black is a color loaded with derogatory connotations in addition blacks are taught to worship a god who is always painted white then to sing that they want to be more and more like jesus who will be riding six white horses when he comes  i myself accepted these white myths at the early age of eight joining the church inopportunely during the lords supper a cannibalistic white rite in which the lord eats nothing but christians actually proceed symbolically to eat the lord then i grew up to learn that god is dead only to read later that they found him alive in the white house i therefore proposed that they move the white house to howard university and call it the black house but the suggestion didnt take too well with those on high the language of prejudice is apparent to the person thinking black when an intelligent individual is labeled bright as over against stupid professors are said to reside in the ivory tower including those at socalled negro colleges or ebony towers whetherwe are regarded as the black sheep of our families may not correlate with skin color we are nonwhites even when we are in the majority but the dictionary carries no such word as nonblack even mulattoes are curiously halfwhite instead of halfblack recently i sat listening to a verbose fellows discussion of the dark famine of ireland finally i told him if it was that bad it had to be white  artifacts artifacts include the objects made by man and used in everyday life for instance children must pass through sunday schools with lesson cards picturing a white jesus and his disciples surrounded by church walls and decorative windows portraying the same in school they are exposed to textbooks peopled by middle class white urban children talking the doubletalk of looksee primary readers this same condition pervades most other areas of american life and is compounded by a number of other contradictions visavis black people   sickness too much already has been written on the schizoid nature of white society and the bland emptiness of white culture to merit detailed discussion here in all areas of lifesex religion race crime and commercethere is a tendency sometimes socially approved to profess one thing and  practice another this stems in part from the practice of holding out progress as an ideal in the technical and scientific spheres while clinging to tradition and convention in the social sphere obsolescent social institutions and norms developed by primitive whites to fit their own social conditions have been handed down to us and cemented by the cake of custom the discrepancy between the mushrooming technological development and our social stagnation grows greater not surprisingly with each day sociologists call this a cultural lag i think that by now it has become a cultural drag yet many black persons cling gullibly to these norms while whites may frequently disdain the alleged ideals in preference to more customary real practices thinking blacks are not obliged to merely adjust to a schizoid society which itself is maladjusted to be adjusted to a maladjusted society is in effect to be maladjusted black persons thinking black quite naturally will reject a society which rejects black people to accept a society which rejects you is in a roundabout way to reject yourself  mathematics the numerical basis of the system which oppresses black people is apparent in the word minority group which implies that blacks are oppressed because they represent a numerical minority actually they are a majority in the world as a whole and all over the world wherever there are white people are oppressed regardless of their proportionate representation yet whites a minority in the world as a whole have developed and disseminated techniques of majorityrule which stymie black efforts toward selfdetermination we are told that we are a minority whenever retaliatory violence flares in the black community but simultaneously urged to engage in the majority dominated politics of voting our way to freedom even population statistics and birth controlthe essence of the numbers and distribution of people take on a tinge of white racism we are led to believe to think that our predicament is a product of our high procreative powers that we may soon cause the population to outstrip the food supply actually it would appear to represent a discrepancy between the distribution of resources and people the land surface of the earth my third grade geography teacher told me is only about twothirds of the globe an eminent graduate school professor in turn proclaimed that twothirds of the people have crowded themselves into only about onetenth of the land area we have not learned to eat much of the edible material for example dozens of specimens of fish swimming wild in the ocean i can conceive of a gigantic raftvillage afloat at sea instead the white man proceeds to disseminate books such as standing room only wherein it would appear that should the situation ever reach that point the problem will just about take care of itself  one illustration will indicate the condition in which we already find ourselves dr bentley glass famous new york biologist recently predicted in the press that by the turn of the century the practice will emerge in response to population explosion of issuing coupons when couples are wed two coupons one child per coupon we already have acquired the coupon of marriage a marriage license couples whose children can obtain a genetic certificate tantamount to the current blood test certificate prerequisite to marriage will be able to exceed the twochild allotment the method of certifying couples genetically will according to dr glass be based on a test of physical and mental normalcy of the two allotted offspring the offspring will be examined of course by tests made out on the white folks up at princeton black children for reasons now wellknown will be less likely to pass the tests then rev ralph abernathy jr v will have to stage a march on washington in order to get a fertility rights act passed  audaciousness the black race and its struggle today is in need of individuals who can dare to be problack as well as antiwhite to think blackwe have already concludedis to be black to be black in turn is to do black the latter is a rather neglected phenomenon many black militants unconsciously overplay the process of being black in order to avoid doing black they lose themselves in dogmatic nihilism and mystic militancy their militancy their blackness becomes a religion so to speak in which strategy is enslaved by their symbolism africa for example a land most never truly expect to visit may take the place of the christians heaven as it were african garb replacing the priestly frock although this is not to deride such practices as a means of cementing ones identity as a black individual so long as they do not become ends instead of means frantz fanon maotsetung and che guevara may be parroted like a bible without apparent concern for transforming their conclusions to fit the demography culture and social organization of this country sometimes i feel that the white folk gave us such works for some good reason many mystic militants mistakenly measure militancy on a scale of whiterejection those who reject whites  percent though conservative economically and politically are regarded as more militant than those who reject only  per cent and so on i who reject only  and  of them am occasionally regarded as a moderate  that may be so but those who would think black must now prepare to move out of this expressive bag and take on the pragmatic duties of true revolutionary innovation
on january   a group of middleranking military  officers attempted to take over the civilian government of nigeria this attempt was foiled by the higher military officers under the leadership of the late majorgeneral ironsi the attempted take over led to the death of the federal prime minister two regional premiers and the federal minister of finance following the attempt the civilian government handed over powers to  the nigerian army after the military take over the future of nigeria as a single political unit became highly uncertain the army mutiny of july  and the mass massacre of civilians of eastern nigerian origin particularly in northern nigeria led to the secession of the former eastern nigeria now called biafra the nigerian military government attempt to end what it termed a rebellion led to what jet magazine of july  called the war between blacks nobody cares about in that same july  eugene walton writing in negro digest pointed out the often overlooked fact that the colonial powers in their scramble for africa created countries without regard to the tribal and cultural differences of african people mr walton noted m under the circumstances it may be better to let them come apart and regroup along lines of their own choosing forming new nations with more workable economic and cultural combinationsand certainly with more harmonious tribal groupings this article will attempt to analyze the cultural content of the former federation of nigeria and the part cultural differences played in the countrys disintegration we may remind our readers that nigeria had  million people from about  different ethnic tribal groups the land area was about four times that of the united kingdom or the size of the states of oklahoma and texas the country was made up of four regions states each region was autonomous and in fact each had different diplomatic representation at the court of st james london the federal and regional governments had bicameral legislaturesthe second chamber called the senate on the federal level and house of chiefs on the regional level cases for and against the continuation of nigeria as a political unit nigeria was seen by many non nigerians as an example of political stability in black africa her leadership was noted for its political sportsmanship compromise was the foundation stone of the political stability the first case for the continuation of nigeria as a political unit is the psychic movement towards unity that is common among many liberals and intellectuals such unity is said to be essential for the human race as a whole particularly if economic and other values are to be maximized second africa now has more countries than any other continent in the world and further increase from existing countries would lead to mushroom countries too small to be viable this is the balkanization thesis third economists and others drawing from adam smith point out that division of labor is limited by the extent of the market and in the case of nigeria disintegration would essentially lead to economic suicide such disintegration would hamper factor mobility fourth nigeria had been a laboratory of human relations and its disintegration would suggest the failure of black people to interact in a meaningful way for their own common good the cases for allowing nigeria to disintegrate start first with the artificial nature of nigeria lord hailey one of the most enlightened british colonial experts had remarked that in creating nigeria britain created perhaps the most artificial of the many administrative units created in the course of european occupation of africa  the continuation of this artificial entity would be a major source of instability and would for all practical purposes retard the process of development second nigeria by its size is too big to be handled by a single political authority particularly when one takes into consideration primacy of the various modern institutions in the new states third any modem government must have the confidence of its citizens this confidence must be built on trust and a feeling of belonging in the case of nigeria events in the past two years have shown that fear mistrust and resentment have been the order of the day and that a section of the country felt that their security life and property were no longer protected in the nigerian federation events in the past two years seem to justify this feeling fourth the economic case for nigerian existence tends to overlook the fact that more than politics economic relations transcend national boundaries the european economic community the east african common market and the central american economic area are examples where economics go wider than politics exterminating people as now done in nigeria limits the market since potential manpower is destroyed and property damaged fifth it might be better to have small but stable countries than to have large and unstable ones finally by its very nature federalism is a bond which may be broken when parties fail to live up to their obligations many federations in the british colonial and commonwealth history did not last for long these include the malaysian federation india and pakistan and the west indies federation britain did not succeed in her efforts to incorporate ireland and quite recently there were talks about the establishment of a scottish national assembly it might therefore be asking too much to expect the federation of nigeria to continue to exist no matter the cost human and otherwise 
the cultures of nigeria one of the simplest definitions of culture is that culture is ways of doing things culture is classified into material and nonmaterial material culture consists of physical objects the tools weapons accouterments charms fetishes ikons and all physical apparatus of life    nonmaterial culture includes the entire system of practices customs or folkways by which the life of a community seems to be organized  material culture is embodied in technology and nonmaterial culture embodied in ceremonies both aspects of culture are present in all societies at all times ethnologists have evolved methods of observing how personalities are formed and organized in the context of a culture human attitudes aspirations actions and reactions views on life and the world in general are all conditioned by cultural background political culture pye and verba tell us suggests that the traditions of a society the spirit of its public institutions the passions and the collective reasoning of its citizenry and the style and operating codes of its leaders are not just random products of historical experience but fit together as part of the meaningful whole the former nigerian republic was made up of many ethnic groups arid contained heterogenous cultures the three largest ethnic groups the hausafulani the ibos and the yorubas were located in the northern eastern and western regions of nigeria respectively the ibos and other ethnic groups in the eastern region are all located within the boundaries of the federation the yorubas are divided between nigeria and dahomey while the hausafulanis are divided between nigeria niger and chad republics this makes it possible for the divided tribes to feel at home in these other countries while the tribes of the eastern region have no where else to go we will argue that despite minor local differences the tribes of former eastern region  biafra belong to a common cultural pool this pool is not shared by other tribes in nigeria ottenberg writing on the ibo receptivity to change made the following observation the ibo are a sedentary agricultural people dwelling mainly in the tropical forest areas of southeastern nigeria members of this cultural and linguistic grouping consisting of about five million persons live slightly inland from the coast and are separated from it by the efiks ibibio ogoni eastern i jaw and other peoples who share with them many similarities in culture and in contact experience forde and jones also observed major cultural similarities among the ethnic groups in biafra which include elaborate new yam rituals when first fruits are ceremonially presented to sacred images the ivory trumpet kept by the senior linage head to summon the group for defense etc methods of fighting weapons and war drums many births marriage and burial customs    folk tales with the tortoise as hero political culture the biafran tribes belong to what experts call stateless or acephalous societies the hausafulani and the yorubas on the other hand belong to state or kingdom societies in the acephalous societies of nigeria oneman rule is totally unknown and people aspire to political office on the basis of their abilities this contrasts with the kingdom societies where oneman rule or a modification of it is the rule rather than the exception and where people aspire to political office by birth this difference accounts for the existence of emirs among the hausafulani and obas among the yorubas attempts to introduce the one man rule in the form of warrant chiefs in former eastern nigeria biafra led to series of riots and disturbances in the area in the late twenties and early thirties although some few powerful chieftains flourished along the coastal areas in the region their existence was more a function of european trade than of indigenous tradition political power among the ibos and allied tribes sklar and whitaker tell us t exemplifys the pattern of dispersed tribal authority as a rule authority extending to matters of land tenure is based on patrilineal kinship groups typically the ibo village chief is the head of a special lineage the chief of a senior village in a group may preside at meetings of the village group in some cases villagegroup heads enjoy great prestige but their authority never reaches beyond the village group indeed there are parts of iboland where chieftancy is virtually unknown and tribal government is thought of as the collective rule of the senior age grades ft this political structure requires the ibos and other tribes in biafra to have a popular participation in the community political decision making these tribes are said to be ultrarepublican or parademocratic  the kingdom societies of the yorubas and the hausafulani do not allow for popular decisionmaking in politics and other social matters the yoruba political system has a resemblance to the english constitutional monarch when the lords checked the activities of their sovereign lloyd noted on the yoruba political system there has always been a delicate balance of power between the chiefs who make    policy and the oba whose sacred status commands such authority as will ensure obedience if the oba misused his powers he might be deposed by his chiefs who would ask him to die this form of constitutional monarch extended to other areas of midwestern nigeria particularly in benin the hausafulani societies are ruled by the emirs who embody both religious social and political powers the islamic jihad of the early nineteenth century gave rise to the emirate kingdoms of northern nigeria and the political culture of that area is rooted in islamic religion sklar and whitaker observed  each of the political systems of the emirates has distinctive features but certain principles of emirate rule are general in their application first emirate rule is theocratic in the sense that an emir is thought to personify the islamic fusion of political and religious authority second it is dynastic emirs are chosen from the membership of royal dynasties by traditional electors subject to the special customary procedures of particular states third emirs govern their domains through ranks of titled officials some traditional offices are restricted to men of royal birth and some men of noble birth others are within the emirs unrestricted power of appointment among those eligible for office competition is keen and its intensity is reinforced by the participation of those who stand to gain by the advancement of a prospectively more powerful patron this implies a fourth important principle of emirate rule namely clientage defined by m g smith as an exclusive relation of mutual benefit which holds between two persons defined as socially and politically unequal which stresses their solidarity    the concentration of dejure power and authority in the hands of the emir tended to inhibit any opposition to him even from within the ranks of the ruling stratum from the standpoint of the commoner emirate rule was despotic in form his personal security depended wholly upon the uncertain benevolence of his overlords the fusion of the theocratic or despotic system with the limited monarchical and the parademocratic systems was bound to run into difficulties this we submit was one of the painful ills of nigeria this fusion of stateless and state societies in nigeria made interaction between their members very difficult and led to the existence of continued misunderstanding this interaction difficulty was noted by coleman  the ibo as well as the ibibio had strong personal economic reasons for wanting nigeria to be a nation with freedom of movement and enterprise the existence of this sentiment was well demonstrated by a minority report submitted by representatives from eastern region six ibos four ibibios efiks one cameronian and one ijaw as part of the recommendation whereby southerners resident in the north would be rendered ineligible for election to the northern house of assembly it is in our view invidious that a nigerian could under a nigerian constitution be deprived of the right of election to the house of assembly in any region in which he for the time beingor permanently has his abode merely by reason of the accident of birth or ancestry    in the last analysis the unity of nigeria is the unity of individual in it the individuals are bound together by political ties of nationality identical nationality of any country must surely carry with it identical political rights    it is significant to note that of the twelve eastern signatories to this report only three were supporters of azikiwe    indeed the remaining nine opposed azikiwe in varying degrees and some were definitely probritish it is equally important to emphasize that the discriminatory provision opposed by easterners was supported by all representatives from the northern and western regions colemans observations are consistent with our thesis on cultural homogeneity of easterners biafrans and our broad division of nigeria into state and stateless societies religious culture religious differences in nigeria are the best known to people outside nigeria while biafrans have the same religious systemschristianity and animism the yorubas and the hausafulani have a mixture of christianity and islam the hausafulani are predominantly moslems in general the ibos ibibios efiks and ijaws who occupy biafra are secular societies this contrasts with the sacred societies of the yorubas and the hausafulani sacred societies are characterized by emphatic resistance to cultural change and when they do change their changes tend to be imitative secular societies on the other hand are highly receptive to change and their changes tend to be innovative it is interesting to note that among biafrans religious fanaticism is rare and the people tend to exhibit rationality in their religious observance these characteristics contrast with the rather slavish and religious fanaticism that prevails in the northern and western regions yorubas have always had someone who claims to be a christ the difference in religion accounts for the different rates of social change in nigeria where christian churches operate they establish schools of various types and teach not only religion but skills as well the moslem schools teach only the koran and do little or nothing in the area of modem education economic culture many people in the former federation of nigeria live in about   villages urban centers are fast growing but still have less than  percent of the population agriculture is the mainstay of the countrys economy land therefore is an important factor in the economy and the systems of land tenure indicate the degree of diversity in the economic system in the acephalous societies as in biafra land belongs to the dead the living and the generation yet to be born ownership of land is not a function of price but rather a function of membership in the community there is therefore no landless person or landless people in the state societies of the yorubas land belongs to the kingdom and heads of various families act as custodians among the hausafulani land belongs to the emirs and the use of land is dictated by the various district heads who act as the emirs representative the state societies may have landless people the biafrans have a strong linkage with their land and where ones ancestors are buried is regarded as sacred tribes in this area remind their children of their ownership of land and this makes it easy to trace people back home in biafra among the tribes of the state societies to trace one back home can seldom be done trade systems and market operations differ among various ethnic groups in the stateless societies the intermediary between the producer and the consumer is hardly rigid that is to say mobility is seldom impaired either by regulation or by custom in the state societies markets are administered by various titled officials each in charge of such things as butchery the grain marketing and the cloth marketing market intermediaries tend to be rigid smith made the following remarks on hausa markets since the hausa merchants and officials are the main links between the rural markets in which the peasants trade and the larger city markets which handle the intranigerian and overseas commerce and since neither of these markets is ever static for long the hausa peasants are subject to changing economic pressures mediated by officials and tradersthe friction that arises when traders accustomed to different types of salesmanship interact continued to be one of the major sources of tension among the various tribal groups labor mobility in the geographical sense differed among the ethnic groups traditionally the yorubas of western nigeria have been urban and quasiurban dwellers the hausafulani developed administrative centers that had some urban characteristics the ethnic groups in biafra wereand arestill predominantly rural urban centers in the area grew out of the british colonial experience in  there were nine cities in western nigeria yoruba with a population of  and over there were two such cities in northern nigeria hausafulani and no city of that size in eastern nigeria biafra by  there were  such cities in western nigeria seven in northern nigeria and five in eastern nigeria the urban areas both new and old experienced a high degree of ibo ibibio efik biafrans immigrants coleman had remarked yet this rapid and intensive urbanization of the ibo peoples since the british occupation is a phenomenon not only of the eastern region their homeland ibos also constitute more than onethird of the nonindigenous population of the urban centers in the northern and western regions k o dike attributed this mass movement of ibos to landhunger w a lewis blamed the palm produce marketing board price policies for the migration phenomenon in eastern nigeria biafra these two reasons are weak because few migrants became farmers but rather took to petty trading and nonfarm activities the friction of urban socialization and the competition for urban employment are some of the factors which created tribal hatred which was the crucial element in the series of massacres that led to biafran secession conclusion nigerian disintegration is a function of her cultural heterogeneity it is also a function of the high expectation of many people outside nigeria who not only saw the country as a model of democracy for black africa but also got more nigeriaconscious and oriented than nigerians themselves in  lord lugard amalgamated the protectorates of northern and southern nigeria and the crown colony of lagos the amalgamation worked only on paper and it was not until  that the representatives from these areas met and started interacting and shaping the framework of what is now known as nigeria one might say that there is only a generation of nigerians and that to call someone a nigerian is to call him a british colonial subject the newness of the nigerian political framework coupled with the countrys large ethnic composition led to what professor deutsch called incomplete social mobilization and as deutsch pointed out elsewhere ceteris paribus the stage of rapid social mobilization may be expected therefore to promote the consolidation of states whose peoples already share the same language culture and major social institutions while the same process may tend to strain or destroy the unity of states whose population is already divided into several groups with different languages or cultures or basic ways of life the nigerian experience is a living example of the failure of the westminister model when transferred to other cultures this model evolved from the british experience of class is inappropriate to africa where the key element is community given the diversity of african or nigerian ethnic groups the competition inherent in the westminister model becomes rather divisive and tends to create deep wounds despite its cultural link with england the united states did not import the westminister system lock stock and barrel the united states presidency senate and judiciary are not carbon copies of the british monarchy lords and judiciary the american model was structured to suit the american situation african leaders scholars and statesmen will do africa and africans justice if they realize the diversity of their peoples and advocate and pursue policies that will allow for peaceful evolution of african institutions to cope with africa in transition indiscriminate institutional importation and pseudo international and diplomatic maturity might prove very expensive in human terms as the nigerian disintegration exemplifies
so god created man in his own image this is the essential   f christian message which gets so mixed up in the minds of jj people god created us in his own image we intend to live e as beings created in the image of god and everything we do  c m in the church should be designed to help us live that way something has happened to black people in these united states we are not as we were a few years ago a few months ago a few weeks ago something has happened to us not to america but to us to the way we think the way we fight the way we work together this is the most important thing that has ever happened in americawhat is that something it is that fear is gone just a few weeks ago we were so different down south we were afraid up north we were afraid the fear was a very elementary fear it was not the fear of being brutalized of being humiliated essentially it was the fear of dying when the white man in the south said get off the sidewalk why did we get off because we were afraid of dying we are not afraid any more so the white man has stopped saying it now he is afraid now he must redefine his relationship with us why is fear gone fear is gone essentially because we are in the process of becoming a black nation a nation that is as real as if it had a capital a congress and a president we as a people are now dedicated to one purpose freedom for black people it is this which makes the difference we didnt understand what this was before because each of us functioned as an individual we were afraid to fight because we felt that if we fought we would fight alone and we would die alone it is hard to stand up and be a man when you are all by yourself that is the way we were the difference now is that we are coming together we are no longer just individuals we are becoming a nation you know that the rest of us are going to support you in every way we can if you fight back against oppression we are not going to turn our backs and run away when you know that you feel different no matter how much uncle tom still remains in you now you are part of a nation so fear is gone everything that is going on in america today stems from this basic fact once we were alone now we are together we have changed we are a black nation in a white mans world increasingly the white mans world has become an enemy world recognized as such an enemy world from which we have been systematically excluded and which we now despise and reject they cant exclude us any more because we dont want to be in their world now we are in our own world our own nation so much so that sometimes we feel uncomfortable because we have to go out into their enemy world to work and to shop we wish that we could stay with our own people all the time when you get on the bus and you have an afro or a natural hairdo and the man stares you think to yourself i dont like the way he looks any more than he likes the way i look and the way i look is just as beautiful to me as the way he looks is beautiful to him you cant exclude a man when he doesnt want to come in you cant tell a man that he cant marry your daughter when he doesnt even want to spit in your face it is a strange new world that we have created it keeps the white man confused he doesnt know what to make of it so he tries to concentrate upon the tangible a burnedout building for example he figures that if he can do something about this physical blight other things will go back to normal but there is nothing he can do with bricks and steel and stone that can make us act like he wants us to act because bricks and steel and stone have nothing to do with it it is not something physical we are different unless they deal with us as we are now they can put up all the bricks and steel and stone that they want to and it wont stay too long we have become a black nation you can see it everywhere the white press doesnt know what to make of it white journalists are the most confused people in the world sometimes when you read the things they write you think you are reading a fairy tale hans christian anderson is much closer to reality than they are because they dont have any key to understand whats happening that is because in their minds we are inferior we cant hate like they hate we cant believe like they believe we cant fight like they fight so they have to make up some kind of story to explain why we do the things we do yet the answer is so simple all they have to accept is the simple fact black people are black but in every other way there is no difference if they could just accept this simple fact they would realize why we cannot accept any more than they could the brutalization the degradation the indignities and the criminalities to which we have been subjected but they cant see that and so they cant understand our black revolution so they write fairy tales to amuse themselves when you look at what is happening you see how we have changed the national student association recently held a national convention the same student organization that the cia financed for years some black students went to that convention and said we dont care who is paying your bills if you want us in the student movement you are going to endorse black_power here and now and the national student association voted to endorse black_power then the teachers we have been looking down on black teachers for a long time we have said that all they cared about was their own individual selves their clothes their cars their social life but recently the american federation of teachers had a convention and the black teachers got together and said what amounted to we dont like anything that is going on and if you dont endorse black_power we are walking out you see how a nation comes into being a year ago they wouldnt have even opened their mouths at the convention the white folks would have picked one of them to speak for the negroes and that would have been that but now at every convention black folks put up a sign saying black caucus whitey stay out this is the beginning of a black nation there was a time when we didnt even want to sit together if we came into a room and saw a negro there we would walk over to the other side of the room and sit down we didnt want to segregate ourselves but now the first thing we do is separate ourselves and get together with all the brothers and sisters to find out what it is that we all want to do that has been the pattern at every convention that has been held this summer and the white man doesnt know what to do the left had a convention in chicago new left old left all kinds of lefts black folks went to that convention the white folks had set up a convention just like white people always set up ghetto day buses from detroit newark and cleveland would bring in black folks to put on a show for the white folks but black folks would have nothing to do with the planning nothing to do with the organization of convention procedure nothing to do with the assessment of political realities white folks have been having ghetto days like this for more than  years only this time black folks werent interested in any ghetto day so they got together and they drew up a beautiful statement even when the newspapers got through with the statement they drew up it was still a beautiful thing listen to the preamble we as black people believe that a united states system that is committed to the practice of genocide social degradation the denial of political and cultural selfdetermination of black people cannot reform itself there must be revolutionary change then they made  specific black_power demands and there wasnt anything that those white leftists could do but accept those demands because without black people there isnt any revolutionary movement in america there are some white people who are poor who are exploited but they are white there are some white people who are liberal but they are white there are some white people who are radical but they are white and in the final analysis all these white people stand together we know this to be true so we black people are now demanding the things that we want for ourselves no white man whatever he represents himself to be is going to tell us what to do this is the message of the conventions of all the rebellions it is the message from coast to coast of the burnedout buildings black people are going to be free and we are going to do it ourselves what is fear when i was going to school i remember studying the psychology of fear and the debate over whether the emotional reaction preceded or followed the visceral reaction even then i knew it to be nonsense what does it mean when we say fear is gone it doesnt mean that when you get into a situation you dont have an emotional or a visceral reaction but that is not fear the emotion the adrenalin m that is pumped into your body can lead you to either fight or ight the body is ready for either one fear is determined by what you do with that energy dont be ashamed if you react if your pressure goes up if your heart starts pumping just be sure you do the right thing at work when they begin to talk about niggers and you are supposed to be invisible dont worry if your heart begins to pump what matters is do you speak up do you just sit there and pretend not to hear we had a peoples tribunal to try the officers charged with the massacre of three black youths in the algiers motel during the july  rebellion right here beneath the beautiful black madonna witnesses testified everything possible had been done by the police to intimidate these black people and yet they testified and told the truth does that mean that as they sat here their hearts were not pounding of course not they knew that the man was going to brutalize them at the first opportunity but that wasnt fear because they did what had to be done a whole lot of you have guiity feelings about being afraid you neednt have it is not fear as long as you do what has to be done america is set on a disaster course of conflict and violence the black man cannot accept america as it is the white man refuses to make the changes necessary for the black man to live in america with dignity and justice these are two facts we will not accept conditions as they are and the white man will not accept the changes which we demand there is no solution except open conflict and violence you dont have to feel guilty about that either it is his fault not ours we say that we are created in the image of god he refuses to accept that it is his fault not ours when there is justice there can be love peace and brotherhood only the oppressor can afford to talk about the preservation of law and order without justice for the oppressed that is for us for all black people to talk about law and order peace and brotherhood is either insanity or it is craven cowardice we have no choice to make we cant be concerned with law and order peace and brotherhood until we first get justice securing justice is our basic concern there are black people who dont understand that we dont have justice but they are becoming fewer and fewer everything about the elections in mississippi was crooked there wasnt any law and order there because there was injustice they were determined that black people would not be elected in american cities during the recent rebellion every constitutional right guaranteed citizens was denied to black people the courts became kangaroo courts the judges functioned as though they were part of the police department the news papers were part of the police department all the white community came together to protect order that is to protect white supremacy to protect and to preserve injustice even as they talked about law and order they were the perpetrators of injustice and the destroyers of law and order the police talked about looters in the street and they themselves were doing more looting every day than the looters in the street but injustice had to be preserved white supremacy had to be maintained the white man was willing to sacrifice the constitution the courts and the law to preserve what he held sacred the status quo to preserve his injustice he was willing to go to any lengths and he did some of you were arrested you know what they did in the jails the prisons and the concentration camps you remember the wanton brutality against men women and children and all the time they were talking about law and order america is headed for increased racial conflict and violence there is no escape because the white man is determined to preserve injustice and we are determined that justice is ours by right and that we shall have it we have decided that we are willing to die rather than continue to suffer the injustice that we have suffered for  years we have the strength necessary for this kind of struggle because we have come together and we are a black nation but it is going to take every bit of our united strength to withstand the kind of persecution that is being prepared for us i dont care how nice you feel inside how much you would like to go along how much you wish you could live out your lifetime without so much conflict and violence i am sorry you were just born at the wrong time there is no way that that kind of injustice can be preserved even when you long for the good old days when you could be a comfortable uncle tom you realize that the good old days are gone forever we are living in the midst of a revolution and in a time of revolution the old values are no long valid when they draft you into the army they take you to camp and teach you how to kill that is against the values of society but the society has declared that in this emergency it is necessary that you forget what you have been taught so you learn how to kill and how to kill well the old values are no longer valid we have got to understand this we have got to understand that in a time of revolution the old values must also be rescinded when america revolted against england they looted a ship in boston harbor they took the cargo of tea and threw it overboard they burned everything that they needed to burn because they said we are engaged in a revolution and in revolution the old values must be cast aside they knew it then because they were engaged in a revolution they were fighting against injustice and oppression now we know it an old lady called me up the other day she said that she lived on west warren avenue and she talked about the way those people were acting during the rebellion how they ran up and down the streets with the things they had taken and told her to get off her front porch or they would burn down her house they probably saw her writing down license numbers to give the police she said that everything we black people do is wrong and that i should stop fussing with white people and start fussing with black people to get them to do right she said that she had tried so hard to keep her little house neat and clean to plant a little grass to organize a block club but the black people in her block wouldnt cooperate they said this aint our community the man owns it and she was hurt because she had wanted to make her block a little grosse pointe she was so happy because a white lady she worked for called her up during the rebellion and asked her how she was doing and sent her some canned food i tried to explain to her that in a time of revolution the old values are no longer valid the old virtues she had cherished so long of saving up to buy a little house and putting a fence around it wont work it is time for all of us to build a community together and if you are still thinking of protecting your little thing trying to make your fence high enough to keep us out you are wrong you ought to love the looters because they are part of the black nation if you were too old to participate then the least you could do was not talk about those who did it is one struggle and we are in it together we have got to love one another we have got to remember that even if at the end of the struggle down the road a piece we end up in concentration camps together we are still brothers and sisters and we must love one another white people in america dont understand this a white daily had an editorial the other day the us dailies are undoubtedly among the most biased newspapers in the world but this was a new low even for  an establishment newspaper the editorial said that h rap brown and the ku kluxers who voted  times in mississippi are equally wrong and if it is accepted that brown is privileged to foment violence then the kkk is also so privileged this is the hitler technique tell a big lie and tell it over and over until the whole world believes it to be true the press knows that there is a basic difference between h rap brown and the kkk brown says one simple thing that black people must fight for justice by all means necessary while the kkk says that white people have got to preserve injustice by all means necessary do you see the difference it doesnt become the same thing because the white mans press pretends to believe that it is the same we have got to fight injustice by all means necessary if that is sedition then we are all guilty white people in organizations all over the country are joining together in support of one basic philosophic position we have got to use all means necessary to preserve injustice against black people that is why conflict and violence are inevitable the white man could change his position but he is not changing it the sale of guns to white people has increased by leaps and bounds even as they write long articles in newspapers and magazines against black violence in the streets they have special flights bringing in guns every day to white people in detroit they are dedicated to the preservation of injustice without injustice they wouldnt need guns we dont even want to live in their communities or go to their schools all we want is control over our own communities they would have nothing to fear except for the simple fact that they are unwilling to give up their control over our community they want to live in dearborn and grosse pointe and still control our schools and teach our children and they are not going to do it that is why they are buying guns because we are demanding a change that is why there is going to be conflict and violence conflict is inevitable unless the white man agrees to transfer power we say that to him and he looks the other way he sets up a new detroit committee to rebuild detroit he gives it all kinds of money but the committee refuses to realize that its one function is to preside at the transference of power it could say black people wont accept injustice any longer lets make some changes but it wont do that instead it reassembles the same old hackneyed negro leadership gives it a new name and tries to deal with it as though it speaks for the black community in order to preserve the same old injustice but it wont work conflict is inevitable because the white man wont face reality oppression does not destroy a people it is the acceptance of oppression that destroys that is why we were sick until we started fighting just trying to hold in our indignation made us sick messed up our minds that is why a girl who gets a natural feels like a whole new world has opened up to her we have begun to throw off oppression we dont know whether we are going to win or lose all black people in america could be killed within the next five years but we would be better off dead than accepting oppression fear is gone the white man has got to understand that in this period of becoming a nation the black church conscious of its african roots becomes increasingly significant many black people have given up the church but the church can become the basis for a new unity in the black community we ask people to join the church so that they will know that they are brothers and sisters that they belong to a black nation this church is dedicated to a black messiah this church believes that the purpose of christianity is to free black people to rid black people of injustice this is what we believe this is why we are so important to the black revolution this is why we need more churches like ours from coast to coast the church must free our minds strengthen our bodies and unite our people this is the task of the church because god created us in his own image and as a child of god we must walk with pride and dignity we are going to be free by any means necessary brothers and sisters remember that we have agents every sunday if someone comes up to you talking about firebombs and guerilla warfare dont let him make a fool out of you one group of private investigators is in the city trying to earn a purse of  by proving a conspiracy there was no conspiracy except the conspiracy to maintain injustice perpetrated by the white man for the past  years let them expose that conspiracy heavenly father we thank thee for the opportunity of worshipping in this house we thank thee that we have this house to come together in be with us and help us to do those things that must be done let your spirit be in our midst and lead our brothers and sisters to feel the call to join together with us in this task of uniting our people this we ask in the name of the black messiah jesus christ amen
image is a term which we are using more and more in the black community because we are discovering that the image we have of ourselves controls what we are capable of doing image in this sense has the meaning of selfconcept we are giving cause and effect the same name but the word image is properly speaking a concrete term meaning the projection or representation of an object the image is the mirror of some aspect of reality at this point we should draw a distinction between real and created images both are projections of reality but the created image is projected by the imagination of man and by the recall and associative power of his five senses for instance i can hold out a rose before you the image of that rose is mirrored in your eye it is a real image or i can describe a rose to you and my words will create an image which you can visualize mentally perhaps you will even imagine the smell and the feel the words i choose and the way i build them into the image will determine this usually a whole complex of associations builds up around an image secondary images are evoked until welldefined patterns of associations based upon sensory perceptions pervade in a very vague way the whole area of a mans experience why is image so central to a mans selfdefinition because all images and especially created images represent a certain way of focusing on the world outside and therefore they represent a certain point of view now if we hold a certain point of view we have automatically emphasized some aspects of reality blocked out others and glossed over the rest and the image which we project or which we perceive is not objective reality but our ownor someone elsesreshaping of reality if it is someone elses reshaping of reality which we perceive then we are within that other persons sphere of influence and can be led to believe whatever he wishes us to believe ¦ that a rosebush is pleasant because it has a fragrant smell or that it is unpleasant because it has thorns if these two images of the rosebush are combined into a metaphor we have created images which lead us to make an association between the reality of the rosebush and another level of reality and we can be influenced for instance on a moral level pleasantsmelling roses have unpleasant thorns therefore beware the sweet fragrance of pleasure for underneath it lie hidden the thorns of destruction in this way the association made in the mind of the hearer or reader is controlled by guiding by controlling our associations the imagemaker can and usually does shape our view of reality because the images the words conjure up when they are put together artistically provoke an immediate emotional response in us and dim out of our consciousness all the untold other points of view at our disposal imagemaking is part of all human experience however we are speaking here of the image created by the magic of words we are considering image not so much as life but as literary art art reshapes the raw materials of nature and of human interaction and in so doing interprets reality in a nonanalytical nonintellectual way art thus makes a direct appeal to the senses and calls forth a spontaneous emotional identification with other men and with the universe therefore the effects of the literary image are most often intuitive deep beyond the threshold of reason and common sense when we spoke of the sweet fragrance of pleasure and the thorns of destruction we made an appeal not to reason but to the emotional attractiveness of the images in this way we develop quite aside from our rational perception an intuitive view of nature and of the cosmos and our own relation to it the rose is an old familiar example of how our attitude toward the surrounding environment takes form and grows the body of imagery surrounding the rose is rooted historically deep in western cultural patterns of looking at the world the rose symbolize beauty on the physical level and purity and freshness on the moral level because this imagery is traditional the associations are unquestioned and because they are unquestioned they take on the quality of myth in the case of the rose the imagery may seem harmless but we will see in a moment how such mythbuilding images can be the very death of selfconcept notice too in the case of the rose that man has projected himself into his imagery the purity beauty and freshness of the rose are usually compared to an idealized womankind this is because the natural impetus of man is to impart to the whole cosmos the qualities which he possesses mans imagery is thus anthropomorphic he sees himself or his behavior in every projection he makes thus a flower dances in the breeze the thunder rushes angrily through the skies the sun smiles down on the sleepy noontime village mother earth provides for us it follows that mans selfconcept must inevitably be tied to his view of the universe since he sees his own reflec tion in it at every moment and a reflection of ourselves cannot be neutral it cannot be objective it is either positive or negative how we regard the phenomena of nature is an indication of what we think of ourselves the howling wind for example is not the same image as the whining wind if our literary tradition stresses the howling wind then we feel emotively that a mysterious prowling creature stalks through our universe if the whining wind is stressed we feel the presence of a weak but persistent creature following us constantly around weve said that man projects his image upon the universe but man does not exist in isolation it is far more accurate to say that man projects his cultural and racial images upon the universe and he derives a sense of personal worth from the reflection he sees gazing back at him for he defines himself and the world in terms of others like him he discovers his identity within a group and now we come to the heart of the matter for we cannot judge ourselves unless we see a continuity of ourselves in other people and in things and concepts we question our very right to exist without other existences like our own this is why image is so important to african americans we are black people living in a white world when we consider that the black man sees white cultural and racial images projected upon the whole extent of his universe we cannot help but realize that a very great deal of the time the black man sees a zero image of himself the black child growing into adulthood through a series of weekend movies seeing white protagonists constantly before him projecting the whole gamut of human experience is in extreme cases persuaded that he too must be white or what is more likely he experiences manhood by proxy and in someone elses image he sees in other words a zero image of himself if there are black people on the screen they are subservient to uncomfortably different from or busy emulating the larger allinclusive white culture in that case our young person sees a negative image of himself nor are the images which control personal worth always so direct or obvious the very same imagemyth process which we discovered through the example of the rose is present in the extensive body of color imagery in western culture those associations with black and white have conditioned us to accept white as the symbol of goodness and purity black as the symbol of evil and impurity this did not just happen it is the result of white racial projection of its own best image upon the universe concomitant with that projection for several hundred yearsever since the black man has come within the sphere of influence of the whitethe moral and esthetic associations of black and white have been mixed up with race thus the negative reflection of ourselves is in the white mans system the reverse side of his positive projection of himself the white man has developed a myth of superiority based on images which compare him symbolically with the black man the very fact of this interconnection is at once a holdover from previous bondage and the most effective means of perpetuating that bondage we realize now that we are involved in a blackwhite war over the control of image for to manipulate an image is to control a peoplehood zero image has for a long time meant the repression of our peoplehood of course the black american has not relied totally on the image projected by white culture he has developed a literature and that literature gives him a certain sense of self we have however in spite of ourselves not been successful in destroying zero image for we have not been able to convince ourselves that our image is projected on any but a small and segregated strip of the universe when a selfdefinition has proceeded spontaneously the literature will reflect not only a group consciousness shared points of view common ancestry common destiny and aspirations but it reflects these in spiritual oneness with whatever natural andor supernatural powers preside over and guide that destiny for the black writer the only possibility for spiritual oneness has been nonrace or religious literature but nonrace or religious literature takes on insidiously the image projected by what is called the larger culture and so takes on a white image black writers have also attempted to reflect spiritual oneness by writing within a totally black framework but white images are implanted at the core of black life the most obvious example being that of the church where god is white moreover the black community is not selfsustaining and a literature which would circumvent this essential feature of peoplehood cannot cope with the forces that shape us for the most part though black writers have avoided these two pitfalls and our literature has been as we have slowly painfully coming out of bondage and has been contributing to our growing sense of peoplehood if black writers have historically concentrated on whiteblack animosity it is because that animosity is an everyday fact of life and functional part of our universe the artist then is the guardian of image the writer is the mythmaker of his people we still at times are not sure as to how much  of our image is us to what extent we are the sole authors of our  myth our peoplehood there are those white people who would nullify any argument we advance on the basis that it is advanced in a white language and it is true that languages project a specific cultural image but i believe that we have arrived at a stage of selfawareness in our writing which sees this type of argument as irrelevant our very plain answer to this sophisticated argument is simply that we will not let white men define our peoplehood by telling us were still using white tools to create it similarly we must reject white attempts at portraying black reality they are valid only in terms of the white mans projection of himself they have no place in the definition of blackness for they reveal the white writers attempt to work through his own cultural guilt fascination with blackness or sense of spiritual emptiness this includes all latterday harriet beecher stowes no one can hand us a peoplehood complete with prefabricated images even the word black is a translation from the portuguese slave term negro gone into the english language as negro but black is also the generalized term which we use to symbolize unity of origin whether we are called anglophone francophone coloured mulatto west indian or american negro by the white imagemakers black is the highly imagistic term we use to do away with all such division ary euphemisms it is the term we use to destroy the myth based on the complex of images which polarize black and white these images must be mythically torn down ritually destroyed we cannot bury our heads before the existing body of myth nor before our own europeanization therefore we cannot return nostalgically to a past heritage and pretend that historical continuity exists in anything but fragmentary form we cannot block out the blackwhite struggle for control of image and create a utopianized world of allblack reflections our work at this stage is clearly to destroy the zero and the negative imagemyths of ourselves by turning them inside out to do this we reverse the symbolism and we use that reverse symbolism as the tool for projecting our own image upon the universe zero image and the need to work through it is not a new concept many black writers have understood the importance of image and ralph ellison in the early fifties stated the same intent metaphorically in the title and outer structure of his novel invisible man what is new i believe is the deliberate desecration and smashing of idols the turning insideout of symbols to which black writers are now proceeding with a vengeance bitterness which runs through the whole of black literature is being replaced by wrath a sense of frustration is giving way before a sense of power it is the sense of power which proceeds from a mythic consciousness based on a peoples positive view of themselves and their destiny perhaps we can best conclude with an illustration of the processes weve been discussing the following poem attempts to desecrate the mythical and beautiful figure of the muse entrenched in white culture since the time of its earliest flowering grecoroman antiquity 
dorothy sterling the author of the captain of the planter has penned another delightful book for our childrentear down these walls doubleday  whether that is a plea or a command her treatment of the civil_rights movement is one of the more understanding ones for youngsters miss sterling opens with the tired feet theory of rosa parks which we suspect is being a bit overplayed we hope some promising young novelist visits mrs parks before she fades from us and some honkie does his confessions that is not however the tone of the book from montgomery we move to africa from which we were forcibly abducted miss sterling quite correctly points out that millions were murdered so that thousands could be brought to these shores as slaves included in the book is a diagram of a slave ship the most efficient slave ship in fact which is itself worth the price of the book she doesnt bother our children with any unproven tales of africans selling each other for a few white women who were never worth a good black man or a couple bottles of coke nor does she fill that section with such horrors that our children would be loathe to continue reading though she speaks of the forced marches to the coast of up to  miles in some cases and of the greed of the western nations that often caused them to attempt to leave a pregnant woman about to deliver on the road alone and then to kill her husband when he asks to be left with her she does a commendable job of describing the horrors the africans must surely have felt without instilling fear into the reader she doesnt go beyond her subject or the possible knowledge of her young readers with tales of the hebrew nation suffering almost as much as we but she tells our story with such compassion and understanding that it is difficult to believe she is nonblack if suffering is indeed a virtue then we are perhaps the most virtuous people of all we leave the slave ships and return to montgomery where dr martin_luther_kings home is bombed he counsels love for our enemy nonviolence turn the other cheek many of us regret that dr_king was not able to turn his other cheek in memphis we move from montgomery to greensboro and the start of the largest mass movement since garveythe in movement sit stand walk wade pray die in the united states as she describes the busburning in anniston which moved the john f kennedy administration to consider the freedom rides a moral issue her concise analytical mind helps prevent her from maligning the late president his late brother and from negating some very brave acts by our people though miss sterling is too shy to say it only a fool or a god would walk into a jungle with only his love to keep him the outstanding chapters deal with immigrants as has been pointed out many times before the white people and italians came to america for freedomwe came to be enslaved they came to own propertywe came to be property they came to claim their manhood we came to lose ours they came for religious freedomwe came to lose our gods some came running as james jones once said to love and be lovedwe came fighting back to hate and be hated she doesnt try to clean up slavery with the theyareheathens wearechristians nonsense she fairly presents our side of the question that as was pointed out in ten black writers respond to the south couldnt afford fire insurance because the slaves were burning them out that armed organized resistance was great and the fear of it greater that we never accepted an attitude of slavery in this context watts is fully in line with black history detroit is comparable to charleston newark but a reiteration of southampton we would like to have seen some holes punched into the theory that old tom gave vesey away if denmark vesey could organize  men into an army while under the closest scrutiny any men have been under then no single one of them could upset the plans or as big mabel used to sing so sweetly one monkey doesnt stop the show and im here to tell him so just as the british captured jomo kenyatta the french murdered frantz fanon the cia poisoned richard wright the honkie period has murdered and imprisoned every freedom fighter they could the fight goes on just as malcolm was murdered rap and stokely sprang up and as they were being silenced somebody the honkie hadnt even heard of started killing policemen in cleveland the fight goes on that old theory that a tom broke up our biggest army just does not hold water because any man or group of men who could organize that well would have had the sense to organize around any possible slipups of that nature but white people want us to think we are our worst enemies that the only reason we havent wiped them out is that we dont trust each other maybe we dont but we havent been telling him either if the slaves were so loquacious how was it that harriet tubman was able to return again and again for the underground railroad even those afraid to make the break were not going to tell on those who were ready to go even the term we have for traitor uncle tom is not an adequate description for our reaction to it uncle tom died rather than tell we ought to keep these things in mind just because he wasnt able he didnt turn his people in you have to go to gunga din as john killens points out before you find a traitor and hes truly a white mans fantasy tear down these walls is a good concise history the logical progression of truths and the welcomed absence of confusing words makes it a valuable addition to any youngsters library so often in histories especially about black people those writing history or what pretends to be history are just not logical we can well imagine the day when someone will write of this period the murderous sixties as a time when black people rebelled and were killed at the approximate rate of  to  which will be as illogical as some of the writings weve endured on the previously preconstructed centuries how could it be my grandchild
the next group of poems beginning with negritude and ending with a view from the white helmet reveal the perceptions and sensibilities of a poet who conducts his thought and expression very much in the manner of an apparently unassuming gadflywhich is to say that in emanuel we are to encounter yet another kind of ellison whose individuality of viewpoint and smoothness of expression is bound to offend the more tribalminded among the black conscious indeed a poet is revealed whose singular toughness and keenness of mind and fancy is almost hidden by an apparent absence of any interest in the current fondness for and preoccupation with stunning spatial innovations that stress uniqueness in form and word arrangement indeed in emanuel we encounter a poet who leans in the very unfashionable direction of not so verylongago traditional devices such as rhymed quatrains and regularity of line and stanza length yet for all of this we are faced with a formidable deadly serious and technically assured and even mischievous talent there is here a verbal dexterity and tightness not unworthy of a brooks and an emotional steadiness and resiliency underneath the light humorous gentle unassuming surface that will grip your fondest notions and make them scream out as they are carried unceremoniously under tq repeat the ideas the subjects dealt with and the very strikingly bold and personal handling they all receive will hardly make this poet popular with those super blacks and super biggers whose common notion of revolutionary relevance and sense of urgency lead them to view with simple hostility any writing by any black man that is good by virtue of precision and subtlety of phrase rather than simpleness and consciously unantiliterary directness there is to be no stretching out with words that makes the least uncommon demand on the peoples imagination allah forbid thus jones first two volumes of poetry preface and the dead lecturer are largely viewed as dangerously preblack to pursue these brothers and sisters further these are the people who find no difficulty in neatly distinguishing blacks from negroes universalists from nittygritty soul experts the lost wouldsowantto be whites from properly dedicated and pure liberated militants and afros ask them what is blackness and you would never get the mercifully optional though very elaborate and lengthy list that brother poet emanuel offers in the first piece of this group nor would many of the individual things itemized escape the blackstarched indignation of the secure and very black whether statements contained in the following rearranged series of couplets might or might not stand a brothers chance of passing depends on the degree of presumption and blackerthan thouness one is willing to exercise there we have it a list as thoroughgoing as it is incomplete but then  is not the elaborate catalogue structure of the poem a sufficient commentary in itself on the inadequacy of all definitions especially those that must depend on enumerating individual items such as those found here even the element of surprise which challenges the readers personal notion of what is true of blackness is used by brother emanuel and very effectively to reenforce just that very point all definitions are inadequate and especially those that rely on enumeration general head countingthat is taking general survey or pollis a process of enumerating another bristling example from this same group of poems the negro takes us by a more direct route deeper into the question of defining blackness deeper into the thicket where blackmaneating fleshstripping bloodgulping uniquefeatureliquidating creatures roamcreatures hitherto the exclusive pets of white criticreviewers called universals the poem leads us deeper into an awareness of the pitfalls of definition by leaving us with the weird impression that some black writers are as white as their critics meaning that they use the white critics trick of denying a human shape to black experience by setting a hostile pack of preconceived notions upon it or viewed another way black experience is forced before a mirror that reflects nothing actual or concrete about what is placed before it the least tendency to depart from the blankness of such a mirror of such an arbitrary and preconceived standard is labeled insignificant if not altogether nonexistent the blankness itself is labeled universal man or just man in the abstract it once appeared that black minds were calling the white minds bluff when they would say universal man is just an abstraction sweetheart now it would seem that instead of calling the white critics bluff these words were simply intended to swipe his thunder for abstractions in a black mouth are just as sweet to some is not every black mans black man an abstraction too emanuel seems to be clearly suggesting as much in his poem the negro so formal definition itself it would seemat least the scientific dictionary way of arriving at and conveying meaningis a process of excluding the fullblooded uniqueness and significance of people and things definitions are a very strict rigid spiritkilling fleshdismissing way of regarding life the fate of being defined by them is much like the fate of a living language in the grip of a school grammar the threat of being defined justifies all of the apprehensive restlessness that these lines from gwendolyn brooks a lovely love leaves vibrating in the ear  do i see any hands questions comments    wolf tickets a very good question indeed sister even an improvement on the brothers silence over there this poem is indeed a very sound place for getting down with it to the matter of a black aesthetic we need only reflect on leaves of a color hard to name and we have begun in earnest to be deeply black deeply involved in the mystery of memories and time and placea place such as the title poem invites us to to every man his treehouse   what has this poets fondness of things vital and green and alive turning and changing in peril and pregnancywhat has all this to do with fondling a black aesthetic why have we been backed into this irritationarea of trees part of the not so simple answer is given in emanuels more vernacular get up blues  just promised someone not to go on telling more and moreespecially about fishermen or even try conveying the delightful humor of pieces like the voyage of jimmy poo the darker more matteroffact teasing to which brother emanuel subjects the colonialist oppressors in a view from the white helmet nor the strong fun and substance of freedom rider washout i will admit though and by way of conclusion that this would have been a mercifully shorter pieceand a far more incisive one toohad i simply enlisted brother lerois swift twilight touch to pay even passing tribute to what brother emanuel has achieved and said so well and masterfully here in the treehouse and other poems for instance jones style would have conveyed swiftly and simply both emanuels own style and content
what is arbitrarily labelled black revolutionary theatre in the summer issue of the drama review is actually a catchall phrase to describe the political philosophy and aesthetic attitude of many young black rebellious playwrights the editors of tdr were largely influenced by the above factor in their decision to give ed bullins resident playwright at the new lafayette theatre unprecedented freedom to edit this issue at his discretion for it is a reasonable assumption that only a negro writer can express the thoughts and feelings of other negroes in a nation that often ignores the black presence in the midst of american culture an important and unique aspect of black awareness is present in this collection of essays and oneact plays leroi jones is undoubtedly the prophet behind this black arts movement whose converts believe that the contradictions between ethics and aesthetics in western society are symptomatic of a dying society these ideas expressed by the poetessayist larry neal are greatly expanded in the opening article of this issue black writers represented here have attempted collectively to expose and destroy the repressive degrading drama of white america through an ethical political and cultural revolution no more will they engage in the falsification of actuality as advocated by the ideas and actions of whites especially as they relate to the black man and his cultural heritage  a manifesto for a black aesthetic is echoed throughout this issue questions are raised concerning ultimates such as truth ethics and morals the ideology behind the movement is clearer however than the artistic form used to express it an attempt to convey the content of black experience prior to the creation of a unique theatrical form has resulted in the recreation of naturalism perhaps this traditional form is most suitable to the sociopolitical context of black revolutionary drama bullins has collected a group of new plays to express black consciousness rather than essays and articles because drama has the potential to evoke immediate action most of the oneacters represented here are unable structurally to support the weight of characters and ideas too often the playwright is bellowing at the white beast who denies his voice papas daughter by dorothy ahmad take care of business by marvin x and claras ole man by ed bullins are the few plays that speak directly to black america a particular kind of human experience is spoken of through these plays in a few cases the authors have found a suitable dramatic form through which to explore elements of black expression what is important is whether the theatrical experience images the truth of human action and the beauty of the human spirit and absence of dramatic form in most of these plays is replaced by content that speaks to all mankind either directly or indirectlyfloyd gaffney 
i would like to take some issue with your editorial on chauncey warrington hildreth iii esq which appeared in the november  edition first it is quite childish and shallow at a time when we truly need depth and perception second it speaks in broad generalities and stereotypes much like those of the segregationist reactionary press which portray all negroes in an all too familiar insulting vein third it is silly and offers nothing positive or constructive it is criticism of the immature type and i think we have enough shallow thinking and behavior from those who oppose racial progress and as a group striving for improvement we cannot indulge in that luxury but apart from those rather general criticisms let us try to analyze the picture portrayed so critically with innuendo and invective let us try to add a bit of intelligence to a very trite and contrived portrayal  cwh iii is supposed to have a good job the only of his group with some ficticious firm this must mean that he is in the   salary bracket which in most cases is a junior executive of between  and  years of age cwh iii was born between  and  if as is indicated he went through schools that were integrated in the s and s he was indeed quite rare also in the s and s the days of depression of amos and andy stepin fetchit etc if he went to integrated schools he certainly took much abuse was poked fun at ignored and discouraged by his teachers denied all participation in the ordinary social activities of his school probably given grades lower than he deserved may have been barred from participation in athletics and was certainly barred from such things as restaurants plays and other forms of public convenience if as the article indicates he got through this difficult period and still had what it takes to go on to college he was probably quite a guy  being in the  age group it is likely he served in segregated armed forcesquartermasters in the army cook in the navyduring world war ii he had none of the advantages of the training and opportunity for advancement now found in the services  if he went to an integrated college then he had to compete on better than equal terms with his white counterparts he probably worked at odd jobs to help pay his way through school even if his parents were professionals few made very much during the depression years and not until some time after the war was there real prosperity among negro professionals but the point here is that cwh iii had to compete with  the cards stacked against him on the basis of his individual abilitieswith little or no help from faculty or teachers if he went to an integrated schooland probably a great deal of downright hostility and discouragement again he would have been effectively barredif as you indicate he attended an integrated university from all the normal activities of university life  you state his parents were professional people do you have any conception of what it meant to obtain professional status in the s if cwh iii is in his s his parents must be in their s that means they were in college in the s to get a professionalor any other degree in the s was rare and required the utmost perseverance fortitude and luck cwh ills father certainly must have worked as a waiter or probably ran the road as a pullman porter he must have worked extremely hard to attain professional statuspass licensing exams that were rigged to prevent negroes from entering professionsif a physician all medical schools were closed except howard or meharry the article completely ignores the atmosphere of the s and s when the klan was a respectable organization lynchings were common and all doors were closed to negroes of ability further if his parents had the courage to live in an integrated neighborhood then they are to be admired in fact it is likely that one or both died prematurely as the strain imposed on the negro with ability and ambition in the s and s generally took its toll in a reduced life span  now we have chauncey iii in a good job what does this mean is all now peaches and cream the article would so imply nothing further is needed simply collect the fat pay check and be arrogant well if cwh iii is in fact the only negro in a white firm he has a hard hard way to go the brief case in the picture had better be filled with plenty of work to do at home and on weekends for if he does not produce and produce better than his white counterparts he is out there is likely some bright young caucasian fresh out of harvard or yale dating the vice presidents daughter breathing down his neck and envying his job cwh iii is still barred from the places that really count in the power structurethat is the private clubs golf courses etc where real decisions are made he had better work hard and produce on ability or he will go to work one day and find someone else at his desk in other words cwh iii is in the real world now with its infighting and struggles for power which the average negro especially it seems negro digest has absolutely no comprehension he must fight every day and must fight with one arm tied behind his back and one eye closed as he can never be where the real decisions are made or be on the social terms which in todays world insure success and mobility thus in a time when the group is desperately striving to raise itself the virtues of chauncey iiidiscipline ability fortitude neatness and the courage to face the majority group alone on its own termsshould be virtues for admiration no other minority group decries its own who have succeeded or demands a rigid standard of conformity to patterns which debase achievement and equate success with rejection no program for involvement of the socalled black middle class is advocated in the article what precisely is it negro digest wants what program is laid out what goals what objectiveswhere is there anything but the most trite of commonplace generalities when cwh iii comes home after a hour day worried about the bright young fellow after his job and out of the inner circle at the office what is he supposed to do the things required of cwh iii on a daytoday basis are the things that must be achieved by black people as a whole if they are to progress these are not western virtues or the socalled alien culture of the majority group but the disciplines that are required in every modern society whether it be in the us europe asia or elsewhere and without regard to racein other words the disciplines of the modern world without these effort is a waste of time which i suspect chauncey iii must feel about some of the childish unrealistic ravings of socalled negro leaders what the modern world requires is discipline organization ability which is not instant but takes a long long time self criticism personal neatness and good personal conduct especially the ability to be quiet and in the modern technological world these can only be obtained by facing the power structure on its own terms in other words the skills and insights chauncey is obtaining must be obtained by the group as a whole if we are to succeed not because they are the mores of an alien culture forced upon unwilling black people but because this is the way the world operates and its either get in or stay out that we have no concept of this is evident from the printing of the chauncey iii article whether we like it or not the world of chauncey iii is the world and we had better develop a cadre of people who have been exposed to it and its pressures you certainly do not gain this type of experience by pretending you dont need it for your magazine to decry in a childish superficial way these necessities is simply evidence of what a long long way we have to go and how pathetic are some of thoseie negro digestwho seek to show the way does the negro digest advocate  that cwh iii quit his job and go to work in the ghetto would this really help all trained negroes cant give up their professions to work in the ghetto this is pure folly it would be counter productive and severely limit the types of training contacts and insights that must be acquired if we are to move forward despite his appearance of luxury if cwh iii is a junior executive his salary is not large enough to permit much financial help if he is to keep up appearances that are as much required by his job as is coming to work on time perhaps he could do moreand probably would if properly approachedbut he is a long way from the affluence that permits large donations to causesregardless  of their merit and if he is perceptive he is not going to give to groups that show a lack of responsibility discipline and objective programs if he is sophisticated enough to have come through the trials and tribulations of your indicated integrated background then he can surely see through those leaders who approach every problem with an open mouth  and whose real motivation is ego in any case to limit and find worth in any one sphere of activity is counterproductive negroes must advance on all fronts acquire as many skills as possible or otherwise you have a self imposed prison that is easily surrounded handledand since the leadership is inbred and unsophisticatedeasily dismissed riots or not riots the black mans place in this society is at the bottom and he is controllable his thrashing about apart from being a good way for tv news media to increase its ratings are really little more than pinpricks in the power structure the worst possible thing is to overestimate your power and importance now back to chauncey iii what can he do in his job first negroes generally being unsophisticated as is so evident from reading negro di gest have no conception of how things are really done chauncey iii is in the scheme in which he operates at a very low level he cannot waive a wand and bring in more negroes at the earliest with all the obstacles he faces in  years he  might be at high enough position to make some impact the socalled big jobs that the johnson pubications harp about are really quite little and insignificant in the real scheme of things and even when a negro obtains a really powerful jobie a cabinet memberhe still must play according to the rules or he will not have his job long in other words he must play exactly the same game that every one else in the power structure  operates underthat is discipline planning and above all no rash or emotional acts therefore there is only a limited number of things he can do that will show immediate assistance to the negro masses but this is the way things are played have been played and will be played in this country and in all other countries in the modern world for you cannot run away and find any road to instant success and there is nothing anyone least of all the socalled negro leaders can do about itviolently or otherwise up is a long term hard job and we had better prepare our youth for discipline training selfsacrifice and good conduct if they are to make it now supposing other minorities say the jewish grouphad imposed the silly selfdefeating rule that every one had to subvert his own personal progress for group service without any real monetary reward jews would still be running little corner stores and helping each other to speak english instead they made individual achievement the hallmark and excellence and personal selfsacrifice to attain personal achievement as the method of progress their group responsibilities were great and demanding but they were done quietly there were no open mouth jewish leadersand with good organization their most competent sophisticated provide the leadership and the contacts to move the group as a whole there was no either or approach does negro digest think for one moment that jews would decry one of their group who attained financial success and all its attributes rather he would be the hero and the model for others to emulatewhich is exactly what has occurred only the negro foolishly decries his own achievements if all the chaunceys in the country gave up their jobs and went to work in the ghetto the only thing that would be accomplished is more confusion in fact working in the ghetto is probably the last thing the socalled instant negro leaders really want as their positionsbased largely on egotistical emotional charismatic appeals and simple solutions the same techniques used by george wallace et alwould be threatened therefore whether negro digest or socalled instant negro leaders like it or not chauncey iii will probably make it and make it in a very substantial way if his virtues are imitatedas other groups have imitated the virtues of its successfulthen many will make progress for despite all difficulties and frustrations there is some progress if they are ignored and deprecated and instead slovenliness loudness lack of organization lack of discipline and lack of working hard to take advantage of training opportunities are passed off as maintaining our cultural heritage then the children of these people will and will forever be the maids and dishwashers of chauncey iv let us see negro digest make some intelligent sophisticated proposals which after reading the digest i doubt is possiblealthough it would be refreshing to see and honest if bungled try for involving chauncey or try asking chauncey for his ideas and dont react with customary immature emotion and ravings of uncle tom instead try listening to his suggestions but whatever is done do it quietly dont advertise your lack of sophistication
ive always known that i was a second class citizen in my beloved country america but somewhere along the way this made me try harder to earn my share of it and enjoy it i think i enjoy it more and am prouder because i did have to prove myself i know i shouldnt have had to do this but since i did im glad i had the determination not to bask in defeat every time i talked to other people who were always finding excuses for not trying blaming their failure on everyone but themselves reminded me that even though my parents were professionals who brought me up in a stable middle class neighborhood i knew that they were probably not always middle class and had worked hard and stuck to it to become socalled middle class you know when you become a middle class negro you pay taxes property taxes the land that go to help our less fortunate black brothers and sisters and you hope with all your might that they will use it to benefit themselves and not give up because you see that just about all socalled middle class negroes got theirs the hard way against odds that their donations to the naacp and the urban league have helped to eliminate during these protest years they might have been working on two jobs to pay the everrising property tax now they didnt really have to look for a job they were already there waiting for them and looking for someone to do them no one should envy the middle class negro because if things are as bad as they are supposed to be he must have a pretty hard time getting to be middle class as you call it now i know that with a lot of cooperation from all thinking people white and black working with a lot of white employers all of a sudden there are a lot of jobs going begging stop look and listen things are better stop bristling and march with us to a better world not perfect but if we all help it will be better this is the only country we have we dont know what another country would be like we cannot fight until we get every narrow minded person to admit that they wronged a people  years ago but we dont need them instead of us wallowing in the defeats of the past leave them behind and come with the middle class negro that is if a middle class negro is a property tax payer look at the blocks and blocks of black taxpayers this means that we have a concern for our school windows and other destruction that our poor misguided children have been led to believe that only whitey has to pay for i can see what youll say if you ever read this but i feel that we dont have to ask if we can control our neighborhood i will contribute towards this i feel like i would like to stop begging now and do please dont take my freedom of speech away if i do not agree with the extremists please dont take away my freedom to say it i can not say that the middle class negro has not helped in the struggle but if you want more help you will have to meet us half way im willing to give a little if you are and maybe we can have a meeting of the minds come out from under and expose some of the good negroes we have teachers lawyers doctors newspapers and a lot of people who are willing to help we cannot fight individuals or well fight the longest war of history come black brothers i havent the time to wait for you but i am hoping that you join me and do your share to build a better world
