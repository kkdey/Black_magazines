why i fight for america 
in the wake of the emmett till slaying £ in august  the question was first asked me by a german taxi driver as we sped along the autobahn in his country during december of that same year a womans refusal to move to the rear of a bus in montgomery alabama made the world sit up and take note it also made me a target for the question as asked by a spaniard in barcelona in  when nine childrens efforts to enter school created chaos in a city when pictures ol a negro minister being kicked by segregationists in little rock glared from billboards in paris a frenchman asked me the same question news of the freedom rides did not stop when the busses did the same news traveled on to foreign countries the sitins walkins and standins were launched in the states but like long range missiles their impacts were heard in distant lands when a lone negro braved hostile crowds to register in a southern college federal marshals were not the only ones who watched so did the world now as i stand on this little race is engaged in a constant struggle a great fight to secure first class citizenship but our fight is not a lawless one it is protected nay precipitatedby the laws of our country the constitution the bill of rights and all the rulings that combine to form the just laws of the land the very freedom for which we are fighting springs from those laws and those laws give us the right to fight it is then only fitting and proper that we should serve in the armed forces of our country for there are those of us who must make contributions to the higher cause so that all the other causes will not lose their meanings i am making my contribution i fight to protect those laws during my brief travels i have found that men of all races can live together in peace i recall the times when i have had friends who were like brothers though they were not of my race those friendships cause me to think that brothers are not always of the same blood kith and kin but are sometimes born in the minds of men who live together in strange and foreign lands my prayer is that such births will occur in the minds of my countrymen that we all might reach the scale where the chords of our living will blend into a harmony that sings the greatness of america i fight because i feel that my prayer is not in vain and i stand on this little pacific isle with that feeling growing stronger each time i look westward towards my home

the basic approach of v the nonviolent revoluj tion will not change it will be marked by increasing frequency and intensity of activity it is already evident that the south will not be the chief focus of activity the entire nation will feel the brunt of nonviolent forces demanding freedom now the south will see most of the activity focused on schools and public accommodations the norths activity will center chiefly on employment and housing in no event will any form of discrimination go unchallenged it has become remarkably clear in the national community that we have a problem a few months ago race relations was only the concern of a small minority and a handful of agitators significantly that which was kindled in birmingham amid fire hoses and police dogs and given a tremendous vote of confidence at the lincoln memorial on august  has drawn active support from the great majority that had been at best uncommitted hundreds of thousands have come off the fence the religious forces have become involved as never before birmingham has become a watershed of history in the nonviolent revolution much of our conversation in years to come will be dated with such phrases as before birmingham and since birming i i yet with all of its significance birmingham has not been quite enough to convince the powers that belocally statewide and nationallythat an atmosphere of urgency exists despite the civil_rights package being the most sweeping civil_rights legislation ever proposed the political overtones of the  elections seem much too apparent in the face of the seven bombings since the birmingham agreement including that which cost the lives of six and the injury of a score more the department of justice is still using policy as a guide line instead of preventive measures being invoked there is still only the disposition to give ambulance service southern racist political figures must be made to understand that the federal court orders are to be enforced partv affiliation and concerns notwithstanding who might gainsay that if barnett had been jailed during the travesty at the university of mississippi perhaps we would not have had to contend with georee c wallace our kid glove treatment of the real anarchists and subversivesthe barnetts and the wallaceshas cost us a terrible price in human life paradoxically i submit that in the one single instance where the federal government has moved it has been against negroes intimately involved in the desegregation movement how despicable that slater king dr anderson and other leaders of the nonviolent movement in albany georgia were placed under federal indictment for obstructing justice and perjury there is no federal indictment against the sheriff who caned attorney c b kingbut it is under investigation there is no indictment against the peace officer who bludgeoned mrs king into unconsciousness and killed her unborn childbut it is under investigation there is no indictment against countless acts of police brutality and murder that take place all over the southbut it is under investigation so now the department of justice takes to trial the leadership of a local community who have sparked the fight against the illegal system under which they are forced to live the maximum penalty andor  years in prison organized labor has failed in at least one respect that can be pointed up by the experience of danville virginia in danville as in other southern cities the legal maneuvering goes on endlessly  picketing an established protest device is being harassed with all kinds of restrictions and codes now that negroes have employed it in their fight against segregation the dan river mills with all of its force of organized labor has been absolutely silent when the right to picket was limited by city ordinance to x number of pickets when they wake up twenty years or maybe ten yearsfrom now and automation is full blown they will be crying to high heaven about the unconstitutionality of picketing restrictions that were born solely to keep black people psychologically and economically enslaved where are their voices now the time to speak is now but the beleaguered forces of the negro community have not heard from organized labor in danville other quarters of the national community have been equally unconcerned thus the freedom now forces must devise some way to command the attention of the national community in order that all the emoluments of citizenship are secured once now and forever one of the ways the attention of the nation might be claimed to spur a creative and immediate resolution to the problem could well be the implementation of a national program of economic withdrawal a massive refusal to buy on the part of the negro community and others of good will would throw the business world into shock maybe then and only then will the nations financial leaders exert some initiative in eliminating the evils of segregation and discrimination this is not as farfetched as it may appear the ebb and flow of finance in every community determines to a large degree the character and morality of its politics in countless communities the impact on the flow of dollars by the nonviolent movement has been a strong leverif not the strongest leverto alter the traditional patterns in race relations it has already been strongly inferred that a national conference on selective buying may soon be called the strategic choice of consumer commodities to serve as targets nationally could even get some attention from the moguls of wall street someone has said appropriately money does not talk it screams just consider how swiftly segregated patterns could be altered if in threequarters of the nation the struggle for selfrespect and human dignity has as an ally the forces of the business world though it is a seldommentioned fact business leaders have a responsibility to national morality or again has the moment come in the development of the nonviolent revolution when we will be forced by delays and painfully slow results on some appointed day at some appointed hour to literally immobilize the nation until  she acts on our plea for justice and morality is the day faroff when major transportation centers will be strangled by mass acts of civil disobedience airports train stations bus terminals the traffic of large cities interstate commerce will be halted by the bodies of witnesses nonviolently insisting on freedom now i suppose a nationwide work stoppage might attract enough attention to persuade some one to do something to get this monkey of segregation and discrimination off our backs once now and forever will it take one or all of these of course there is always the fast unto death why not are we not daily politically and economically strangled to death by the thousands under the present system finally let me say there is no guarantee that equality of opportunity will come this year or within the next five its possible that it may not come in teneven at the risk of national disaster but even if it is deferred another  years the cry will remain freedom now in the midst of daily humiliation where we are still forced to be guided in ordinary pursuits by signs that say white and colored even if it must be said through clenched teeth our cry remains freedom now as we recognize the realities of continuing job discrimination and know full well that we are still the last hired and the first fired even with no prospect of paycheck at the end of the week unfailingly our demand persists freedom now when we return to the negro ghetto at night weary and footsore after a day of fruitless searching for a decent home in a neighborhood where we are able to pay the going price despite the frustration of open and subtle housing discrimination we must insist freedom now there are times when we will tire of endless litigation state by state county by county school board by school board plaintiff by plaintiff in order that the children bom of the loins of our bodies may have the opportunity of a desegregated education our cry remains freedom now there will be moments when we will not be riding the crest of great demonstrations that lead to success our efforts will sputter and utterly fail candidates for jail will be scarce sufficient bond money nonexistent apathy deeply entrenched but our cry must remain freedom now our flesh will tear under the assault of police dogs our bodies will literally break under the forces of billy sticks we will not be able to stand before fire hoses our spirits will be crushed by reprisal and fear but our cry must remain freedom now even as we stand in the rubble of burned and bombed churches or at the bier of a slain medgar evers or hear the anguished cry of little girls dying in sunday school and the prospect of the damning of the unborn our cry must remain freedom now

bill russell the dark gainly and responsible man who is center and cocaptain of the boston celtics the perennial champions of the national basketball association is without question one of the most remarkable athletes of our time yet he regards his life up to now as a waste i dont consider anything i have done he has said as contributing to society i consider playing professional basketball as marking time the most shallow thing in the world russell is not biting the hand that feeds him and his family he is too canny and practical a man he is not sullying basketball in any meaningful sense either it is rather that he is close to  years old and has made certain judgments that seem to him so correct and obvious that he is not afraid to enunciate them basketball or any other sport is at bottom frivolous and the imposition of being a negro at this moment in history is an obligation that cannot be met on the floor of the boston garden where and how he can fulfill it russell does not yet know in six full seasons with the celtics russell has been selected four times by the players in the league as the nbas most valuable player including the last three years in succession on the other two occasions he was runnerup before russell joined the celtics late in  hey had led the league in scoring for the five foregoing years but nonetheless each year the celtics had been eliminated in the divisional playoffs in russells tenure boston has won six of seven championships the only year it lost out russell was injured during the final playoff series and did not play in two of the last three games his contributions to his teams welfare are however often unsung not long ago for instance it waswho elserussell who found a teammates contact lens on the court do  have to do everything for this club he said with an indulgent smile   the foundation of russells brilliant play however is not blocking shots rebounding or his other purely physical skills it is rather his admirable mind and purpose his intelligencehe knows what to do with the balland his pride people dont realize says auerbach that this is a brain out there people think of him as just a big guy with fantastic coordination but he approaches being a genius once the game starts i admire his mind off the court too auerbach adds not entirely facetiously because hes smart enough to understand  » me to sum it all up says heinsohn hes got a hell of a lot of pride when hes playing his game it makes us almost unbeatable and the secret to the thing is that he gets himself up so often hes so nervous before a game he upchucks he wants to be the best in everything he does says cocaptain frank ramsey he hates to lose as long as the teams winning hes completely happy as long as hes playing real great ball were winning then hes the life of the party you hear that laugh  miles around hes only moody with himself although bill russell has much to laugh about and does in his high rackety way there are only two things that could make me quit coaching says auerbach my wife and russells laugh he is at intervals an angry dissatisfied  and aloof man of uncommon principle and is no less remarkable as a person than he is as an athlete russells scraggly beard is a telling indication of the man not only is russell nearly  feet  and blackcircumstances obviously over which he has no controlbut he has deliberately set himself further apart by being one of the few professional athletes to wear a beard ask him why he grew it and he will reply in time if he feels like it ive thought about it and ive thought about it why did i wear the beard why do i its part of this thingive always fought so hard to be different and i am different without even trying and maybe its just my own little revolution it just isnt done in polite circles in a sense but i do think its part of my personality when i first joined the celtics i shaved the beard off i did it on my own it was none of their business and if i had valued their opinion i would have asked them i made a concession to conformity at that time then i grew it back after we won the first championship i let heinsohn shave it off and then i grew it back again it was a very childish thing in the sense of defiance i wear it now to let people know i am an individual i do think for myself and im very opinionated contrary to popular belief im a living thinking breathing human being they say i owe the public this and i owe the public that what i owe the public is the best performance i can give period if someone asks me for an autograph i think its a waste but i sign them occasionally sometimes i just feel like being nice or it gets rid of them i personally dont care what people think of me i dont think i think any different than anyone else but i may act different one thing im not is a liar its not a matter of moralsmore a matter of ego i think too much of myself to misrepresent myself ill do anything i can for anyone as long as it doesnt hurt me but i have sympathy for very few people basketballthats all people want to talk to me about its a waste because they have nothing to say i resent people who talk to you and have nothing to say so i dont say anything hows the weather up there how are things on main street thats where i live what the heck kind of question is that you must be a basketball player because youre so tall just walk up and put it in eh no im not a basketball player i just kept growing what size bed do you sleep in i hate for people to get personal a big bed how much do you eat its ridiculous if you mind your own business life aint bad if you do the best you can thats the best you can do were a bunch of grown men playing a childs game its a childs game weve made into a mans game by complicating it silly isnt it we entertain people for x number of hours during the winter they may talk about it for a few minutes maybe an hour then its forgotten is this a contribution no analyze itits a silly game im also a silly man because i enjoy it i enjoy baseball too perhaps im a little dull it is not easy for a white man to understand or totally accept the vision of a black man skin is the hardest boundary the point is this bill russell or any other black man like him does not want the white mans sympathy or indeed his friendship what he wants is recognition and acceptance of himself as an individual a black individual who can meet the world on equal terms and fare unequally according to his merit a few things have happened russell says ive got three kids now a certain amount of responsibility to them i also have a certain amount of responsibility to a lot of other kids i give most negroes a certain amount of pride heres one of our guys doing all right they say the world cant be all bad that contribution is very shallow of course im practical where else but in basketball could i command this salary it is estimated in excess of  man does what he has to but the contribution id like to make as a personto my kids and little black kids all over the worldis to make life better so their ambitions arent stifled when they face the world to give them the opportunity to do what theyre most skilled at i could have a burning ambition to give my kids a million dollars if i gave them that alone id be giving them nothing the most any kid can ask for says russell is to succeed or fail on his merits success and failure are relative everyone doesnt have presidential abilities and everyone cant be an allamerica it doesnt necessarily mean youre a failure my fathers a foundry worker this doesnt necessarily mean hes a failurebecause another persons father is a lawyer society needs both some people are going to be laborers but why say a man has to be a laborer because hes black one right we never had in this countrywe never had the right to be a failure or an individual why if one black man fails should all black men fail thats what the struggle is about whether its through love as with martin_luther_king or through pride as with the naacp or through hate as with malcolm_x and elijah muhammad what does the american negro want the editorials ask i find this very stupid were all products of our society and the acceptable standards are the same we want the same things when they write about birmingham the papers refer to outsiders and racial agitators to the black people of the us there is no such thing as an outsider theres been too much play on words in this country negroes have to earn their rights they say my oldest son buddha william felton russell jr was born on november   suppose  kids were born around boston that day why does my son have to earn any more than any of those  kids i was bom on february   why do i have to earn more than anyone else there used to be a lot of emphasis on the first negro to do this the first negro to do that its unimportant whos the first or whos the last the important thing is how many the rest is tokenism when thurgood marshall was made a judge it made me feel real good because he never attempted to disassociate himself like some educated negroes some negroes live in a twilight zone closing themselves off into a small white society the negro world doesnt concern them i feel sorry for themto an extent education is the acquiring of the ability to think for oneself anyone can get through college on memory courses if a negro judge says i dont think of myself as a negro just as a competent judge hes not facing life the way it is in our society its harder to face it the other way but you can sleep at nightevery night although everyone in his family is a life member of the naacp russell has not played a major role in any single negro organization he does not look upon himself as a leader and is uncomfortable in crowds he views the negro movement as being various in means but single in aim and feels that its factionalism is not divisive but a search for the most effective way i would have loved to go to birmingham russell says but im not passive sometimes i think i have tendencies to violence ive been mad enough to fight three times in my life and each time i wanted to kill the man you know the athletes i admire ted williams jackie robinson and sonny liston its easy to be easygoing and friendly to everyone i think a man has to be what he is if he feels good he is good if he doesnt he isnt im an admirer of floyd patterson too these are honest people in the sense of representing themselves some negro athletes dont show me much im disappointed in them they are politicians in the sense of saying the right things all the time if i went down there to birmingham and let someone spit on me and didnt do anything about it it wouldnt be me if you never really express dissatisfaction concretely people tend to ignore it if you believe in something youve got to say it this passive kick if it doesnt work how can they keep preaching it it is predicated on the premise that people are basically moral if they are right this is wonderful if they are wrong the religious phase of the movement will be destroyed if martin_luther_king is wrong he has  failed as a leader maybe im becoming a fatalist or whatever you call it morality is a very large word morality and love have a lot in common who can really define it what is moral and what is immoral it is relative ive been reading about the black muslims a lot of things they say express the way i feel perfectly or rather a great deal of the things they say i cannot disagree with can the races get along yes will they get along thats the question the muslims say the white mans a devil i dont agree with that because i dont think there is such a thing as a devil they say the white man is evil i wonder about that in the sense that i wonder whether all men are evil i dislike most white people because they are people as opposed to dislike i like most black people because i am black i consider this a deficiency in myselfmaybe if i looked at it objectively detached myself it would be a deficiency in  russell first went to black africa on a tour for the state department the continent had such an impact upon him that he bought part ownership of a rubber farm in liberia and named his baby daughter karen kenyatta after jomo kenyatta the prime ministerdesignate of kenya and onetime mau mau leader whom russell greatly admires russell is thinking quite seriously of settling in liberia i found a place i was welcome because i was black in stead of in spite of being black he says the basic problem in negro america is the destruction of race pride one could say we have been victims of psychological warfare in a sense in that this is a white country and all the emphasis is on being white whiter than white according to the law immigrants from northern european countries are more desirable than any others when a white man says his folks come from ireland he says it with a certain amount of pride he probably can trace his family tree for generations for whatever its worth this is not true of the american negro until the emergence of the independent african countries all we knew about africa was from the tarzan and jungle jim movies how stupid they made the natives one white mantarzanwas the best and smartest at everything even king kong after accepting the sacrifice of blacks for years when he was offered a white girl he didnt kill her he fell in love with her pride in being black was practically destroyed by seeing stupid things like this there was almost a sense of selfdegradation also until very recently the socalled negro elite was fairskinned the problem i see in africa is that it has to build a middle class all your great political and social changes have been brought about by the middle classmerchants artisans technicians africas needs are not necessarily administrators  but people who can doplumbers toolanddiemakers draftsmen black africa is stepping from carrying things on the head to carrying them in airplanes theyve skipped the wheelbarrow the horse and buggy and practically railroads they have problems so immense where do you start you educate as many as you can but everyone who gets an education wants to be an administrator people have to realize there are stations in life forms of success everyone wants to have the ultimate success everyone cant have it someone must roll their sleeves up and go to work i find it a very perplexing problem whether i should go to africa or stay here ive thought about it a great deal if my contribution would be more concrete here no doubt i should stay here when i look at the struggle of the american negro i cant help but be very very proud with what weve had to work with weve done a pretty good job of surviving but we still have so far to go    it would be a hell of a country    its a great country as it is now we have to define great an ambiguous word great industrial empire standard of living  i think it would be so much greater if everyone had an equal opportunity in every field there is no way to speculate how much brainpower this country has lost and we dont have to like each other to live together peacefully and equally have you ever read how in the time of drought all the animals use the same water hole the lions stay with the lions the tigers with the tigers the elephants live with elephants but they all use the same water hole of course because of his wealth and position russells experiences do not parallel those of most black men most of the time he lives on a white block in a white town has white babysitters and drives a  lincoln continental convertible the fact that owning a big car is considered a negro stereotype does not concern russell ive passed the stage he says where i have to prove anything i happen to like watermelon too there may come a time when i have to ride a bicycle it wont bother me it just wont be as fast or convenient in boston russells celebrity is so great he can no longer enjoy himself at the ballpark or at night clubs he gets too much attention once in a while however the ineradicable fact of being black which he has never forgotten intellectually falls upon him and wounds him like a blow in the summer of  russell said the other day i took my two sons to louisiana where i was born and lived for nine yearsto see my grandfather i make a reasonable living im a reasonable intelligent person i bathe regularly so im pretty much a normal human being but from the time i left washington dc we couldnt eat i had only driven the road once before so i was following the map staying on the main road we couldnt stop and eat or sleep i wasnt really hungry i was just trying to get food for my kids i wasnt interested in socializing or rubbing elbows some negro entertainers try to show the whites that they are nice people all of us are nice people but the movement is not a popularity contest i dont care if the waitress likes me when i go into a restaurant all i want is something to eat i drove a pretty nice car had a few hundred bucks on melegal tenderbut i couldnt stop to eat or sleep i bet any russian you name from khrushchev on down would have had a nice trip to louisiana what can you tell a kid  and a kid  no one can justify this to me customs and traditions and all that junk one of the greatest crimes is apathy im kind of hardheaded youre either against me or for me being neutral you support the status quo you see this going on you say thats sad it really shouldnt be say it to a few people and it makes you feel better this is apathy all i ask is that you practice good citizenship vote and try to accept people for what they are as persons if you do that you give everyone an equal chance if you come to me and say youre not prejudiced youre lying i think all whites feel guilty but im not sure they know what they feel guilty about  bill russells life is founded on the facts that he is black was poor and grew taller than most men he was born in monroe la and moved to oakland calif when he was  when he was  his mother died he was raised by his father when my mother died russell says my father was a young man and he could very easily have shipped me and my brother off with relatives but we stayed together it wasnt all good and it wasnt all bad some of the bad things that happened i have come to understand when youre poor its a different world my brother used to run track did the  in  thats not badand my father came out one day and raced him with work shoes on my brother says he won and my father says he won and i say it was a dead heat its not important the important thing was that my father got in the race i remember this field in louisiana where the grass grew very tall sometimes wed all play hide and seekthe four of usin that field when it was time to go in my father would pick me up with one arm pick up my brother with the other arm my mother got on his back and he ran us all the way home everybody had a great time    although russell is just now entering his prime as a player he often ponders quitting basketball when i think about it he says there are a lot of things to con sider but it never has anything to do with quitting on top first of all im very much afraid of airplanes secondly the game takes a lot out of me i call it a ninehour game two hours getting mentally prepared two hours for the game itself and five hours before i get to sleep sometimes even then i cant get to sleep i feel that if i dont have a good game we will probably lose and it will be my fault during the playoffs its a hour game people say floyd patterson should quit i dont think so because hes not champion hes not a failure i think its false values if a guy feels he has to quit on top there are few enough pleasures in life not to do the thing you want to do one of the saddest things that has happened to me russell said the other day is that in basketball so many good things have happened to me its hard to get a real thrill any more you know what i get excited about nowwhen my kids say funny things or i get two new speakers for my stereo although i had a perfectly good system before that in russells home in reading a boston suburb he has installed a  stereo systemhe has  lp albums and who knows how many sand some  worth of electric trains are in the basement recently his wife rose began displaying some of russells basketball trophies around the house if it was up to me id put them away again russell says as far as im concerned there should be no pictures of the man of the house in his home and no trophies outside achievements dont belong in a family setting but rose has her own ideas too shes the finest person i ever met ive told her many times that if i was married to anyone else i wouldnt be married its difficult to live with a person of my character im moody and demanding in some ways inconsiderate in other ways im a pretty nice guy i think when bill russell permits you to get to know him you discover quickly that he is more than just a pretty nice guy you discover a firstrate and rewarding person and when you are talking to him or listening to him or beating him in gin rummyhes no ace at that gameyou do not think of him as a basketball player or a giant or a negro finally but as someone it is worth your while to be with

recently a young negro singer in performing an excerpt from the negro folk opera porgy and bess substituted mommy for mammy in the lyric it was a subtle change perhaps barely discernible to some but make no mistake the singer was exemplifying a deliberate attempt on the part of an organized pressure group to  viewpoint regulate any and all references to american negroes which exist in the fields of literature and the performing arts the national association for the advancement of colored people is to be commended for its original program adopted in  which states in part    to uplift the negro men and women of the country by securing for them the complete enjoyment of their rights as citizens justice in the courts and equal opportunity in every economic social and political endeavor in the united states is the cold calculated and often brutal editing of classical works the way to accomplish such a program in their cries for civil_rights negroes often also cry for an identity or heritage that they have lacked equal rights is true but that they lack a heritage is grossly untrue their heritage in this country began in the th century the very day their ancestors arrived their heritage is evident in the showboats of the mississippi the songs of the south the genius of a booker t washington and the minstrels that spanned a century and the breadth of the nation their heritage is evident in the mark twain works and the unique revival meetings that exist today yet these are the very things that are being attacked as unrealistic undignified distorted or degrading by far these accusations are unfounded in the fields of literature and performing arts who can truly say that twains cherished negro characters in his books of late th century life are unrealistic or that stephen fosters beloved old black joe is undignified where is the distorted view of the character joe in the jerome kernoscar hammerstein ii musical version of edna ferbers showboat or the degrading aspect of a firstrate negro song and dance man still some continue to criticize such things and attempt to have them partially or completely eliminated from the american scene apart from literary injustice to deny these things is to deny the very heritage they strive to locate if all minority groups in the united states attempted to change or eliminate entirely all references to their particular groups in literature or the performing arts on this basis then the world would have to forget forever the major works of harold arlen harry golden john steinbeck william faulkner the famous borscht circuit and all of americas dialecticians how utterly bland would be the american culture then pressure groups should cease this senseless purge and concentrate on the true problems negroes face in the country today

the other enemycomplacency
the freedom rides the fnnt freedom songs the  i £ very a r °f freedom and s  ght °f  ltlg awaited dream enroute toward reality this comforts my heart and nourishes my soul but deep in my mind im troubled by the question i ask  j so much has been written justifiably so about the inhumanity of white americans toward his black v brother and yet i see another enemy just as ruthless and as omni present as my oppressorthis enemy being that uncourageous contaminating stifling state of complacency characteristic of so many of my black brothers this despite the summer of discontent and the energetic efforts of dedicated leaders and faithful followers i see this state as a dwelling in dishonesty and i could only entitle one to  adopt it if i were convinced that he would not associate himself as a part of the victory when it has come to past perhaps this motivates my protest i see the complacent as one yho is not truly unaware certainly vnot unable to grasp the scent of freedom and i believe he will find it humanly impossible to pretend not to share the spirit of overcoming when that day comes shining through the line of defense hed so boldly assert would most probably be what do you mean i dont care no this is not at all what i mean certainly he cares what i know of humanity makes it almost impossible for me to believe that an american negro could truly not care deep down inside he has to care but what makes one man complacent and another not the complacent one simply hasnt the courage to admit his care to express his concern and to face the reality of himself he lacks the strength to recognize and seek release from selfoppression and he must do so before he can contribute to the immobilization of his oppressors the complacent will ask why my pen attacks him instead of attacking my oppressor but does he not realize that he is a tool of the oppressor is he so unaware of the role he is playing as opposed to the role he could play i dont suggest that each of us should or could exert the bravery of martin luther  king the dedication of james forman or the militancy of james baldwin but i do submit that these leaders depend on each of us for tfheir inspiration i further submit that our very manhood obligates us to support the cause that means o much to each of our lives since my initial exposure to the realities of our society ive harbored deep convictions about the plight of my people in  although at a very tender age i was quite aware of the supreme court decision one might say ive grown along with our protest but with more exposure to this reality i was also forced to see this other enemy complacency i used to wonder when we as a people would act i long to see us unified and to see our leadership truly lead im grateful that much of this is factual today but yet i cant ignore the lingering complacent and ive found him to be shockingly present despite the thunder of an awakened people i returned to these united states during last crucial summer after spending the past year overseas as a member of the armed forces during this time i followed the news reading everything available and upon being discharged i returned to my hometown chicago with a heart rejoicing with the prospects of a unified people ive seen much to be proud of but i couldnt ignore the obvious chicago is probably quite representative of my people for if there exists a melting pot for negroes my hometown most certainly qualifies it didnt take long for me to gather the feeling of the people and though i salute many i have no qualms about my criticism of the others i speak of those who say were making a spectacle of ourselves were not really bad off james baldwin is just mad and statements similar to these i can only think of them as victims but i long to see them reached because such a thinking has for so long victimized my race  we owe it to our unborn to be more realistic certainly i alone havent seen and heard these things and surely it disturbs many of us what must james forman feel when he walks the street the taste of a cell fresh in his mouth and comes face to face with complacency what hurt must the struggling although ailing roy wilkins feel when he is confronted with this most difficult of enemies though a negligible enemy perhaps in one man the force of an army when totaled i recall an incident that might have provoked or at least intensified my desire to speak out it occurred on thursday evening august  the day after the beautiful march on washington on this evening i attended a core rally with the featured speaker being james baldwin there was a pretty good crowd of devoted negroes and awakened caucasians in attendance but among this crowd with the exception of one clergyman i saw not one person i knew i was bom in chicago my existence has in no way been sheltered i know many people but where were they where was just one of them on this evening just one day after the most touching event of my lifetime i was reassured that my convictions were justified i must have walked away that night compelled to write this article i wish it had not been necessary have i answered the question no this has not been my intention ive only presented it the answer lies in the hearts and souls of my brothers i only know that when i think of the progress made i think also of the progress that could be made it can be made i dont suggest that everyone should picket i dont prescribe the organization one should join and i dont pretend to symbolize the nobility of a negro i only know that there is a spiritual beauty in joining hands and singing we will overcome and i firmly believe we shall we have shared oppression and if we share the responsibilities our goals demand so much sooner will we share the victory there is honor in taking the side of righteousness our cause is right rise above your barricade and you wont regret it a middleclass negro said to me recently ive gotit made i cant believe a man has such a small appetite how dangerous complacency
charles sumner yankee
president johnson could use charles sumner in the united states senate today he was beaten unconscious to the senate floor by a south carolina congressman in  for his fiery opposition to slavery he battled for the admission to the senate of a negro from mississippi in  and won by a vote of  to  he pestered president abraham lincoln into issuing the emancipation proclamation converting the war between the states into a moral crusade to end the indignities heaped upon negroes in america a warweary lincoln once said resignedly sumner you are always six weeks ahead of me he demanded an end to racial segregation in the public schools of the district of columbia as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee in the lincoln administrations he guided through congress a treaty with great britain abolishing the slave trade he achieved the recognition of haiti and liberia as independent nations he secured fair employment for negroes in federal servicefirst as mail carriers for the post office department he fought the th amendment protecting negro suffrage on the grounds that it was unnecessary congress had the power he contended to enact a protective law without a constitutional change anything for human rights is constitutional    there can be no state rights against human rights who was charles sumner you hear his name today only in the angry howls of southern segregationists who know an enemy when they hear of one you see his name only on the sumner tunnel under boston harbor but charles sumner was the united states senator from massachusetts from  to  succeeding daniel webster upon the latters appointment as secretary of state one hundred years ago at the risk of life and limb and his political future he was saying there can be but one liberty and one equality the same in boston and new orleans the same everywhere throughout the country to the negro people even then he was advising fight for full freedom now i trust that no excess of benevolence will make you consent to any postponement of those equal rights which are still refused    stand firm the politicians will then know that you are in earnest and will no longer be trifled with victory will follow soon and the good cause be secure forever the civil_rights forces in congress today could use a man like charles sumner
old jims yankee son
you know dont you that jim crow has a blood relative living in other parts of the country yes this mr james s crow is old jims own son but if you should ever men tion old jim to him he would blush and vehemently deny any kinship whatsoever to the notorious jim crow and all of his friends without exception would warmly support him in his denial they would all forcefully assert that there is absolutely no family relationship between the two but old jim will tell you differently old jim is a southerner and proud of it granting that he was actually born in the north as a few people claim he was no one has ever yet accused him of being a damn yankee unquestionably he was nurtured in dixie where he grew up to become for many decades her undisputed ruler with his bedsheet horsewhip noose and shotgun and he dotingly looks forward to living there forever some observers say however that he is fast growing old and crochety others even state bluntly that he is already senile and that he has just about lived out his historically allotted time his characteristic reply to all such scurrilous and outrageous observations is a raucous roar of defiance and a tantrum of violence he loudly swears that he is still as capable and vigorous as ever yet deep in himself old jim realizes that he is not as popular as he used to be that his power and influence are rapidly declining and that his days are numbered naturally this all hurts himand irritates him his formerly complacent hauteur has now become nervous and defiantand reckless although he has more detractors and critics now than ever before he still has lots of friends and supporters he is very widely known at least by reputation not surprisingly if you understand the popular psychology he has admirers and supporters all over the countrynot just in the south and many who will no longer support him openly will gladly support him clandestinely his most articulate followers especially those in the south agree wholeheartedly with old jim that he is still able to do his work as well as he ever did if only those outside agitators would stay away and quit stirring up trouble everything was lovely they claim until these troublemakers invaded the magnolia groves according to a popular legend mr james s crow early fell out with his father over the question of racial segregation but old jim stoutly avers that he and his son never had any fundamental differences regarding a philosophy of life their differences he maintains always were and still are essentially differences of form rather than of purpose plainly the son thinks his father is unsophisticated and crudea back number and old jim for his part always ends any discussion of his son with the contemptuous snort hypocrite if you ask mr james s crow what his middle initial stands for he will invariably smile furtively and reply that it is only an initial but old jim will tell you bluntly that his sons middle name is segregationist  mr james s crow who is not so provincial as his father maintains residence in the east north and west those who claim to know him intimately will tell you unqualifiedly that he even has an abiding ambition to establish a residence in the south some day when old jim becomes too decrepit to wield any significant influence and to take over the management of his fathers business and operate it along the same lines as his own in manners and appearance the crows are quite different brusque in manner old jim has never at least until recently given a tinkers damn about appearances in sharp contrast mr james s crow is  iave and deeply concerned about appearancesespecially about apraances thats why so many people think there is definitely  o kinshio between the two and mr james s crow is ever ready   accentuate these contrasting superficialitiesand to call attention to them so he often excoriates old jim publicly yet observers who have closely followed the careers of both of them say unhesitatingly that mr james s crow is unquestionably a chipalbeit a polished oneoff the old block scratch beneath the surface they advise and you will discover the old jim crow in him instead of using old jims brute force and his unconstitutional state  and local laws mr james s crow they claim seeks to substitute psychological conditioning and social manipulation to accomplish essentially the same endsde facto segregation and domination of course old jim invariably retaliates in kind and at length to his sons public abuse of him but in doing so he always unwittingly admits to his own execrable immorality by accusing his son of being equally as bad as he himself isand in many respects even worse old jim prides himself on his frankness says he never puts on airs he says if people dont like him as he is they can get the hell out of there and go back wherever they came fromor somewhere else people who are always carpin about him are just damned agitators and trouble makers anyway recently however many reports have been circulated falsely maliciously and slanderously according to old jim that his friends and supporters have successfully pressured him into sprucing up a bit when he knows that important yankee company is coming to dixie and now some scoffing jokesmith has garnished these reports with the story that old jim once tried using a little shaving lotion and hair oil on the slybut that he completely forgot the deodorant in marked contrast mr james s crow studiously observes the amenities of life and his grooming is impeccable these qualities together with his keen appreciation of the importance of good public relations give him the ability to make friends and influence people so like his aged father he also has numerous friends and supporters in all parts of the country many many more in fact than his father has in truth many of old jims former devotees who found it increasingly embarrassing to openly support him any longer in his mounting vituperation and violence have now turned to mr james s crow who has become the last best hope for the respectable people who seek to keep the substance of segregation but without its opprobrious name for mr james s crow moves always in an aura of accepted respectability he associates only with the best people and he has free access to the highest circles of finance commerce trade industry politics education communication and all other policymaking aspects of social life in this country through generally obliging news media he pays voluble lip service to the familiar and popular slogans of a democratic societyfreedom liberty equality fraternity mr james s crow is of course emphatically opposed to jim crows practices but he is warmly in favor of states rightswhich in practice means the rights of alabama and mississippi for example to disfranchise exploit degrade and terrorize certain citizens in order to maintain an old custom of segregation and domination he claims you cant legislate moralitybut strangely he never advocates repealing all the laws now in effect against such types of immorality as murder arson theft bribery slander prostitution and cruel treatment of children he says you cant change a venerable custom with lawsbut he is perfectly willing for the states to be permitted the right to use the law to bolster the cruel unconstitutional outmoded and crumbling customs of racial discrimination and segregation and he seems to have forgotten that the british successfully used laws to end the very highly valued old melanesian custom of headhunting mr james s crow says that property rights are basic to all other rights doesnt a person without any property still have some human rights by this he means specifically for example that a restaurant owner who had to get a permit before he could even construct a building on his own private land who had to construct the building in compliance with a city governments strict specifications who then had to be licensed by an agency of government to prepare and serve food to the public under certain specified regulations and who has to let a government agency inspect his property at willthis multiregulated property owner must now for the sake of the ultimate freedom and liberty of all of us be left unbridled and even be protected by the government in his inalienable right to freely use this otherwise highly regulated property to refuse service to any of the public that he was licensed to serveif he doesnt happen to like their complexion briefly mr james s crow and his supporters with their own immediate freedoms and liberties and profits and jobs and careers all apparently secure as long as the people are generally contented view this country as the best of all possible countriesand one that would soon be much better if the nigras would only be patient and quit rocking the boat in midstream our nigras you know have made wonderful progress during the last hundred years but would mr james s crow and his supporters be content with the negro peoples social status and their severely restricted civil_rights and liberties with their pay checks and their housing and their health educational and job opportunities oh of course not well it does make a difference doesnt it or does it a great deal it seems depends on whose ox is hobbled whose children are deprived  anyhow in a nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal jim crow and mr james s crow are both comically and tragically anachronistic
the words the facts and the future
few negroes and fewer whites believe that our founding fathers thought of the negro for one minute when they framed our constitution in fact a number of nationality groups and races were not considered the  freedomnow movement was not guilty of prejudice against the negro nor any other group and there was no oversight when the good men of the american revolution used the word men they meant men like themselves white anglosaxon protestants of course a few polish french and jews contributed to the revolutionary cause but their insignificant number at that time precluded any serious threat or any necessity of thinking of them as being unlike americans but back to the negro his survival during slavery and up to today depended on his ability to understand what the white man was saying and more importantly what he really meant by his words uncle toms shifty headscratching mumbling ways permitted him to survive without offending slave insurrections contumacious blacks and even docile ones were severely dealt with in order to avoid the appearance of offending the negro had to base his knowinga knowing on which his life depended upon something far more reliable than the word he heard spoken he learned to listen to the voice and how the word was spoken tonal patterns inflections and a host of nonverbal cues such as facial expressions movements of the hands arms legs and even ears in short he became sensitive to the whole man and not merely to the orderly procession of words from his masters mouth the slave also learned to delay response to feign confusion and misunderstanding his headscratching shuffling feet and squinting eyes placed the burden of continuing instruction or explanation upon the master and if the master talked long enough rephrasing restating and broadening the slave knew what he wanted with this knowledge he knew what role to play a safe answer was to tell his master what he already knew or what he wanted to hear the former a primitive nondirective therapeutic technique  by fading into his environment as an innocuous at times troublesome but profitable child he survived and the white man was happy with his flattering image of his nigger perhaps never aware of being duped but if the master was aware of his slaves mask he preferred in all probability the ruse to the blackfaced humanity behind the mask the negro felt secure and triumphant his artifice his cunning and yes his intelligence bought another breath another day until    today the mask also served the white master it heaped together with all the other convenient reasons was just one more proof of the negros difference inferiority subhumanness the mask also helped to allay the guilt that all good christians reportedly suffer when committing evil the nigger became a thing apart a thing unlike anything else   and god willed it too to preserve this moral armor the master would have endured a hundred more masks rather than face the man behind the mask or    himself to think this survival technique an unconscious one passed on from mother to child is to oversimplify the problem yet i can only suppose that this technique had its beginning on a nonconscious level i do know that it has worked its way into the conscious and still persists today among certain classes of negroes unfortunately this trait appears to have been learned for it does not seem to be present among the ninetofive ivyleagued negro what a pity it is not an inherited trait then both the black and white bigots could have a field day for the black bigots could claim this trait as a badge of superiority and the white ones as indisputable proof of inferiority but in the slums this awareness this defense is ingrained long before grimm if grimm ever makes it even today among some negroes the phrase read between the lines has great meaning or the injunction to the young when white folks talk you just listen and listen well then you know what to say most of the time you just dont know and i mean you dont know even when you do naturally as some negroes prove themselves by meeting certain middleclass standards such as becoming educated speaking properly presenting the proper emotional expression or lack of one attending the right church and viewing art as something separate and distinct from life they have become more sensitive to the literal meaning of words today the negros social perception is dull or he is ignoring the implicit statements of whites the young middleclass negro is demanding that all words regarding his life liberty and pursuit of happiness be explicitly stated he has renounced the understanding bought by the masterslave conspiracy for today the young negro is not motivated by sheer survival this he takes for granted since todays negro refuses to cooperate and wear the mask the white man is alone with his guilt his conscience and himself and he too often damns the negro all the more for causing him the inconvenience of changing his mind and facing himself this returns us to the constitution with all its promises the bill of rights making the world safe for democracy and on and on the young middleclass negro collegeeducated and all is just as surely shaped in the middleclass mold as though he were white and really believed that he could become president albeit in forty years unfortunately he doesnt believe that he can become president nor that all the slogans and sacred documents include him in their promises not even tomorrow he knows that in the north and south he is excluded in the north he is permitted to read these freedom words but told not now in the south until recently his best bet was to feign illiteracy the southerner knows what many white northerners are beginning to fear that to give an inch is to give all having been afforded a good christian education which teaches that every word has an exact meaning the young enlightened negro pushes for the literal rights which are synonymous with america many may explain this push for constitutional rights and the negros recognition of his dignity as a man by the rise of african nations educational achievement world war ii and other pulsations within the last ten to twenty years all of these conditions no doubt ripened the moment for the freedomnow movement but the negro also believes something else something far more advantageous and equally encouraging no american white would dare exclude him literally from his birthright it is this belief which has fired the rise momentum and contagion of the present drive for equality although ideally a christian country and prizing that image both the white man and negro know that christianity takes a back seat to the customs and meanness of the times but the negro believes that just as with democratic ideals the white man must have his word and his image even though they bear little resemblance to reality americas democratic armor now on display and for sale throughout the world is rarely supported by the lofty idealism usually it is supported out of fearthe fear that no group is safe in america if the literal meaning of the sacred words is changed for in spite of the myth about america being a melting pot america as everyone knows is a molding pot no man is safe who is too different and there are too many different groups who are momentarily resting from attack because now it is the negros hour now i know there are champions of the everythingisallrightwithamerica school im aware of  the refrigerators collapsing houses and even aspirin consumption in this country im more aware of and indelibly impressed by what it is to be black in america for most negroes have heard the white mans comments i like negroes but jews  i just cant stand them or the poor white trash are the lowest meanest things on the earth you just dont know them they just dont want to be any better ive cringed at the venom hate and utter subhumanness that have been dumped on the poor white trash perhaps whites cant accept the idea that even a white man can be poor and unlike the vaunted mold i dont know strangely ive found myself defending them knowing too well that their love for me is shorter than the hair on the bottom of my feet but it is this hate this need to hate that troubles me and more it sickens me making it impossible for me not to believe that hate and fear are the cement which binds americans too often i have heard whites malign the catholics italians polish and other nonanglosaxon protestants who cant quite disappear into the great molding pot and what is more revolting is to see the downtrodden of europe the starving the oppressed the persecutedbecome the oppressor and the persecutor and far too many of them do one generation from the hells of europe they now in best animalrioting form hurl their outrageous abuse at the negro moving on their street or sending his children to their neighborhood school the maddening yelps in these northern cities are biledup by these lovers of freedom these escapees from tyranny these goodbravehungarian freedomfighters    and all the others who can now afford the luxury of tyranny and yet they are partially blameless for to become a good american and become acceptable in the middleclass mold you must hate niggers and these good people would become good americans even if it required duplicating belsen today with full knowledge that the american mood is not quite willing to accede to him his full rights the young american negro is pushing not the conscience but the literal meaning of the word captured in the declaration of independence other sacred documents and promises which symbolize america and propaganda beamed to the enslaved of the world to the crossroads either america admits him as a full citizen on a fulltime basis or else sweeps away the shortlived dream and marches him to the gas chamber if anyone has a right to be bitter and demand all now its the middleclass negro living on the fringe ofor in the suburbs consider his sacrifices he gave up the oldtime religion and jazz unless its progressive and can be intellectualized he has chained his feet and soldered his joints no part of him will ever again sway to the blues or the rhythms of the field hand he has become an observer of art and a patron of the arts watermelon is taboo especially if eaten in public he will forever deny himself greens corn bread chittlins now a delicacy sold in gourmet shops and a host of other downhome pleasures hes going to become a packageeating casseroleslopping tv dinner if it kills him which it wont but the negro isnt unique in his adaptation theres something in america which levels and destroys differences the second generation of the foreignborn quickly became ashamed of their parents accent they wanted to become americans everyone moves toward the great mystical goddess equalitarianism and what is her boon now that the negro has his turn maybe hell find out in the suburban neighborhoods in which the negro has gained a foothold he has moved with astonishing alacrity to become the best middleclass neighbor youve ever seen hes become a slave to lawns barbecue pits houses children and dogs a couple of years ago a white friend of mine had considered moving from his suburban commune while wavering and arguing with himself and everyone else negroes began moving into his suburb he thought a new life was coming to the community the infusion of vitality so he stayed a new life did come just like the whitebut black the negroes outdid the whites their love of lawns house and respectability was aweinspiring whites should welcome them into any community they soon become the standard after making such a sacrifice it is no wonder that the middleclass negro is bitter hes divested himself of everything familiar on the promise of finally making it his peculiar desperation will not permit him to go back to the poisonous past he has no choice but to demand his rights and to demand vehemently and what about the slums this summer i walked the streets of the northern ghetto the moods there are blacker than the faces you pass on the street the middleclass negro leaders especially those of status and years would like to slow down and arbitrate but if they do theyll have no sympathy from the ghetto for no one can count the ghetto among his following here in the beginning was the deed and not the word the instincts and perceptions of uncle tom are too strong white and black faces have used and misused the ghetto given promises and broken promises thought of them first before election and not at all after they know theyre alone the tired people of the ghetto have long since lost faith in the word especially all words which allude to justice here in the black slums police brutality is common and always officially justifiable ghetto eyes see prostitutes plying  their trade on the streets and paying off in order to do so they see policy men and pimps making money by the fistful around the clock and coupled with all this they know the subtle prejudice of the north they know the norths solution to the negro problem containment welfare and sociological studies no the negro in the slum doesnt trust his black leadership they talk too much like the white leadership besides theres never been an intense drive to enlist his support he feels that hed be out of place with his black betters and he would the middleclass negro is reaching for the middleclass mold he cant hate all niggers but the least he can do to show good faith is to hate poor niggers the man from harlem or hough knows that all that is black is not good hes not sure that all that is white isnt evil but he has only his personal experiences to draw from so the slum negro listens to the naacp core and all the others but he says to them when do the jobs come what does this mean for me man eatin in a air terminal dont mean no big thing for me  i cant even make it walkin    so the young emancipated educated negro is confronted with the same problem hes black but it doesnt give him the edge he cant at this time communicate with the ghetto nor command a popular following he can attract only his kind he doesnt understand these blacks hes lost touch the young educated black may have sympathy from the slums he may have support if the end should comethe gas chambers for the negro in the ghetto looks for that day he neither sees nor believes in the conversion of white folks he doesnt hear the word when they promise the great change he doesnt believe that the new negro leaders can do any more to help him than the old ones in fact his plight and he knows it too well is tied up with the entire economic web of the country a negro speaks white folks without jobs you know aint none for me a black nationalist leader not muslim has been confronted with this problem time and time again the sheer logic and blatant reality of the unemployed black and white folks in this country are pushing this leader toward socialism not communism but to the ghetto these are more words and as the black nationalist said man my problem is translation if i come up with an economic setup how do i translate it and before that how do i get them to believe it you know translating an idea into a belief to those who complain that the negro needs to achieve more education and become more like the great mold his very injunction his patronizing advice will come home to shatter his suburban dream for it isand will continue to bethe young educated negro growing to manhood on the juice of hatred not oranges who in his frustration will burn the house that words built for he will meet the standards they arent that high he will meet everyone but the one implicit in all instructions he cant become white he will have listened and obeyed the literal word and with increasing rancor he will demand the reality of the literal promises white americans have no choice they must acknowledge his claim and grant him his literal birthright or if they dare they may destroy the sacred words that give rise to this black hope and by so doing make america safe for no one and each at that time will know his place  and his end supposing the middleclass prepared acceptable negro is admitted to the molding club what then the negro in the slum will become as white trash something apart and hateful to all only god will be on his side and god speaks softly and carries a twig
let us have a new american theatre
from maine to mississippi witchcraft is unanimously condemned sometimes dealt with humorously as in john van drutens play bell book and candle sometimes seriously as in arthur millers the crucible not for several centuries has it been controversial men may smile or shake their heads ruefully in contemplation of mans inhumanity or pity not just the victims for their suffer ing but the persecutors for their stupidity how easy to judge the past how difficult to understand the present every era has its myths the middle ages accepted the myth of witchcraft the modern world has accepted the myth of race men of the sixteenth century did not simply believe in witchcraft they knew it the witches were there to see the nazis did not simply believe in aryan supremacy they knew it the jews were there to see millions of americans consider race not as belief but as fact the negroes are here to see in the wizard of oz the wizard gives green glasses to everyone in emerald city so that they may believe life to be prettier than  it is american culture gives to many of us black and white glasses which obscure our vision of our fellow men after these general observations let us consider one result of this cultural mythology the position of negro actors in the american theater now it would seem that aesthetic people tend to be less racially biased than those whose values lie mainly in economics or politics yet such is the strength of culture that without intent or even awareness playwrights producers directors and fellow actors restrict negroes to comparatively few roles this situation prevails in all levels of our theaterprofessional university community and to a lesser extent secondary school a hypothetical example may illustrate the dilemma a high school dramatics coach plans to stage the old mysterythriller the cat and the canary white and negro students read for parts he casts a negro girl as the west indian voodoo woman a negro boy in the minor role of the doctor another negro boy in the bit part of the attendant from the lunatic asylum perhaps too he casts a negro as the lawyer in the first act liberal eh what who could possibly complain but someone does one of the negroes is obviously the most talented student in the cast why wasnt she cast as annabelle the leading role or if a boy in a major role as one of annabelles  three cousins the thought never occurred to the director why because whites dont have negro cousins it wouldnt be realistic and after all the stage is supposed to reflect life that is a key phrase a fundamental assumption worthy of examination the theater is supposed to reflect life stunned by the protest the teacher asks the advice of his state department of education the department has a policy school dramatic productions are to ignore race if this means doing goodbye mr chips with a japanese chips and a mexican mrs chips all right professional theatrical practices are not to apply within school the teacher must adjust his casting though professional university and community theaters rely on the reflection of life assumption the practice has limitations it applies to appearance but not to name a theater patron scans his program at ocaseys the shadow of a gunman to find abe cooperstein cast as mr mulligan the landlord and tony romboli as mr maguire soldier of the ira conditioned by custom the patron enjoys their performances without weakening of the illusion that he is watching a play about irishmen i want to suggest that we reexamine our cultural conditioning that we consider color as we do nationality and as members of an audience ignore it the policy established in many schools should extend to all theater this involves not only social and humanitarian objectives but a relationship of greater integrity between audience and actor we would come to accept the negro or oriental in the role of mr mulligan or mr maguire as we now accept the jew or italian a man would be a man and we would look on him as such of course certain plays where the racial myth is a theme should be excepted porgy and bess the blacks a raisin in the sun deal with men as negroes and whites rather than as men some will reject the comparison of nationality and color on the grounds of a visual image the image however is mental not visual stemming from a misconception of acting and the actors purpose this confusion of the actor with the character portrayed has produced the emphasis on broadway as well as in hollywood on type casting a system fatal to the development of an actors capabilities who is the actor finally he is the character portrayed no longer himself we often hear that the actor must enter into the character not so the actor must bring the character into himself the fusion is an act of love and understanding the theater demands illusion it is pretense it is pretending along with art and music drama is one of the means man has devised to experience life the stage is a window into the human mind that of the playwright some now living have been privileged to see paul robeson play othello if othello why not hamlet why not caesar why not christ when we view the film version of julius caesar it is not james mason whom we should see as brutus but brutus as played by lames mason mason must believe he is brutus and we must share his belief william james said that habit explains most of our behavior in shakespeares day people watched men play womens parts there was a visual image as real as color today that would be unacceptable the time is here to discard habits based on outworn attitudes about mankind the integrated society emerging in america will be premised on a view of human nature which transcends the externals that separate us
the ancient book
maggie knew as did the rats that all the apartments of the condemned building were empty except hers and that of the old man and lady who lived on the second floor under her she had hid mandels gun when she first sensed that her face her body and her child were no longer novel to him and therefore no longer appealing it was as though the rats had waited for mandel to leave a lone woman and a baby in a crib would not frighten them the big woman sat beside the crib holding mandels  automatic in one hand the other hand lay upon the heavy covers that covered the sleeping childs dark doubled body mandel would have known what to do she thought and she grew aware that that was why she had flirted with him took him fed and loved him the hollow crash of a door slammed shut by the december night wind multiplied itself as it bounced through the empty rooms and down the unlit hallways immediately afterward the scrape of claws upon the floor in the kitchen joined with the other noises in the a tall somber wabash avenue tenement four kerosene lamps one in each corner of the room set in motion peculiar moving shadows responding to the varying currents of the wind    maggie pointed the gun at a shadow that moved quickly in and out of a circle of light across the room from one corner to the corner near her but it was gone before she could be sure of what it was another scrape of claws near the crib and maggie squeezed the babys stomach making him stir and whimper outside the snow had begun to fall and broken white lines sped past the window and lit by the street lamp on the corner below appeared to contain tiny little lights within themselves it was these flakes that reminded her that tomorrow would be december a holiday a gust of wind turned the kerosene light into her face lighting the white shawl around her head though barely lighting the deep brown of her wide flat nose or the fullness of her tightly pressed lips her small eyes slitted and seemed to be the only bright thing about her face as she glanced from one wall to the other hand rigidly about the heavy cold steel moving the  with the sweep of her eyes it wouldnt have been so bad her voice comforted her if he hadnt awaited til christmas eve the silence following her voice brought about in a kind of delayed perception a realization that she without knowing it had been listening to the steady scrape of claws upon the floor not just one set but many the noise had stopped at the sound of her voice and it was the resultant silence that  made her conscious of the fact that there had been such a sound mandel had shot a rat which had been perched right over the head of the babys bed he had promised to take maggie and fred jr away from merrydale arms right after the first of the year they had gone to bed talking about how things would be different from now on and she had loved him as though she really loved him she had not felt gratitude that night only love but on a christmas evetell somebody he cant take anymore    she shoutedor rather the emptiness of the room made it seem as though she had shouted how bout me take it anymore i cant take it anymore then she paused and said very softly but i do perhaps it was the sound of defeat in her voice which gave the starving animals crouched along the edge of the wall the impulse to attack perhaps they had planned the attack to occur at this moment perhaps another hunger pain had hit the boldest of them and his forward charge had set the example for the others but for whatever motive or impulse it was that impelled them the rats ran from the corners and the edge of the wall toward maggie toward the crib the first one maggie saw came from directly in front of her where she had been staring so intently that her vision was no longer able to sort out real from imagined movement but now running in the full glow of the lamp light big black the rat left no doubt as to its existence or its intentions maggie leaped to her feet knocking backwards the chair in which she had been sitting the crash of the chair momentarily stopped the attack maggie fired the gun at the spot where she had last seen the rat naturally it was gone the sound of the shot drifted off into the rooms and soon merged with the sound of an l train that rushed its return load of christmas shoppers to their homes farther south maggie reached for the baby and snatched him covers and all out of the crib just as a rat appeared at the spot where mandel had shot the last one something tugged at the cover that dragged the floor and maggie pulled the hand holding the gun from under the babys warm body and shot in the dark at the dragging end of the sheet she ran to the door kicking her feet as she ran her foot collided with something soft and bulky a squeal and a thud she began hearing what seemed to be hundreds of squeals and squeaks she seemed to see hundreds of scurrying shadows at her feet from the corner of her eye she saw the crib spotted with quick moving fat figures she ran down the hallway feeling her way whenever the lights from the street did not penetrate the darkness now down the stairs past the old man and ladys apartment again she thought she felt something tugging at the covers that dragged along the floor again she shot at the dragging end the baby whined and twisted nearly causing her to drop him another flight of steps seemed to follow every flight she passed and the open apartment doors showed the windows beyond and snow piled upon the floor beneath the windows where the panes had been broken when maggie reached the bottom landing the light through the vestibule illuminated a high drift of snow in the hallway maggie running wildly squeezing the baby hard against her chest holding the gun with its muzzle pointed upwards straining for breath maggie martin fell over the dragging end of the babys covers and started a running fall down the hallway steps through the open hallway door she clutched the baby even tighter she dropped the gun she grabbed for the open door of a mailbox near the hallway door and it came off in her hands her legs seemed to have gone crazy and she had no time for thought or feeling nothing existed except the blur of a distant building a piece of sidewalk and her baby in her arms which was now not even a baby but a part of her self inseparable from the whole of herself she felt her arm wrap around a tree and she felt the bark cold and rough against her face it seemed to be the friendliest touch she had ever known she clung to the tree with one arm she lifted her face upwards into the snow she drew short deep breaths that turned into ice in her throat she looked at her baby and suddenly became afraid for it she snatched the covers away from it leaning heavily against the tree the light from the street lamps showed the brown chubby body distinctly the snow fell upon its face and bare arms and legs the baby squirmed and opened its eyes and closed them again as the snow fell into them then it cried loudly and maggie smiled faintly turning him over at the same time feeling his flesh for a break searching for a rat bite she found none the baby squirmed and shivered and cried out again and maggie seemingly just becoming aware of the snow and the cold looked about her as if to make sure that the snow was really falling she then threw the covers around the baby quickly and tucked them in at the ends and pulled her shawl over her head and started walking south towards thirtyfirst street every building from twentyseventh street where she lived to thirtyfirst street had been torn down now only a catholic school stood undestroyed on wabash another l train sped by and  the blue sparks shot upwards from the track and vanished in the shower of thick watery snow it was not until she reached thirtieth and wabash that she realized she wore only a thin sweater and a skirt neither brassiere nor slip nor stockings the baby wriggled a little but she knew that at least it was warm a bus hurried eastward on thirtyfirst street inside the packages lay against the windows beside their owners somehow or other her eye caught a welldressed lady standing up as though preparing to get off at the next stop the lady held a baby in her arms and the baby was wrapped in a hooded comforter with a zipper in the front both the lady and the baby looked to be very warm the wind blew westward from lake michigan and the snow blew with it maggie bent forward pushing her head into the babys covers the sweater seemed like no sweater at all and her legs felt as though they were being sprayed with ice water a chill seeped into her body she trembled she could not stop her teeth from chattering the colder she got the tighter she hugged her child thinking that it too felt the freezing cold as she did but the child had closed its eyes and was breathing evenly as though certain that the jerking ride would soon end and that it had but to wait patiently until it could again lie in its warm bed and sleep undisturbed a blinking neon sign vague in the haze of the snow assured maggie that she had not much further to go she did not consider what was going on in the building beneath the sign she knew only that there was life there and that there were people there who would let her get warm and maybe let her stop until she could figure out what to dowhere to go a man stood in the doorway of the building trying to decide if the party at the tavern a block away was worth walking to in the harddriving wind and the wet snow to get to he decided that it was not and turned to go back into the crowded tavern when he saw a wide jumble of shadow tottering in the grey thickness near thirtyfirst and michigan he stared for a minute he saw no heavy flapping overcoat nor did he see a wind twisted hat or a fur collar what he did see made him squint in the slapping bitter snow to see more and as maggie approached him skirt blown hard against her fat thighs and full stomach sweater white in the white of the snow the man yelled inside the tavern lord in heaven theres a woman out here with no clothes on only one or two people heard his voice over the laughter and loud music but they a man in a fur collared storm coat and his companion a young girl prettily dressed in a leather coat ran to the door they caught sight of maggie just as she stopped at the tavern window and leaned heavily against it rubbing her wet face against the bundle in her arms the man who first saw her ran to her speaking with a drunk mans thick tongue girl what you doin out here in all this cold dont you know you goin to freeze to death the young girl in the leather coat reached for the baby is this a baby here let me take it maggie shook her head and held on to the child she pushed past the people around her into the brightly decorated crowded noisy bar the first man ran in front of her pushing the customers out of the way make room he shouted lets have some room for the lady and her baby this womans froze to death then he turned to maggie and almost touched her cheeks with his lips when he asked aint you baby maggie tried to smile at the man but her teeth would not stop chattering two people near her got up and walked out the bartender was at the other side of the bar pouring drinks for a party of four who had spent  for a setup hey jim dandy bellowed the winereddened drunk come up this way jim dandy theres a lady who needs help the bartender looked down the bar and upon seeing maggie frowned and continued to pour the drinks for his party the juke box stopped playing and now no one put any more money in it one or two people walked from their booths in the back to take a look at maggie and the baby a man at the bar watched her through the wreathframed mirror behind the bar one dark brown lady wearing a high peaked black hat with a veil that flattened her nose giggled and turned up a shot glass and blurted black as she is its a wonder the snow fell on her her companion a lightskinned man in a narrowbrim blue hat protested mildly the blacker the berry the sweeter the   the mans response became lost in the ensuing buzz the atmosphere changed from that of revelry to contemplativeness the bartender seeing that this woman was affecting the holiday spending by his customers stalked swiftly to the end of the bar where maggie stood wiping her babys face alright alright he shouted authoritatively whats going on here before maggie could answer him the bartender squinting through steamy glasses at mother and child said im sorry lady but no children are allowed in here then as if to make amends he took a bottle from the shelf behind him here ill give you a drink to warm up with the drunk protested what do  you mean drink she needs help shes froze the bartender glared at him and then turned to maggie i said im sorry miss now the customers gathered around maggie and the bartender they turned their attention first to one then the other maggie felt as though she were surrounded by the rats again she wanted to run to the street into the snow into the iced nothingness that had lain before her before she saw the taverns neon light but she was too weak and frightened to run anyplace else tonight and she knew that whether the bartender knew it or not she would not leave this place of her own free will she would sit at the bar if she had toor in a booth or even in the ladies rest room but she would not leave she felt therefore that there was no need to say anything by way of explanation and anyway she thought while meeting the bartenders stare with a dull blank expression she could not have explained if she had wanted to she had not yet determined for herself what had happened to her bring me a drink jim dandy wheedled a woman who had gotten up to see maggie and who having seen her had gone back to her seat unmoved and thirsty the drunk grabbed jim dandys arm as the bartender turned to get the womans drink oh no you dont not yet aint you got someplace where she can spend the night aint you gon do something for this po woman and her child the bartender slapped the drunks hand away then he pointed his finger at maggie how come you pick me to mooch on i know you girls beg a quarter here and a quarter there    preying on peoples sympathy to get money to buy wine he leaned over the bar and pointed the tip of his finger at maggies flat nose now if you dont git out of here quick im going to call the police on you somebody said that aint right to treat her like that somebody else said something ought to be done maggie looked around she caught sight of a door beside the ladies wash room she walked toward the door people made room for her she squeezed past the table and chairs in the middle of the floor if people were talking before she reached them they stopped when she came near resuming their conversations when she passed she passed an old man at a booth near the ladies toilet his hat was tilted far down across his face and he kept his head bent low she could feel the cold exuding from him as she passed and she thought that perhaps he had sneaked in just as she had and was trying to remain inconspicuous long enough to get warm and to figureperhaps as she had to dowhat to do next no one tried to stop her as she opened the door to the room and found it to be a tiny boiler room with a dim light bulb near the furnace a wooden pop bottle case stood against a wall near the low glowing burner she shut the door behind her and sat on the case and began to unwrap the baby the baby was cold she rubbed its body gently she watched her hand as she rubbed him and she watched his eyes as they stared up into hers his face was solemn and his eyes were bright he seemed neither afraid nor uncomfortable no one came into the boiler room she heard a scraping sound and immediately felt the bundle for the gun she did not remember that she had dropped it she stared at the spot where something big and low moved it was a cat she smiled at it the fire warmed her and the glow through the grating looked pretty upon her babys tiny figure already the baby was asleep she lay her head against fred jr and closed her eyes outside the juke box started up again and the talking grew loud again and soon someone laughed loud and the clinking of bottles increased she did not hear the door open but when she looked up she saw the old man she had passed standing in the doorway miss please dont be scared maggie started to stand the man took his hat off she sat down miss i know you aint gon believe me but i know you maggie pulled her shawl away from her head her short hair pressed flat about the curve of her skull the light from the furnace darkened the shadows of her nostrils and the ridge above her lips the fullness of her face blended with the fullness of her body and a little spot of orange light touched her here and there as in a painting the man stepped toward her maggie did not move he shut the door behind him and looked around as though afraid that someone might see what he drew from his heavy rag of a coat this book is from before the bible the man smelled of burnt wood as though he had spent the evening before an open fire i am the direct kin of an african chief the old mans face was white with whiskers about the chin and eyes his flesh was dull and wrinkled and it did not shine when the firelight touched it his voice was rough even though he whispered and it seemed deeper than any voice maggie had ever heard he stopped beside maggie you not from this townare you maggie softly no the old man laid his hat on the floor  you dont know where you fromdo you maggie looked away from the man at her baby you aint got no husbandis you well i did kind of    no the man stood the book at his hands hung at his side girl you a princess your kin was the most high ruler of the original ghana your great great great great grandfather was the living god to his people and all who saw him praised his name in this book    the old man looked around him again then turned to maggie  is the history of your people girl know who you are read this book it will make you free it will change your life girl maggie stared at the man she stared at the book it was bound in plain brown paper the surface of the book looked as though it had been put together with flour paste it was wrinkled and smudgy the man turned the inside of the book to maggie she saw pictures of dark people standing tall and straight some held spears in their hands the man turned the page of the book and there was a fullsized picture of a man sitting upon a stool holding a scepter above several kneeling dark people maggie reached for the book the man drew it away ill give it to you for two dollars maggie said i got a dollar to my name the man looked around again and whispered give me the dollar  you wont regret it your life will change  i know what im talking about maggie looked at the baby he was asleep she wondered where she would go tomorrow one thing was certain she would not go back to merrydale arms she wondered what she would eat what the baby would eat she reached underneath her sweater and unpinned the dollar that lay against her breast she handed the dollar to the old man well there aint much i can do with a dollar anyway you wont regret it    miss you wont regret it he handed her the book and turned quickly and rushed out of the room maggie opened the book there were kings in it there were warriors there were great structures she recognized as the pyramids of egypt in small letters at the bottom of the flyleaf of the book was printed in small letters copyright©  published by the south state book store  south state street chicago illinois maggie smiled she hoped the old man would buy a meal with her dollar at first she read silently moving her lips as she did she hardly noticed when she began reading aloud although she glanced often at fred jr as she read from a land far away three travels came seeking the ashanti child who would rule great africa as his father did desire for many days and nights they did travel and it was over an humble place that they saw a bright star shining and they came to that place there they found the black prince    maggie read the words until she could no longer keep her eyes open then she fell asleep she did not see the door open again as she slept leaning against the wall near the furnace she could not feel the hand of the young girl who slipped the hatcollected cluster of bills down her bosom neither did she see the drunk stare at her with the oddest kind of resolution upon his face somewhere outside the boiler room a clock struck twelve and the customers stoodtheir backs to the barstaring through the open door at the fat dark woman and her child touched lightly by the orange glow from the fire
were adam and eve black
were adam and eve black they must have been according to the laws of heredity held today gregor mendel an augustinian monk discovered the mendelian laws of heredity by crossbreeding colored and white flowers he discovered that red flowers might produce white or red flowers red and white flowers would produce red and white flowers but white flowers could only produce white flowers the absence of a quality he called a recessive characteristic the presence of a quality he called the dominant characteristic thus whiteness would be the recessive characteristic since it could not produce that which it did not have viz color so blueeyed parents may only have blueeyed children for blue eyes is a recessive characteristic it only shows that there is less black pigment on a white background and black whiskers on a white background give an impression of blueness since parents lacking pigment cannot have children with more pigment it appears that our first parents were black

no matter how easy n v or difficult it may be  to find a job the real problems for the per son holding only a high school diploma begin when he starts working he must appreciate what his prospects are not immediately but in the next decade and how he can make them come out best for himself is it so hard to think of the next ten years you will be in your late twenties you will probably have voted in a presidential election you may have done a tour of duty in the armed forces there is a good possibility you will have married and have started a family ten years are really not so many are you ready the high school diploma that enabled you to get the job is a license a license to acquire knowledge the future belongs to those who know their work well and can learn with changing times and needs within the next six or seven years the labor market will require more than two and a half million more skilled workers than were required two or three years ago in addition replacements will need to be found for another   million persons who will transfer to other occupations retire or die the national economy will therefore be looking for  million able young people to apply their intelligence and skills to produce machines build homes and highways and keep america moving the opportunities are as boundless and far reaching as the solar system rapidly growing new technologies will create opportunities unknown today like group photographs statistics can be awfully boring unless you are in them certain occupations within the skilled worker group have grown faster in recent years than have others and will continue to grow faster there are career guides pinpointing these check your schools guidance counselor for information he may have as a general thing however you should know that the job outlook for skilled workers is currently bright growth in the number of skilled workers in the  to  year bracket has been declining lately this means that increasing numbers of skilled workers must be furnished by younger age groups and opportunities for the high school graduate under  are exceedingly good provided that he plans well and gets himself good training in his skill the importance of the skilled worker has been overlooked to some extent in recent years because of the attention focused on professionals such as engineers and scientists but a basic fact of life in the workaday world is more true today than ever before the work of engineers scientists executives and many other professionals would be barren without skilled workers to give their ideas and plans form and substance these are among the more important reasons why this is the era of the specialist and organization man a skilled worker technician or artisan prepares for the future at trade schools in special technical courses or in an apprenticeship building a sound foundation for his career in these ways may take some time really getting established in a skill may take longer yet and as in all kinds of work there are sometimes tough choices to make for example the matter of a union may be crucial to your choice of a skill some unions encourage the development of young workers others do not but while it may be harder to get into x union than into y union x union may have been able to keep wages higher in its industry than y union has done in its field this and other factors are things that the young skilled worker has to take into account it would be wise for him to do a good bit of checking into the job career and advancement opportunities in the several fields that may interest him before committing himself too firmly to a specific skill field one of the best skillslearning places going today is the armed forces so specialized are the skills required in the modem military force that the soldier sailor or airman is often more technician than warrior in the armed forces you can learn how to handle everything from a bulldozer to a battlewagon you still have to go through basic training but once thats past you have a chance at a great variety of technical training schools skills learned in the armed forces often pay handsomely when youre back in civilian clothes radar specialists mechanics electronics experts construction men computer programmers and operators often join firms that have government contracts many opportunities exist also in the civilian side of government pay is generally good theres job security and government work is nowadays so vast and varied that opportunity for advancement is almost invariably available in determining a career examine the future of law enforcement men and women fingerprint and ballistics experts are crucial members of todays mechanized and specialized army of law enforcers so too is the modern policeman the modern fireman any office manager in the united states can tell girls fervently of the need for competent trained knowledgeable secretaries and other office assistants special plea here please get on speaking terms with the english language if secretarial work is what you want high school graduates are in  particular demand by utilities and communications companies new systems being installed have increased the employment needs of telephone companies new billing methods and accounting procedures have put a premium on competent young help in virtually every publicserving corporation moreover these companies are among the leading offerers of onthejob training the field of merchandising remains in many ways the most promising of all the field is more demanding now in skills training and knowledge of the public than it once was but the high school graduate who is smart aggressive and imaginative can cover a lot of ground and rise very high although the beginning in this highly competitive field may sometimes look not very promising the population of the united states is increasing by  million persons a year new supermarkets and suburban branches of department stores will continue to be built and theyll all need good managers good sales and service representatives good display technicians good buyers around the supermarkets and store branches will be more houses to build sell and service and more people whose living and recreational needs will require competent service representatives a final note on a skill field increasingly overlooked these days farming as everyone knows there are fewer farmers every year as the american migration to the city continues but  americans have to eat and farmers raise much of what comes to their tables the modern farmer runs a highly technical operation in which a lot of money is tied up he has to be a skilled manager mechanic gardener animal husbandman all in one he can be very successful and as one of the few really independent artisans left he can know satisfactions oftentimes denied to his coginthewheel fellow artisans of city and suburb where can you find specific information about opportunities and openings in skills fields one excellent resource is your local office of the united states employment service industry personnel offices can help you community county and state offices often have employment counseling and service aids private service organizations such as ymca can often help and so can unions state universities and colleges and church groups dont be shy about checking out possible information sources you are going to be someone of firstclass importance to the future of the united statesa builder mover and maintainer you owe it to yourself and the thousands you will serve to be in work you like and to be good at that work have you ever attended the dedication of a bridge the launching of a ship the opening of a new building on such occasions the designers engineers and architects publicly thank the skilled workers without whose knowledge training and ability nothing more than drawing board designs could have been achieved you are setting sights on the day when you too will be so honored 
the american racial puzzle can be solved
it has occurred to me only recently that perhaps the most striking development in the south is not that the process of desegregation is under way but that the mystique with which americans have always surrounded the south is beginning to vanish driving into atlanta in a heavy rain one hot august night six and a half years ago my wife and two small children waking up to watch the shimmering wet lights on ponce de leon avenue i was as immersed in this mystique as anyone else for the last full day of driving the talk and the look of people were different the trees and fields seemed different the air itself smelled different this was the mysterious and terrible south the deep south soaked in blood and history of which faulkner wrote and margaret mitchell and wilbur j cash white atlanta had been ravaged and still knew it negroes had been slaves and still remembered it northerners were strangers no matter how long they stayed and would never forget it there was something about atlanta about georgia the carolinas that marked them off as with a giant cleaver from the rest of the nation the sun was hotter the soil was redder the people blacker and whiter the air sweeter heavier but beyond the physical beyond the strange look and smell of this country was something more that went back to cotton and slavery stretching into history as far as anyone could rememberan invisible mist over the entire deep south distorting justice blurring perspective and most of all indissoluble by reason it is six and a half years later i have lived these years inside what is often thought to be the womb of the souths mystery the negro community of the deep south my time has been spent mostly with the warm and lovely girls in my classes at spelman but also with the earnest young men across the street at morehouse with the strangely mixed faculties of the negro colleges the white and the dark the silent and the angry the conservative and the radical with the black bourgeoisie of college presidents and business executives with the poor negro families in frame houses across the street and their children playing with ours on the campus grass from this i have been able to wander out into the glare of the white south or cross into those tiny circles of shadow out of sight where people of several colors meet and touch as human beings inside the tranquil eye of the hurricane the southern mystique hovered nearby even on yellow spring afternoons when we talked quietly to one another in the classroom at times it grew suddenly dense fierce asphyxiating my students and i were ordered out of the gallery of the georgia general assembly the speaker of the house shouting hoarsely at us one nightmarish winter evening i was arrested and put behind bars hundreds of us marched one day toward the state capitol where helmeted soldiers with rifles and gas masks waited a dozen of us sat in at a department store cafeteria silent as the manager dimmed the lights closed the counter and ordered chairs piled on top of tables all around i drove four hours south to the black belt country of albany georgia to call through a barbed wire fence surrounding the county jail to a student of mine who was invisible beyond a wire mesh window it was in albany also that i sat in the office of the sheriff of dougherty county who a month before had given a bloody beating with a cane to a young negro lawyer and nowhere was the mystique so real so enveloping as on a dirt road in the dusk deep in the cotton and peanut land of lee county georgia where justice and reason had never been and where the night before bullets had ripped into a farmhouse belonging to negro farmer james mays and exploded around the heads of sleeping children and yet i can say now after living intensely in the deep south in exactly those six years when the south itself has lived most intensely that the mystique is dissolving for me and for others the south is still the most terrible place in america because it is it is filled with heroes the south is monstrous and marvelous at the same time every cliche ever uttered about the south every stereotype attached to its people white and negro is true a thousand other characteristics complex and subtle are also true the south has not lost its fascination but it is no longer mysterious and i want to explain this by talking about those two groups who have been at the center of this mystery the whites and the negroes of the deep south although the darkness of the negro physically suggests mystery it is the white southerner oddly enough who has been presented as the great national enigma this despite the whiteness of his skin against which flaws and blemishes show up more easily a whiteness unsullied by that admixture of slavic and latin blood found in the north and kept homogeneous by the simple expedient of tossing over the wall in the night all offspring from blackwhite sexual encounter the mystery of the white southerner comes from a trait that he is presumed to possess in quantity and quality sharply distinct from everyone else and deepinthebone compared to the obvious difference of the negro that trait is race prejudice other white people it is acknowledged are colorbiased there is considered to be however something special about the quality of the white southerners prejudice the yankee is rather businesslike in his matteroffact exclusion of the negro from certain spheres of ordinary living the british imperialist was haughty and sure of himself but the violence the passion the murderous quality of the white southerners feeling against the negro has become a canon of american thought deep in our consciousness and our literature and of european literature see sartres la putain respectueuse and what is more significant while the outward signs of this prejudice are clear enough at its core at the why of this crazy feeling is a mystery when reporter john bartlow martin wrote right after the supreme court decision the deep south says nevercentral to the books thesis was the implication of some ineradicable mystical hatred so deep and so invisible in the white southerner that no blasts of social change could touch it when i had lived a year or so in the deep south talking to and living next door to the same white people described by the author of that book i began to suspect he was wrong six years later i knew he was prejudice discrimination race hatred are real problems to the point of viciousness even murder but their mystery for those who will look hard is gone i will not tangle with cause because once you acknowledge cause as the core of a problem you have built something into it that not only baffles people but worse immobilizes them causation is not merely complexit may be impossible of solution as some of the new philosophers say one of those metaphysical conundrums created by our own disposition to set verbal obstacles between ourselves and reality why not ignore cause as a general philosophical problem and concentrate on result the point is devilishly irreverently simple if you can get a desired result the mystery is gone stop fumbling with the cause of prejudice except for those aspects on which we can operate a physicist may still not know what really is behind the transformation of matter into energy but if he has figured out how to release this energy his achievement is stupendous atlanta is in the deep south atlanta has as many crackpots kkk sympathizers country woolhats white supremacists barbershop lynchers vicious policemen as any southern city if the deep south said never atlanta too said never in  it was tightly segregated by  the buses had desegregated so had the public libraries the rails and bus terminals a number of theaters and restaurants downtown the department store cafeterias the opera the municipal auditorium  the legitimate theater the public schools the colleges public and private several hotels the plainclothes squad of the police department the fire department the baseball team the tennis courts the parks the golf courses the chamber of commerce several professional organizations the county committee of the democratic party and even the senate of the georgia general assembly now that it is all done there are obvious reasons which can be advanced with great casualness a flexible city administration a layer of negro intellectuals a determined student movement a band of white liberals giving cosmopolitan salting to the countrystyle talmadge ham but none of this takes account of the fact that all the above forces are a minority of the population that most of atlantas population the overwhelming majority of its  white people still consider negroes inferior and prefer a segregated society and that these people were numerous enough to have prevented most of the changeby riot by election by boycottif they cared enough they stood by passively and accepted with the puniest of resistance a series of fundamental changes in the sociolegal structure of the city there is then a key to the traditionally mysterious vault of prejudice locked inside the mind of the white southerner he cares but not enough or to put it another way while he cares about segrega tion there are things he cares about more the white southerner has a hierarchy of desires in which many other things are rated higher than segregation monetary profit political power staying out of jail the approval of ones immediate peers conforming to the dominant decision of the community desegregation has come in varying degrees to atlanta and a hundred other places in the deep south in the face of persistent antinegro feelings in the community simply because one or another of these desires which stand higher in the southerners valuescheme was threatened if he did not surrender except as an academic exercise there is no need then to probe the fog that inescapably shrouds the philosophical question of causation in race prejudice what needs to be done is to decide for each group of whites in the community which value is more important and to plan a web of multiple tacticsnegotiation boycott lawsuit voting demonstrationthat will effectively appeal to these priorities in a rough semiconscious way the actions of the federal courts and of negro leaders in the south have aimed at this a more deliberate use of the hierarchyofvalue concept would bring even more dramatic results the white man in the south is subject to the same simplicities and the same complexities that surround the human species of any color any place he has certain biological needs which he will try to satisfy whichever way he can on top of this he has other wants which he has learned from his cultureand because these often conflict with one another he has an unconscious set of priorities that enables him to make choices he is subject to economic pressure and ambition also if jungian theory is correct and the notions of modern role psychology valid and i believe they are he needs approval from certain people around him and seeks to play out the role society has cast him in beyond all this as beyond all the frontiers of human knowledge there is mystery in the behaviour of the human animal but its time to clear from our minds that artificial and special mystique so firmly attached to the southern white that has too long served as a rationale for pessimism and inaction but what of the black manor woman there is a strange and damnable unanimity of segregationists white liberals and negroes on one fervent beliefthe mystery of negritudethe irreducible kernel after all sociological peelings of race difference the segregationist white citizen or black muslim shouts this in all directions the white liberal is subtle sophisticated and ingenious in the various ways he can express thishe sweetens it with sympathy or admiration or affectionhe delights in the sheer thrill of a mystery he cherishes it as a secret shared with his fellow liberals yes yeswe can never know what it is to be a negro no nothey will never trust a white man and we cant blame them the negro robbed of other protection clings to it plays with it turns it to his advantage when he can even the most perceptive of his literary leaders baldwin ellison use it in cunning or in pride and all of them white liberal and negro intellectual fondle it nurture it as men having subdued a forest fire might play with the last flames too fascinated even in the midst of peril to put them out for good physical difference is so gross a stimulus to human beings cursed as they are by the gift of vision that once it is latched onto as explanation for difference in personality intelligence demeanor it is terribly difficult to put aside it becomes an easy substitute for the immensely difficult job of explaining personal and social behavior conservatives use it openly liberals secretly even unknowingly it seems to be the hardest thing in the world to convince ourselves that once weve noted skin color facial features and hair texture we have exhausted the subject of racethat everything beyond that is in our heads put there by others and kept there by ourselves and all the brutal material consequences of centuries from lynching to patronizing friendship were spun from an original thread of falsehood the most vicious thing about segregationmore deadly than its immediate denial of certain goods and servicesis its perpetuation of the mystery of racial difference  because there is a magical and omnipotent dispeller of the mystery it is contact contactbut it must be massive unlike those integrated situations in the north and it must be equal thus excluding maidlady relationships of the southdestroys the manmade link between physical differences and behavior explanation race consciousness is hollow its formidablelooking exterior is membranethin and is worn away by simple acts of touch the touching of human beings in contact that is massive equal and prolonged the brightness of the physical difference is relative it stands out in that darkness created by segregated living and is quickly lost in the galaxy of sense impressions that come from being with a person dayin dayout in our country the kind of contact that rubs away race consciousness is possible only in rare places and intermittently but it exists in scattered underground pockets of resistance to the norm one of them is the negro college where white people can become so immersed in a negro environment that they are oblivious at least temporarily of race the fact that they live on an island against which waves of prejudice roll from time to time means that they slide back and forth from overconsciousness on some days to a blissful racial amnesia on others a white student after several months of living eating studying playing in a totally negro college environment visited a nearby white college and returned saying how pallid they all seemedall those white faces and sharp noses this is a startling example of race consciousness in reverse but it is encouraging to see how quickly one can change the temper of racial awareness by an inundation of sense experiences once the superficiality of the physical is penetrated and seen for what it is the puzzle of race loses itself in whatever puzzle there is to human behavior in general once you begin to look in human clash for explanations other than race they suddenly become visible and even where they remain out of sight it is comforting to know that these nonracial explanations exist as disease began to lose its eeriness with the discovery of bacteria although the specific problem of identifying each bacterial group remained so long as evil existsand it exists in poisonous heaps south and norththe raw material for mystery is here we can make the most if we want toof white mobs in oxford mass negro indignation in albany blazing churches in birmingham gunfire on rural porches and the sheer wonder of blackness and whiteness but the specialness of the southern mystique vanishes when one sees that whites and negroes behave only like human beings that the south is but a distorted mirror image of the north and that we are powerful enough today and free enoughto retain only as much of the past we want we are all magicians we created the mystery of the south and we can dissolve it
howard u conference
last november cv it v many of the nations leading advocates of civil_rights and racial equality gathered at howard university for a twoday conference on youth nonviolence and social change the parley was called by the gandhi memorial lecture committee at howard headed by professor flemmie p kittrell and represented an expansion of the annual lecture series which commemorates the late indian leader the  program was financed in part by grants from the gandhi society for human rights and the taraknath das foundation both of new york city the purpose of  the conference was to inquire into the impact of the nonviolent movement to date upon the individual and the community with special reference to youth participating in the discussions were youth who are involved in nonviolent direct action civil_rights movements psychiatrists lawyers social scientists and the leaders of ational organizations whose primary purpose is the attainment of equal opportunities author james baldwin also was a participant from the welcoming remarks by president nabrit on the morning of november  to the gandhi memorial lecture by the rev dr martin_luther_king which closed the conference on the evening of the following day the several oncampus sites used for the talks were filled to capacity the results of the parley were pretty much as expected there was unanimous agreement that the civil_rights movement should continue there were varying opinions on the techniques to be employed however excerpts from the remarks of the several speakers appear on the pages which follow space limitations have necessitated the use of only brief abstractions
it seems that this is both the time and the place for a conference on youth nonviolence and social change this is the centennial of the emancipation proclamation which assures us of physical freedom but the vestiges of the slave system have remained to plague us from the days of slavery down to this day and we are not yet free revolutionary changes are taking place all over the world and america has not escaped this common lot a great many of us are not able to live up to the requirements of this movement which call not only for courage but also for an inner discipline and selfcontrol in the face of great provocation therefore it seems wise to me that we should take this time to look at the anatomy and the impact of one of the great forces in our time the nonviolent movement it also seems that this is a proper time in which to examine the impact of nonviolence because of the increasing intensity of the struggle which the negro is making to achieve firstclass status in our country for many years we have witnessed this struggle in the schools in the courts in our institutions and lately we have seen it transplanted into the streets in the highways and into our business and commercial establishments it is also occurring in our unions and our organizations and as the intensity of the struggle increases opposition mounts so that when we look at the nonviolent movement which is one of the powerful forces in this struggle we do indeed serve our time we welcome you to howard university an institution that has attempted during these many years to aid in theory and in fact in the struggle for freedom we hope your stay at howard will be comfortable and pleasant but above all we hope that from this conference shall come a renewed determination to continue to struggle on every front until we have achieved freedom to those who would divide us because all of us do not think in the same way and to those who would discourage us because all of us do not align ourselves behind any one social force i could remind them of the words of the poet who said if a man does not keep pace with his companion perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer let him step to the music he hears may we do that and may your conference be a success
how much provocation can a nonviolent fighter take before he breaks out into violence or if he can hold himself in check during the campaign is he more prone to become violent afterwards nonviolent fighters characteristically master their angry feelings through adhering to a religious philosophy that preaches the ultimate supremacy of love and the redemptive power of suffering does this limit the successful use of nonviolent methods to those who hold this philosophy the hardest questions arise from the fact that to date nonviolent campaigns have all been waged in a context of violence the threat of violence has always lurked in the wings although the primary aim in human combat is to change the opponents mind to make him submit to your will one cannot deny that threatening him with bodily harm is a very effective way of doing this and if you kill him you no longer have to worry about what he thinks so far only groups that believe that they cannot hope to win by violence have adhered to nonviolent tactics however these nonviolent movements could potentially mobilize superior violence on their side the leaders of nonviolent movements constantly remind their opponents that if their demands are not met they may not be able to keep their followers in check is the threat of violence an integral part of the success of nonviolence can nonviolent campaigns succeed in the complete absence of this threat if not are they truly nonviolent dr nelson among the qualities inherent in genuine nonviolent protest is a belief in the persuasive even compelling power of selfsuffering this may be a high price for the end that is sought but what choice remains when persuasion the courts the ballot have failed resort to this kind of soul force has two justifications one is a belief that as the means so must the end be means and ends must be seen as convertible on the belief that to take care of the means is to guarantee the ultimate achievement of the end there is of course the alternative of violence which also is not without its price violence eschewed there remains the pitting of ones spirit against the hardness of the offender of ones whole soul against anothers will we who want genuine enduring freedom why must we look for it to spring from the seed of violence rather than from the seed of kindness a good rule for the participants in any movement of nonviolent resistance is to bear in mind that they are not saints fighting devils they are the aggrieved struggling against the authors of their grievances i would suggest then in relation to nonviolence as a technique that the nonviolent act of a man which outruns in goodness his convictions is still better than a violent act i suggest that the continued doing of good which exceeds ones moral convictions can lead to the making of a better man we must still concede that this as a mere technique is an uncertain foundation upon which to build a good and happy society mr baldwin one could hope in this country for a level of cognizance able to envision a world in which quarrels can be settled in some way other than they have been settled in the past i think the situation of the negro proves the obsolescence of the notion of violence however i cannot help but wonder how long we can endure what is happening to us and not fight back particularly in situations where it is a matter of selfdefense i have found a great number of young people who would think nothing of picking up arms tomorrow on the other hand i see in this danger this terrible confrontation an opportunity for good an opportunity not only to liberate this country but perhaps an opportunity to change the world it is very clear to me in any case that if we were not involved in the cold war or the nuclear race we could liberate a vast amount of our money and energy and begin to change our cities our negroes in them and the white people too it is a question of misplaced energy mr coffin nonviolence as we have seen it in america does not so much change the segregationist as it does the enemy the enemy is no longer the negro the enemy is now violence it is at this point that the moderates come out of the woodwork and begin to moderate they moderate not on the grounds of integration not on any moral ground but on the very pragmatic grounds of law and order the avoidance of violence our societys first concern is not to establish justice is not to grant freedom to individual members but simply to offset chaos by establishing order it is one thing to say that justice rolls on like mighty waters but it is another thing to work out an irrigation system fear is more influential than moral persuasion fear of irresponsible negroes is having a greater effect on the white segregationist community than conversion by people like mr farmer mr farmer one of the problems that we will have to work with is how to control and discipline a mass movement to maintain nonviolence how to do it especially when it is a movement based upon a tactic upon a method upon a technique rather than upon a philosophy or a way of life we concentrate now on setting up institutes workshops and sessions to train masses of people we must train monitors who will be skilled to spot trouble isolate it move the demonstrators on before violence has had an opportunity to wreck the demonstration this must be done quickly otherwise it will deteriorate into a violent revolution there is a peculiar situation here in america demonstrators in the south can affect the conscience of the north but demonstrators in the north have difficulty affecting the consciences of northerners i find that the movement has been more successful where it has been able to affect the consciences of persons i am firmly convinced that the nonviolent movement must be a combination of an appeal to the conscience and the old trade union tactic of hurting the pocketbook we must do this in a more professional manner than we have done in the past dr fishman nonviolent demonstrations have had an interesting paradoxical effect on the one hand the white liberal is enthused and entranced at the image of the morally dedicated brave young negroes risking their lives on behalf of a moral principle the white liberal perhaps has become too much involved in the issue of nonviolence and too little involved in the issue of rights nonviolence in this sense has perhaps had a similar effect on our government if in the long run our government continues to be ruled by political power and concerned with what is politically pragmatic and politically possible then nonviolence may represent an easy out for the politician it represents for him a way of ducking the whole issue so long as he can keep the negro placated with promises extenuations talk about political pragmatism talk about what is politcally possible and hope that the reverend king and the other negro leaders may be able to keep the negro community in check and keep them nonviolent the political leader has a perfect out he can spend his time maintaining his own power and not giving in to the basic issues of freedom and rights sociological and psychological aspects dr edwards nonviolence in its pristine form is more than resistance in nonviolent terms as conceptualised by gandhi it converts the adversary through demonstrations of suffering and selfabnegation which expose and bring to consciousness the oppressors guilt and the faulty position he holds if one elects to follow such a course in accordance with the dictates of his conscience and in full knowledge that the adversary will administer punishment one must be prepared to accept such punishment without retaliation in violent terms desoite the presence in this country of scores of admirers of gandhi who preach his philosophy and have advocated nonviolence and despite the supporters of the peace movement the crystallization of the ideology of nonviolence which guides the present movement is owing to the reverend martin l king prominent attention is given to the reverend king because he has been the most articulate spokesman and has provided the most crystallized ideological expression of the nonviolent movement nonviolence must always be viewed as a phase of a larger social movement it is conceivable and predictable that as the movement changes nonviolence as a technique will disappear though one would not be so bold as to predict when it is already apparent that the successes of the present movement have brought into view a clearer need for different emphases but whatever its future the historian is likely to relate that in the midth century the nonviolent movement focused the attention of america on one of its most significant problems drs solomon and fishman it would appear that the nonviolent student civil_rights movements is neither an unusual accident of history a carefully invented pragmatic ideology of a few leaders nor a movement sprung into being through the appearance of one charismatic leader its content the reactions it provokes and its successes appear to be an understandable intersection between a number of psychological and political forces in the south and the evolution of a new social character in negro youth the movement provides a release of pentup resentment and anger in a politically and socially advantageous and morally superior manner touching both the conscience and political nerves of the community data drawn from the negro students suggest that for many the ideals of nonviolence are secondary to the social and personal considerations of achieving civil_rights to these students nonviolent techniques seem like good strategy and their reason for not striking back when being physically abused is that it would hurt the movement that is not to say they do not believe in the worth of the technique but rather that these students feel that the current political framework and role of public opinion in the country today is such that those who become violent are bound to lose in the long run when a group or individual struggles against opposition much stronger than himself and which is capable of inflicting disastrous retaliation upon him nonviolent defiance seems to provide a way of resolving the dilemma mr kahn there are certain prerequisites for nonviolence a certain degree of organization in society reduces the necessity for violence violence in a large measure is a reflection of social disintegration fundamentally the problem always has been how to remove the instituional causes of violence frictional institutions which cause violence the measure of nonviolence in my view is not how deep down it goes into the individual but how far out it goes from the individual and the group to change the conditions that cause nonviolence the closer the nonviolent directaction movement comes to making progress the more it is going to have to begin to make broad political judgments on the nature of the political system under which we operate it is surprising to me for example that the various civil_rights organizations have yet to mount all together in consort with other progressive forces in society an allout political campaign which has as its single slogan break the political power of the dixiecrats i think this is the main obstacle to which the movement is going to have to address itself mr mitchell i believe the nonviolent movement has been to a great extent identified and described by those who want to make the negro a docile and subservient fellow who is willing to turn the other cheek who is willing to let his women be kicked around who is willing to let his children go to jail this is a great mistake because it is not characteristic of most humans whether they be negroes or not to react that way i think time is running out on america in this resoect i think that   those intellectual and dedicated people who have carried the ball of nonviolence who have been willing to be slapped and kicked around have brought about a wonderful chapter in our countrys history but the plain fact is that there are many other people who are not willing to be slapped around there are plenty of other people who will defend their homes if they are bombed the only way to meet this challenge it seems to me is for the u s government to get busy and pass effective legislation which will make it possible to protect people who are interested in safeguarding their lives their property their honor and the future of their children dr waskow i think it is important to examine the question whether there is a field of behavior that is neither violent nor nonviolent but nonlethal this should be done if for no other reason than to make it clear that one need not lapse directly from gandhianism to violence there are techniques for carrying on political conflict that are not violent but do not depend on the direct confrontation of bodies and souls secondly i think we need a new look at the role of the police both the southern establishment and most of the integration movement tend to assume that the role of the police is to defend one or another established order segregation or integration it is possible to imagine a role for the police in which they do neither but aim at only one thingthe prevention and if necessary punishment of outright violence but do not prevent either nonviolent or nonlethal forms of conflict i am not posing this as the solution but i think that the possiblity of this role for the police is one which has not been looked at so far mr meredith first i would like to comment on mr mitchells remarks and say that i am in complete agreement with him no matter how hard i try i cannot fully adopt the principle of nonviolence in addition i do not believe that in the final analysis this principle can solve our problems when i was a student at the university of mississippi and when some other student cursed me and i smiled people would think that i was a shining example of the nonviolent method believe me this was not the case because of the situation at ole miss i had no choice but to act nonviolently i am sure that violence is not the answer to the negros fight for freedom i am not so sure however that our people are as nonviolent as they have been pictured particularly in the white press i believe that if negroes continue to be nonviolent even when circumstances naturally would make them become violent it will be harmful to our position in the long run legal and constitutional aspects mr nabrit the demonstrationsparticularly the sitinshave required lawyers to reexamine some ideas about constitutional law that had become settled and fixed the issue is whether under our system of laws negroes can be kept out of public accommodations because of their race and arrested and jailed for insisting upon service in such facilities the southern states argue that when a storekeeper discriminates against a negro the constitution is not violated because the state is not involved we of the naacp have argued to the contrary saying that the states are deeply involved in these cases i suggest to you that the failure to assure that negroes are treated equally in the public life of the community offends the fourteenth amendment i believe that the framers of the amendment intended that it would cover the failures of states to protect as well as their affirmative misdeeds i think that it is instructive to recall that  american states and many english commonwealth and european countries including france italy and the netherlands would protect the right of a negro to be served in a place of public accommodations a principle characteristic of racial segregation is that whatever other impact it may have it is invariably an insult mr trebach one of the great practical effects that direct nonviolent protest has is that it conveys on a personal basis the idea that negroes do regard racial discrimination as an insult the enforcement of segregation is a violation of the equal protection clause it is also true that any action by an official of justice that in any way treats a person differentially because of his race is a violation of the equal protection clause this is a pretty pervasive concept for example there is a case that came out of birmingham where the police went into a railroad station and asked negroes if they had interstate tickets they did not ask whites this action by the police had set the basis for an eventual favorable decision toward these civil_rights protesters bail is a particular problem in baton rouge bail was set at   for protesters on a breach of the peace offense normally the bail for this offense is  there is also the possibility of relief in the injunctive provisions of the civil statutes the big thing about an injunction in this area is that the general position taken by the federal court is this if a suit commences in the state court the federal court will not issue an injunction unless you can show that great irreparable and immediate harm will occur finally on the possibility of removal of a case from a state to a federal court under present law this is not a very effective remedy i dont know of a successful case in the history of this removal statute i find a terrible prospect for the future but i hope that southern officials will come to their senses stop these practices and conform to the constitution unless they produce a great social upheaval mr bernhard the concept of the original civil_rights statutes passed in the s and s has been totally forgotten this concept was that not only were substantive civil_rights statutes needed but procedures and techniques were needed to enforce them our present provision of the federal law is ineffective in order to get somebody prosecuted successfully today it must be shown that the policeman grabbed a negro hit him over the head jailed him and kicked him after he was in jail but that is not enough you have to establish that while the policeman was doing this to the negro he had a fixed intent to deprive him of a constitutional right i think we need to go back into our history to find out what has happened to the original civil_rights statutes those enacted during reconstruction this is one area that has not been adequately researched to date dean ferguson the method of mass arrests which has been used as a technique against the demonstrators raises some very severe problems about our process of justice administration itself the system is based supposedly on individualization of each particular case what has quite obviously happened is that the mass arrests were not individualized the arrests are what some scholars might call group theory that is if we find a group which can be identified in a particular way then we move against the group i would suggest that there is a fairly substantial constitutional problem here the republican form of government clause may very well be involved when we begin to get mass arrests and mass use of the administration of justice machinery for the purpose of imposing punishment on persons by using such procedural machinery as bail holding for a certain number of hours without consultation and the like dean pye it is easy enough to say that any time we are engaged in nonviolent action where our motives are praiseworthy it is permissible this idea to me raises very serious difficulties i do not have the answer but i suggest that in a pluralistic society such as we live in the dangers to the legal order may be such that we are going to have to place a brake on some of our nonviolent activities we want to be careful in the attempt to justify nonviolent activity which is lawful in the cause of civil_rights that we do not provide the intellectual justification for southern school boards not to desegregate until somebody sues them we want to be careful that we do not give justification to roman catholics who decide not to vote for school bond issues for public schools in negro neighborhoods because they think that constitutionally they have a right to share in those tax revenues for parochial schools miss thornton i am concerned with the amount of time which lapses between the beginning of a right and the winning of a right in the courts i am concerned with the ineffectiveness of the remedies we wait three or four

there can be no gainj ll   saying of the fact that  ii  we face a crisis in race d relations in our nation this crisis has been precipitated by the collusion between the forces of liberation and the forces of domination the old idea of racial segregation of paternalistic relationships has exhausted itself and american society is seeking to reorientate itself along the idea of desegregation of integration the idea of persontoperson relations this is the crisis of our age i am still convinced in spite of the tragedies we have faced in our birminghams and other communities that nonviolence is the most potent weapon available to the negro in his struggle for freedom and justice i believe that nonviolence is the method that can achieve the ideals goals and principles of this new age the philosophy of nonviolence contends that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek means and ends must cohere ones aim must never be to inflict injury upon the opponent this stands at the center of the nonviolent discipline and philosophy one must rise to the heights of being able to accept blows without retaliating nonviolence means that you refuse to engage in external physical violence and it also means that you are constantly moving to the point where you refuse to engage in internal violence of spirit not only will you come to the point that you are able not to shoot the opponent not to hit the opponent not to throw a rock at the opponent but you come to the point that you are able not to hate the opponent some people misunderstood love at this point for they think when you say love you mean a sentimental affectionate emotion and i would be the first to say that it is absurd and nonsense to ask oppressed people to love their oppressors in an affectionate sense the love i speak of is more than an ecstatic or romantic love it is more than friendship it is a love of understanding creative redemptive goodwill for all men it is an overflowing love which seeks nothing in return theologians would say it is the love of god operating in the human heart when an individual rises to love on this level he loves every man not because he likes him not because his ways appeal to himbut he loves every man because god loves him and he rises to the point of loving the person who does the evil deed while hating the deed that the person does i think this is what jesus meant when he said love your enemies and im happy that he didnt say like your enemies its pretty difficult to like some people its pretty difficult to like somebody bombing your home and killing your children its pretty difficult to like some of the senators and congressmen who spend all of their time voting against civil_rights but jesus said love them and love is greater than like it is a recognition that prejudice is a learned process that those who are prejudiced are taught that way hate is dangerous it is as injurious to the hater as it is to the hated the nonviolent discipline says you move toward that point at which you are able to love the opponent and hate segregation and there is something about this that frustrates the opponent it exposes his moral defenses it weakens his morale and at the same time it works on his conscience and he just doesnt know how to handle it even if the opponent tries to kill you you develop an inner conviction that there are some things so precious some things so dear some things so eternally true that theyre worth dying for and if a man has not discovered something that he will die for he isnt fit to live if an individual at  yearsold hears some great truth some great principle some great ideal standing at the doorsteps of his life and he refuses to take a stand because hes afraid that his hand will be burned afraid that he will lose a job or afraid that he will be killed and he wants to live longer  he may live until hes  but hes just as dead at  as he is at  one must never allow himself to reach the point where he is willing to cooperate with evil this is what civil disobedience means in the final analysis noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good there are those who argue that you cant legislate morality that negroes must wait for freedom until the heart changes but the people who say this fail to see something it may be true that morality cant be legislated but behavior can be regulated it may be true that the law cant change the heart but it can reform the habits it may be true that the law cant make a man love me but it can keep him from lynching me there is need for strong civil_rights legislation and if this legislation is not passed in this session of congress the debilitating sorrow and sore on the body politic will suddenly become malignant and we will be in for a terrible night in our nation it may be a night of violence and terror the whirlwind of hope can be restored in the negro community by the passage of this bill
