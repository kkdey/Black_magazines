this is the eleventh school year since the u s supreme court announced its epochal decision banning socalled separatebutequal public education but only this year has the wall of segregation been breached in the last of the defiant states in the late confederacy and all across the deep south the wall has been only breached racial segregation in our schools is still the only system in hundreds of southern communities and the dominant pattern all over the south further it is a disruptive practice mentally morally and socially stunting in many cities over the rest of the country its an old southern customwidely admired and emulated executive orders as well as other supreme decisions have sought to extend integration to other important activities of our public life such as service in the armed forces the use of parks recreational facilities transportation facilities libraries hospitals and housing numerous state laws and city ordinances have been enacted for the purposes of integrating our uses of public facilities and of more nearly equalizing our opportunities for education employment health and decent living standards these efforts  national state and localhave by no means been in vain much indeed has been accomplished but immensely more remains to be done we have not yet become one nation indivisible we have not yet won liberty and justice for all in fact in these laudable endeavors as in integrated education we have really only barely begun for the most part we still have an essentially segregated society racial segregation discrimination and domination are old caucasian customs that will die hard why do we who widely and loudly profess to be a free nation and who propose to lead the socalled free world in a determined effort to maintain and further the ideals of liberty equality fraternity and democracywhy do we continue so long to procrastinate about implementing the individual rights provisions of our national constitution as well as our traditional ideals of democracy why do we hesitate so long before a watchful world to practice what we preach to other nationsand to ourselves was ever a primitive tribe more reluctant to forsake the venerable but violent ways of its fathers than we are to give up the narcotic fruits of racial segregation will it take a widespread mixing of blood in death to awaken us from our insensibility to human feelings and human rights our national virtues are involved in conditions so anomalous that a searching inquiry into the rationale of segregation is unavoidable if we negro digest december  are to escape a national tragedy and an international revulsion in facing the naked facts of the cruel degrading and demoralizing uses of segregation we should find the inescapable obligation and the necessary courage and determination to end its brutal practice why does segregation remain so popular in caucasian circles high and low primarily it is because caucasians are the segregators rather than the segregated the rejectors instead of the rejected the shunnersnot the shunned that makes a vast differenceall the difference and people who actively practice racial discrimination have either too much arrogance or too little imagination or both to put themselves into the shoes of those who are forced to walk the lonely humiliating path of segregation our lack of a vigorous application of democratic and equalitarian principles to the civic life of each of our citizens alike is ultimately due in large part to our preference for property rights over human rights basically our aloof attitude toward the negro springs from an anachronistic concept of property rights he was once a marketable chattel he is even now in most southern localities popularly considered to be a communal hand available for use by the white community at a price near subsistence level indeed in many rural areas of the south a strong vestige of personal ownership of negroes is strikingly revealed through the common method of identifying a colored person as one of mr broadacres niggers thats an old southern custom congressional members from the rabidly apartheid states are relatively few in number but strong in influence and power this is partly because they openly and boisterously voice notions of white supremacy held in varying degrees by many other members who nevertheless find democratic pretensions more expedient politically than racism thus our political democracy remains almost exclusively a white democracy but segregationists by no means abhor color instead they find it politically useful socially gratifying psychologically flattering and economically profitable their apparent aversion to color as such is only pious pretense and those southern segregationists who thunder loudest against color are only indulging in diversionary tactics of course they are not afraid of color as their forefathers did for long generations before them they live intimately with it they work with it eat with it play with it sleep with it love it and help to procreate it but of course all of these interracial relations must by all means conform publicly to the rituals of white domination and negro submission this old southern custom is the sole requirement for close racial communion neither do these superior race advocates really object to the de velopment of a mongrelized race that they do not in practice object to miscegenation anyone can see again the manner of doing it is paramount they do not object to the act which is generally a form of exploitation but only to legalizing the act see john dollards caste and class in a southern town such legalization would eventually raise the status of the lower caste to the point of endangering the whole caste system which is to them centrally fundamentally and vitally important though the motives for interracial sexual intercourse are doubtless diverse and complex sexual exploitation of negro women by white men even to the point of rapeis an old southern custom the basic importance of color lies in its use as an indelible badge that permanently identifies a minority group and thus makes its exploitation hereditary the fundamental role of color is not to generate prejudice but to bolster and perpetuate it and the bourbon segregationists of the south have no intention whatsoever of surrendering now or later their way of life they cant easily be divorced from the idea that the negro still somehow belongs to them they will have to be pried loose this is an ugly fact of american life which will not go away because we minimize it try to ignore it or deny it its an old southern custom to have negroes during the last decade more advice has been given to the colored people of the united states about the desirability and necessity of obeying and upholding the law than has been given to the southern segregationists on the same subject during the entire career of jim crow whose sun is now sinking but in one respectin regard to the civil_rights of negro citizens the rulers of the south have always been a lawless group for half a century and more they lawlessly and blatantly ignored the equal part of the separatebutequal doctrine in utter disregard of the fifteenth amendment they have persistently denied the great mass of negro citizens their lawful right to vote when this denial could not be accomplished by legal subterfuge it has been unhesitatingly lawlessly and unblushingly achieved by threats of force the free use of force in unmerciful beatings and mutilations or even by planned murder for generations southern folklore has taught young caucasians that they were not obliged to respect the legal rights of negroes equally with those of whites and any time a white mans prestige or power came into conflict with a negroes rights those rights were tacitly ignored or for emphasis more often arrogantly flouted depriving the negro of his citizenship rights is an old southern custom in fact the negro people in the south have had to live without the protection of the law to a degree unparalleled in the life of any people of any other great modern country negro digest december  unless you call apartheid south africa a great country not only has the law failed to protect the negro it has been freely used to keep him in his placein bondage and for many decades public lynching was a distinctive folkway of the south it has now been practically replaced by clandestine murder and murder from ambush unless a prominent negro is thus murdered these methods of killing cause far less publicity than a neighborhood lynching in any case quiet murder leads to less criticism of the southern status quo regardless of the method employed murdering negroes remains an old southern custom away down south in dixie today lawlessness not only lurks in ambush and slinks through the night with dynamite it also stalks across the land in the guise of law and orderin uniform and police boots with a cattle prod in one hand and a gun in the other in civilized communities the police dog is becoming the segregationists best friend today segregation in the deep south is being maintained by nothing less than a reign of terror this white terror was plainly exposed for all to see by the summer project in mississippi last summer there courageous young democratic americans all dedicated members of the human race tore a shockingly revealing hole in the segregation curtainunmasking more than one old southern custom thus a century and more after the emancipation proclamation the negro is still dominated socially exploited economically and sexually shunted aside politically terrorized and then widely and loudly blamed for causing unlawful disturbances well of course it really is disturbing for the oppressed and dispossessed to protest vigorously enough to be seen and heard round the world both the philosophy and the practice of racial segregation have become so deeply embedded and so intricately entwined in the traditions the folklore and the customs of the deep south that the white man has been caught in his own segregationist trap he is now sweating and floundering between its jaws of fear and hatred and through practicing segregation against his colored neighbors he has become so stupefied socially so insensible to human values that he cant conceive of negroes as individuals with varying personalities as ordinary human beings with ordinary human attributes as persons fully entitled to all the rights and privileges of citizenship instead in his social stupefaction he sees them only as indistinguishable units of a mass of beings known collectively as niggers somehow not quite fully human and therefore incapable and unworthy of full citizenship only a half century ago the question does a negro have a soul was still current in the late confederacy around the turn of the century the rising segregationists driving hard to consolidate and  consummate the undisputed rule of jim crow had arrogantly challenged the negros humanity in order to make his new bondage appear justified for instance a book by charles carroll in  bore the title the negro a beast or in the image of god this campaign of vilification met with enough success that its psychological mark is still evident though the deepest infection and the most virulent manifestations of this social malady of racial segregation are in the south it affects the entire country in some degree and it impinges upon our foreign relations with an endlessly recurring discord getting rid of it is a task that confronts and concerns the whole nation now and no matter which way we turn it will still confront us releasing ourselves from the entangling and constricting grasp of segregation and its numerous attendant social evils is a tremendous job that calls for a strong and continuous effort to awaken the nation to the shameful and frightening realities of our social predicament it calls for a sustained effort in mass social and political education and reeducation it calls for a concerted and determined effort to apply impartially all of the protective and equalitarian provisions of our federal constitution to all citizens and to enforce our national laws in all of the states alike today in the heartland of jim crowwith its segregationist sheriffs its battalions of riottrained police and its thompson tank law and order has become synonymous with segregation the stranglehold which these fierce bayou segregationists have upon the negro people can be effectively broken only by a federal government determined to enthrone the majesty of the law throughout the defiant south and thereby actively insure the full rights of citizenship to every citizen by now this should be plain enough to everyone when you consider all the people of the south racial segregation is not simply an old southern custom venerable and harmlessthat has become a cherished way of life it has always been a rapacious practice for the negro people it has always been and still is a way of degradation humiliation suffering and death devoid of both compassion and justice segregation is a continuing monstrous social evil it is an affront to human dignity it is an assault upon the human soul a rape of the human personality how much longer will the american conscience and american justice permit the negro people to be shamelessly sacrificed upon the altar of the immoral and illegal old southern custom of racial segregationwhich is not so very old after all morality law and common human decency all demand that this soulless custom regardless of age be stopped now 
is there really a negro revolution
persistence of nem gro oppression in one form or another stems fr° m the way ne« r° es u« as weu as whjtes have conceptualized or misconceptualized the entire problem of race relations in america this is especially true when it comes to the socalled negro revolution that is going on now why after all of these years is the negro not free why has not the negros struggle taken a more effective a more final mode it is because i submit the negro has accepted the white mans definition of how to achieve his freedom by this i do not mean that any single white man or group of white men are directing the negros struggle i mean negroes themselves have accepted in theory and practice forms of struggling or protesting that are defined by the modus operandi the way we do things over here of the american establishment in a word the freedom movement has become institutionalized itthe movementis governed and handicapped by the very mode of politics economics and everything else that governs and handicaps this nation the white establishment is not going to approve of let alone allow a mode of struggle that will lead to the effective and speedy overthrow of the white mans dominant position in society anyway the sheer machinery of the establishment the law politics economics etc sloppy though it may beoperates in such a way as to impede if not outright prevent any major and speedy success in the negros struggle to become free you see how long it took to get the civil_rights bill into law it will be  years or more before the provisions in it can be universally enforced the institutionalization of the negro struggle is achieved in the following ways  the negro struggle is made into a formal movement every effort exerted by negroes must be approved of one way or another by the legitimate establishment this negro digest december  puts the negro in a position where he must reveal what he plans to do before he does it there are set channels and procedures in and through which the negro must go whenever and wherever he decides to do something about his oppression a tendency for the struggle to become ritualized ensues no matter what the situation is tha negro becomes accustomed to struggling against it in a fashion that is repetitive and most of all one that is easily predictable by whites this makes the struggle orderly which is a prescription set down by whites in the end a great deal of the effort exerted by negroes amounts to no more than empty ceremony a solemn parade or a turbulent demonstration where negroes suffer brutality from white mobs water hoses and hound dogs classic examples are the march on washington in the first instance and the birmingham demonstrations in the second instance  the negro always has to sit down and talk this leads to compromise on whatever he is talking about which means the negro struggle is being arrested the common form in which this process occurs is the committee the committee is appointed by someone from the white establishment who is revered for his nonpartisanship the committee is composed of people of goodwill and high standing in the society or better yet from the community in question of late the usual thing is to set up a biracial committee during the negotiation it is the whites who givein less than the negroes then too the whites have a way of not keeping their promises meager as they might be when infrequently promises are kept it takes so ong to institute them another fact about negotiation is that a few of the blacks are usually encouraged to do something that smells like selling out this is a clear indication that the negro struggle is governed by the traditional mode of american politics currently quite a few negro leaders have assumed the role of race diplomats too many negroes in positions of leadership play the traditional role of uncle tom only now they are educated uncle toms and are not so easily detected they deal with the white and black communities in such a way as to protect their own self interest a doctor a preacher a president of a negro college especially in the south it is not unusual to find negroes in high places who softpeddle demands for freedom and equality in order to make their own positions secure in most instances nobody knows it but the diplomat and the few whites in question traditionally when white people of goodwill in the south wanted to stop negroes from doing something or to start something the pattern has been to call in the local doctor preacher or college president and negotiate all of this is done behind the scenes except  in rare cases where the situation becomes public knowledge blows wide open the masses do not know what is going on until the negro returns and tells them that suchandsuch a line of action usually inaction or ineffective action is the best thing for them and is what they are going to do the nature of diplomacyfrom its historical beginnings to the presentproves one thing it is rare that a diplomat actually represents the entirety of his constituency the best he usually does is to represent himself along with his immediate coterie or peersthe class interest this allows for an explanation as to why after the suffering and struggling on the part of all negroes only a few usually middleclass really benefits  every time the negro does something to achieve his freedom the response is lets study the situation this means all activity by negroes must cease while the study is in process nine times out of ten white people do the study or administer it which is the same thing it takes a great deal of money which of course must come from the white establishment what the study boils down to is this whites are going to tell about how whatever the negroes want will create more problems than it will solve and above all about how whites and negroes simply cannot get along together some white sociologists or authorities on race and their staffs earn a great deal of money the authority gets his findings published in one of the journals or better still in newsweekall about what whites think about negroes never the other way around then he publishes his study in book form receiving high acclaim and ultimately as a consequence of his monumental work he assumes the chair in social sciences at one of the larger universities this also applies to the few negroes who from time to time get the chance to head up a study meanwhile years have passed the stockpile of our knowledge on race relations accumulates like debris in the archives of the dead  bring the struggle out of the streets and put it in the courts first one must sit and be intimidated by the bigotry of southern courts local judges and other officials then if one is lucky one comes up through the state courts and finally to the supreme court this takes years and more money than any single negro or local group of negroes can ordinarily afford an avalanche of litigation red tape is unavoidable and still even if the supreme court decides in your favor there is no certainty on the local level that you are actually going to get what is now legally yours the adjudication of the negros rights works in such a way as to prolong the granting of those rights  the negros struggle to achieve his freedom tends to be conceptualized in mythological terms negroes do this as well as negro digest december  whites the struggle is defined in terms of mystical measures such as love those who hate you the need for understanding    suffering    forgivingness we are told that the problem is in the hearts of americans those who make speeches employ such phrases as go down moses    go tell it on some kind of mountain  i have a dream etc etc    negroes are told that prayer is a powerful weapon against oppression and that god is on their side all of this makes for some fine oratory and more times than not sloppy poetry what it means in too many instances is that the negro has adopted a view towards alleviating his oppression that tends to prolong that oppression a christian approach towards solving the race problem can do just so much nonviolent methods of struggling can do just so much then the law of diminishing returns sets in anyway negroes are not living in a land of ancient kings singing about go down moses and if i had a hammer might call up in the negro a powerful sense of his suffering but it also tends to transport the negros concentration away from this world and this time a world and a time that if he is to become free he must deal with in an objective secular fashion this equally applies to black nationalism backtoafricanism and black muslimism any solution to negro oppression that does not provide realistic means towards that solution is a mythsolution the poetic and symbolic rhetoric of the freedom movement often indicates its nonmilitancy therefore the threat of violence in coercing compliance with negro demands is not being utilized this is what happened when because of the very secular language in which john lewis chose to state negro demands his speech was heavily censored at the march on washington in addition to this the progress that negroes make tends to be generalized in such a way that when one negro achieves something it is played up as if all negroes have achieved it sidney poitier has definitely achieved but the rank and file of negroes has not achieved anything the same goes in the case of jackie robinson ralph bunche and so on this type of thinking represents tokenism in negro progress it is a form of vicarious progress and not real progress  no matter what the negro says he wantscivil_rights fair employment better education human rights and so onthe white man especially the southerner never fails to bring up the question would you want your daughter or your sister to marry one this question seems to sufficiently caution if not inflame all whites against integrating negroes into the mainstreams of american democracy  it seems to me there is a trend on the part of some civil_rights groups to place an undue amount of emphasis on policy more and  more the freedom movement is becoming involved with bureaucracy bureaucracy often confuses communication and impedes progress the leaders and other personnel of the movement are beginning to look and act like organization men what organizationism does is to coerce every small or local group to conform to policy this prevents or limits spontaneous action and independent thinking the negro freedom movement tends not to tolerate protest action or demonstrations that veer from its current policy of nonviolence and of not offending or embarrassing white friends of the movement this is known as negro liberalism of course the policy of nonviolence and negro liberalism is a direct reflection of the influence that the white establishment has upon the negro struggle negroes go along with this policy because i am afraid it is the only one that liberal whites approve of and mainly because negroes have the same values as the white establishment i have already mentioned how john lewiss march on washington speech was censored and disapproved of because the speech made a radical departure from the agreedupon policy agreed upon by whom by whatby white liberals and negro liberals who did not want to say or do anything that would offend the white establishment and most of all john f kennedy and company another example occurred when one branch of new york core decided to stage a massive automobile stallin on major transportation arteries on the opening day of the worlds fair there was much debate amongas well as betweenthe major civil_rights groups the local chapter of core made an effort to go ahead but the stallin as such was a telling failure i do not know if any heads rolled i do know that the local chapter was expelled or suspended from the larger body  instead of intensifying the aggression against the wider society many negroes feel that they must get themselves ready must prepare for integration and equality they must acquire good manners and in general they must learn how to act before they can expect whites to treat them as human beings what this means is that too often negroes assume toward themselves the same attitudes that whites have frequently the psychology of the negro is that of a freak striving to achieve equality with normal people the normal people whites define the terms of the freaks equality the negro accepts these terms he abandons his own qualities his manners and habits and strives to imitate the values habits and behavior patterns of white folks it is this viewpoint that tends to color or usurp every phase of the negros struggle for human recognition in america considering everything i have asserted so far how may one evaluate the current wave of negro protest as a revolutionary movement the answer is inescapable there is no black revolution a revolutionany revolution is a ruthless program of aggression on the part of the oppressed masses against the very foundation of the powers that oppress a movement with revolutionary intent seeks not to reform certain limited aspects within a society but to destroy or overturn the entire organizational structure it leaves in its wake the ruins of not merely the one institution that is directly identified with oppression it makes havoc with the entire socioeconomicpolitical complex because revolutionaries know that it is the complex which is ultimately responsible for oppression or freedom you cannot escape hatred and oppression in a world of hatred and oppression that world has to be destroyed that world has to be reorganized from top to bottom both materially and psychologically there is no revolutionary mentality in america americawhite and blacklacks the kind of imagination that creates revolution the leaders the organizations and groups that are in the forefront of the negro struggle and which are accepted as legitimate by the white establishment are not clamoring so much for individual liberty freedom as they are for uniformity in social status and public treatment equality these kind of negroes want to be accepted in and by white society not as individual personalities but as if they were white themselves they have the same values that whites do this attitude necessarily puts a straitjacket on how far the negro will go out on the limb in throwing off his oppression freedom for most americanswhite and negroespecially middle class negroes has a madison avenue meaning it means material comfort and while the majority of negroes are not actually middle class they are definitely middle class oriented james meredith for instance has repeatedly stated that the main motivation behind his endurance at the university of mississippi was the very american desire to get ahead to be able to function as a lawyer in his mississippi hometown and to acquire the material comforts propagandized as common to our american way of life    just as any white man would do this is the crucial point most negroes want to throwoff oppression within the context of the american establishment the negrow is not yet willing to run the risk of a total assault on the culture to find that many of the things for which he has fought and is fighting will no longer be available that is within the socioeconomic and political framework that now characterizes this nation it is a question of values whether it is best to completely do away with oppression as undesirable and find that other desirable values are also done away withor to deliberately or unwit tingly protest in such ways as to prolong in some form or another the existence of the race problem and thereby retain many of the more desirable features of the american system this is the real american dilemma at this moment in our history it pertains almost exclusively to the negro for contrary to what myrdal asserted in his book an american dilemma the vast majority of whites in the united states have never had any bones about the discrepancy between the american creed and what they actually did in real life it was only when someone tried to significantly change the status quo that whites became alarmed it is largely the same today there is on the other hand a revolutionary force in america but it is a force locked within itself because it has been and is alienated from its own powersthe powers of violence i am referring to the black massesthe ignorant impoverished unrefined bottomrun negroes in the south and in the black ghettos of the north these are the final people historically anywhere in the world the only power the masses possess is the power of violence or the power which is the threat of violence the black masses constitute  per cent of the negroes in america these are the people america will ultimately have to deal with these are the people that negroes the liberals and middle class orients will have to deal with these are the extential negroes beause the negros struggle tenus to be institutionalized on every level and in all respects the masses of colored people are largely excluded from receiving any of the gains that middle classoriented negroes are now making this is true in all but a few isolated instances one notable exception was the montgomery bus protest movement when the deal went down allnot one or two or a fewall negroes rode the bus in montgomery they still do on the other hand take birmingham the masses of negroes endured the water the dogs the brutality of the mobs when the deal went down they had nothing concrete to show for it but their scars i believe two negroes got jobs and one lunch counter was desegregated the birmingham situation is not the exception but the rule until the violence of the masses of negroes or their potential for violence is felt throughout the nation there will be no negro revolution we will be experiencing a revolution when civil economic and human oppression in a very concrete way is lifted from the lives of the black masses but this will involve much more than just a black revolution it will be an american revolution whether one describes the current activities of negroes as the negro digest december  civil_rights movement the freedom movement the negro upheaval or by any other phrase is not purely a question of semantics there is something going on there is a great deal of activity a tremendous amount of noise since there are peopleblack and white who refer to all of this as the negro or black revolution it is not enough to show that they are in error one has the responsibility of trying to understand what the term means to the people who employ it in relationship to what is actually happening and most of all one must unearth why people are using this term when its real meaning does not apply to the situation it was around  that louis e lomax negro reporter and author published an article called the negro revolt in one of the better slick magazines the article was then made into a book published under the same title largely the revolt that mr lomax was talking about had to do with the younger generation of negroes revolting against the older type negro leadership the young predominantly college enrolled negroes sitinners were thumbing down on the orthodox leaders as being too slow and conservative and they were beginning to take things into their own hands a new militancy developed the term negro revolution seemed to have come into prominence subsequent to lomaxs book revolt    revolution as time passed and more and more negroes took to the streets the term began to appear in the white press with mounting frequency i believe also that the cuban revolution had a suggestive impact upon all americans especially white americans so that the term slipped into the press to describe what negroes were doingalthough quite unaware of the psychology involved and to be sure although there was a world of difference between what castro did and what negroes were undertaking to realize this is to see clearly what the white press either consciously or unconsciously was and is doing in labelling the activities of contemporary negroes as the negro revolution the whole thing begins to make sense a pattern begins to emerge american white people tend to view anything the negro does to achieve his freedom as being revolutionary it is at once a fear reaction a sort of racial reflex response in lieu of protecting their dominant position and a conscious or unconscious attempt to illusion the negro so that he will not really become revolutionary if negroes can be made to think they are being revolutionary they will become satisfied with what they are getting or will become illusioned as to the exact nature of what it takes to really make them free and what it is really like to be free when one or two negroes as a consequence of mass demonstrations sitins liedownins and so on receive employment as construction workers in a very real sense for whites this is an ex ample of the negro reflation negroes rhapsodized by masr media and perhaps by the intoxicating effect of assuming a collective consciousness are lulled or excited into viewing their behavior also as the black revolution another factor which lies behind the rhetoric of the negro revolution is sensationalism five years ago judging from the mass media one would have had difficulty saying for certain that negroes lived in america except for rapists murderers thieves and other criminals today the news about negroes dominates the media radio television newspapers magazines everything at last the negro is commercial the black gold rush is on so much is being published about the negro that one simply cannot keep up with it all life time newsweek look saturday review harpers saturday evening post and on down the line the publishing houses are rolling the stuff out i will hazard that during the last five years more negro material has been published by the american press than in any other twenty years taken altogether most of it is little more than garbage but who cares it sells noticeably the new york times began to carry much more news about negroes shortly after its west coast edition flopped there has been no other time in the history of publishing not even during the leftwing s that so many negroes have gotten into public print as during the past five years many of these negro authors do not even profess to be writers whites also are exploiting the unprecedented commercialism of negro subject matter in fact there is an underground animosity developing between negro and white writers despite the negros superior knowledge of the subject whites seem to be cashing in on negro material with much less difficulty from publishers reviewers and the public than most negroes hollywood has made black like me written by a white man into a movie nobody to my knowledge has dared to film ralph ellisons invisible man with reference to the socalled black revolution itself whites are infiltrating the movement wherever there is a negro sitin wadein prayin or any sort of protest or demonstration whites are to be found among the ranks at least onethird of the marchers on washington were whites even the black muslims whose attitude towards whites is unmistakable are plagued by caucasians clamouring to join them i know there are some white people who are genuinely dedicated to the cause of freedom i also know there are too many whites who are aligning themselves with negroes simply because they have a pathological craving for attention and publicity many whites are downright jealous of the attention negroes are currently receiving via the mass media they join the movement because i am afraid they negro digest december  have no other means of acquiring recognition i am reminded of a young white man who is or was an official of a brooklyn chapter of core the young man was brought into court tried and given a short sentence for civil disobedience he sat down on the floor of the court room and refused to be moved the judge advised him to leave or be charged with contempt the white zealot refused to budge and called the entire court including the judge members of the ku klux klan growing impatient and peeved the judge added ninety more days to the sentence whereupon the zealot went into a tantrum and had to be dragged from the floor of the court he received plenty of attention the next day his name appeared in the new york papers and his face over the television networks since it is now receiving more publicity than at any other time in history the negro movement in two many instances becomes a bandwagon for white crackpots and misfits this is equally true of some negroes who incidentally are playing revolution they are jumping on the bandwagon there occurred an incident in harlem where some negroes were picketing a small restaurant owned by a puerto rican working there were one negro dishwasher in the rear and threeskinned puerto ricans up front the negroes were demonstrating to have a darkskinned negro employed up front unknown to the  public there was some fuss as to who was the leader of this demonstration there were two preachers contending for leadership they were at each others throats suddenly a policeman informed one of them that he had to move his automobile that was when the newsmen and television cameras converged upon the second leader i watched him on television he knew his picture would be in the papers he knew his statement would appear in the press he was so aware and proud that his face was being televised i made an observation that man should not have been the leader of that demonstration any more than ross barnett should have been the governor of mississippi there is some question in my mind as to whether the demonstration should have been or not yet i wonder in as much as barnett was the governor of mississippi then that porkchop preacher should have been the leader of that demonstration dead water an dead sand contending for the upper hand as long as the dispossessed masses of black people remain dispossessed as long as the american establishment does not provide an avenue through which the ignorant utterly depraved portion of the negro and white community can realize a sense of personal dignity and social worth in terms of the humanity of man it will go on it may never end at the present rate before it gets better it will get worse  the sensationalism and commercialism of the freedom movement serves to obscure what is really happening there is some progress being made how much and where it is all leading is difficult to say also no one knows or has tried to discern what all of this is doing to and unleashing in the emotional chambers of white southerners mississippi for instance is now a virtual nazi state awaiting the final solution no one as far as i know is preparing for the worst between blacks and whites in the south and north except the cops and the racists we are too busy being sensational and making money why it remains to be answered at this particular time in our history is the negro so commercial in the media why does the black revolution seem to be the most saleable thing that is happening in this country without bringing in the international situation which limits whatever analysis one might make there seems to be a news deprivation an excitement vacuum in america which the current negro upheaval is filling secretly we are on pins and needles waiting for the next headline the next radio announcement the next bloody photograph in the tabloids waiting for the televised barbarity between blacks and whites to boom into the boredom of our living rooms obscenity this is what we are reduced to i suggest that it is not horror that we feel when we see in the media black men and women being maimed in the streetsit is prurience the pornography of black and white bodies clashing together to wit most americans especially whites perceive the intermingling of negroes and caucasians as something extremely lewd to witness it acted out via the mass media not in love but in hate and violence constitutes a vicarious ecstasy of the most depraved nature before me i have the new york times on the front page is a photograph of white men in st augustine florida beating a group of negroes with bottles and sticks what has come over us i am a negro and i will not submit m body to that kind of twisted pain if i were white i could not participate in that form of orgy let me make one more observation about the black masses as they relate to the socalled negro revolution at a new york rally shortly after a white minister was accidentally killed by throwing himself down in front of a bulldozer during a negro demonstration in cleveland ohio malcolm_x refused to declare a period of silent prayer in reverence of the ministers death a white man from the audience had suggested the period of silence malcolm_x refused to honor the negro digest december  request he stated that unnumbered negroes have been and are being murdered and nobody has offered up a prayer for them while this is not altogether true malcolms attitude had a tremendous effect upon the audience most of which were bottomrun lowerclass negroes they leaped to their feet and cheered i discovered something during that rally malcolm is apocalyptic his words are brute concrete secular and he communicates with the masses whether you or i like it or not he can become the most followed negro of our times he has an anticharisma that recriminates radical whites and middle class negroes and he electrifies the common masses here are his words in a merica  whites go around with the attitude t am white in the sound of their voices in the essence of their beings  it is impossible for a white person to believe in capitalism and not believe in racism  you cant talk this negro revolution jive to me when youre not ready for it when the deal is down most of you arent malcolm_x is the only negro who talks like whether he is or not a real revolutionary meanwhile drew pearson is calling dick gregory and adam c powell too radical he says that whites are forming a solid block against negroes and that negroes are losing understanding and sympathy from whites in the north as well as in the south the white backlash precisely it can be this kind of attitude among other things that might bring an abortive end to the current stage in the freedom movement unless one is insane he hopes it does not come to that nevertheless it seems as if drew pearsons attitude or was it an observation is the growing tendency among more and more whites and i fear we will not become sufficiently aware of the meaning of what is happening inand tous until it is too late the current struggle constitutes the precipitating stage unless we do something now one way or another to free those millions of blacks whom i have spoke of as existential negroes there may not be a revolution but there will definitely be armageddon
psychoanalysis revisited
the thunder of the helit g copter landing on the r rooftop of my office buildin§ sent me div  ing headfirst under my desk as papers scattered in all directions a lot of people think that those of us in the psychiatric profession dont have our own little fears too but im here to tell you that we do and the thought of having an airplane land square on the top of my skull is mine ill bet it gets a rise out of you too anyway i didnt even peek out from under that desk until i heard the sound of the skylight opening and saw this guy making his way down this ropelike ladder thats aheh hehpretty dramatic way to make an entrance i said sheepishly crawling out from under the desk get right to the heart of the thing i always say the stranger answered no need pussyfooting around hung up in all that automobile traffic so i fly my own plane did it in world war ii still an air corps reserve man i see i said and began picking up my papers and shuffling through them i trust you have an appointment i cant seem to find your name here do i have an appointment hah ive had an appointment for two weeks thats impossible i said ive been booked up for a month we psychoanalysts are busy people nobody could have made an appointment with me in the last two weeks you think not he snapped you hired a new receptionist two weeks ago didnt you well who do you think slipped her in here she worked in an appointment for me first thing thats the way i operate get your own people in first and thenwham as he spoke his arm came swooping down upon the desk with a bang so loud i dropped my papers again i paused for a long moment to study my visitor he was tall and squareshouldered with an indian arrowheadnose set in a tanned face topped with silver hair his voice was tight with a western flavor and he had the cool clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth i waved him to the couch and switched off the overhead fluores cents then i switched on a small lamp near us conserve a little electricity i remarked ah a conservative eh i like that he replied well now i said when we were both settled whats your problem the world is my problem he snapped russia red china vietnam social security medicare civil_rights the cold war the hot war yes yes i interrupted in a patient tone these are trying times in which we live and i can understand your concern but in the hour or so we have together today let us just discuss your major maladjustment or in the argot of the layman whats bugging you oh he said and i could see his manner slowly beginning to change as if he werent so sure of himself ohwell you see i have a feeling that a lot of people dont like me well i said slowly persecution complex huh i know how it is seems like some days everybody is against you its nothing to worry about we all go through that now and then and its just no no you simpleton he shouted i dont mean in just an ordinary sense i mean literally thousands and thousands of people dont like me many of them even seem to be afraid of me and its important that people like me millions of them have to like me as he talked i thought i saw a tear form in the corner of one eye well now thats a little ambitious isnt it i said to ask that millions of people like you i mean nobody has millions of friends look you jackass he snarled i didnt come in here to listen to a bunch of liberal platitudes i want some hard answers and i want em quick what are you headshrinkers anyway a bunch of pinkos or are you just too lazy to go out and earn an honest living ill bet if we defoliate these downtown office buildings wed turn up a bunch of you guys i could see he was getting pretty excited and talking a little irrationally so i tried to calm him down a bit psychoanalysis is dangerous work you know i mean if a guy goes off his nut right there on your couch and starts swinging you can get clobbered let me get you a drink of water i said after i managed to calm him a little i walked to a water cooler at the corner of my office took a paper cup and pushed the button nothing happened hah hah i laughed weakly with embarrassment ill bet i forgot to pay the water bill again and theyve cut it off im kind of forgetful about that theyve cut off your water he asked incredulously getting his hackles up again why id never stand for a thing like that if i were you id get a couple of marine buddies and march right down there and turn that water back on i dont think that will be necessary i said ill just put a check in the mail to them tonight all right coward he said lets get back to your problem i suggested why do you think millions of people should like you because i know whats good for this country he declared besides im a straightshooter and im for home mother flag and the buffalo nickel they dont make buffalo nickels anymore i said you see he shouted thats whats wrong with this country nothing is the way it used to be weve got to get back to basics but times change i argued nothing stands still like the commercial says progress is our most important product or in the words of president johnson shut your mouth he screamed and for a moment i thought he was having a stroke look i said who sent you to me anyway or did you just pick my unlucky name out of a phone book a friend of mine recommended you he said quieting down some short darkhaired little fellow was in to see you about a month ago he was having these hallucinations sometimes he would get to thinking he wasif you will pardon the expressioncolored oh that one i replied i remember him well but dont tell me you are getting that kind of complex too no you silly bastard he shouted i told you what my problem is for some stupid reason people dont like me sir i said adopting a very formal air i can understand your concern and i realize that you are a paying customer while i am only a poor servant of the people nevertheless i do not feel that you need to conduct yourself in this hostile manner i find your attitude belligerent and your language reprehensible he gave me a cold stare namecalling in the pursuit of a competent analysis is no vice he declared and scampered back up his ladder
tribute to a freedom fighter
thr ee courageous young men were viciously murdered this summer while fighting for freedom a nation grieved their fate and so did i on sunday august  i attended funeral for a young man named wayne yancey who also died while fighting for freedom but a nation did not grieve there were however those of us who did he didnt die from a bullet and his death didnt bring any headlines but there was something as dastardly in his death as in the deaths of the other three wayne yancey was a yearold negro volunteer in the mississippi summer project he was killed in a headon automobile collision august  in red bank mississippi while carrying out a project assignment i find the details of his death rather insignificant and i suggest that a speeding automobile was only a symbol of what really killed him he quite like the other three fell victim to a very sick society a society which preaches brotherhood and principle while practicing bigotry and intolerance might very well be symbolized by a speeding automobile both are extremely destructive i met wayne several months ago while working on civil_rights projects in chicago we never became close personal friends but we worked in the movement together and we conversed from time to time in march we were among a group of chicagoans who attended the sncc conference in atlanta and together we talked about the forthcoming summer we intended to spend in mississippi now so suddenly it seems wayne has  passed on from this challenge i known as life to that unknown that »awaits each of us now i am left with impressions of the young man and in his death i have discovered that i knew him much better than i realized during his life this to me says something of life and lifes final act  death and my impressions of wayne seem to reveal something about my people about my country and about this humanity to which we are indebted by the very nature of our breathing wayne yancey exemplified the victimization of my people by this society which has so long tolerated racism he often talked about his past and the things he hoped to do in his future one of the most poignant memories im left with is his having said to me in atlanta in march again back in chicago and once again on the night before we left oxford ohio for mississippi that after the summer in mississippi he wanted me to join him and a few other fellows in a civil_rights project in a town called paris tennessee he used to say its a small town and in a few weeks we can really shake it up i knew wayne traveled a lot engaging in rights activity and consequently i made no special connection between him and the small town in tennessee and so on sunday august  i went to paris tennessee and there learned for the first time that wayne was born and raised in the little town he wanted me to help him shake up this young man who had actively participated in the struggle in chicago new york atlanta and mississippi hadnt forgotten the place where he first learned the bitter lessons of being black in this country he hadnt forgotten the little town where he was introduced to the mental lynchings we have all endured during our struggle against oppression although the little town was no longer his physical hell it somehow stood between him and freedom and such seems to represent the very cruel psychology this nation has forced upon black men and so i went to paris as wayne had asked but my journey was premature and my mission was not the desired one we went to paris tennessee to bury a young man whose existence in this world was far more honest than his surroundingsa young man whose words to me so vividly portrayed the alienation that once engulfed him wayne left paris tennessee a few years ago finished high school in chicago tnd struck out against a society which had deprived him the same society that killed him in the only way he knew he joined a gang in chicago and allowed his anger his hate and his frustration to flow but he never stopped searching and he found something he could truly identify with something that would give his life a meaning society had prevented it from attaining he found his road to the manhood society systematically denied him and seemingly intended for paranoiac reasons that he should never have yes he found the freedom movement and there is no doubt in my mind that the movement did indeed become his life he chose a gallant way of living with his anger his hate and his frustrations and he enabled himself to control his feelings while finding the courage to go about making a better life for himself and others this was his alternative to destroying himself yes he rose above many adverse situations he became a man by the very fact that in his short  years he discovered a way to contribute to a society which had disparaged ostracized and punished him from his very beginning siipply because he was born black yes black men must pay special dues to this society and wayne paid more than his share he was aware of and concerned about the evils in this society and although he died trying to help it i must ask was society aware of or concerned about him i am somehow afraid that to society he died a stranger i find great significance in the circumstances which brought wayne to that fatal moment and i assert that his presence at that scene represented his struggle for not his freedom alone but for yours mine and all mankind i insist that he died for that which killed him and consequently we stand indicted i am assured that we are indeed a sick society shall be sick until we look at rrfen like wayne yancey and begin to face the reality that each of us every human being on this earth is equally importantand just as equally unimportant when we are delivered from this sickness we will then be indebted to men like wayne yancey iy the end it is only we who can insure that he did not die in vain my last thoughts of wayne are what i believe in my mind and what i feel in my heart i believe he was a black man who only a few years ago felt there was no hope for him and his people in this country i can only hope that he died believing that there is hope just as i believe there is at last no in his death there were no headlines no fanfare and very little said or known but in his death in his life there was a certain greatness that we must attempt to understand and learn from im certain that in that great unknown wayne was embraced by andrew goodman james chaney and michael schwerner and somehow i could hear them saying to wayne welcome brother 
the supre me race
race is a haunted word bloating with pride burdened with suffering clouding the reason of commoner and ruler alike it is also a term of biologic science in its latter potency it lends a flavor of objectivity to statements about innate race differences invented for political and economic purposes popular race concepts lag far behind current progress in the fields of population genetics and physical anthropology now human groups can be evaluated in terms of qualities with clearcut inheritance these new and forthcoming facts cannot be dismissed as troublesome they may not fit into our view of equity but they remain unyielding facts of nature and we had better try to understand them ageold race concepts founded on skin color stature facial traits and hair characteristics seem to fulfill some primary requirement of classification a central african pygmy would soon be recognized as a stranger among eskimos of alaska the differences are real and easily recognized  turning to details we find an enormous variation within geographically defined populations some europeans rise above the stately nuers of eastern africa others are short or actually dwarfed often enough short parents have short children all of us can easily remember the stubby parents of some rangy friends though stature has some heritable basis we must turn to the extremes to discern simple modes of inheritance thus chondrodystrophic dwarfs in marriages with persons of normal stature have normal and dwarfed sons and daughters in equal proportions nobody would come upon the idea of referring these dwarfs to a pygmy race some thirty per cent of all europeans cannot taste dilute solutions of phenylthiourea at least one fourth of the brothers and sisters of a tasteblind person reveal the same deficiency we would not classify them as belonging to a tasteblind race why not are we reluctant to refer a fixed proportion of a persons brothers and sisters to a different race we need a definition now turning to webster we find race defined as a division of mankind possessing traits that are transmissible by descent and sufficient to characterize it as a distinct human type let us admit that defective bone formation with resultant dwarfness is insufficient to characterize a race negro digest december  we can dismiss the tasteblind race on the same ground but questions of this type whether classification grounds are sufficient or not meet the scientist today in his study of physical anthropology two hundred years ago men were conveniently black brown red white and yellow but hindus and north europeans with their different hues shared the classification as whites or caucasians a subdivision seemed reasonable but it had to stop somewhere if every shade of pigmentation served to separate a specific race we would meet such absurdities as several races within the same family of palefaced tawny and dusky europeans the number of races would soar rejecting color as the sole racial division line physical anthropologists turned to such traits as hair texture proportions of head and face form of eyelids and shape of nose long skulls came together on the museum shelves with separate sections for round and intermediate skulls such criteria cut across the ancient race line then the anthropologic classification resorted to clusters of traits among europeans tallness goes with a blond complexion and a long head a nordic race with these characteristics may have existed but never in pure form when people from northern and western europe are compared with inhabitants of the central parts of the continents differences are observed in stature body proportions and head form a rough distinction between northwest europeans and an alpine type may be accepted on such grounds similarly an east african population can be set off from the majority of the sudanese people using pigmentation hair form and series of measurements physical anthropologists have defined some thirty different races no observer of human diversity can easily free himself from the question why stop with  races we could add some geographically welldefined groups and get a round number of  perhaps  racial groups could be named or  let us return to these questions a little later armed with new facts now we accept the anthropometric division of mankind as convenient if somewhat arbitrary it is founded on sets of traits generally of a  graded character sufficient to characterize fairly distinct human types in addition these traits are transmissible by descent but how what is inherited we do not inherit long legs what we receive from our parents are series of genes that control growth one set of genes interact to form a long and slender build other genes combine to check growth and produce a stocky figure genes are chemically active sites in molecules of known composition they form us during early fetal life they pilot our vital pur  poses they fix our natural life span accidents called mutations change single genes to dodgers such as the mutant gene responsible for chondrodystrophic dwarfism in this case a single gene profoundly affects growth an exceptional situation what has been said about growth and stature holds in the case of skin color series of genes are at work producing varying amounts of pigment in skin hair and eyes exceptionally one distinct gene mutates and produces when it goes with a similarly changed partner gene the general lack of pigment called albinism both these abnormalities dwarfism and albinism are easily analyzed growth is stunted by one mutant gene inherited from one of the parents the coloring matter of skin hair and eye falls short when another mutant gene is inherited from both parents otherwise the graded characters studied in classical anthropology are determined by syndicates of genes of unknown number sure enough such inheritance is accessible to its special kind of analysis in view of the general and fervent interest in skin color it seems rather remarkable that pieces of main importance are indeed lacking in our knowledge of pigment genes it is certain that we can measure and classify people without resort to distinct gene differences if we limit our analysis to graded characters we discard however our most powerful tool for weighing the gene content of human populations we carry a maximum of two counteralbino genes in each ordinary cell some people have one plus the albino gene the rare albinos carry two albino genes only thus close to  per cent of all sites for this gene in north americans is occupied by the normal counteralbino gene and the rest sevenperthousand is the frequency of the albino gene such statements would be void of meaning but for our potent tool the stability rule under random mating if marriages are contracted without regard to the presence or absence of a certain gene its frequency remains constant from generation to generation we cannot apply this rule to shades of skin color but it tells us something about the chances of marrying a carrier of a single gene for albinism they amount to the double product of the two gene frequencies we have to count with normal and albino thus unobserved carriers of the albino gene come  to a thousand or almost one and a half per cent how can we use such knowledge a parent of an albino intends to marry a second time with the risk of onein to wed another carrier of the albino gene this is true if he does not marry a relative if he marries his first cousin the risk that she is also a carrier amounts to one in eight he should know that in this case he runs close negro digest december  to nine times the normal risk such calculations have been applied to many diseases caused by mutant genes when the inheritance is recessive as in the case of albinism the risk that the first cousin of a known carrier is also a carrier never drops below one eighth or  per cent the frequency of unknown gene carriers can on the contrary vary considerably in the general population when different abnormalities are compared in the case of albinism it is of some consequence that marriages are not contracted entirely at random in the meaning that anybody can wed any person of the opposite sex some observations point to a higher frequency for the albino gene in some intermarrying groups than in the general population of the u s now we are back to our first problem that of characterizing human groups obviously gene frequencies lend a specific meaning to such classification when they account for differences in disease predisposition to characterize populations we need common genes such as those responsible for the blood groups here we can calculate gene frequencies the genes a b and o alternate on a specific chromosomal site and all of us belong to one of the four blood groups a b ab or o today all major populations have been examined with respect to  blood groups striking differences occur thus american indians largely lack this gene in eskimos its frequency comes not much above one per cent in china and india on the other hand the frequency of the b gene amounts to twenty per cent while such differences may have as we shall see a profound biologic meaning two points must be stressed first the same genes occur in all populations though their frequencies vary in small groups like pure chippewa indians the b gene frequency actually sinks to zero secondly a person cannot be referred to any race on the ground that he belongs to a certain blood group we note such differences without neglecting the agreements eskimos and egyptians have about the same frequency of the a gene with the study of gene frequen cies physical anthropology won a deepening insight into the composition of human populations the rh blood group system with a chromosomal site different from that of the abo system soon proved useful in anthropologic work and now a dozen systems have been used in the course of this genemapping of the continents five major races were distinguished they fitted roughly the old concepts of american indians australoids caucasoids mongoloids and negroids this way of characterizing races has flaws it fits some major geographic regions but only roughly so the basques in northern spain and southern france are caucasoids but endowed with extremely low b and high rh negative gene frequencies they seem to be the remnants of an early european population gene frequencies reflect historical and prehistorical events thus the b gene reaches eastern europe with a broad front of high frequencies diminishing through central europe but still distinct from a low frequency in western europe the great invasions the migrations of nations and the social intercourse with neighbors resulted in extensive outbreeding and reshuffling of genes careful evaluation of gene frequencies defined no pure white race the study of blood groups has shown that men are brothers under the skin whether they like to admit it or not recent improvements of chemical analysis have revealed striking differences in the minute composition of blood proteins the latter include the haptoglobins serum proteins capable of combining red blood pigment the first mapping of human populations revealed that one gene in this system hp  occurred at a rate of about  per cent in europeans increased to  per cent in some west african regions from a generally high frequency in africa and was rather low in asia the haptoglobins and several other newly detected serum protein differences fit the concepts established by the blood group techniques thus differences do occur between roughly defined major populations these differences are mainly quantitative populations differing with regard to gene frequencies major races are not pure as long as we have been close enough to exchange blows and wares we have turned over genes this new anthropology armed with improving methods for the study of gene differences tends to disclose an increasing number of inherently distinct groups within nations and geographically defined populations again we meet differences in percentages rather than inequalities between individuals such minorities may establish their divergent gene frequencies by chance fluctuations in very small original groups or by settling as immigrants among foreigners whatever its origin the diversity tends to be maintained as long as marriages as a rule are contracted within the group the lapps in northern scandinavia constitute a minority with distinct gene frequencies here the relative isolation is due to traditions language and nomad life the mabaan people of the upper nile province sudan look and speak like their neighbors the dinkas nuers and shilluks but they differ in blood groups in this case a wide wilderness separates the mabaans from their neighbors negro digest december  scores of similar instances are known we may add different jewish groups with their own gene frequencies and religion together with customs and environmental attitudes as the more or less rigid boundary line gene differences between indian castes have to do with agelong social demarcation all these facts add up to an unavoidable arbitrariness when it comes to defining a race anthropometric traits could release a rather unhampered subdivision of populations if they were used for race criteria now we meet much the same situation when we apply gene frequencies let us remember that human nature is too rich and varied to be caught in any meshwork of artificial definitions it is true that neighboring groups differ slightly and distinct groups decidedly many students of human diversity hesitate to designate the small inbreeding groups with distinct gene frequencies with the loaded word races are all differences in gene frequencies due to chance and diversity in origin no anthropologists have long been aware of the possibility that some such differences are adaptive one population meets other conditions of survival than the inhabitants of a climatically different region it was thought that body build and skin color were the end results of the cruel winnowing by hardship in past generations today some wellfounded doubt meets the thought that any gene is without advantage or disadvantage when it can be observed in alternate forms genes which seem good under some conditions may be bad under other circumstances one striking example of the relative value of a mutated or changed gene is presented by the s gene in the hemoglobin series the coloring matter of our red blood cells hemoglobin occurs in various genedetermined forms of which only a is unconditionally normal in adults when both parents carry the hemoglobin s gene in a single dose onefourth of their children develop a severe blood disease sickle cell anemia as these children do not build families the gene would slowly disappear or almost so new mutations tend to keep the frequency of a detrimental gene at a low but constant level in many african populations however the hemoglobin s gene is quite common this is true of peoples in tropical africa where subtertian malaria is or until quite recently was of permanent occurrence millions of children and adults in these regions carry the hemoglobin s gene in a single dose rendering them resistant against the parasite plasmodium falciparum which causes the predominant form of malaria in these regions this was the first wellestablished form of inherited superiority in geographically defined populations  in north america the gene for hemoglobin s is decreasing among the descendants of africans of no advantage in regions free from malaria the gene is tapped off through early deaths of doubledose carriers thus the superiority bestowed on africans is sustained under special environmental conditions only recent investigations reveal that the hemoglobin s gene follows the distribution of the falciparum parasite rather than nationality outside its broad belt of high frequency across tropical africa the hemoglobin s gene occurs along the mediterranean shores on the arabian peninsula in southern india and northern thailand the relatively high hemoglobin s gene frequency does not set off an exclusively african malariaresistant race the s gene in one of the two hemoglobinregulating chromosomes produces a moderateand in malaria regions beneficial quantity of the special blood pigment when it occurs in duplicate the hemoglobin s gene kills its bearer thus any people with a high rate of this gene pays for its survival with a high child mortality if the hemoglobin s gene conferred an unconditional advantage it would in a limited number of generations establish itself as the normal gene this is nowhere the case no people in africa or else where can claim a general biologic supremacy still could my people not be endowed with a series of distinct if relative advantages in a biologic sense yes much forthcoming experience points decidedly to this possibility valid for any people let us remember that extreme hardships and an uneven struggle for subsistence fell to the lot of most people a few generations ago existant high level equilibriums between gene frequencies are remnants or symptoms of this struggle for survival as a tribe or a people often at the cost of the individual a possible symptom of presentday adjustment appears in northern ghana with its peak incidence of hemoglobin c this chemically distinct hemoglobin seems to be limited to the peoples of west africa and their descendants on the caribbean shores and in the u s the search for new cases of balanced selective forces was greatly stimulated by the discovery of a connection between malaria and hemoglobin s in mediterranean countries thalassemia an inherited hemoglobin disorder has a remarkable peak distribution in recent malaria regions the same holds good for a certain enzyme deficiency of the red blood cells cradles of the malaria parasite in southeast asia hemoglobin e occurs at a high rate and seems to offer some advantage to the heterozygous gene carriers the wellknown blood groups negro digest december  a b ab and o usually occur at such frequencies that even the rarest of them cannot be maintained by new mutations in other words we seem to be forced to conclude that the common blood groups are at the play of beneficial and harmful forces that balance each other the actually observed increased risk for ulcers in the stomach and small intestine of persons with blood group o is only a forerunner of so far very fragmentary information there is no lack of clues however and much more will become known about the influence of blood groups upon health vigor and longevity when it comes to mental traits our measuring devices are at the very best comparable to the yardstick such measurements can be used for genetic analysis but not for the calculation of gene frequencies the essential problem here consists in the sifting of cultural and educational factors from biologic endowment the latter consists for all we can grasp with a thinking tainted by biologic experience of the universal human blend of strengths and weaknesses when analysis arrives at primary mental abilities some of them may spell conditional advantages transformed to handicaps in other surroundings on a cruder level every human group has its bullheads some of whom if winds came colder be loved for their staunchness we all have to make the best with what we have got under present conditions it is illboding for any youth to come out with the idea that his lineage has supplied him with an innate superiority or inferiority whatever his race may call itself it has supplied him with genes tens of thousands of which are common to all men he also has genes perhaps scores of them that are more common in his own people some of them may confer a conditional advantage he may find his way to use it from a biologic viewpoint race grants very little and dooms to nothing in its immense and sightless power nature has culled survivors from groups with varying degrees of genetic diversity some of these survivors have remained in their original surroundings keeping up a precarious balance with beasts and plagues and droughts among them on the outskirts of progress we may find what would correspond most closely to the idea of pure races the unfathomed dynamics of the present population growth and the subtle powers of the everchanging terms of modem life will mark the emerging populations in a way we can hardly predict our hope for a future meeting us with sudden and extreme hardships or alluring ease lies in the great diversity within all major populations of today whatever comes some gene combinations will empower their bearers with endurance and uplift earth will always belong to the supreme race the race of man

after the funeral when buddy and ernestine got home and she had kicked off her shoes they punched a couple of cans of beer and sat negro digest december  around for a long quiet time they were thinking about jamie and it seemed right when a person had just been buried to think a lot about them to think thoughts hard enough to last because they wouldnt ever come to mind like that again jamie had been born right there in harlem and had almost never gotten out of it he had grown up therefirst in the one furnished room with a hotplate then the two rooms then the four rooms on the second floor where his mother and father moved when the old man had become foreman he grew slowly and he grew quieter as he grew up he was a slim small boy for his age when he was fourteen and he ran hard and played hard and played hooky when he could and could get away with it but he was too quiet for his age and it wasnt just a timid quietit was a sullen caged quiet that bothered people he got under their skins when his eyes just stared at them like a dumb and furious animal and he was speechless they used to mock his tight mouth that only grew tighter into a mean pucker under his dark wide eyes the kids who played with him used to mock him until when he was fourteen he swung a baseball bat at one of them because the boy had mocked him and then he ran home with his eyes still dryly soberly mad when they found out it wasnt a skull fracture but only a large knot on the boys head that would go away the boys parents dropped charges against jamie but jamies parents were tired anyway they were tired of the oppressive heat and airlessness tired of their lives and helplessness tired of jamies dark fits of silence and the black sullenness of his pride tired without hope they decided he should spend the summer with an uncle down south and they sent him it m was the first time he had been outside of harlem he didnt stay a summer he stayed a year he stayed although his mother wrote him and told him how lonely she was and how nicely his room had been arranged with all his baseball pictures on the walls and his father wrote that his allowance would be raised he stayed until he was almost sixteen and then he came back to harlem to school again they went downtown to meet him and they almost didnt see him when he came up the ramp from the trains he was older and taller and thinner than ever and his face with its smooth long cheeks drawn toward his narrow chin seemed less mobile more confirmed in its sorrow than ever he stood there awkwardly in a too small suit that still managed to sag unhappily everywhere a cardboard suitcase bulging in one hand as the crowd about him turned away his mother dragged his lean hard ribs to her bosom and his father shook his hand and then they just stood as though waiting but it wasnt long before his mother looked into his eyes and saw what was missing it was that mean darkness that had troubled her heart like a stiff fog and it was gone he smiled then and it rolled back his lips from dull close teeth they saw his hand slide into a pocket and then saw a glint of silver as he raised it to his mouth but they didnt recognize the mouth organ until he blew the first hoot upon it a hard gusty chord that burst in their ears with a sensation like plunging into the silent pressure of water and the liquid jovial ragtime notes poured at them in a talkative challenging flow as he danced a little jig in front of them it wasnt just that the silent resentful pride had left him that was only a part of the truth and then only the negative part what mattered was that he had found a voice he had found it somehow during his year away and the hard uncertain things that had struggled in inner darkness struggled no more his parents soon found out that jamie and the mouth organ were already inseparable he was no more talkative than ever and his mother came to accept the harmonica as before she had accepted his silence but where she had loathed the brooding silences of her son jamies mother came to listen for jamies mouth organ on the stairs its tempo telling his mood lovingly as though it were in fact his voice its facile eloquence had beguiled her it was a colorless object now dull characterless except for the life the brightness or dark moody blues that jamie blew into it it was a barometer that registered every change and pressure and his parents listened at the closed door of his room as the random chords recorded and charted the unembarrassed weather of his soul negro digest december  a year passed a year of school of homework of regents the cold drab city blocks pasted with a grey winter slush then warming with the drop and glassy shatter of icicles the flush of water down papermatted gutters finally spring and the small budding of isolated saplings on the city street and the heat beginning to press the tenants onto fire escapes roofs the broad sidewalks where an endless procession of tireless children played the mouth organ had been lusty and imperishable it snorted and roared all the husky jazz notes that it held that it had caught swelling upward from jamies breast and the jangling strings of buddys guitar on the roof with him accompanied that was when buddy had first known jamie and had known him well and close as two boys can only be perhaps for a summer buddy was the one friend they had made jamie and his harmonica he was jamies age but already he played the guitar with the leisure and insouciance of precocious age they played in their own passion and the urgent sharp harmonies leaped above the blocks of grey indistinguishable buildings rutted by the narrow lanes of butting autos they mingled with many dark nights with clear air above the close greasy apartment smells with many white stars some that dripped like bright celestial tears down the dark face of the night buddy was the first one to mention bringing girls up to the roof one night the organ swooned barked sardonically but buddy could remember with the bubbling expanse of beer inside him that there had been another sound in the instrument a nervous quaver like a quickened pulse like a giggle too and the first girl came it was near the end of summer in the first steaming days of september that buddy brought ernestine one night up to the roof she popped out through the door ahead of buddy and buddy said i brought ernestine you know ernestine dont you jamie shook his head with a disjointed snatch of a pop tune loosed from the organ i was in your math class this spring she murmured jamie nodded an acceptance a slow smile before ernestine sat beside buddy and buddy bobbed his head meaning to begin the night had still been dusk when they arrived as the darkness became complete the stars brightening ernestines head drooped upon buddys shoulder and the guitar quieted became a subdued rhapsody no longer taciturn and apart but with a tremulous muted concern after awhile jamie felt urged away from them as the guitar strings sunk to a whisper over which the voices of buddy and the girl mingled endlessly he got up with a boastful strut of dixieland that took him to the roofs edge where he watched the streaming lines of traf fic in the streets below but irresistibly the bravado suspired from the organs voice sinking toward a husky seeking blues the guitar strings idled but from the hand cupped over jamies mouth a flood of insistent notes lapped at the nights distance seeking in its darkness something more when buddys guitar shattered his solemn melody with a sudden raucous clatter jamie turned to the couple leaning together over the guitar it rang with a loose jarring refrain a bitch crying buddy called it and jamie fell silent before it it was not until he went down to bed and lay on his back waiting for sleep in the sweaty blackness that he pressed the line of square holes against his lips which parted over the salty silver of the casing and blew a tune softly so softly like an echo returning to its source spring had come again a climactic spring before he met julie like ernestine she had been in his class all semester and one day she had spoken to him in the waning days before graduation he had not even known until one of those now infrequent times when he and buddy stopped to talk in the halls between classes that she was vicepresident of the senior class and he had forgotten it again for months when she was waiting outside of his building one morning of the last week of school he found out that she lived in the next building his parents heard the new moodiness of the mouth organs refrain the restless agitated whine of it which came and went between odd jumbles and snatches of melody as though a constant struggle toward order were being waged and lost and mourned they bought jamie a new suit for graduation because the one job that his father had found for him he had mysteriously indifferently lost and he still had only an allowance and they saw him take the diplomalooking very handsome they thought if he would only smile and go back to his seat one hand thrust desperately into the pocket of his jacket the girl next to him smiled too warmly too proudly at him for his mother not to elbow her husband and incline her head although they did not know her yet especially did not know she already considered herself engaged to their son but then jamie did not really know that either yet howd he ever take up with julie anyhow i never heard him say more than two words to anyone all the time i knew him except to you and then all you talked about was music i dont know buddy said i guess it just happened jamie wasnt bad looking you know the girls all noticed him for his looks they just forgot about him after awhile because he didnt talk like the rest of us he never had anything to say to them julie was different though you remember julie you couldnt stop her her parents hadnt stopped her with their warning of her silent jobnegro digest december  less suitor and his parents hadnt stopped her with their confidences about their awkward and unconfiding son and jamie himself hadnt stopped her with his remote privacy isolated behind the medley of the harmonica jamie told me he used to be quiet and not talk because somebody was always talking and nobody listened so he played and everybody knew what he was trying to say then and when they stopped to listen he could feel that he was saying it good julie had told buddy right after the wedding but i didnt listen i didnt let that stop me so i got through to him and he had to hear whether he wanted to or not she had bridged the flood of sound and had chipped away at the flinty silences until he had given her his class ring and then she had chipped some more you should hear my mother and his folks they act like hes already married to that harmonica they think itll drive me nuts theyll see they think hell never hold a job theyll see she had said and she had chipped some more and they saw graduation had changed things it sure did ernestine said she had kicked off one stocking and was rolling the other one down but she was thinking of something else she was thinking of how jamies father had gotten jamie and buddy jobs at the factory and how that summer she and buddy had gone steady and then they were engaged and how jamie and buddy had joined a little jazz combo downtown and buddy had saved money and quit the combo and married her and how buddy was now a foreman himself but buddy was remembering something else that summer hadnt been like the other summer when he and jamie had first met they had graduated in june and before two months were up julie had married jamie and somehow they werent friends anymore without anything having come between them after the combo had finished for the night and waiters were tossing chairs about stacking them he would cross the floor on the way home and jamie would be sitting there he just sat and he didnt seem to see anything with his head cocked like he was listening but there wasnt anything to listen to but the scuffle of polished wood and the tinkle of glasses being shelved behind the bar hey boy your womans waiting for you he used to say and sometimes he would get a drink from the bar and bring it over and sit with jamie in the dark club but jamie never finished a drink and he had nothing to say he would finger the harmonica and turn it and sometimes he would hold it up to catch the remaining light in the dim room and tap it but whatever he expected never came out and he used to shake his head like a bewildered man and looked at buddy with his empty eyes get some  sleep boy see you in the shop tomorrow buddy would say not long after that ernestine had talked buddy into dropping out of the combo it was long hard hours and it wasnt getting them anywhere and maybe if there was a break later he would go back they gave him a party after his last show with them only jamie left before it was over buddy hadnt seen him go he had seen him sitting to one side in the smoky shadows of the club after it closed fingering the harmonica and then he had looked again and the chair was empty still sitting back from the table with a lighted cigarette on the table edge burning over an inch of ash buddy had already gotten his promotion so they didnt see each other in the factory anymore and they no longer called each other after work so he hadnt seen jamie again for a couple of months until he took ernestine down to the club he was surprised when he heard the combo they were never exciting the way reviewers called the more modem combos they played somewhat oldfashioned jazz but they played it well usually and those that liked to hear traditional jazz came back often to hear them but they were off and all at once he knew that it was jamie who was playing away from the group and he had never heard him off before not even when they were teenagers on the roof and that was when he realized something that he had known all the time but hadnt thought about before that even before he had quit jamie had stopped playing the organ to himself after each performance he would sit endlessly fingering the instrument without once bringing it to his lips time and again he would examine it as though it had become strange before his eyes it was no longer identical with him and he seemed to watch it with an evermounting sad suspicion buddy had even asked him why he looked at it so curiously i have to work with it he had said it doesnt say everything it cant say it all in another minute he had said julie cant hear it thinking about it buddy hadnt wanted to stay around to say hello to the combo he and ernestine had sat far back and had left early after that they heard that the club had replaced jamie and then they only knew of him from time to time when ernestine would come in with a rumor he had picked up a habit julie had someone on the side she was pregnant he had hocked the furniture she had miscarried he had lost his job and gone to lexington he was dead they had believed it when they heard he was dead even before they called julie the other things had been too incredible they didnt believe them they had nothing to do with the sad powerless shadow of a man they had known who only listened and played as though he were some secret keyhole through which an inner world revealed its jubilation and regret they had known for a long time that he was dead he had died in the memory of those who had known him like lights disappearing at night into the dark face of a tenement and finally they had the rumor and then the solemn black tuxedoed stranger with hollow grey cheeks in the shrouded box in the undertakers parlor to confirm it there was a knock on the door and buddy put his feet down off the chair seat when ernestine opened the door julie was standing there looking very pretty and carefully composed still in the black dress from the funeral she came in with an unsuccessful smile and sat down quickly on the edge of a straight chair buddy and ernestine waited a moment for julie to move to speak she seemed so precipitously arranged that she might fall to pieces at any moment then buddy stretched for the refrigerator handle and asked have a beer no thanks her rejection was quick and tidy what can we do for you julie ernestine bowed solicitously above her she looked up i wanted you to have this she said blankly to buddy she reached into the black purse and extended a small parcel shrouded in a womans handkerchief buddy unwrapped it and held up the tarnished harmonica for me i thought    you used to be such close friends    when you used to play the guitar i gave it up just when i had about given up hope ernestine said folding her arms warmly about his throat jamie never gave that up till the day he died id rather not keep it buddy decided abruptly and offered the harmonica back to julie who looked at him surprisedly with a stare as though she had been betrayed it wouldnt be right anyhow it was like a part of him like an arm or leg i wouldnt want to have it around maybe it shouldve been buried with him ernestine interrupted irrelevently he went at that thing like a baby to his bottle i tried to wean him julie said  tried god knows i tried and she slowly shook her head he could have made something of himself he could have been somebody if he would have put down that damned    thing well theyre separated now she said still refusing to take it back it should have been right there in the coffin with him buddy insisted again he gave a last look at it and slid it into the pocket of his shirt i remember jamie saying that when he played he was like a genie going into a dark blue bottle that the sound just bottled him up and then he was okay because nothing could touch a genie in his bottle no one could find it very funny though they tried to smile and after that there wasnt much any of them had to say finally julie rose from her tense perch and said she was anxious to get home and change she was hot and she left buddy opened another can of beer and then he took out the mouth organ and fingered it revolving it slowly between the thumbs and forefingers of his hands he laid it lightly against the toughness of his lips and blew a faint harsh buzz escaped and faded in the humid air a fly buzzed about the damp rings on the table he started to smack the fly with his hand and then he thought of the fly stoppered in a little blue bottle flailing uselessly toward some outpost of his tinted vista and his mind seemed to close over jamie for a moment he forgot that he had been thinking about him he put the harmonica on the table edge and the fly rose and droned away into another room unzip me ernestine said her back turned to him
utomtomism or the bigoted assumption that african culture is intrinsically sexy savage and sinister portrays the dances of black africa in terms of myths the first myth envisions seminaked savages leaping and hooting by firelight in celebration of unspeakable rites of sexuality this hollywoodabetted image what are they saying asks deborah kerr of white hunter stewart granger while together they witness a supposedly erotic bit of african choreography in king solomons mines finds expression sadly enough even in wellintentioned writings on tropical africa but real african dances are not sex dances although occasionally they may turn rabelaisian for reasons of humor or social satire traditional africans normally dance several feet apart from each other and regard our method of embracing while we dance as indecent another myth imprints the common mind with a notion that war dances are important south of the sahara a misconception that probably tells more of the civilized white mans fascination with and inability to avoid warfare than it does of choreography the wardance myth would find apparent corroboration in two dances recently presented at the african pavilion at the worlds fair one zulu the other burundi in fact something like marte moritors description of watusi dancing flashes in the mind of many americans when they try to imagine what african dancing is like eyes defiant they rush forward as if carried by a single wave wildly shouting while stabbing an imagined foe then drawing back and again leaping forth how silly this might seem to say a kanuri of northern nigeria whose social dancing elegant and precise as a minuet has nothing to do whatsoever with martial intent finally the third cliche notion beloved of certain american cartoonists introduces the ferociously attired witch doctor in paraphernalia stemming from melanesia if anywhere who stamps and postures above an ailing patient lying prostrate on a mat lightyears removed from this point of nonsense are actual african medicinal dances on the mainland opposite the island of zanzibar people used to dance a round implausibly called pepo in which the patient himself not the shaman danced out a search for relief from neuritis and neuralgia with gay movement that resembled a simultaneous rendering of the shimmy and the samba we in the west are only now beginning to explore the legitimate therapeutic properties of dancing especially in the field of psychiatric disorder  hopefully these uncle tomtomist stereotypessex war and jujuwill dissolve as an increasing number of subsaharan dances become known in the west as a natural consequence of the triumph of black nationalism the ballets ajricaines which brought the good earth of the republic of guineas folk dancing to the usa in the early sixties actually represented the merest indication of more to come as one of the most choreographic continents on earth wakes up to its deepest cultural potential no fewer than three pavilions at the worlds fair offered or will offer african dancing at the african pavilion one could witness exciting choreographic episodes from the ivory coast east africa and other places practically every hour on the hour in tropical africa the highest art form is the dance comparable to the place of symphonic music or architecture in our own culture writing in the twenties about the southern parts of nigeria ethnologist p amaury talbot was emphatic indeed amid the tribes of this region the dance may be taken as the chief method of portraying and giving vent to the emotions traditional africans know this of course as evidenced by the amiable boast of the kaleda dancers although all signs point to the capital importance of the dance in africa mention of this esthetic activity is almost entirely omitted from no less an authority than the international african institutes ethnograhic survey why perhaps because of the relative unimportance of dance in western european culture anthropologist james h howard admits candidly most ethnographers ignore the dance completely as something beneath their consideration howard suggests that one ought to accord the dance at least the same importance as it is given by the people you study by that criterion every working monograph on an african society ought it seems to me to indicate something about dancing until americans are exposed to frequent reports with critical focus on african choreography uncle tomtom with a leer on his face and a spear in his hand is likely to play havoc with the intellectual issues the dancers of the ivory coast zululand burundi sierra leone and guinea currently raise at the worlds fair for the eye is notoriously subjective and the uncle tomtomist sees only what he wants to see this is so pervasive a problem that when one dance troupe came to the usa from africa the press found nothing more substantial to report essentially than in which cities the girls were allowed to dance with bared bosoms and in what cities they were not how urgent is the solution of this problem very for the dancers of africa are already features of the worlds fair uncle tomtom not only downgrades authentic materials but negro digest december  grants wide latitude to african and afrolatin phonies as well thus at least one american negro has donned nigerian robes memorized a few ethnic beats mostly from haiti culled from lps and chanting africa with a short american a beguiled teenage safaris by afternoon and adult safaris by night into believing they had just made contact in a nightclub with base line african music then enter his dancers throwing their respective pelvises in all directions grunting and stamping and posturing sexily with a touch of interpretive via india with these and other problems in mind i have attempted to write a brief sketch of some of the more salient aspects of african dance one hopes that these suggested traits will serve as grains of sand around which the intelligent amateur of african dance can spin at the fair the pearls of his own appreciation here they are  apart dancing it is worth noting reported monsieur f de kersaintgilly in  that in negro africa man and woman never put their arms around each other while they dance as we do in france this puts a finger upon the key characteristic of west african dance suppose we call this trait apart dancing by which is meant that although two or more persons may dance facing or beside each other contact is rarely established and never prolonged observe for example the ivory coast traditional dance called digreba at the fair a young female dancer heavily painted with kaolin and splendidly attired in rattles a necklace of large beads loud yellow raffia bra and cloth skirt dances among equally colorfully dressed young men but they never form a couple each dancer remains a separate entity and acts for the most part independently of all others a far cry indeed from the european embrace dance part of our culture from the moment we learn the foxtrot which seems to have evolved from the sixteenth century drehtanz turning dance in central europe almost from the beginning this remote ancestor of the american teenagers cheektocheek stimulated the invectives of organized moral indignation thus stubbes in his the anatomie of the abuses in ailgna  for what kissing and bussing what smouching and slabbering one of another what filthie groping and uncleane handling is not practiced in those dancings by contrast for what chaste distance one from another is not maintained in the ivory coast digreba at the african pavilion the association of dance with sexual proclivity is a largely european problem what dance bigots refuse to recognize is the impertinence of this preoccupation when applied to subsaharan dance tradition wherein man and woman if they dance in the same company at  all always dance apart from one another when we watch the ivory coasters and remember that three basic traits of couple dancing in the west are linked or embraced position synchrony of movement and limited body english ours eyes are primed to savor the complex implications of african apart dancing the apart dancer as it were unlocks his arms from the european embrace and gives them back to the dance his torso is equally liberated this sets the stage for the second basic trait of tropical african dance  total body movement when the zulu male dancers perform at the fair at times all of the muscles of their bodies seem to be used incessant wavelike ripples activate their shoulder blades arms and backs even the zulu women when seated in a dance vibrate their bodies from the waist up amidst a rich mosaic of song offbeat whistling and a marvelous female vocal effect called ukuyiyiza to incite people to defend themselves or as a sign of happiness total body dancing is handsomely attendant in the negro new world one scholar finds that the whole body is used in afrobrazil courlander describes gross direct movements in haiti and the wittiest report of all marshall stearns has portrayed one especially vibrant united states jazz dancer as a oneman laocoon doubtless one of the most accessible repositories of the africanism which links in spirit not genetically new york to zululand is spanish harlem mambo thus in the early sixties practically every wednesday evening at the palladium on broadway one could observe earl lovell a brooklynborn negro rattling his shoulders waving arms bent at the elbow shimmying his kicks in short activating most of his body this parceling out of dance rhythms to every part of the physical frameso evident in the work of the female dancer of digreba at the fairis the choreographic equivalent of the west african musical trait of dominance of percussion there is a lot of percussion and several meters to get around in west african music listen carefully to the musician on filin gbe a giant drum from bouafle country in the ivory coast at the fair and it will become clear he is playing a different time signature against the meter followed by his confreres on smaller drums the body cannot absorb all these meters in the feet as in the foxtrot or even in the arms and legs as in the highland fling but must interpret them through the head shoulders hip and torso too  dances of derision clearly the dancing at the fair is a mere sampling and one element of african dancing that i sorely missed there was the dance of derision choreographic equivalents of the african song of allusion a form of social control whereby a soloist or negro digest december  a group sings about the pretensions or misdemeanors of an individual to make him literally face the music and inspire him to behave or recognize his fallibility are one of the most striking practices of tropical africa kaigh calls them dances of domestic oddities and found them among the zulu of south africa they dance after any event white or black which takes their fancy i have seen danced imitations of myself and party too veracious to be flattered or even comfortable after i had lost a steeplechase by being thrown from the horse my boys danced the accident so faithfully that i came away a sadder if not wiser clown the boy who took the part of me was most embarrassingly accurate as to detail these boys had danced a sly dig at their white master announcing in dance movement a sabotage of the myth of white supremacy pride and pretension are as much a target of the west african as well as south african zulu dancer as they are of the singer one wishes the zulu at the fair would dance a satire of some of the sunburnt tourists from darkest america who push and crowd about the dance pit at the african pavilion and smirk at what they see the colonial authorities of northern rhodesia were clearly aware of the purpose and force of the dance of derision or so chapter  section  of the laws of that area implies no person may organize or take part in any dance which is calculated to hold up to ridicule or to bring into contempt any person religion or duly constituted authority dances of derision have been reported across the face of west africe from mali where they have been described as satires in action to the capital of the nupe people in the northern region of nigeria now and then the young men will imitate with comic exaggeration a typical womens dance or caricature the walk and gestures of women this specific tendency may well have given the jazz dance some of its special flavor thus leadbelly the famed negro blues guitarist was also expert at countrystyle buckandwing clog dancing in one number he would imitate the gait of all the women of shreveport high and low pete seeger whether dreamt up in negro america or in nigeria these satires in action refer back to apart dancing as the key to understanding it is wellnigh impossible to poke fun at your partner or her dance by any means other than vocal when you are tightly locked to her in western embrace position my friends at the african pavilion tell me that they know several satiric dances and may incorporate one or two into their presentations before the fair is over next year  posture one of the most frequent postures of west african dance is a matter of moving according to harold courlander with the feet flat on the ground the knees bent and the back swayed the female dancer of digreba at the fair is an almost classic demonstration of this point when she bends her knees and dances about with flywhisks in either hand there are other postures in african dance of course but the bentknees swayedback mode is certainly prevalent at least on the guinea coast thus an american if he wants to look for substance instead of smut at the african sierra leone guinea and sudan pavilions at the worlds fair can look for apart dancing total body movement dances of derision and typical posture all of the dances are apart dances and all activate the human frame in ways that demand great precision and wit in the corporeal exploration of polyrhythmic music with as professor paul bohannan tells us the head moving in one rhythm the shoulders in another the arms in still a third the torso in another and the feet in still another africans have evolved one of the most remarkable art forms on earth
the folcroft incident
the young man had t f  y been married for four   z years before he decided to look for a new home his daughter terri lynne was two years old and horace baker  a technician for the radio condenser

people on heather road had also lived for years in the ghetto areas of philadelphia while they had been growing up in sagging brick tenements negroes had begun moving into their neighborhoods a home an apartment a block at a time there were good and bad negroes and they went to school with them and heard their parents curse them they fought with them and spawned a hatred for people with black skinswhen these people grew up and began to have families of their own they saved money until they could move into the suburbs they came to delmar village and breathed the fresh air and created an allwhite community where there was no black skin to remind them of the slums when they did see a negro their out their old hatred sometimes in obscene children heard and also expressions came and learned to hate now the negroes were coming again thought delmar village it was fine for the church to preach that was its purpose but the church did not know what it was like to live with niggers a

front wall go home niggers thursday morning august  the bakers attempted to move into their new home a cursing rockthrowing crowd estimated at five hundred persons threw yellow paint at their car and

patrolmen werent going to be niggerlovers when the crowd grew into a mob of close to  the state police were called we just cant handle it alone said chief myers its out of hand its being caused by outside influences outside agitation said mayor mcvicker the boroughs  pm curfew for persons under eighteen went into effect and the jeering swearing demonstration was cut in half early friday morning the damage to the bakers home was completed when a bottle of flaming gasoline arched through an upstairs window a sudden early morning shower discouraged others in the crowd and folcrofts fire company

to work come home and try to keep our home and property as clean as humanly possible said horace baker if we cannot live up to a challenge like this we will have no place to go the bakers were ready to move on the morning of august   a glazier sent by a baptist church in philadelphia appeared with the first sunlight and replaced the first floor windows at  heather road some groups of teenagers shouted at him for a while and then talked among themselves of what would happen if the bakers tried to move the rumors said the bakers would come to the village at  am the glazier cut his hand taking  out the broken glass state police were now entirely in charge road blocks sealed off all entrances to the area to keep out the curious major singleton schaeffer commandant of the th state police district surveyed the already growing crowd of informally dressed demonstrators and turned on his heel the major was dressed in civilian clothes and was smoking a pipe he was going to let the sun burn some of the anger out of these people an naacp leader william cecil moore president of the darby area branch criticized major schaeffer for the four hour delay of the bakers claiming the trooper was not a policeman but a politician it was a day full of resentment the troopers and their major though undermanned because of the labor day holiday and almost overwhelmed at one point later in the evening did an excellent job their first program was to gain the respect of the crowd they did this efficiently by snuffing each point of friction as it appeared during the long hot afternoon they refused to give an inch there was a healthy fear of the troopers by the time the bakers arrived members of a local naacp chapter approached a roadblock and were told not to enter the area they wished to stage a counter demonstration a peaceful strike im afraid there wont be anything peaceful down there said a state trooper at the barricade the crowd at heather road was restless someone was passing out copies of an american nazi party publication the stormtrooper numbering about eight hundred as the arrival time approached the gathering had the appearance of a harmless community outing a family entertainment children played in the street running among the legs of adults standing there teenage boys sat on the hoods of police cars legs dangling and wives with their hair in curlers pushed baby carriages up closer to the center of the festive excitement so they wouldnt miss anything as always when there is any kind of audience to appreciate humorless slang humor adolescent toughs shirts unbuttoned and tails hanging over pegged trousers put on a spirited verbal rebellion against authority the troopers and this time they had the approval of their parents there were women agitators also their shrill complaints were half for the benefit of their neighbors and half for the stern impassive faces of the troopers a slender woman arms folded across a pink blouse hair in curlers delivered all of the following in one continuous burst of indignation you wouldnt want them living next to you now would you they come in and right away make it like trash i wouldnt never mind a nice clean white man but i dont want niggers i hate them i know youze aint niggerlovers you just got a job to do but still i dont see negro digest december  no black state troopers the police moved restlessly alert in their grey uniforms only occasionally turning their backs riot sticks dangling from their wrists a trooper walked slowly down the long line of jeering young faces and in each hand he carried a blackjack a pile of rocks bottles eggs and vegetables was collected on the lawn in front of the bakers home as the crowd was searched for anything that might become a weapon later on students from crozer seminary in chester and ministers from several local parishes came silently to protest the demonstration and to welcome the baker family a stone glanced off one of the new windows and a fresh round of eggs splattered against the walls the five members of the clergy moved up the terraced lawn and stood in front of the threatened home to face the jeering swearing mob the barrage continued five state troopers went into the mob and pulled out one man forcing him into a folcroft patrol car driven by chief myers if you take that man chief youre out of a job you a niggerlover too the car

know what the hell theyre doing said a trooper none of it made any sense it was getting late in the afternoon and uncomfortably warm there was a reporter from the pennsylvania guardian who had a full beard as he stood beyond the line of state police with the other  members of the press he suddenly became a communist agitator and a niggerloving pig a housewife pointed out this fact to the others and they took up the cry communist agitator you can smell that pig from here senator mccarthy must be smiling in his grave said the reporter it still works none of it made any sense it was almost  pm and many of the demonstrators had tired of waiting then all the troopers were given lastminute instructions major schaeffer had given the goahead more troopers came down heather road using their cars to force the crowd out of the street and onto the sidewalks someone leaped on the hood of a moving police car and four troopers burst through its doors and carried him into a waiting police wagon major schaeffer cleaned his glasses and walked the length of the now howling seething mob looking for another candidate this was it there could be no mistake this time or someone would get seriously

neighbors the bakers walk up the cement stairs to their new home accompanied by phillip savage director of the tristate naacp isabelle strickland president of a local chapter and t s clements a baptist minister the white clergymen who have been waiting at the door of their home greet them and shake hands they enter as a hail of stones and vegetables bounces from the walls outside people have come like locusts running calling to each other in the excitement filling the street and the alleyway next to the home the bakers are at home five minutes later the only two whole windows in their home are gone in ten minutes the rear window of their car hit by two bricks is shattered into dust and chrome  strips are pulled from its sides the police meet violence with violence pulling a teenager from the crowd and pushing him into the car which is waiting for him look they got new furniture the black bastards hey scum can you hear me in there its just a matter of time wait till the troopers leave we want freedom in only a few minutes a bored audience of  has become a dangerous mob of almost  troopers are hit by bricks coal cherry bombs eggs and saliva what we shoulda done is put the women and children right out in the street to block them off thats what the niggers do we shoulda planned this a lot more said a raging little woman who then turned back to the matter at hand and continued to shout niggerlovers at the top of her voice there are some calm voices who do not share in the hatred right now i am ashamed to say i live here said mrs arlene crecco a resident of the village for five years me and my husband dont see eye to eye on this but im disgusted at what theyre doing to their children said mrs crecco when they start to teach kids like that hatred where do they draw the line thats what id like to know she said a trooper took a hunting knife from one of the toughs two delmar village wives walked away from heather road all the bakers furniture was now

per unit have risen as much as  and higher there have been no new incidents since the  disturbance the moving van left and troopers braced themselves for an exhausting evening the afternoon of waiting in the sun had weakened some of the mobs anger and many threw their remaining curses at the greyuniformed cordon and returned to their homes for the evening meal it was friday and the smell of sea food was in the air all a them is on the side of the niggers explained one particularly furious little woman who had offered periodical bits of opinion all during the afternoon this time she referred to members of the press still clustered on the bakers lawn and theyre all trying to brainwash every one of us you me everybody she told a trooper every time you look in a paper or turn on the television what do ya see or hear about niggers thats what they talk about giving them rights and freedom but at the same time they take away all of our rights that barnett is right weve got to fight all this brainwashing look at the niggerlovers theyll m never tell our side of the story how would you like to be married to that one said a trooper shes been out here screaming all afternoon a long night was about to begin for the bakers darkness came bringing fresh courage for the demonstrators early in the evening the crowd reached full strength more than one thousand angry and curious people as the fury of the bottlethrowing mob reached its highwater mark major schaeffer called for all the help he could get at midnight it subsided leaving the lawn in front of the bakers home covered an inch deep in broken glass and garbage p  james mosley a white senior student at crozer seminary in chester who was among the clergy who drew the crowds anger by their presence in front of the bakers home stayed with the bakers during their first evening at home he helped sweep away the debris saturday morning no i dont think any of us were afraid mosley other ministers phillip savage and the bakers  but they did get awfully close to the house i had begun to wonder if the police were keeping anyone away said mosley at  saturday morning  troopers arrived to reinforce the  deadtired troopers already on duty what remained of the mob was told to return to their homes twelve mounted troopers trained in handling riots were dispatched to patrol delmar village streets we kept our sense of humor through the whole business during the night we thought up more crazy jokes than dick gregory will think up in ten years he said yeah said savage if the negroes started a campaign to buy burial lots in allwhite cemeteries the civil_rights theme song would change from kwe shall overcome to we shall undertake  vjrf  it is the day after glass is being swept from the floors inside  heather road mounted policemen lift children onto their saddles and give them rides as they patrol the long lines of row houses the man stands on his front porch and sees the litter on his lawn the screen door will have to be replaced up the street children are running in the early sunlight soon he will bring his own daughter to live here when it is safe the next step is to go along with life said horace baker the tension and hatred that did all this will die down in time no insult no intimidation no threat no nothing will make me leave he said troopers came up the stairs bringing food to the embattled couple

digest december  tion of ours has the right to select the home of his choice said protestant and catholic pastors to their sunday flocks in the afternoon  male home owners of the village met and issued a statement saying that they deplored the violence of the demonstration outsiders were to blame but that they planned boycotts of any business which serves or deals with the bakers we do not

first time since moving to the village they also brought terri lynne home to live with them it was safe reporters at the incident took a long look at the character of the rioters they make me sick said a cameraman they make african tribes look pretty good from here i think you might be wrong said an old reporter dabbing at a stain on his shirt where he had been hit by an egg theyre out there right now making my good opinion of them look bad but their only real sin is a lack of imagination of intelligence this makes them try to find answers in a hurry through violence he said another tv editor took the pipe out of his mouth to agree sure he said give people just like these some good cause and watch them then they go without food and sleep and money to dig two guys out of a mine cavein the fellin mine near hazleton pennsylvania but he added tell them they have a chip on their shoulders which many of them do or quick tempers and theyll knock out half the teeth in your head to prove how mildmannered they are the sad thing is that theyre out here throwing rocks and garbage because they dont understand said the old reporter  one last observation on thursday august  after the bakers had made a first attempt to reach their new home a postman walked through the mob carefully sorting a handful of letters he glanced at  and then crossed the street easing the strap from his worn leather bag further up on one shoulder someone called his name and he nodded except for that no one seemed to notice him at all but when you think about it whats so unusual about a colored mailman i have a dream said the reverend martin_luther_king
