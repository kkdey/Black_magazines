the frustrated masculinity of the negro male
there is a saying that the only people free in america are the white man and the negro woman while this is true only in a special sense it does point to the simple fact that negro men are extremely frustrated in playing the masculine role this leads to a psychological effort to compensate for feelings of inadequacy by way of a struggle for conspicuous masculinity many cloak their deepseated feelings of inadequacy in boldly masculine garb and mannerisms for example while only eccentric white males and old west villains wear mustaches the mustache is widely sported by negro men this spotlights their visible contrast with women more than a few negro women for their part will say that they dont want a man without a mustache tassled shoes umbrellas and earmuffs are regarded as feminine within the lower class although this now is waning to some extentwhat with the adoption of the continental and ivy league look the bouncing jitterbug walk and the bluffing demeanor of negro males is still another aspect of the quest for conspicuous masculinity while white men think nothing of crossing their arms or legs as a gesture of refinement negroes typically spread their legs and lean forward ever so slightly to achieve an effect not open to women wearing dresses and skirts then there are the masculine epithets such as man stud a stallion jack a male mule cat lion or panther and the like to suggest a masculine ferocity they long for but do not have women are accordingly given less ferocious  labels such as babe and chick this does not include broad which apparently has come down from slavery days meaning a negro slaves wife owned by the master of another plantation and called an abroad wife the frustrated masculinity of the negro male also is apparent in the extreme suspicion of homosexuality among even the most normal of men thus the negro man who plays the classical piano or dances the ballet is likely to be called homosexual much more so than in the case of white men a negro man with the refined bearing of rock hudson would be viewed with suspicion or regarded as queer much of this is realistic anxiety for it is true that negro males are frustrated in the effort to play a male role before the coming of nonviolence in racial discord with its relative safeguards against resisting white mobs negro women and children were typically sent in men hung back apparently then rushed in after the situation was underway witness rosa parks who sparked the passive resistance movement autherine lucy first negro to enter the university of alabama ada lois sipuelfisher first negro to enter the university of oklahoma in a nonsegregated capacity and daisy bates who stood up to faubus along with the little rock nine now that the pattern has been set and the ku klux klan tamed negro males have become more reckless although one wonders what they would do without constance baker motley of the naacp legal staff and gloria richardson militant leader of the cambridge maryland protest this is in contrast to the cultural expectation that men should be the aggressive guardians of their women and children yet in some deep south communities negro males cannot even preserve the sanctity of their homes from invading white suitors the fact that the negro man cannot protect his family presents a special problem to the negro male psychology negro women can and often do rationalize wed get our rights if our men would face up to the white man negro males on the other hand have no one on whom to project the blame rather they are likely to internalize the contempt held by their women who have two national organizations  the national council of negro women and the national association of colored womens clubswhile negro men have none as such witness the incident in chicago during the summer of  when a group of  negroes having obtained official permission to use calumet park which then was regarded as white were stoned by  white teenage boys most of the men present ran off leaving four teenage boys and the women and children to fend for themselves on an individual level one irate worn an complained that her husband pretends to snore whenever she must arouse him from bed to check some mysterious noise downstairs say in the kitchen similarly negro males are frustrated in the effort to play the role of provider this is illustrated in the fact that a major tenet of the  black muslim movement is to restore the male to a respectable position in their families women are expected to obey their husbands and relinquish some of their power in the family group men are bound in turn to a struggle to provide for and  protect their families while there is some doubt that the muslims are successful in accomplishing these goals it is true that in muslim services unlike many christian churches which are disproportionately filled by women and children men do dominate the conduct of church affairs   but the fact remains that negro men in general are impeded in the role of provider they are more likely to have their salaries outstripped by their women census figures for  show that considerably more white males than females are enrolled in college  percent to  per cent this is not true for negroes where  per cent of the males were enrolled in college against  percent of the females even if a negro male does go to college he is more likely to wind up in a nonprofessional occupation while considerably more white males than females are professional the reverse is true for negroes needless to say there is often a strain between the nonprofessional negro male and his professional wife he may resent her professional associates while she may reject his nonprofessional friends the nonprofessional husband may feel sensitive to the professional status of his wife in contrast to his own and she may feel the need to apologize for him before her professional friends even those negro males who go to college and work in professional capacities are most often pushed into the traditionally feminine occupations of school teacher and social worker beneath the college rank high school women graduates may get clerical jobs in the white collar category and feel a prestige not accruing to their blue collar mates thus many negro women ex  press the belief that a negro man cant do nothing for you financially or dont know how to treat a woman such women pride themselves on the possession of white sponsors who pay their clothing bill or the rent the negro malethey feelis minus the masculine prestige contingent on the ability to provide luxuries and satisfaction for females the paramount importance of the occupation to the males selfrespect has been pointed out by harold finestone see cats kicks and color in identity and anxiety ed by maurice stein and arthur vidich thus some reject work altogether and turn to pimping as a compensatory exploitation of the female but this is counter to a culture which expects the contrary only many persons mistakenly point to the negro males success in sports as an indication that negro males possess superior masculinity but this is not necessarily so such theorists may be overlooking the fact that the athletic field may be especially attractive to individuals who have a need to spotlight or showoff a conspicuous masculinity professor kirson weinberg of chicagos roosevelt university made a study of professional boxers for instance see the occupational culture of boxers american journal of sociology  and found among them young men who were called sissie in childhood or who originally had femininesounding names one individual decided to learn boxing because his sister had grown tired of taking up for him much of the viciousness of welterweight champion emil griffiths fatal fight with benny kid paret was said to be the result of hostility generated at the weighin when paret patted griffith who also is a designer of womens hats on the buttocks and called him a woman in spanish the lynch mob also has helped to exaggerate and spread the myth of the negros superior masculinity yet only one out of six lynch victims were even accused initially of rape see arthur raper the tragedy of lynching sex was merely used as a pretext by angry white mobs even so there is an old theory that many negro sex offenders are acting out their frustrations especially when the victim is white one negro simply walked up to a strange white woman in a chicago elevator and hit her in the mouth he explained that he simply had an irresistible impulse to bop her not to rape her and did not molest her sexually although many a man has shared this urge toward women of both races the point is still conceivable another who raped a negro girl said that he had always been too shy or meek to approach a woman in the usual manner but this has not offset the myths and jokes among whites regarding extreme or animalistic sexual prowess and equipment attributed to negro males it has helped to make the negro male an object of curiosity to more than a few white women but in turn has been utilized by white supremacists to salve their guilt regarding their easier access to negro women in the deep south see john dollard caste and class in a southern town at the same time the white supremacists develop fears that their own weird tales may contain some element of truth the next step naturally is to try to stifle or minimize the masculinity of the negro male in actuality sometimes even by outright castration john o killens author of a novel about negro men at war and then we heard the thunder was no doubt aware of this when he had a woman character tell the hero solly the one thing they will not stand for is for a black man to be a man and everything else is worthless if a man cant be a man
the myth of the white backlash
currently editors c columnists and commentators are making much of the socalled white backlash against the civil_rights movement they argue with uncommon unanimity that the stiffening resistance of white people against negro demands as exemplified in the large vote for alabamas segregationist governor in wisconsin indiana and maryland represents a significant loss of sympathy among whites for the cause of equal rights the assumption supporting this proposition is that there existed prior to the eruption of school boycotts sitins lieins stallins and the ascendancy of negro militants a great store of sincere goodwill toward negroes on the part of most northern whites and this is almost  per cent pure myth if such goodwill did exist for negroes among northern whites then how was it manifested was it translated into activity designed at lowering racial barriers against negroes in the norththese are important questions for the key to the nature of the whole crisis of civil_rights in the north lies imbedded in the answers and yet these are questions few of the editors and analysts are asking the simple fact is thathad such goodwill been prevalent among northern whitesthere would never have developed any need for boycotts and demonstrations and the moderate and responsible negro leaders like roy wilkins of the naacp would never have been eclipsed by the extremists if northern white people generally favored equal rights for negroes then there would have existed no racial barriers in the craft unions no nonnegro hiring policies by many industrial firms no practice of keeping negroes in menial jobs in those firms where they are hired no exclusion of qualified negroes from middleclass or white residential areas and therefore no allnegro schools with facilities equipment and instruction demonstrably inferior to that in predominantly white schools those who argue insistently that negro militance has hurt the negro cause neglect to offer convincing evidence in support of their argument it may be that such evidence is in fact quite small and difficult to come by it is even possible that the argument is used largely as a club with which to discourage the growing nuisance of demonstrations viewed from the negro side of americas racial wall the proposition that there is a white backlash against the civil_rights movement takes on the character of a particularly insidious canard just what are these proponents of the white backlash theory up to anyway are they genuinely concerned that white sympathizers with the negro cause may abandon the struggle or are they attempting ever so subtly to blackmail negroes into submission surely any honest observer of the civil_rights scene who is capable of even moderately accurate perception must know by now that the white community tends to act in favor of negro rights only in the face of concerted negro pressure rare indeed are the instances where white authority bows to the principle of total equality of the races on its own initiative it is true that northern whites are reacting with some vehemence to the disruption of the status quo but are those who interpret this as a backlash unconsciously equating the status quo with the conditions of amiable race relations to negroes it would certainly seem so many of the whites who now are claiming disaffection with the ne gro cause because of some excesses on the part of some civil_rights activists or groups are actually revealing their own latent condescension prejudice and intolerance they are in effect seeking to punish all negroes for the behavior of a few negroes which is precisely the excuse southern racists have always employed now these people may proclaim themselves friends of negroes if they choose to but it is extremely unlikely that negroes have ever thought of them as friends this of course is another way of stating the dilemma of the liberal many whites who think of themselves as being friends to negroes would be embarrassed to read what amounts to a description of themselves in a book written by enlightened virginia aristocrat lewis harvie blair back in  directing his words to those fellowpatricians who protested that they were gentle and helpful to negroes lewis harvie blair wrote in a southern prophecy but we forget that our kindness to the negroes proceeds from the standpoint of condescension and of assumed caste superiority and we expect it to be received with humility and from a feeling of acknowledged caste inferiority and if not so received by the negroes they are thought impudent and impertinent and the foundation of our kindness dries up the cause of justice and equality is either right or it is not and if it is right it does not become wrong because of the behavior of some individuals or groups concerned with it to say to negroes that their cause is just only so long as they behave in a way to deserve equality is not only to insult negro citizens but it is also to ascribe to white people precisely those powers over negroes which no citizen can have over another in a free society the point is that those who are defecting from support of negroes are those whose support was only token to begin with not only do these whites who believe in real equality still give unqualified support to the cause they also understand how and why many negroes are resorting to extremism these white people are not racists which is to say that they do not assign human rights and values according to race and therefore they are able to put themselves in the negros shoes and having done so they know that nothing short of death would prevent them from insisting that they have the same rights and privileges as all other americans and looking at the prowallace vote in wisconsin indiana and maryland from this viewpoint it is possible to be cheered rather than depressed by the results if wallaces pull of onethird of the vote really means that this proportion of the people oppose negro equality then it also means that the other twothirds are willing to accept negro equality indeed if the vote means any such thing it amounts to a great victory for the cause of equal rights in those two states personally however i am not so optimistic what the country is finally facing are the consequences of its own timidity hypocrisy and neglect americans in no section of the country have ever been subjected to any intensive coaching in the honoring of negro rights quite the opposite has been true and even some conservative observers are getting around to admitting as much in a recent column in the chicago daily news john m johnston wrote nobody who reads the papers should be surprised by the wallace phenomenon it was not by oversight that a hundred years have gone by without spelling out the privileges of citizenship for negroes as is now being attempted in washington indeed it was not i suggest that when the full impact of the meaning of the negro revolution dawns on white america the vote in favor of states rights and against government interference will be even greater than that recorded in the recent wisconsin and indiana primaries for negroes are in no popularity contest and they are not asking for tolerance negroes are insisting upon their rights as free citizens furthermore it is highly unlikely that negroes will be impressed by the endless admonitions of moderation and pleas for restraint directed at them by whites white people have been telling negroes to wait for their full rights for over a hundred years in fact it is precisely because negroes failed to insist upon their full and equal rights in the north that many of the racial restrictions now prevailing came to harden in custom many people believe for instance that the question of housing segregationundoubtedly a central concern in the nations racial dilemmais a relatively new and particularly delicate consideration in the overall problem but such is not the case the basic federal law on housing was passed nearly a century ago in  it provided a year in prison a fine of  or both for those who violated the following provision all citizens of the united states shall have the same right in every state and territory as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit purchase lease sell hold and convey real and personal property however in the south custom was joined by brutal suppression in the conspiracy against negro rights writing recently in the reporter of the great racist reaction that overtook the country in the s historian c vann woodward had this to say in the south the reaction found expression in whitesupremacy propaganda segregation laws poll taxes literacy and poverty tests white primaries and other devises for disfranchising the negroes it was accompanied by an increase in lynching riots and other forms of violence against the minority race it resulted in driving the negro from all forums and avenues of political life in stripipng him of many of the civil_rights and defenses he had gained through the reconstruction amendments and in reducing him to a despised and segregated outcast well negroes now are calling for a redress of all these grievances and it is the nations challengenot his aloneto see that the grievances are redressed with honor and dispatch in recent years liberals have replaced segregationists as the prime targets of negro ire writers like james baldwin and leroi jones have gone so far as to picture the liberals as millstones around the negros neck and poet calvin hernton flatly blamed the failure of white liberals for the rise of the black muslims these attacks of course were not leveled at genuine liberals who are relatively few but at that vast army of americans who mistake a patronizing attitude however subtle for a liberal conviction what most of these people mean when they say they are friends of negroes is that they dont mind negroes as long as negroes stay in their place and that place invariably turns out to be somewhere other than where full and unconditional rights of citizenship are a reality in other words these liberals tend to balk and to reject their convictions at the point where negroes insist on being simply men and women like any others with precisely the same rights privileges and obligations as other men and women and so whites in the metropolitan areas of the north are being flushed out into the openforced to go on recordrelative to their true racial attitudes it was one thing to strike a liberal pose in favor of negro rights so long as what was involved only amounted to a question of unsegregated seating on a southern bus or free use of a public park or even unrestricted service at a sandwich counter but it is quite another matter when this liberality is put to the acid test in terms of jobs schools and housing areas where some adjustment and possible inconvenience on the liberals part is required to make negro equality an unqualified reality white analysts of the civil_rights movement may choose to see a great white backlash but negroes remain unconvinced there is no surprise for negroes in the revelation of widespread bigotry among white people north or south what is happening is that the two major races in this country have arrived at the inevitable confrontation this is the true meaning of this moment this is the service governor george wallace of alabama is rendering to americans he is bringing us closer to the longpostponed moment of truth the time has come when white people are going to have to decide whether they are to be guided by the principles of justice and equality as spelled out in the constitution and bill of rights or whether they are going to submit this system of government to the rationale of racism we are now witnessing the weedingout process the separation of the true believers from the hypocrites from now until the resolution of the race problem one way or another white people will find it increasingly difficult to cloak their desire for white privilege in robes of genteel patronage

the negro who saved america
the year was  thomas jefferson had just become the third president o f the young struggling republic that was the united states in france napoleon bonaparte had just become the first consul of the republic for life and had barely begun his fantastic career of european domination but it was a former negro slave toussaint louverture who lived on the small caribbean island of san domingo around which world events would turn for the next two years from the island of san domingo toussaint louverture saved the united states from a possible war halted napoleon bonapartes plans for a western empire and made it possible for the united states to purchase louisiana from france to understand how this almost unknown figure came to have such a large influence on world events it is necessary to look at life on the island of san domingo in the year  in  san domingo was divided into two parts the eastern part of the island now called the dominican republic was a spanish colony the western half of the island now haiti was french and one of the richest colonies in the world at this time there were about onehalf million people living in the french colony about  were white french colonists about   were mulattoes and the rest were fullblooded negro slaves toussaint louverture was one of them the french revolution which had taken place two years before had severe repercussions on the island in  the mulattoes who were wealthy well educated and french citizens but still subject to a kind of caste system demanded their freedom as french citizens the whites fearful of the mulattoes refused their demands and became ardent royalists the quarrelling and fighting between the two groups went on for two years until the government in san domingo decided in  to stage a slave uprising to scare the whites and mulattoes into forgetting their differences and uniting behind the government the government called together the slave leaders and planned a mock uprising the slaves in return for their help were to receive one day off a week and a promise of no more whippings the slaves were to walk off the plantations and then the french troops would come in and pretend to end the pretended rebellion on august   the slaves walked off the plantations as planned but a few slaves got carried away and the mock uprising turned into the real thing the whites and mulattoes now frightened ceased quarrelling joined forces and began to kill as many slaves as possible most of the slaves who had no intention of killing anyone now found themselves hunted by the whites and mulattoes who killed any slaves they caught to save their lives the slaves fought back and the battle was on toussaint louverture and other slave leaders seeing a chance to turn a senseless uprising into a real fight for the long dreamed of freedom gathered together an army of slaves and started the fight for freedom for two years toussaint conducted guerrilla warfare against the french insisting on freedom for the slaves as a part of any armistice agreement just as the french were preparing a campaign planned to ultimately defeat toussaints troops the french people removed louis xvi from the throne and france became a republic armies all over europe quickly mobilized against the democracy which threatened the safety of royalty everywhere england and spain seeing an opportunity to grab more land each sent troops into the french colony on san domingo toussaint quickly joined forces with the spanish who lacked troops in return for professional training for his troops the french fighting a war on two fronts now found themselves slowly losing ground finally the break toussaint and his troops had been waiting for came the french people at the height of their revolutionary ardor proclaimed the freedom of the slaves in january  toussaint immediately offered his services to the new democracy and was accepted toussaint now turned to the task of defeating the english and the spanish this took time but by  toussaint and his troops had driven out the english and had taken the eastern half of the island in the name of france although san domingo was still technically under french rule in  toussaint louverture now held the real power being both governor and commanderinchief under the leadership of toussaint san domingo prospered by  the island had reached twothirds of its prerevolutionary production toussaint invited the french planters who had fled the island during the fighting to return and pick up where they had left off  many went back and enjoyed prosperity once more toussaint placed an overseer in charge of the lands owned by french colonists who did not return and divided the profits from these lands so that the workers received onequarter the government received onehalf and the absent owner received onequarter in a trust fund in case he should ever return toussaint improved roads and started schools he instituted a simple universal tax system under which everyone paid the same fixed percentage he made secret trade agreements with the united states and great britain and conducted a lively trade with these countries in short everyone from the   white planters to the black former slaves prospered under the leadership of toussaint louverture more important everyone had freedom in the true sense of the word and there was no conflict between the whites and the blacks by  the revolutionary government of france had fallen and bonaparte was now in power he had grandiose plans for building a colonial empire for france his original plan was to extend the french domain to egypt india and louisiana but by  he had met failure in egypt and his plans for india had fallen through only louisiana was left for french expansion bonaparte wanted louisiana because it was a vast prosperous section of land enough land to start a new france new orleans was a trading center through which all american trade coming down the mississippi had to pass trade between the french caribbean colonies such as san domingo and louisiana would prosper all which would produce more wealth for france and gave bonaparte more room in which to operate besides louisiana would also be an excellent base from which to mount a french invasion of the united states if the occasion should ever present itself a french owned louisiana would have had a tremendous effect on the united states war would have been inevitable our rapidly expanding nation could not have tolerated a french colony on our western boundary the french would have been much more resistant to united states expansion than the spanish had been our struggling nation could not afford a war we had no army to speak of and our navy consisted of just seven frigates if we had gone to war alone against france we might easily have lost and become a french possession if we had joined forces with great britain against the french the greater possibility we would have been very dependent on britain for our existence and our future if we had won the war on britains side it is quite possible that canada would then have surrounded the united states on three sides a situation just as bad as a french louisiana the united states was in a tight spot and things looked dark indeed bonapartes plans for louisiana included san domingo bonaparte wanted to use the island as a supply base for the new colony however the island belonged to the french in name only the island really belonged to toussaint louverture and the negroes who might cut themselves loose from the mother country at any moment that situation could not be tolerated napoleon didnt exactly like the blacks either i am for the whites because i am white i have no other reason that one is enough besides that black upstart in san domingo had let himself be called bonaparte of the antilles and even had the nerve to send a constitution for bonapartes ratification in which he made himself governor of san domingo for five years opened the islands ports to any country in the world and declared san domingos local independence so bonaparte resolved to do away with toussaint and reinstate slavery france had ceded louisiana to spain in  and bonaparte had to force charles iv king of spain to sign a treaty of retrocession of louisiana to france the treaty was agreed upon in october  but it took bonaparte two full years to force charles to sign the treaty and make it legal while bonaparte waited for charles to sign the treaty he concentrated his efforts on san domingo he placed leclerc one of his best generals and his brotherinlaw in charge of the expedition to the island leclerc was to deceive the blacks win their confidence and then arrest toussaint disband his army and restore slavery napoleon gave him two months to accomplish this task when that had been done leclerc was to proceed to louisiana and assume a hostile attitude toward the united states great britain fearful of slave rebellions in its own colonies agreed not to interfere the united states trying to avoid war withdrew its trade from san domingo toussaint and his army alone were left to thwart bonapartes plan for a western empire leclercs troops set sail in january  it was the largest expeditionary force ever sent overseas it consisted of  troops  generals and  war vessels the fleet was so large that when toussaint first saw it he exclaimed we shall perish all france is come to make us slaves it was to be his only moment of panic quickly returning to the hills he issued to his people a proclamation which breathed vengeance my children france comes to make us slaves god gave us liberty france had no right to take it away burn the cities destroy the harvests tear up the roads with cannon poison  the wells show the white man the hell he comes to make his people proved themselves equal to the task when leclerc landed in le cap one of the islands finest cities he found it reduced to ashes it was a scene which was to be repeated many times in the coming days the twomonth schedule bonaparte had set for leclerc came and went but the blacks showed no signs of giving up the fight although the french had captured the major cities and the coastal plains and many of the blacks had deserted toussaint he held on with an ever dwindling force continually defeating and eluding leclerc in the field leclerc was getting desperate he was losing as many men in sickness as he was on the field the morale of his troops was sinking lower and lower his supplies were in the same pitiful condition toussaint was also getting desperate his troops had dwindled down to  men a force too small to fight the french toussaint could either hold out as long as possible or he could agree to an armistice let his troops go home to their families and be prepared to fight again when the time came to do so either way toussaint knew the coming rainy season would bring with it yellow fever which would effectively wipe out the french toussaint chose the latter course and arranged an armistice leclercwho wasted four months and   troops trying to catch toussaint readily agreed to the armistice the armistice was a victory for toussaint the blacks were to be free french citizens and there were to be no reprisals but the armistice was not to last long toussaint was suddenly arrested and sent to france where he was put in a dungeon after his arrest toussaint told a french officer in overthrowing me you have cut down in san domingo only the trunk of the tree of liberty it will spring up again by the roots for they are numerous and deep numerous and deep they were indeed for all over the island insurrections were raised against the french the french their troops now badly depleted by yellow fever became increasingly powerless against the freedom fighters when leclerc died of malaria bonaparte reckoning that his army of  had been defeated by toussaints uneducated badlyequipped black troops decided to withdraw from san domingo before he lost his reputation as a military genius he quickly leaped into a war with britain and in  left the island to the negroes who had finally won their freedom while bonaparte was having his troubles in san domingo jefferson catching wind of napoleons plans for louisiana dispatched james monroe to france to try to buy new orleans and west florida for  million dollars jefferson would have been satisfied if the united states could have retained its right of deposit at new orleans bonaparte his plans for a western empire now shattered by toussaint louverture was only too glad to be rid of new orleans and the rest of louisiana by selling louisiana he could raise needed money for his war with britain and could at the same time keep louisiana out of british hands napoleons representatives and monroe and livingston the other united states representative agreed to terms of  million for all of louisiana even though monroe was not authorized to buy it agreement to terms was reached on april   only  days after toussaint louverture died of pneumonia in his lonely cell bonapartes dreams of a western empire came to an end san domingo had won its independence and the united states had gained an immense area of land the debt this country owes to toussaint louverture is considerable yet he is a forgotten man most united states history books fail to even mention his name race prejudice alone has blinded the american people to the debt they owe to toussaint louverture and the courage of onehalf million other negroes who would not be enslaved
the nation needs your gifts
a part from anything wanted to be able to come here and speak with you this afternoon because you are young gifted and negro aj in the month of may in the year  i for one can think of no more dynamic combination that a person might be you are after all the product of a presently insurgent and historically vivacious and heroic culture a culture of an indomitable will for freedom and aspiration to dignity for even though it is not as well known as it should be our people have sustained one of the most heroic resistances to tyranny in the history of man our african ancestors came to the new world fighting slavery by mutiny on the high seas and by suicide the character of slavery itself was defined by the black mans repudiation of his enslavement which he daily did battle with by sabotage work stoppage acts of violence against those who enslaved him and of course most telling of all by running away by the thousands from slavery and when the time came to help give the fatal blow to the slave system our ancestors now by the tens of thousands fell into the ranks of abraham lincolns union army to serve in any way they could to destroy that hideous cancer against human dignity that was the confederacy they served as cooks they served as spies they served as work battalions men and women thousands and thousands of them but above all they served as the most determined fighting soldiers to don the union blue and storm the barricades of the rebel camps and after that war the civil war the negro people and the poor whites of the south sent their own sons for the first time into the halls of congress to represent them and create the finest democratic hour the south and this nation have ever known during the period of the reconstruction for example the free public school system was made available for the first time to the southlandwhereas before only the children of the rich had been able to enjoy the right to education it was against this brief upsurge of democracy for black and white that the bourbon south unleashed the night riderto take away the ballot from the negro and thereby from his poor white brother as well it was against this brief upsurge of equality that slavocrat apologist historians arose across the land to villify and defame the reconstruction and create an image of it that persists to this day and it was against the threat of the return ever again of such an hour of democracy and opportunity for allthat the system of brutality murder and economic intimidation we know today became the instruments used to guarantee the disfranchisement of the black men and degradation of the white men of the south it is this system which prevails today and it is this system that once again shall compel this nation to find better education or be torn asunder once again but apart from all these things apart from this little known and much distorted history of the negros threecentury struggle against oppression in the new worldis the fact of his culture a culture which since the seventeenth century has thrust forward poets and since the nineteenth novelists and journalists contrary to the notion of the quiescent intellectuality of the american black man is the fact that he first began publishing his newspapers in  while the greatest of his number were yet in chains he began writing classical verse before america was a nation more important the inflected speech and idiom of our people continue to influence an entire nation as indeed do our everreplenishing dance and music forms continue to dominate our national arts and entertainments and that is why i say that though it be a thrilling and marvelous thing to be merely young and gifted in such times it is doubly so doubly dynamicto be young gifted and black look at the work that awaits you there is a story to be told and retold again until no man can plead his ignorance of the things i have just ripped through in such paltry outline i suppose what i am trying to do is to urge you in an opposite direction from the more fashionable attitudes and vogues of our times there are many who would have you believe that there is something wrong with you as writers if you concern yourselves with anything that i have just put before youwho would try to persuade you that genuine sophistication lies in the realm of the psychoanalytical novel and the absurdist play drawn not from the world as it is but from only your most highly internalized and overdistilled notions of that world i am too young and unwise not to offer advice this afternoonand i caution you as developing writers away from those seductions language symbols spoken and written have permitted man to abstract his awareness of the world and transmit his feelings about it to his fellows that may be the most extraordinary accomplish ment in the universe for all we know and even if it is not it is certainly one of the most wondrous and marvelous things to have happened since our particular

ft lee in enemy territory 
 one doesnt have to be a galbraith to realize how impossible it would be to draw an economic picture of petersburg virginia without having the neighboring army base fort lee dominate the canvas yet if one uses the attitude of its citizens as a gauge he can only conclude that the town has retained its social and political autonomy despite this dependence now this attitude alone is in striking disagreement with the common belief that a town adjacent to a military base is forced to adopt its social customs and standards but petersburg actually goes a step further not only does it refuse to let the army influence its social customs it even tries to exert as much of its own influence as possible over fort lee the primary reason for this attitude lies in the location of the town petersburg is in the southcentral section of a state that is southern in both geographical position and temperament virginia is a state that prides itself on being the cradle of the confederacy a term which to its citizens is synonymous with independencesouthern style that is but it would be an understatement to simply say that virginia is in the south any virginian worth his tobacco or peanuts will tell you virginia is the south and any person who dares question this distinction risks being accused of an ignorance of american history a casual glance at a map is all it takes to prove that geographically this argument is fallacious but historically the virginian is on firm ground when he makes this contention for even the most desultory student of american history is aware that the state supplied many of the leading civilian and military heads of the confederacy general robert e lee made it all too clear that his allegiance to virginia took priority over his american citizenship to strengthen his argument the virginian is quick to point out richmond as the first capital of the confederacy it was at richmond that the illfated government took shape amidst the cheers of the throngs who hailed it as a declaration of independence from the tyrannical government in washington and it was in the richmond area that the once magnificent army of lee its ranks now thinned and illequipped had its final death throes the adventure had begun and ended in virginia the fall of a government however does not erase an image and the proud independent and selfreliant image the virginian had of himself persisted all through the humiliation of reconstruction like a muscle it absorbed this punishment gaining strength in the mere act of resistance until today this strength is boldly manifested in a monolithic resistance to edicts handed down by the federal government from prince edward county to arlington the backyard of the nations capitol this image flaunts itself the key word in virginia is independence its significant that petersburg which lies so close to richmond doesnt consider itself a suburb of that city the distance between the two cities can be traveled in thirty minutes and a community even an hour farther from a city like say chicago would accept the suburban label as a matter of course my first glimpse of the town came at night from the window of a rickety army bus that had picked the group of us up at richmonds byrd airport perhaps the poor first impression it made on me was because of my disappointment at not being shipped overseas immediately after basic training this plus the natural distaste a chicagoan has for any small town was enough to make the shabby buildings shabbier and the dim lights dimmer on the outskirts of town just before we reached the base the bus passed a cemetery few of us were surprised by its immense size but its unkempt appearance was enough to shock even the most complacent among us gravestones ran right up to the edge of the highway sitting there in a grotesque fashion still i could not help but see a poetic quality in having a cemetery serve as a buffer zone between a town of peace and a military installation it was as though it had been placed there as a reminder of the ultimate consequence of war a week passed before i was able to see the town again the intervening time was spent getting myself situated on the base that was to be my home for the next sixteen months fort lee turned out to be as beautiful as a college campus and as unique as the man whose name it bears like most of the military bases close to washington it is a showcase established as a training camp during world war i it has since become a training center for quartermaster officers the buildings are new and strikingly modern in design some even require visitors to remove their shoes before entering the floors can literally be eaten off of the lawns are green and wellkept the athletes and there are many for lee is also a special services center wear letter jackets and the commanding general often wore a red dinner jacket to social functions as my platoon sergeant often told us the quartermaster corps may not be the fightingest outfit in the army but ill be damned if were not the bestdressed  lees athletic facilities were the envy of every college on the atlantic seacoast and many were quick to take advantage of them during the college spring vacation of  the track team met princeton penn state morgan state winstonsalem and hampton institute lee certainly couldnt have been considered a breather for these schools because three members of the team had also been members of the  u s olympic team bo roberson a silver medal winner later became a star halfback in the american football league baseball was the commanding generals pet sport so its not surprising that the baseball field was the best in the area what was surprising was that this small base had four swimming pools while much larger installations were lucky if they had one or two small wonder that when i finally received orders for an overseas assignment i was told that i was at last joining the army as pleasant as life was on the base i was still curious about that town that was a scant three miles away finally on a bright saturday afternoon i boarded the bus that made hourly trips into town it was significant that i remained in my seat near the front once the bus was through the post gate five years before the bus would have stopped after it had passed this gate and the driver would wait patiently until all his brownskinned passengers had movedprobably sullenly to the rear i was enjoying a privilege that certain individuals had risked courtmartial to win we drove past a field i hadnt seen or noticed on my first journey down that broad new highway the many plaques and statues indicated that it was meant to be much more than a park it was in fact a memorial a memorial to the confederatenot union mind yousoldiers who had died in the battle of petersburg later i learned that the gallantry of the union forces hadnt gone entirely unnoticed they had been buried right next to confederate soldiers one magnanimous virginian pointed out a man couldnt ask for a finer resting place i soon discovered that petersburg was full of civil war memorabilia plaques indicated where confederate troops had camped and large xs on sidewalks marked the spots where lee had conferred with his lieutenants it seemed that the city fathers were trying to create the impression that the entire war had been fought in that one small area i was reminded of the story told by a visitor to greece if one were to believe the many plaques and markers found in greek villages he stated then its clear that a handful of greeks nearly annihilated the entire turkish army in their war of  fifteen minutes after leaving the base we arrived at our destination the bus station in downtown petersburg had two memorable features first there were the signs over the two doors where the words colored and white had recently been removed the imprints were still visible however perhaps to indicate that at least the ghost of segregation remained the second feature was not only strange but a little disturbing as well it was strange that the majority of the negroes still insisted on using the inferior facilities they had been relegated to during the stations segregated era instead of availing themselves of those in the erstwhile white section this botheredbugged would be a better wordme because i had learned that hundreds of students from nearby virginia state college had satin and picketedat the risk of imprisonmentto end the stations discriminatory practices as one leader of the demonstrations put it it just proves that you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink but one of his colleagues quickly pointed out that the purpose of the demonstrations had not been to force negroes to use the white facilities but to have their right to them recognized by station officials the fact that most of the local negroes refuse to abandon their old patterns of behavior doesnt mean the demonstrations were failures he contended i believe were justified in claiming a victory when the lone negro traveler no longer has to suffer the humiliation of being ordered to use a particular rest room or dining room  unfortunately the bus station was the only victory the demonstrators could claim when it had come to the city library and local picnic area the white citizens had followed the example of their neighbors in prince edward county closing the library had obvious effects on citizens of both races but closing the picnic area produced unexpected and rather ludicrous results the petersburg picnic area it had no official name covered a dozen or so acres near the outskirts of the city it consisted of a few patches of seldomcut lawn sand mixed with stones and glass scraggly pine trees and a lake that was too muddy for swimming and where voracious snapping turtles had long ago destroyed the fish yet it offered the white petersburger the pleasure of quiet and negrofree weekends and was therefore considered well worth the tax money spent to maintain it naturally the negroes disagreed with this point of view as unappealing as that plot of land was it was still supported by public ie white and negro tax money and consequently it was the negroes right to decide for themselves whether or not to use the facilities so the inevitable picketing and demonstrating began interestingly enough the negroes were protesting the injustice of the policy rather than an inconvenience for they had always preferred lake jordan an armymaintained resort a mere eight  miles from town lake jordans waters were clean and blue well stocked fish not snapping turtles and its picnic area looked like one all this was in addition to the fact that the facilities were available to everyone within a week after the petersburg lakes closing lake jordan officials noted a sharp increase in attendance it was clear to even the casual ist observer what was happening white petersburgers who only a week before had vowed to resist integration forever were flocking to integrated lake jordan this phenomenon could have been predicted from what had been happening at fort lee for years local whites however grudgingly had long been sharing the bases excellent athletic facilities with negroes on sunday afternoons even the lilywrhite restaurants were forsaken by these whites to enjoy an inexpensive dinner at the bases cafeteriaand few of them complained about having to share a table with a negro gi in the usually crowded dining room apparently they viewed segregation as a luxury to be enjoyed only when it was convenient for them since there was so much contact between fort lee and petersburg and since it was obvious that the town needed the base more than the base needed the town one would think that the base would take advantage of this opportunity to change local customs such was not the case instead there was overwhelming evidence that army officials had succumbed to local pressures no other explanation can be given for two service clubs and two noncommissioned officers clubs being maintained when one of each was more than adequate for such a small base no attempt was made to openly bar a particular race from any of the establishments but it was generally understood that a certain place was for us and the other place for them a few negroes ignored this silent decree and insisted on patronizing the white clubs just to assert their right to do so but the majority had little interest in integrating those pleasure spots where the blue grass variety of rock n roll music was a specialty actually the only ones inconvenienced or embarrassed by the system were members of the sizeable group of northernbred whites who had a predilection for a more sophisticated type of jazz occasionally a few of them could be seen cringing in a darkened comer of the negro club listening to the sounds that reminded them of their new york or chicago haunts how far fort lee officials would go to conform to local customs wasnt made clear to me until a certain incident on a hot spring afternoon the occasion was a parade in honor of j lindsay almond then governor of virginia who was touring various military installations in the state those with military experience need not be reminded of the grueling hours the soldier must spend preparing a base for the visit of a dignitary particularly if he is a politician the task was especially distasteful to negro soldiers who knew that almond represented all the social injustice they had encountered in the state it had been governor almondnot senator byrdwho had encouraged monolithic opposition to the supreme courts school desegregation order but the command had been given for everyone to stand tall for the occasion and distasteful as it may have been this order applied to black as well as white the army frowns on boycotts as a clerk in a battalion headquarters i was usually spared the harassment and discomfort of parades this time there were to be no exceptions how i swore as i labored over my scuffed boots and tarnished brass its at such times that a soldier asks what in hell have parades got to do with winning wars and invariably an old soldier would reply trooper a good soldier never questions orders it has always amazed me how quickly college graduates products of institutions encouraging inquiry adjust to this rigid code its even more amazing how many seem to enjoy having someone make decisions for them could it be that inquiry is often used as a means to escape responsibility if inquiry were a means of escaping anything then i was certainly eligible to be excused because a dozen questions passed through my mind as i stood at attention on the griddlehot parade field i was too angry to be bothered by the boilinghot sun that was baking my helmet and heating the metal on my rifle a few rows behind me i could hear someone whispering his own words to dixie i wish i was in old manhattan where negroes wear just silk and satin run away run away run away from dixieland but i was too engrossed in my thoughts and this spectacle before me to be amused by my comrades levityor bitterness why i asked myself were we being forced to stand at attention while dixie was being played why was the army so concerned about making a good impression on almond why werent any negro dignitaries in the reviewing stands along with the dozens of petty white politicians if it was because the white politicians had requested that none be invited why had the army complied with their wishes was it only the officials at lee who were unaware of the armys position to influence and change social policy or did this ignorance extend all the way up to the top brass since these were silent questions i expected no answers and even if i had had the courage to voice them theres little doubt that they would have been viewed as merely rhetorical questions however an explanation was offered  unwittinglyimmediately after the parade units were ordered to pass in review a corporal next to me a young yankee whispered to the staff sergeant directly ahead of him say sarge are we expected to goosestep as we pass the reviewing stands trooper the sergeant replied the important thing in the army is to keep in step that was it the army in its efforts to keep in step with local custom had fallen out of step with the times had i been a hero or a fool i would have shouted this as i marched past the stands but since i considered myself a good soldier i saluted instead
the story of the quakers 
among the most active of all religious groups in the area of civil_rights is the religious society of friends commonly called the quakers surely the quakers have done more for american negroes than has any other group in christendom at a time when it was illegal to provide religious instruction for slaves george fox the founder and leader of the quaker movement wrote about his concern that the enslaved negroes might come to the knowledge of the lord too he admonished slavemasters to treat their slaves mildly and gently and to consider setting them free after certain years of servitude fox had just visited one of his mission outposts in barbados where he had come face to face with the phenomenon of negro slavery for the first time seventeen years later a group of foxs followers in germantown pennsylvania expressed their conviction that human slavery was evil because it violated the golden rule it encouraged adultery and it caused cruel treatment the german friends concluded that slavery should be abolished it was largely by quaker action that pennsylvania began the legal abolition of slavery in  nearly a hundred years before lincolns emancipation proclamation and early quakers were among the leaders of the abolitionist movement nationwide valiant antislavery voices in america included those of john greenleaf whittier lucretia mott and levi coffin all quakers coffin vividly described the activities of courageous quakers on behalf of the underground railroad between the slave states and canada with proclamation of the emancipation of the slaves the quakers did not consider their work finished the exslaves were for the most part ignorant untrained and confused quakers were prominent in the formation of freedmens associations which provided for the protection education and practical training of the emancipated negroes in modern times we find that quakers have been active in the formation of such organizations as the national urban league and the national association for the advancement of colored people who are these people the quakers why have they been so concerned about the welfare of negroes both of these questions can be answered satisfactorily by our taking a look at the history and basic convictions of the quakers first of all let us understand that quaker wa not the name which members of the group took upon themselves at first in fact for many decades after the appear ance of the movement it had no name there is no evidence that george fox intended to form a separate religious body born into the family of an english weaver in  fox was a very serious and conscientious child as he grew up he became more and more unfavorably impressed by the formalism and irrelevance of the prevalent religions and soon left home to find a more vital dynamic faith the conviction unfolded within young fox that all christiansnot only the officially ordained clergymenwere priests who could speak directly with god from the depths of his newfound living faith fox began preaching in  not only did he speak in churches but also in barns at market crosses and wherever else the opportunity presented itself by  fox had  followers by  he had over  the actions and way of life of the early quakers followed naturally and logically from their beliefs fox preached that every christian could hold mystic communion directly with god the spirit of love and truth therefore ordained ministers and forms of worship were unnecessary anyone believed the quakers could be guided by the holy spiritan inward spirit or inner lightif he would sit quietly and shut the world from his thoughts in the sight of god preached fox and his followers every man woman and child was equal and sacred by acceptance of these basic tenets every quaker found himself on what a later american quaker john woolman called the damascus road whereon he became aware of the concerns o the spiritual life and the drawing of the supreme spirit god soon he found himself on the jerusalem road which required a quickened conscience and a complete commitment to the holy life next came the jericho road the one on which he was called to action and service on behalf of his faith finally said woolman the quaker reached the erasmus road the way of true christian fellowship the followers of fox refused to take their hats off before judges or even kings feeling that you was too formal a title to be used among equals they addressed each other as thee because they believed that there was that of god in every man they absolutely refused to bear arms against another human or even to sue a neighbor because they felt that legal oaths implied a double standard of truth the quakers refused to make them the story is told of a modern quaker who was called to testify in court as he mounted the witness stand the judgeknowing the man to be a quakerasked him do you swear or affirm neither replied the qauker i tell the truth very well said the judge you may proceed such an attitude of tolerance might very well mark officials toward quakers in midtwentieth century america but it most assuredly did not characterize the views of the seventeenth century english officials what the quakers were telling the churchstate of england was in effect that it was wrong that its theology and ritual meant nothing that men did not have to attend steeplehouses to worship god and that it was evil to pay taxes in support of the state church of england certainly the group was not looked upon with favor from the time of their appearance the quakers were the objects of almost continuous persecution which they endured with almost incredible patience and courage in contrast with the other disapproved sects in england the quakers never met secretly for worship they always insisted that it vas a christian duty to meet openly no matter what the consequences many hundreds of them were imprisoned because of their refusal to attend the services of or pay tithes for the support of the recognized churches and especially for their steadfast refusal to take the governmentrequired oaths of supremacy and loyalty while being tried in derby england george fox admonished the presiding judge to quake with fear of the lord contemptuously the magistrate called fox a quaker and the epithet has been used ever since it was not until almost  years after their appearancethat the group the quakers first referred to themselves as the religious society of friends which is to this day the formal name of the group the earlyday quakers fared little better in america than they did in england of all the early american colonies only rhode island at first welcomed the quakers in all the other colonies they were whipped deported hanged and in other ways persecuted some of the quaker women were even accused of being witches in  the first american martyrs to the quaker cause william robinson and marmaduke stephenson were hanged on boston common mary dyer a quaker woman had been twice banished from boston but had returned with stephenson and robinson she had been sentenced to die with them too but was reprieved at the very last moment she was deported but returned to boston a year later insisting upon martyrdom as she ascended the gallows she was told she would be freed if she promised to leave massachusetts and never return nay she replied i cannot it was a windy day and after the execution a witness pointed to the body and exclaimed look she flies there like a flag when englands king charles ii heard of the heinous execution he  was outraged and commanded the massachusetts authorities to stop killing quakers but to deport them to england the mary dyer execution was one of several events that led finally to englands toleration act of  and the end of quaker historys long period of horror less than two years later george fox died it seems that with the passing of the toleration act and the demise of george fox quaker zeal began to wane and die no longer did the friends feel impelled to go out into the world and rid it of evils instead they began to turn in upon themselves they developed and enforced ever more rigid codes of discipline on the society music art pleasure and the marrying of nonquakers were all strictly forbidden scrupulous honesty sobriety and punctuality were demanded quaker dress and speech became painfully plain during this timefrom  to the quakers grew more and more different and dour indeed they became a peculiar people and they lost many members while gaining very few however respect for quaker education and philanthropy grew deeper and stronger and the ardent activities of the quakers for prison reform and the abolition of slavery began to take effect william penn a convert to quakerism established the model american colony pennsylvania and built its model capital city  philadelphia he made with the indians what has been called the only treaty never sworn to and never broken the quakers treated the indians like dignified and intelligent sons of god and the indians reacted in kind during the years in which the quakers controlled pennsylvania and philadelphia the colony was never raided by the indians too it was unequaled in prosperity and in the excellence of its hospitals and educational institutions in  the quakers stepped down and out of power in the city and colony when the demand was made upon them to pay a tax to finance a war against the shawnees and the delawares modem quakers belong to several divisions called meetings of the society of friends in complete contrast to every other group in christendom traditional quakerism has no formulated creed demanding definite subscription no liturgy priesthood or outward sacrament and no inequality between men and women in the organization though the friends have no written creed their beliefs generally agree with those of other protestants some are as liberal theologically as unitarians while others are as conservative as southern baptists most quakers study the bible placing special emphasis upon its moral teachings probably all of the friends insist that the bible is only a part of the continuing revelation of the divine spirit to man all quakerslib eral or conservative modernist or fundamentalistshare the doctrine of the inner light the divine spirit within every human being in the early days of quaker history all meetings for worship were silent or unprogrammed the members would gather in the severely plain meetinghouse and would sit in silence until some member felt moved to speak many of the friends still prefer the silent meeting however there are modern quaker groups that have paid ministers organs choirs and orders of worship their services are hardly distinguishable from those of presbyterian congregational methodist and other oldline protestant congregations and there are friends churches that conduct revivals and crusades as diligently as ultrafundamentalist baptists methodists and pentecostalists modern friends have kept alive the traditional quaker emphasis in education philanthropy and social justice for more than two centuries american quakers have sought ways of agreement by which they could approach the social problems with which they were concerned not only have the friends labored for better race relations but also for religious liberty the cause of peace temperance prison reform and care of the mentally ill throughout all their history the friends have sought first to achieve the new higher social order within the individual then in the meeting and thereafter to create it in their community and nation probably the most effective instrument of the modern quakers has been the american friends service committee the committee was formed in  by members of most of the quaker meetings in america to care for the innocent victims of the war with a small group of paid workers and trained volunteers and relying heavily on local help and resources the afsc carries out an extensive program of relief and reconstruction in times of peace the committee maintains centers and work camps in europe and latin america as well as in underprivileged areas of the united states it is extremely active in the humanitarian works of resettling immigrants slum clearance and the improvement of housing it also collects repairs cleans and distributes large amounts of clothing in  the american friends service committee shared with the british friends service council the nobel peace prize for worldwide labors for the cause of brotherhood the quakers have come a long way no longer are they merely a peculiar people who refuse to fight avoid politics and require absolute simplicity in speech manner and dress the modern quakers in america support registered representatives in washington dc and have produced a president herbert hoover and a vicepresident richard m nixon as well as untold scores of our countrys leading educators philanthropists men of letters and men of medicine rather than passively frowning on war the friends have sought ways to alleviate it many have rendered invaluable noncombatant service to their country in times of strife and a few have even fought in wars thus we see that the quaker concern for the negro has been and is but a part of a much larger picturethe vision in the heart of every friend of a world wherein there is peace and goodwill towards all men 
a fantasy
the civil_rights bill of  had been extremely weak when compared to the one that confronted congress in  the new bill had been before the legislative body for almost a year and the filibustered were still going strong on both sides of the fence pro and con tempers were growing short it seemed to be just a matter of time before the negro revolution would change from passive resistance to a violent offensive the president had appeared on television numerous times in efforts to calm this explosive situation but his words were not enough and russia sat like a giant buzzard waiting to pick clean the bones of a nation that could die from the cancer of violence such was the state of things when it first appeared all the residents of the little town where it arrived had been evacuated and were virtually being held prisoners in an area cordoned off by a regiment of soldiers only a select group of scientists military men and important political figures was allowed to roam freely in the town all reporters were barred from entering and none of the select group was permitted to discuss the matter outside of the immediate area not even those who first observed it were exactly sure of the time it had arrived they only knew that it had come somewhere between midnight and  am on the fateful morning of december   investigation subsequent to its arrival allowed that one frank garvey night porter at the markus building was probably the first person to observe it after vigorously shaking his head to dispel any visual illusions he had run down the street to the all nitery biterya restaurant owned by frederick fred jacoby since fred was entirely familiar with the amount and consistency of frank garveys drinking a full half hour elapsed before he finally realized that frank was not in the clutches of delirium tremens at exactly six oclock fred stepped outside and looked what he saw sent him scrambling back to the telephone it was freds telephone call that  eventually brought the horde of scientists military men and important political figures swarming to the town the military soon after arriving placed fred frank and all other eye witnesses under guard to keep them away from newspapermen and television owing to the rapidity of the exodus and to the removal of all eye witnesses the remaining residents did not really know why theyd been evacuated the fact that many carefully avoided all contact with their neighbors resulted from a rumor that mr jones mcklinin the used car dealer had contracted and spread a deadly tropical disease there were those who broke through the military cordon and fled to the woods in the belief that all populated areas were to be devastated by negro pilots who had stolen giant aircraft equipped with nuclear bombs but by the second day the facts began to emerge newspapers around the world carried the story on their front pages in germany herr grantz dropped his prized beer stein when he heard the news over his radio and tokedasan in japan bit the ends off his favorite chopsticks when he opened his newspaper the occurrence carried such impact that the possibility of an american race war was momentarily averted by evening of the second day even the aborigines in australia knew that an alien space ship was hovering over america the space ship did not whirl twirl nor spin it did not move backwards forward or sidewards it just hung there motionless nine hundred feet from the ground measurements by highly accurate scientific equipment showed that its altitude and position did not vary from day to day military and scientific aircraft equipped with cameras flew above below and beside the space ship the photographs that were taken received close study from a highly trained group of scientists but nothing of value was disclosed however reports from pilots of various aircraft revealed one significant fact on the upper right side of the otherwise unbroken surface of the space ship was a round sliding panel about three feet in diameter the angle at which it was located prevented those on the ground from photographing it through telescopic lens at irregular intervals the panel would rapidly slide open and shut as yet no aircraft had been lucky enough to snap a picture when it was open on the third day the panel slid open and shut at least fourteen times it was on this day that professor v c swainer a scientist began fiddling with the dials of a radio that sat on the counter of the all nitery bitery the group had selected the restaurant as a sort of headquarters for their activities therefore many heads swiveled toward professor swainer when he tuned in on the frequency of the towns radio station for a high metallic voice was blaring from the instrument repeating the same two sentences over and over i wish to communicate with the president you can contact me on this frequency i wish to communicate with the president you can contact me on this frequency iwishtocommunicatewiththepresidentyou    there was complete silence in the restaurant as each highly trained mind assessed the repeated statements silence reigned as each scientist military man and important political figure reached the logical conclusion the silence persisted as each man accepted the conclusion in relation to the space ship outside the alien was speaking then professor swainer dropped his coffee cup and the silence was broken tables were overturned chairs kicked over and military shoe shines were ruined forever as men scrambled for the radio on the counter for telephones for radio transmitters and in some cases for safety itself one hour later everything was set communications with the space ship had been established then reestablished on a different secret frequency the president was standing by on a direct telephone line from the town to the white house fearing for the chief executives safety in such a strange situation his advisors had suggested that all information from the   alien be relayed to the president via telephone at precisely ten minutes past two the alien began speaking through relay to the president of the united states of america no one except the select group of scientists military men and important political figures will ever know exactly what was said during that strange executive conference for the entire text of the conversation has never been made public but some facts were revealed at six oclock that same day when the president spoke over a a world wide hookup of radio and television my fellow americans and citizens of the world today has been one of the strangest and most important of my life we of this earth have long wondered if life exists out there among the stars we have long wondered if god in his wisdom saw fit to create other men on distant planets we have long wondered if such men would be compatible with our own world if they would have human characteristics if they would come in war or peace we need no longer wonder today i talked with such a man the president went on to explain that only one alien was on board the ship it had come as a sort of advance scout for the group that would eventually follow the alien he explained had not yet come out from the space ship because the atmosphere was slightly different from that of its own planet however after a period of adjustment it would be able to breathe the air without harmful effects thus the sliding panel in the  side of the ship was enabling the alien to gradually become used to earths atmosphere the president continued there is no need to speculate on the intellect of these people the fact that they sent a space ship here shows their intelligence is far advanced when compared to ours i was informed that the customs languages policies and systems of governments on this earth have been under surveillance for years the president paused then looked steadily at the camera as he resumed speaking i was also informed that these people have concluded that we on earth will destroy each other if there is no outside intervention for reasons which were not told me they decided to intervene in so doing they further decided to support and expand the principles philosophies and government of the nation which is most similar to their own after years of study the nation of their choice is the united states of america in the wake of this news there were of course many reactions the russian news organs proclaimed that this is another devious capitalistic scheme to threaten the soviet union and all other good peoples of peace loving nations in a rabid rage red china swore that vile vicious warmongering lies will not deter us from our chosen objectives below the cotton curtain the misdirection of southern intelli gence resulted in the deduction that the aliens have studied all facets of ouah society and have ahproved all that white america has done therefoah they have studied segregation and found that it is propah   in foreign lands american diplomats aurgued that in view of the aliens superiority it is apparent that we must do whatever they decree lest we ourselves be destroyed on the morning of the fourth day it was by the sheerest luck that captain gregory parrin veered in on the space ship and snapped a picture at the exact moment the panel slid open he himself did not realize that he had captured the interior of the ship on film more important he had photographed the alien within thirty minutes after the picture was taken captain parrin landed his aircraft it wasnt until three hours later that an excited group rushed a copy of the photograph to the white house only one half hour elapsed before the president again looked out on an international audience from the television screen dispensing with all preliminaries and formalities he began speaking immediately during the past days all of us have no doubt wondered what the being on board the space ship looks like perhaps we expected little green men with horns or some other monstrosity but this is not the case as we all know when god made us he made us in his image it is now apparent that when he made other men on other planets he abided by the same rule i have in my hand a picture of our visitor i am happy to say that he is not really alien at all though he is super intelligent he is just another man like you or me here is his picture the cameras focused on the enlarged photograph that the president held up for all to see it showed a man that was bare from the waist up it also showed that he was fair skinned blond haired and blue eyed two thirds of the worlds population viewed that picture with apprehension the question of whether it had anything to do with the sudden defeat of the civil_rights bill in congresswith the bloody uprisings of africans in various colonies with the vicious attack on the u s zone in panama or with the sudden sneak attack on russia by the chineseis now academic practically the whole world was in turmoil on the fifth day that day the space ship descended for two hours it sat on the ground unopened in the small town the ban on newsmen and television was lifted reporters and cameramen vied for the most advantageous positions even the president surrounded by security guards journeyed to the town and waited to greet the alien the word flashed around the globe and all fighting ceased at the end of those two hours men everywhere where sitting in suspense waiting and watching all talk and noisy speculations were halted by a high whining noise as a door in the space ship swung slowly open when the alien stepped forth mens breath caught in their throats as they gaped in astonishment only then did they remember that its picture had been taken in profile for the side of its body that resembled a fair skinned blond haired viking warrior blended in perfectly with the other side that resembled a black skinned curly haired african king the eyes of the world were upon it and its blue eye and brown eye stared back at the world

if i dare to imagine that these letters may have some significance for both of us it is because i believe that christianity is concerned with human crises since christians are called to manifest the mercy and truth of god in history christianity is the victory of christ in the world that is to say in history it is the salvation of man in and through history through temporal decisions made for love of christ the redeemer and lord of history the mystery of christ is at work in all human events and our comprehension of secular events works itself out and expresses itself in that sacred history the history of salvation which the holy spirit teaches us to read between the lines we have to admit that this meaning is often provisional and sometimes beyond our grasp yet as christians we are committed to the attempt to see some meaning in temporal events that flow from human choices to be specific we are bound to search his tory that is to say the intelligible actions of men for some indications of their significance and some relevance to our present choice as christians history then is for us that complex of meanings which we read into the interplay of acts and decisions that make civilization and we are also this is more urgent still at a turning point in the history of that european and american society which has been shaped and dominated by christian concepts even where it has at times been unfaithful to its basically christian vocation we live in a culture which seems to have reached the point of extreme hazard at which it may plunge to its own ruin unless there is some renewal of life some new direction some providential reorganization of its forces for survival at present in a worldwide struggle for power which is entirely pragmatic if not cynically unprincipled the claims of those who appeal to their christian antecedents as justification for their struggle to maintain themselves in power are being judged by the events which flow from their supposedly christian choices for example we belong to a nation which prides itself on being free and relates this freedom to its source in christian theology our freedom rests on respect for the rights of the human person and though our society is not officially christian this respect for the person can be traced to the christian concept that every man is to be regarded as christ and treated as christ briefly then we justify our policies whether national or international by the implicit postulate that we are supremely concerned with the human person and his rights we do this because our ancestors regarded every man as christ and wished to treat him as christ or at least believed this to be the right way to act even though they did not always follow this belief now if we advance this claim and base our decisions and choices upon it we must not be surprised if the claim itself comes under judgment if we assert that we are the guardians of peace freedom and the rights of the person we may expect other people to question this demanding from time to time some evidence that we mean what we say commonly they will look for that evidence in our actions and if our actions do not fit our words they will assume that we are either fools deceiving ourselves or liars attempting to deceive others our claims to highminded love of freedom and our supposed defense of christian and personalist ideals are going to be judged we believe not only by other men but above all by god at times we are perhaps rashly inclined to find this distinction reassuring we say to ourselves god at least knows our sincerity he does not suspect us as our enemies do he sees the reality of our good intentions i am sure he sees whatever reality is there but are we absolutely certain that he judges our intentions exactly as we do let me cite an example our defense policies and the gigantic arms race which they require are all based on the supposition that we seek peace and freedom not only for ourselves but for the whole world we claim to possess the only effective and basically sincere formula for world peace because we alone are truly honest in our claim to respect the human person for us the person and his freedom with his basic rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness comes absolutely first therefore the sincerity and truth of all our asserted aims at home and abroad in defense and in civil affairs is going to be judged by the reality of our respect for persons and for their rights the rest of the world knows this very well we seem not to have realized this as well as they another example we claim that we are really solicitous for the rights of the negro and willing to grant him these rights some time or other we even insist that the very nature of our society is such that the negro as a person is precisely what we respect the most our laws declare that we are not simply a society which tolerates the presence of the negro as a second class citizen of whom we would prefer to rid ourselves altogether if we only could they assert that since the negro is a person he is in every way equal to every other person and our religion adds that what we do to him we do to christ since we are a free society based on respect for the dignity of the human person as taught to the world by christianity how then do we treat this other christ this person who happens to be black first if we look to the south which is plentifully supplied not only with negroes but also with professed christian believers we discover that belief in the negro as a person is accepted only with serious qualifications while the notion that he is to be treated as christ has been completely overlooked it would not be easy for a christian to mutilate another man string him up on a tree and shoot him full of holes if he believed that what he did to that man was done to christ on the contrary he must somehow imagine that he is doing this to the devilto prevent the devil doing it to him but in thinking such thoughts a christian has abdicated from christianity and has implicity rejected that basic respect for the rights of the person on which free society depends from then on anything such a man may say about christianity or freedom has lost all claims to rational significance only with the greatest unwillingness have some very earnest southern christians under duress accepted the painful need to ride in the same part of public conveyances with negroes eat at the same lunch counters use the same public facilities and there are still not a few of these christians who absolutely refuse to worship christ in the same congregations as negroes even some catholics have refused to receive the body of christ together with negroes in sacramental communion and they have been astonished to find themselves excommunicated officially for refusing integrated schools when in point of fact they had already by their own action manifestly excommunicated themselves acting purely and simply as schismatics rending the unity of the body of christ nevertheless the inner conflicts and contradictions of the south are not to be taken as a justification for the smugness with which the north is doing just as poor a job if not a worse job of defending the negros rights as a person the race problem is something which the southerner cannot escape almost half the population of the south is negro though there are greater concentrations of negroes in northern slums yet northern negroes can be treated as if they were not there at all for years new yorkers have been able to drive to westchester and connecticut without going through harlem or even seeing it except from a distant freeway the abuses thus tolerated and ignored are sometimes as bad and worse than anything in the south it is clear that our actual decisions and choices with regard to the negro show us that we are not in fact interested in the rights of several million persons who are members and citizens of our society and are in every way loyal americans they pay taxes fight for the country and do as well as anybody else in meeting their responsibilities and yet we tolerate shameful injustices which deprive them by threats and by actual violence of their right to vote and to participate actively in the affairs of the nation here i can see you will protest you will point to the supreme court decisions that have upheld negro rights to education in integrated colleges and schools it seems to me that our motives are judged by the real fruit of our decisions what have we done we have been willing to grant the negro rights on paper even in the south but the laws have been framed in such a way that in every case their execution has depended on the good will of white society and the white man has never failed when left to himself to block or obstruct or simply forget the necessary action without which the rights of the negro cannot be enjoyed in fact hence when laws have been passed and then contested and then dragged through all the courts and then finally upheld the negro is still in no position to benefit by them without in each case entering into further interminable lawsuits every time he wants to exercise a right that is guaranteed to him by law in effect we are not really giving the negro a right to live where he likes eat where he likes go to school where he likes or work where he likes but only to sue the white man who refuses to let him do these things if every time i want a coca cola i have to sue the owner of the snack bar i think i will probably keep going to the same old places in my ghetto that is what the negro until recently has done such laws are without meaning unless they reflect a willingness on the part of white society to implement them you will say you cant legislate morality that phrase may be quite true in its proper context but here it is a question not of morality but of a social system if we have got to the point where the laws are frequently if not commonly framed in such a way that they can be easily evaded by a privileged minority then the very structure of our society comes into question if you are responsible for legislation that has only a dubious value and if as a result the authority of law itself begins to be questioned then you are partly to blame for the disorders and the confusion resulting from civil disobedience and contempt of law i think there is possibly some truth in the accusation that we are making laws simply because they look nice on the books having them there we can enjoy the comfort of pointing to them reassuring our own consciences convincing ourselves that we are all that we claim to be and refuting the vicious allegations of hostile critics who question the sincerity of our devotion to freedom but at the same time when our own personal interests and preferences are concerned we have no intention of respecting the negros rights in the concrete north or south integration is always going to be not on our street but somewhere else that perhaps accounts for the extraordinary zeal with which the north insists upon integration in the south while treating the northern negro as if he were invisible flatly refusing to let him take shape in full view lest he demand the treatment due to a human person and a free citizen of this nation that is why the negro now insists on making himself just as obviously visible as he possibly can that is why he demonstrates he has come to realize that the white man is not interested in the rights of the negro but in the white mans own spiritual and material comfort if then by making himself visible the negro can finally disturb the white mans precious peace of soul then by all means he would be a fool not to do so yet when we are pressed and criticized and when the negros violated rights are brought up before us we stir ourselves to renewed efforts at legislation we introduce more bills into congress knowing well enough how much chance those bills have of retaining any real significance after they have finally made it if they make it at all the negro finally gets tired of this treatment and becomes quite rightly convinced that the only way he is ever going to get his rights is by fighting for them himself but we deplore his demonstrations we urge him to go slow we warn him against the consequences of violence when at least so far most of the organized violence has been on our side and not on his at the same time we secretly desire violence and even in some cases provoke it in the hope that the whole negro movement for freedom can be repressed by force i do not claim to be either a prophet or even a historian i do not profess to understand all the mysteries of political philosophy and i am thank god not a sociologist but i question whether our claims to be the only sincere defenders of the human person of his rights of his dignity of his nobility as a creature made in gods image as a member of the mystical christ can be substantiated by our actions it seems to me that we have retained little more than a few slogans and concepts that have been emptied of reality it seems to me that we have little genuine interest in human liberty and in the human person what we are interested in on the contrary is the unlimited freedom of the corporation when we call ourselves the free world we mean first of all the world in which business is free and the freedom of the person comes only after that because in our eyes the freedom of the person is dependent on money that is to say without money freedom has no meaning and therefore the most basic freedom of all is the freedom to make money if you have nothing to buy or sell freedom is in your case irrelevant in other words what we are really interested in is not persons but profits our society is organized first and foremost with a view to business and wherever we run into a choice between the rights of a human person and the advantages of a profitmaking organization the rights of the person will have difficulty getting a hearing profit first people afterward you ask me indignantly to confirm these vicious allegations it appears that the one aspect of the negro demonstrations that is being taken most seriously in the south is that they hurt business as long as there was talk only of rights and of freedom concepts which imply persons the negro movement was taken seriously chiefly by crackpots idealists and members of suspicious organizations thought to be under direct control of moscow like the naacp but still all this talk of negro rights especially when accompanied by hymnsinging and religious exhortations could hardly be taken seriously it was only when money became involved that the negro demonstrations finally impressed themselves upon the american mind as being real we claim to judge reality by the touchstone of christian values such as freedom thought the spirit faith personalism etc in actual fact we judge them by commercial values sales money price profits it is not the life of the spirit that is real to us but the vitality of the market spiritual values are to us in actual fact meaningless unless they can be reduced to terms of buying and selling but buying and selling are abstract operations money has no ontological reality it is a pure convention admittedly it is a very practical one but it is in itself completely unreal and the ritual that surrounds money transactions the whole liturgy of marketing and of profit is basically void of reality and of meaning yet we treat it as the final reality the absolute meaning in the light of which everything else is to be judged weighed evaluated priced thus we end up by treating persons as objects for sale and therefore as meaningless unless they have some value on the market a man is to us nothing more nor less than what he is worth he is known to us as a reality when he is known to be solvent by bankers otherwise he has not yet begun to exist our trouble is that we are alienated from our own personal reality our true self we do not believe in anything but money and the power or the enjoyment which come from the possession of money we do not believe in ourselves except in so far as we can estimate our own worth and verify by our operations in the world of the market that our subjective price coincides with what society is willing to pay for us and the negro he has so far been worth little or nothing until quite recently there was no place for him in our calculations unless perhaps we were landlordsunless we had real estatein harlem that of course was another matter because the negro was really quite profitable to us and yet we did not think of profit as coming to us from the beings of flesh and blood who were crowded into those rooms on the contrary it came to us from the only thing that was realour estate the negro was so shadowy so unreal that he was nothing more than the occasion for a series of very profitable transactions which gave us a good solid reality in our own eyes and in the eyes of our society but now suddenly we have discovered that there are also some real negroes for them to be real they must have the same kind of reality as ourselves reality is estimated in terms of financial worth and so we discover that there are a few negroes who have money why has this rich negro suddenly earned the grace of our benevolent attention because he is a person because he has brains because of the fantastic talents which alone could enable him to be a professional success against such inhuman odds none of this it is now to our interest to recognize him because we can use him against the others so now when the negro claims he wants to take his full part in american society as a person we retort you already are playing your part as a person negroes over the years we now declare have had a rapid rise in income a nice vague statement but it satisfies the mind of anyone who believes in money large numbers of negroes drive highpriced cars another beautiful act of faith but here we come with exact figures it is estimated that there are now thirtyfive negro millionaires in the united states what are these statements supposed to mean simply that there is no need for the negro to make such a fuss to demonstrate to fight for recognition as a person he has received that recognition already thirtyfive negroes are millionaires thirtyfive out of twenty million large numbers drive highpriced cars what more do you want these are indications that the negro has all he needs for he has opportunities he can make money and thus become real what opportunities even though a negro millionaire may live in a fine residential neighborhood he is still living in a ghetto when he moves in the whites move out the neighborhood is taken over by negroes and even if they are millionaires their presence means that a neighborhood is no longer fine for a white man it is no longer even residential so that even when he is worth a million a negro cannot buy himself in the land of the free the respect that is given to a human person doubtless the mercy and truth of god the victory of christ are being manifested in our current history but i am not able to see how they are manifested by us
a little time perhaps only a few more months and we will realize that we have reached a moment of unparalleled seriousness in american history indeed in the history of the world the word revolution is getting around accepted at first with tolerance as a pleasantly graphic figure of speech it is going to be regarded with more and more disapproval because it comes too near to the truth and why what is a revolution what does it mean to say that the negros struggle for full civil_rights amounts to a revolution i    much as it might distress southerners the fact that a negro may now sit down next to a white woman at a snack bar and order a sandwich is still somewhat short of revolution and if by dint of courageous and effective protest the negroes who have a vote in deep southern states should actually manage to cast their votes on election day without getting shot that in itself does not make a revolution though it may have something radically new about it the question is who will they be voting for ross barnett yet i have often thought there is something true as well as sinister in the usual conservative claim to realism we must admit that the southern politicians are much more fully aware of the revolutionary nature of the situation than are those northern liberals who blithely suppose that somehow the negroes both north and south will gradually and noiselessly fit in to white society exactly as it is with its affluent economy the mass media its political machines its professional thoughtlessness and its middle class suburban folkways we seem to think that when the negroes of the south really begin to use their largely hypothetical right to vote they will be content with the same candidates who were up last year and the year before if those candidates themselves were under any such illusion they would long since have done something that would get them the negro votes in point of fact the southern politicians realize very well that if the negroes turn out full force to vote and thereby establish themselves as a factor to be reckoned with in southern politics the political machines of the past are going to collapse in a cloud of dust to put it succinctly if the southern negro is really granted the rights which are guaranteed to him de jure by the american constitution and if he fully and freely exercises those rights it is all up with the old south there are quite enough negroes in the south to make any really free election catastrophic for the status quo and negroes both south and north are not going to waste time voting for people who sic police dogs on them and drench them with high pressure fire hoses while occasionally lobbing bombs onto their front porches for good measure so much for the south but what about the north northern negroes are already able to put some of their own men into office but this is only the beginning of what is suddenly becoming a very conscious and concerted drive for real political power this drive is going to be more and more accelerated by the problem of jobs with five million unemployed officially acknowledged in  with no indications other than that this figure must grow and with repeated strikes and protests in which negroes demand to be hired along with whites there is going to be violent conflict over the limited number of jobs with the best will in the world nobody is going to be able to give jobs to negroes without taking them away from whites and there is no indication at the moment that the whites intend to retire en masse and spend the rest of their lives watching tv so that the negroes may carry on the work and collect the paychecks of the nation this represents whether we like it or not a radical threat to our present systema revolutionary situation and furthermore it accentuates the already clearly defined racial lines dividing the two sides in the conflict this means that the negro is going to continue to be what he has decidedly become aggressively aware of the power and impact on white society of mere threat of revolutionary violence the negro himself is in the presence of a social structure which he has reason to consider inherently unjust since it has never done him any real justice except in fair words and promises he also sees that this society has suddenly become extremely vulnerable the very agitation and confusion which greet his demands are to him indications of guilt and fear and he has very little respect for exhortations to go slow and be patient he feels he has been patient for a very long time and that anyone who cannot see this for himself is not being honest about it he also feels that there is no hope of any action being taken unless he takes action himself and that the steps taken by the government are mere political maneuvers leading nowhere this means that a wellmeaning liberal policy of compromises and concessions striving at the same time to placate the negro and to calm the seething indignation of the conservative whites is not going to avert danger it may on the contrary aggravate it hence the realism again of the conservatives who think that the only thing is to stop violence now by the full use of all the repressive agenciespolice national guard armywhich they themselves still fully control after all the traditional line of thought of those who use repressive power to defend the status quo is that they are justified in applying force to prevent a chaotic and explosive outbreak of revolutionary disorder save many lives protect property especially their own of course and maintain a semblance of national identity which would otherwise be dissolved in blood needless to say this is identical with the argument which revolutionaries themselves advance for repressing all resistance once they themselves have achieved their aim and have seized full power now my friend here is your situation you the wellmeaning liberal are right in the middle of all this confusion you are in fact a political catalyst on the one hand with your good will and your ideals your fine hopes and your generous but vague love of mankind in the abstract and of rights enthroned on a juridicial olympus you offer a certain encouragement to the negro and you do right my only complaint being that you are not yet right enough so that abetted by you he is emboldened to demand concessions though he knows you will not support all his demands he is well aware that you will be forced to support some of them in order to maintain your image of yourself as a liberal he also knows however that your material comforts your security and your congenial relations with the establishment are much more important to you than your rather volatile idealism and that when the game gets rough you will be quick to see your own interests menaced by his demands and you will sell him down the river for the five hundredth time in order to protect yourself for this reason as well as to support your own selfesteem you are very anxious to have a position of leadership and control in the negros fight for rights in order to be able to apply the brakes when you feel it necessary this is why the negro emphatically rejects you now he does not want you in his way you are more a nuisance than anything else and you offended at this lack of appreciation want to reassure the negroyou are really on his side and to prove it you will help him to get just a little more you will be satisfied with the headlines you will once again feel cozy with your liberal imagefor a few days thus you make it possible for him according to the fantasies of conservative thought to taste blood and conservative thought is not always deluded in its choice of metaphors on the other hand when you come face to face at last with concrete reality and take note of some unexpected and unlovely aspects of what you have hitherto considered only in the abstract you yourself are going to be a very frightened mortal you are going to see that there are more than ideas and ideals involved in this struggle it is more than a matter of images and headlines and you are going to realize that what has begun is not going to be stopped but that it will lead on into a future for which the past perhaps offers little or no precedent but since it is one of the characteristics of liberals that they prefer their future to be vaguely predictable just as the conservative prefers only a future that reproduces the past in all its details when you see that the future is entirely out of your hands and that you are totally unprepared for it you are going to fall back on the past and you are going to end up in the arms of the conservatives indeed you will be so much in their arms that you will be in their way and will not improve the shooting these are frank and brutal facts my good friend but they are the facts on which you must base your future decisions you must face it this upheaval is going to sweep away not only the old style political machines the quaint relics of a more sanguine era but also a great deal of the managerial sophistication of our own time and your liberalism is likely to go out the window along with a number of other entities that have their existence chiefly on paper and in the head what are you going to do are you going to say that though changes may be desirable in theory they cannot possibly be paid for by a social upheaval amounting to revolution are you going to decide that the negro movement is already out of hand and therefore it must be stopped at any cost even at the cost of ruthless force in that case you are retreating from the unknown future and falling back on a known and familiar alternative namely the alternative in which you who are after all on top remain on top by the use of force rather than admit a change in which you will not necessarily be on the bottom but in which your position as top dog will no longer be guaranteed you will prefer your own security to everything else and you will be willing to sacrifice the negro to preserve yourself but it is precisely in this that you are contributing to the inexorable development of a revolution for revolutions are always the result of situations in which the drive of an underprivileged mass of men can no longer be contained by token concessions and in which the establishment is too confused too inert and too frightened to participate with the underprivileged in a new and creative solution of what is realized to be their common problem this is the case at present in the united states instead of seeing the negro revolution as a manifestation of deep disorder that is eating away the inner substance of our society because it is in ourselves we look at it as a threat from outside ourselvesas a deplorable revolutionary adventure by an understandably dissatisfied minority goaded on by red agitators but this is a totally fanciful view which removes the crisis from the context of reality into a dreamworld of our own in which we proceed to seek a dreamsolution we forget that the negro is there because of us his crisis is the result of our acts and is in fact our crisis our total inability to see this is turning a common political problem into a violent conflict in which there is no possibility of real dialogue and in which the insensate shibboleths of racism drown out all hope of rational solutions when this happens even those whites and negroes who would normally be able to work together to find a common solution will be driven apart and the white man will become the black mans enemy by the mere fact that he is white as martin_luther_king sees so clearly if the negro struggle becomes a violent conflict and this is what would best please the white racists it is bound to fail in its most rational and creative purposethe real vindication of negro rights and the definitive assertion of the negro as a person equal in dignity to any other human person i am convinced he says that if we succumb to be the temptation to use violence in our struggle for freedom unborn generations will be the recipients of a long and desolate night of bitterness our chief legacy to them will be a neverending reign of chaos from strength to love  by harper bros  in one word there is a serious possibility of an eventual civil war which might wreck the fabric of american society and although the negro revolution in america is now unquestionably nonmarxist and just as unquestionably a completely original and homegrown product of our own there is no doubt that if it resulted in a revolutionary upheaval of american economic and political life there might be a danger of marxist elements capturing the revolution and taking it over in the name of soviet communism remote as it may seem this fits an already familiar pattern and furthermore it has to be considered because it already dominates the minds of the segregationist right wing my question to you is this can you think of a better way of conducting yourself does all profoundly significant social change have to be carried out in violence and with murder destruction police repression and counter repression is it not possible that the whites might give closer attention to the claims of negro leaders like martin_luther_king who assert that they do not want violence and who give every assurance backed up by some rather convincing evidence if you can remember birmingham that the negro is not out to kill anybody that he is really fighting not only for his own freedom but also in some strange way for the freedom of the whites this is a new and quixotic concept to us since we are fully convinced that we are the freest people that ever existed is it true that all change of our present social framework is necessarily a disaster so great that any price can legitimately be paid to keep it from coming about is it not possible that whites and negroes might join together in a creative political experiment such as the world has never yet seen and in which the first condition would be that the whites consented to let the negroes run their own revolution nonviolently giving them the necessary support and cooperation and not being alarmed at some of the sacrifices and difficulties that would necessarily be involved is there no alternative but violent repression in which reluctantly no doubt you decide that it is better for the establishment to be maintained by the exercise of the power which is entirely in white hands and which ought to remain in white hands because they are white because of course negroes are not yet ready for any kind of power this presupposes a simple view of the situation a belief that when the chips are down it is going to be either whites or blacks and since whites have proved their capacity to run the country and keep order it is unthinkable even to permit the possibility of that disorder which you take it for granted would follow if negroes took a leading part in our political life conclusion revolution must be prevented at all costs but demonstrations are already revolutionary ergo fire on the demonstrators ergo    at the end of this chain of thought i visualize you my liberal friend goose stepping down massachusetts avenue in the uniform of an american totalitarian party in a mass rally where nothing but the most uproarious approval is manifest except by implication on the part of silent and strangely scented clouds of smoke drifting over from the new camps where the negroes are living in retirement ill how is christianity involved in the negro struggle dr martin_luther_king has appealed to strictly christian motives he has based his nonviolence on his belief that love can unite men even enemies in truth that is to say that he has clearly spelled out the struggle for freedom not as a struggle for the negro alone but also for the white man from the start the nonviolent element in the negro struggle is oriented toward healing the sin of racism and toward unity in reconciliation an absolutely necessary element in this reconciliation is that the white man should allow himself to learn the mute lesson which is addressed to him in the suffering the nonviolent protest the loving acceptance of punishment for the violation of unjust laws which the negro freely and willingly brings down upon himself in the white mans presence in the hope that the oppressor may come to see his own injustice the purpose of this suffering freely sought and accepted in the spirit of christ is the liberation of the negro and the redemption of the white man blinded by his endemic sin of racial injustice in other words the struggle for liberty is not regarded by this most significant sector of the negro population merely as a fight for political rights it is this and it is also much more it is what gandhi called satyagrahaa struggle first of all for the truth outside and independent of specific political contingencies the mystique of negro nonviolence holds that the victory of truth is inevitable but that the redemption of individuals is not inevitable though the truth will win since in christ it has already conquered not everyone can come to the lightfor if his works are darkness he fears to let them be seen
the negro children who walked calmly up to the police dogs that lunged at them with a fury capable of tearing their small bodies to pieces were not only confronting the truth in an exalted moment of faith a providential kairos they were also in their simplicity bearing heroic christian witness to the truth for they were exposing their bodies to death in order to show god and man that they believed in the just rights of their people knew that those rights had been unjustly shamefully and systematically violated and realized that the violation called for expiation and redemptive protest because it was an offense against god and his truth they were stating clearly that the time had come where such violations could no longer be tolerated these negro followers of dr_king are convinced that there is more at stake than civic rights they believe that the survival of america is itself in question they believe that the sin of white america has reached such a proportion that it may call down a dreadful judgment perhaps total destruction on the whole country unless atonement is made these negroes are not simply judging the white man and rejecting him on the contrary they are seeking by christian love and sacrifice to redeem him to enlighten him so as not only to save his soul from perdition but also to awaken his mind and his conscience and stir him to initiate the reform and renewal which may still be capable of saving our society but this renewal must be the work of both the white and the negro together it cannot be planned and carried out by the white man alone or even by the negro under the white mans paternal guidance it demands some negro initiative and the white man cannot collaborate fruitfully until he recognizes the necessity of this initiative the negro is not going to be placated with assurances of respect and vague encouragement from our side he is going to make sure that we are listening and that we have understood him before he will believe in our attempts to help the purpose of nonviolent protest in its deepest and most spiritual dimensions is then to awaken the conscience of the white man to the awful reality of his injustice and of his sin so that he will be able to see that the negro problem is really a white problem that the cancer of injustice and hate which is eating white society and is only partly manifested in racial segregation with all its consequences is rooted in the heart of the white man himself only if the white man sees this will he be able gradually to understand the real nature of the problem and take steps to save himself and his society from complete ruin as the negro sees it the cold war and its fatal insanities are to a great extent generated within the purblind guilt ridden selfdeceiving selftormenting and selfdestructive psyche of the white man it is curious that while some southern whites are surrounding their houses with floodlights to protect themselves in case negroes creep up to murder them in the dark all the violence in the south to date has been on the part of the whites themselves barbara deming a white new england woman who demonstrated with the negro children in birmingham was sent to jail with them the jail was of course segregated she was thrown in a cell full of white prostitutes and other delinquents and found them not only furious and hostile towards her but terrified lest the negro children who were still singing hymns after a sublime display of christian heroism might rape and murder them in the jail curious that these white southerners people to be pitied indeed from their halfworld of violence petty thievery vice and addiction were the ones who felt themselves menaced and menaced by the clear eyes of children the truth is that they had very good reason to fear the action of the children was aimed at them and aimed directly at them it was an attack not upon their property their jobs their social status but upon their inmost conscience and unless that attack could be met and deflected these people would not be able to continue as they were in all literal truth if they heard the message of the negro children they would cease to be the people they were they would have to die to everything which was familiar and secure they would have to die to their past to their society with its prejudices and its inertia die to its false beliefs and go over to the side of the negroes for a southern white this would be a real death indeed this is the radical challenge of negro nonviolence today this is why it is a source of uneasiness and fear to all white men who are attached to their security if they are forced to listen to what the negro is trying to say the whites may have to admit that their prosperity is rooted to some extent in injustice and in sin and in consequence this might lead to a complete reexamination of the political motives behind all our current policies domestic and foreign with the possible admission that we are wrong such an admission might in fact be so disastrous that its effects would dislocate our whole economy and ruin the country these are not things that are consciously admitted but they are confusedly present in our thoughts and fears they account for the passionate and mindless desperation with which we plunge this way and that trying to evade the implications of our present crisis unfortunately not all negroes can appreciate the christian foundation of nonviolent action as it is practiced by the followers of dr_king many northern negro leaders and especially the organizers of the black muslim movement categorically reject dr_kings ideas as sentimental they believe that his nonviolence is a masochistic exhibition of defeatism which flatters the whites plays into their hands and degrades the negro still further by forcing him to submit uselessly to violence and humiliation in some cases the sharp criticism of martin_luther_king is carried so far as to accuse him of deliberately and cynically sacrificing his followers in order to get power and prestige for himself in white society this reaction against what is basically a christian protest leads to another extreme a black racism as intransigent and as fanatical as that of the white racists themselves it is true that the black muslims must not be painted as a corporation of devils yet the muslim movement is one of absolutely hostile rejection of all that is white including christianity conceived as the white mans religion instead islam regarded as african religion and as the worship of a black god or at least of the black mans god is substituted for it emphasis is laid on the martial and combative elements in the faith of islam and the first principle of all race relations is that the white man is never to be trusted he is worthy only of hatred and contempt no dialogue is possible between white and black and all that can be achieved is a complete separation their aim is to achieve this separation without violence in so far as this may be possible but they will not hesitate to use violence if this becomes necessary theoretically then the black muslims do not have a systematic program of violent attack on the white population as some seem to imagine but since the separation of which they dream is and can be no more than a dream the tension between the races in the big cities of the north where the muslims are concentrated will undoubtedly produce some violence sooner or later it can be said however that the fact that the muslims are disciplined and organized makes them to some extent an asset they will certainly try to control violence and direct it this is preferable to completely uncontrolled and in some ways uncaused rioting exploding at the slightest spark and spreading in aimless fury through whole cities until its force is spent yet the muslims however disciplined they themselves may be can easily start a general conflagration among other negroes the black muslims have so far had no influence in the south and although the negro spokesmen in the north are often hostile to martin_luther_king he has immense prestige wherever negroes are to be found in the united states though birmingham was not understood by all of them as a victory for their race it seems however that all hope of really constructive and positive results from the civil_rights movement is to be placed in the christian elements it is also possible that as the movement gains in power the reasonableness and the christian fervor of these elements will recede into the background and the movement will  become more and more an unreasoning and intransigent mass movement dedicated to the conquest of sheer power more and more inclined to violence if the christian and nonviolent element in negro protest is finally discredited it may mean that christianity itself will become meaningless in negro eyes those negroes who attack their christian leaders in the south are usually completely disillusioned with christianity if not bitterly hostile to it because they are convinced that it has no other function than to keep the negro in passive and helpless submission to his white oppressors when white christians express admiration and sympathy for dr_king this is immediately interpreted by his negro critics as evidence for their own negative thesis as for the attitude of white christians toward the negro freedom movement protestants and catholics alike are at best confused and evasive in their sympathies one gets the impression that they mean well and that they recognize the validity of the negros protest but that they are so out of contact with the realities of the time that they have no idea how they can effectively help him it is true that the american hierarchy has denounced the sin of racism some but not all catholic bishops have taken action to integrate catholic schools or to castigate the worst abuses of discrimination here and there christian leaders get together to make encouraging statements yet at the same time even those white christians most favorable to the negro cause have been quick to react against the protests in birmingham and jackson censuring them and demanding more patience on the negros part sincerely believing that the whole problem can be adequately settled only by the administration in washington this to the negro is more than naive he cannot help but interpret it as evasion and bad faith and consequently he has little or no confidence in any white christian group including the catholic church evidently many white christians will be grieved and disappointed at this evaluation of their sincere concern over the negros struggle for his rights they will remind the negro that they have taken certain steps in his favor they will expect him to be more grateful i think the time has come to say two things about this attitude first of all it shows that they do not grasp the real dimensions of the problem as the negro sees it like the average liberal they think that the negro is simply presenting a few reasonable demands which can be met by legislative action and as a corollary to this they assume that if the negro were to ask any more than this he would be unreasonable if not rebellious in actual fact the negro is not simply asking to be accepted into the white mans society and eventually absorbed by it so that race relations in the us may finally come to be something like those in latin america i think that most catholics tend half consciously to imagine that this would be a reasonable outcome let the united states imitate those countries that were settled by catholics in the first place and where there has never been a very strict color line catholic values will triumph and there will be no more racial problems because the united states will be like brazil as present events in brazil make quite clear this is no solution the actions and attitudes of white christians all without exception contain a basic and axiomatic assumption of white superiority even when the pleas of the negro for equal rights are hailed with the greatest good will it is simply taken for granted that since the white man is superior the negro wants to become a white man and we liberals and christians that we are advance generously with open arms to embrace our little black brother and welcome him into white society the negro is not only not grateful he is not even impressed in fact he shows by his attitude that he is at the same time antagonized and disgusted by our stupidity and here i think is where all christians are innocently no doubt doing the gravest harm to christian truth for some unknown reason the white man especially the southern white does not seem to realize that he has been rather closely observed for the last two centuries by his negro slaves servants sharecroppers mistresses and bastards he does not seem to be aware of the fact that they know a great deal about him and in fact understand him in some ways better than he understands himself this information has never been passed on to the white man who has never dreamed of asking for it he has assumed that the ideas of the negro were more or less worthless in the first place do negroes think of course not they just sing dance make love and lie in the shade doing nothing because they are different they hadnt got the energy to think the negro knows precisely why the white man imagines that the negro wants to be a white man the white man is too insecure in his fatuous selfcomplacency to be able to imagine anything else consequently when the catholic church gives the impression that it regards the south as a vast potential pool of negro converts in which a zealous and ardent white apostolate can transform a few million uncle toms into reasonably respectable imitations of white catholics this actually does very little to make the negro respect the truth of christ practically nothing to help him understand the mystery of christ in his church it is often quite evident that the genuinely warm sympathy which so many catholics have for the negro is nevertheless something the negro himself now accepts only with resignation and disillusionment what we love in the negro tends to be once again the same old image of the vaudeville darkie the quaint black mammy of plantation days the pullman porter with ready wit the devoted retainer whose whole family has served a white southern feudal tribe for generations this is a caricature of the negro of which the negro himself has long since grown tired and its chief function is to flatter the white mans sense of superiority one has yet to find very many catholics including especially priests who are really able to deal with negroes on an equal footing that is to say without the specious and fraudulent mediation of this image most of us are congenitally unable to think black and yet that is precisely what we must do before we can even hope to understand the crisis in which we find ourselves and our best considered and most sympathetic consideration of the negros plight is one calculated to antagonize him because it reflects such pitiful inability to see him right before our nose as a real human being and not a higher type of domestic animal furthermore we do not bother really to listen to what he says because we assume that when the dialogue really begins he will already be thinking just like ourselves and in the meantime we are not too disposed to offend the white racists either we still want to please everybody with soft words and pleasant generalizations which we convince ourselves are necessary for charity a genuinely catholic approach to the negro would assume not only that white and the negro are essentially equal in dignity and this i think we do generally assume but also that they are brothers in the fullest sense of the word this means to say that a genuinely catholic attitude in manners of race is one which concretely accepts and fully recognizes the fact that different races and cultures are correlative they mutually complete one another the white man needs the negroand needs to know that he needs him white calls for black just as black calls for white our significance as white men is to be seen entirely in the fact that all men are not white until this fact is grasped we will never realize our true place in the world and we will never achieve what we are meant to achieve in it the white man is for the black man that is why he is white the black man is for the white man that is why he is black but so far we have managed only to see these relationships in a very unsatisfactory and distorted fashion first of all there was the crude initial concept the black man was for the white man in the sense that he belonged to him as his slave but in the relationship of master and slave there is no correlative responsibility the master is like god who cannot enter into a relationship with a creature the creature can only enter into a relationship with him so the master could do what he liked with the slave and perhaps incidentally he might find himself without realizing it living to some extent for the slave whom he had come to trust and love but though there was a germinating humanity in this relationship there was no sense of a real social obligation to slaves as such who therefore were never really admitted to be human beings thus though the south of slavery days was a kind of eden for the white man and is still remembered in the southern myth as eden it was without human significance because it was empty of basic truth the truth of man was absent because here were two different kinds of men who were supposed in the order of nature to complete one another as correlatives and one of them was not admitted to human status the civil war came and the negro acquired a human status on the books of law but only on the books in actual fact his position was even less human than before to assume the superiority of the white race and of europeanamerican culture as axiomatic and to proceed from there to integrate all other races and cultures by a purely onesided operation is a pure travesty of catholic unity in truth in fact this fake catholicism this parody of unity which is no unity at all but a onesided and arbitrary attempt to reduce others to a condition of identity with ourselves is one of the most disastrous of misconceptions it may be true that a french missionary who brings the truth of the gospel to a west african pagan is bringing him the truth indeed but unfortunately the fatal tendency has too often been to assume that everything he was bringing down to his clothes his table manners his cartesian habits of thought his gallic selfesteem and in a word the infallibility of the bien pensant were all pure revelations of god and his church in such conditions missionaries have assumed with extreme generosity that their only function was to give of their sublime fullness and that it was never necessary for them to receive to learn to accept any kind of a spiritual gift from the native and from his indigenous culture material contributionsyes but nothing else there has generally been no conception at all that the white man had anything to learn from the negro and now the irony is that the negro especially the christian negro of the heroic stamp of dr_king is offering the white man a message of salvation and the white man is so blinded by his selfsufficiency and selfconceit that he does not recognize the peril in which he puts himself by ignoring the offer but is the white man in a position to recognize the providential char acter of this hour if i say that the negro offers him an opportunity the white man will perhaps scrutinize him afresh in order to find out what he has to sell and what will he see something at once disturbing and unattractive processions of discontented black men and women carrying signs groups of exalted children singing hymns frightened but determined people letting themselves be rolled around the street by the power of firehoses there is courage there no doubt and they obviously mean business but we have courage too and there is no need at all for us to have the hoses turned on us but this is not the point the negro in fact has nothing to sell he is only offering us the occasion to enter with him into a providential reciprocity willed for us by god he is inviting us to understand him as necessary to our own lives and as completing them he is warning us that we cannot do without him and that if we insist on regarding him as an enemy an object of contempt or a rival we will perhaps sterilize and ruin our own lives he is telling us that unless we can enter into a vital and christian relationship with him there will be hate violence and civil war indeed and from this violence perhaps none of us will emerge whole it must then be said that this most critical moment in american history is the providential hour the kairos not merely of the negro but of the white man it is or at any rate it can be gods hour it can be the hour of vocation the moment in which hearing and understanding the will of god as expressed in the urgent need of our negro brother we can respond to that inscrutable will in a faith that faces the need of reform and creative change in order that the demands of truth and justice may not go unfulfilled it is for this reason that the prudence and the selfstyled wisdom of some white christian leaders may well prove to be a sign of spiritual blindness and as such it may be decisive in leading the negro away from christian truth and natural reason to embark on a violent and chaotic fight for power characterized only by brutality and pragmatism in this struggle the lessons given by the white police and politicians in the south will certainly be turned to good advantage what the negro now seeks and expects or perhaps what he has entirely given up expecting from the white christian is not sermons on patience but a creative and enlightened understanding of his effort to meet the demands of god in this his kairos what he expects of us is some indication that we are capable of seeing a little of the vision he has seen and of sharing his risks and his courage what he asks us is not the same old string of meaningless platitudes that we have always offered him in lieu of advice he asks us to listen to him and to pay some attention to what he has to say he seriously demands that we learn some thing from him because he is convinced that we need this and need it badly negro writers like james baldwin have repeatedly demonstrated that this conviction lends an extraordinary power to their words there is no question that they have more to say than anybody else writing in america today many have read their books and heard their message but few are prepared to understand it because they simply cannot conceive of a white man learning anything worthwhile from a negro still less can tney imagine that the negro might quite possibly have a prophetic message from god to the society of our time in simple and christian terms i would say that the message is this white society has sinned in many ways it has betrayed christ by its injustices to races it considered inferior and to countries which it colonized in particular it has sinned against christ in its lamentable injustices and cruelties to the negro the time has come when both white and negro have been granted by god a unique and momentous opportunity we have this opportunity because the negro has taken the steps which made it possible he has refused to accept the iniquity and injustice of white discrimination he has seen that to acquiesce in this injustice is not virtue but only collaboration in evil he has declared that he rejects both the physical evil of segregation and the moral evil of passive acquiescence in the white mans sin but this is only the beginning now the white man must do his share or the negros efforts will have no fruit the sin of the white man is to be expiated through a genuine response to the redemptive love of the negro for him the negro is ready to suffer if necessary to die if this will make the white man understand his sin repent of it and atone for it but this atonement must consist of two things  a complete reform of the social system which permits and breeds such injustices  this work of reorganization must be carried out under the inspiration of the negro whose providential time has now arrived and who has received from god enough light ardor and spiritual strength to free the white man in freeing himself from the white man i state these two conditions as nakedly and unequivocally as i find them in the words of negro leaders my only comment is that in making these demands they are committing themselves very heavily to provide answers in case we should ever ask them any questions the negro is saying that in effect he has answers so far his actions in birmingham make his claim credible i for one am willing to hear more but i must admit there is as yet a certain vagueness in the inconclusive remarks so faradvanced concerning the future i am not too sure the negro knows any better than anyone else where this country is actually going yet this is a challenge and a very bold one the negro leaders are making some fantastic claims and they are perhaps all the more fantastic because those who make them have half despaired of ever being heard certainly all the official good will of the administration is in no sense an acknowledgment that these claims have even been considered in their depth that is because washington is professionally capable only of seeing this as a political issue actually it is a spiritual and religious one and this element is by far the most important but it is the element that no one is ready to see a white detective in birmingham watching scores of negro children file into the paddy wagons gave expression to the mind of the nation when he said if this is religion i dont want any part of it if this is really what the mind of white america has concluded then we stand judged by our own thought what is demanded of us is not necessarily that we believe that the negro has mysterious and magic answers in the realm of politics and social control but that his spiritual insight into our common crisis is something we must take seriously by and large in the midst of the clamor of every possible kind of jaded and laughable false prophet the voice of the american negro has in it a genuine prophetic ring who knows if we will ever get another chance to hear it in any case the negro demands that his conditions be met with full attention and seriousness the white man may not fully succeed in this but he must at least try with all the earnestness at his command otherwise the moment of grace will pass without effect the merciful kairos of truth will turn into the dark hour of destruction and of hate the awakened negro will forget his moment of christian hope and christian inspiration he will deliberately drive out of his heart the merciful love of christ he will no longer be the gentle wideeyed child singing hymns while police dogs lunge at his throat there will be no more hymns and no more prayer vigils he will become a samson whose african strength flows ominously back into his arms he will suddenly pull the pillars of white society crashing down upon himself and his oppressor and perhaps somewhere out of the ruins a new world a black world will one day arise this is the message which the negro is trying to give white america i have spelled it out for myself subject to correction in order to see whether a white man is even capable of grasping the words let alone believing them for the rest you have moses and the prophets martin_luther_king james baldwin and the others read them and see for yourself what they are saying it is related that when mohammed was seeking the light he thought of becoming a christian and he went to some nestorian christians in a corner of arabia and sought a sign of the truth of christianity from them in order to see whether they had faith he asked them to show him the credibility of the christian message by walking barefoot on red hot coals the nestorians told him that he was mad mohammed saying nothing departed from them and soon the conviction that he sought came to him in the burning heat of the arabian desert it was a truth of stark and dreadful simplicityto be proved by the sword originally

whats a negro revolt boy
 an amateur freelance writer i nevertheless scooped the nations press in an interview with the notorious jim crow never before had old jim as he is affectionately dubbed by his devotees granted an interview for publication getting the meeting was very difficult the explanation of why an amateur was able to get it is quite simple old jim is press shy over long decades of observing from a distance so to speak how the press operates he has come to distrust the integrity of the gentlemen of the fourth estate he says they have always misrepresented him and often even maligned him and now he maintains they seek to dress him in a gray flannel suit and make a racemanipulating hypocrite of him but in his homeland old jims most quoted aphorism  is i operate right straight from the shoulder after seven weeks of negotiation through an intermediary who must remain unnamed i was finally able to get the interview simply by convincing old jim that his answers would be published precisely as givenunadorned and unexpurgated the following interview occurred last march  in old jims unpretentious hotel suite in dixie city capital of the empire of jim crow after i arrived in the city all preliminary arrangements including the satisfactory establishment of my identity had been made through one of old jims faithful lieutenants who at the scheduled time ushered me into the presence of this unique political boss seated behind a plain magnolia table old jim merely nodded when i spoke and indicated my he firmly advised get started chair i had barely got placed when instantly the interview began question what is the central purpose of racial segregation in your country answer to guard and maintain the pristine purity of the great anglosaxon race q would you say this racial purity has been kept unimpaired to date a hell yes of course otherwise how do you think it could be maintained you cant maintain what aint q then how do you explain the presence of so many light skinned negroes in the empire of jim crow a these are the legitimate offspring in the practical moral sense of the word of free white men and nigger girls or women but these mulattoes are examples of an impure nigger race since they have nigger blood in them they are niggersnot whites so the white race remains pure q but by the same token then wouldnt you have an instance of the impurity of the white race in the offspring of a negro man and a white woman a wed have just an ordinary mulatto nigger and two hangings q is there any economic purpose in segregation a the driving purpose of nigger slavery was economic gain and one of the chief secondary purposes of segregation is of course economic advancement economic exploitation of inferior races is one of our godgiven rights and we should show the good creator our appreciation by using this right without shame or reservation also social gains naturally flow from segregation in a civilized society a racial caste system releases the most capable members of the superior race from the cheap dirty dangerous work so they can devote their time and talents to business politics the professions education travel and recreation or fun q but what about the socalled poor white trash how do they fit into this caste system that is based on race a these rednecks and crackers no matter how povertyridden and ignorant can always look down upon the niggersand lord it over em this is a big boost to their spiritsthe whites i mean it enables them to adjust more easily to their natural poverty and this adjustment helps to insure the political stability of our society so segregation is both a psychological and a political asset it encourages contentment and fosters patriotism after all these lazy white people like the shiftless niggers get the kind of jobs they are best prepared for and the kind of living they deserve why man without these poor competing whites the niggers would make too much moneyand vice versa both groups come in very handy indeed q jim people all over the country are especially eager to get your uncensored views on education for negroes a beyond a little elementary schooling the least education they have the better off they areand the better off our country is too whatever is good for them is good for the country you never in all your life saw an educated nigger that wasnt uppity and you never saw an uneducated niggerif he was uneducated enoughthat was uppity its them educated town niggers that take off after them damn yankee trouble makers senator eastlands niggers dont ever bother nobody education ruins niggers as quick as a little extra money does besides they dont need no education above the grades for the jobs we need them for a little onthejob training at a nominal wage can teach them all they need to know anyhow dont anybody with just half sense know that you cant really educate a subject race and continue to hold them in subjection they wouldnt stand for it maybe the ancient romans did have some educated individual greek slaves but here in democratic america in the last half of the twentieth century we are dealing with a race of twenty million niggers that are already getting democratic ideas in their heads we either keep them in poverty and ignorance or they will eventually escape our domination and become free q how then would you explain the reason for the many new brick school buildings for negroes that have sprung up rather suddenly all over the empire of jim crow since  when i was down through here last a actually they are essentially just window dressing a kind of false front or what some of them educated niggers like to call a facade what is taught inside them is little different from what was taught in the old inexpensive frame buildings which were really adequate for the purpose to teach the niggers a smattering of the three rs a little vocational training lots of life adjustment behavior and plenty of civics and patriotismloyalty we are not about to start that separate butequal education youve heard so much hypocritical talk of really them expensive buildings are an unnecessary strain on the taxpayers but many of my people i must admit have lost some of that old dontgiveadamn independence that nearly everybody down her used to haveeither from conviction or from apathy and even jim crow has to adjust his sails slightly to the prevailing windsuntil he can change the winds in a word a lot of my people have become appeasers instead of standing up and fighting like free white men they are trying to stave off real schoolhouse integration by appeasing them communist bureaucrats in washington with a few shiny new buildings and a little tokenism q  see you mean stand up and fight like governor wallace did when he stood in the schoolhouse door he   a why hells bells no like george wallace my eye here old jim shook the spittoon with a spout of ambeer how long did he stand in that door till them washington stooges bodily overpowered him manacled him and hauled him away no he meekly walked away with a sickly look on his face as meekly as a little lamb being led to the shears and if you please how many other schoolhouse doors has this redoubtable states rights governor said with a supercilious sneer stood in exactly none hes been too damn busy traipsing all over the country trying to polish up alabamas image image hell get it straight i mean stand up and fight like bull connor honesty forces me to admit that many of my people have become infected with that social malady of conformity at least they want to put up  a nice looking front as they say and quite a few of them in fact a disturbingly large numberactually want to make what they call some long needed reformsa nice sounding word for unprincipled surrender evidently some of them are really deeply troubled by a warped sense of right and wrong theyve become soft q one more question please if you have time old jim had just glanced at his watch lying on the table do you think negro citizens should have the same voting rights that caucasiani mean anglosaxon citizens have a hell no and neither does anyone else down here who values our great democratic anglosaxon heritageor even just his own hide of course a little token voting by the right kind of niggersthe ones who know their places and stay in themis all right in fact at times it can serve the good of the country from my long career i can recall several instances in which we were able to swing a local election by using the nigger vote in manageable numbers but if we are to preserve our democracy the ballot must always be carefully protected the democratic ballot must never be subjected to promiscuous use by the niggers after all niggers dont automatically have the rights of citizenship they have only what rights we choose to give them practically speaking niggers are subjectsnot citizens      when old jim picked up his watch i knew the interview was over although i was strongly tempted to ask him to elaborate upon his concept of the right of the ballot in a democracy i discreetly crammed my papers into my briefcase arose and thanked him for the interview he nodded without further formalities i left the roomand dixie city
