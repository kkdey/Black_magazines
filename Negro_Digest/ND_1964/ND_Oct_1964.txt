in the face of war and death
there is a war going on now in the united states anyone who does not understand how this could be possible is more naive fortunately or unfortunately than one would think this century would permit recently in that war four negro children were blown to bits while they were learning to pray the leader of the jackson mississippi naacp himself a reluctant convert to the doctrines of nonviolence was assassinated in front of his home police dogs fire hoses blackjacks have been used on negroes to try to reinforce a simple and brutal social repression and all these terroristic tactics are used finally toward the same end to make young bucks and tottering school marms confess to the same lie the racks and maidens of the inquisition demandedthat there is something other than reality while a negro is under a hose or thrown against a building by some brute he is supporting that lie as well as the lie of his own inferiority the inferiority of the suppliant the readiness of the weak to repeat themselves to be no more than weak or no smarter than their torturers yet in spite of this and in the face of such brutality certain elements in america ask the negro to be nonviolent but who are these elements and what are they really asking on all levels the white man insists that there is no negro in america like the one that claims now to be here or at least there has been a constant and unfailing effort on the part of almost every white man in america and the colonial west to have his own qualified version of a black man exist and not just any black man who might like to appear under his own volition to the southern white and many northerners the sitins are liars the pickets and boycotters all are fiendish liars there is no such negro who would want anything but what weve always given them the white southerner says the negro who wants the foot off his neck must be inspired by communists it is a simple lie to say otherwise they say we know what negroes are what they want governor wallace on television admonishes his black housekeeper warmly yall take care of everything heah the old woman smiles and goes off to take care of his baby that is the negro that really exists for him no other the smiling convicts raking up leaves in his yard he waves as he crosses to his car more real negroes he is on his way to the university to make the fake negroes disappear the liberal white man insists also that there is no such thing as a negro except the thing he has invented they are simply underprivileged the havenots the emerging they are the same as we given an education a livelihood etc and this is the rhetoric but where did all these underprivileged people these havenots come from what for instance are all these black people doing in this country in the first place it is questions like these that the rhetoric is supposed to erase from the liberal white mans mind the fact that the negro was brought here as an african slave and labored some two hundred years in slavery is by now supposedly forgotten during slavery a liberal or a moderate was a man who didnt want the slaves beaten but he was not asking that they be freed certainly the negro middle class has forgotten or at least it is their job to pretend they have forgotten and for this reason even the low moan of blues from some unamerican tenement is almost as much of a social affront as a sign on a water fountain this is the missionaries legacy the last pure remnant of the slave mentality cultural shame what the liberal white man does is to open a door into the glittering mainstream of white american life as a possibility for the middle class black man all the negro need do is renounce his history as pure social error and strive with the rest of the strivers so that he too can help in erecting a monolithic syndrome of predictable social values based on the economic power and hegemony of the american western white man in order for the negro to achieve what i will call an equality of means that is at birth to be able to benefit by everything of value in the society of course the society would have to change almost completely what the liberal white man wants is to change the negro so he can be included in the existing system richard nixon is an example of what the liberal wants the negro to become a drab lower middle class buffoon who has no more political power or cultural significance than his  social interment and petty ambition allows very few american white men want the system itself changed and that change complete or to occur with the rudeness of sudden reality abracadabra a family of twelve negroes is living in the next lot what shall we do the cry goes up from the kindest hearts it is the same kind of spurious and pragmatic realism that motivates most american reformers eg most of the socioeconomic policies of roosevelts new deal were not meant to change the society but to strengthen it as it existed roosevelt in this sense gave a flexibility to the american ruling class that it could not have survived without it is like a man who when fire breaks out in his apartment immediately builds a stove around it so far the most serious battles in the war i spoke of are being waged between two classes of white men although the negro middle class is the semiconscious pawn in these struggles the rest of the black population are pawns by default the battles have been waged are being waged now and for the last three hundred years between white men who think the negro is good for one thing and those who think he is good for another this same fight went on during the early days of slavery ie between those of a missionary mentality those who would give the slave christianity thereby excusing the instance of slavery as a moral crusade with concomittant economic advantages and those who felt that as animals the black men had no need for god since as animals they had no souls the fight continues today with the same emphasis except in earlier times the liberal forces the god carriers had only the house slave or occasional freedman to show off as end products of a benevolent christian ethic but now the kennedys and the rockefellers have a full fledged black bourgeoisie to gesture towards as an indication of what the social utopia of the west should look like so the war goes on from battle to battle but with essentially the same things at stake and for the same reasons the forces of naked repression on the one hand have always been out in the open what they want have wanted is common knowledge to negroes once negroes have gotten old enough to know that the world as they will come to know it is basically unfriendly if you are black each class has its own method of making that world unfriendly which makes the quarrel but nothing is really changed complete socioeconomic subjugation is the goal of both white forces what the liberal sees evil about this program is the way it is being carried out liberals want to be leaders moral guides rather than rulers the black middle class and its spiritual forbears the freedmen and house slaves have always fought to maintain some hegemony and privilege and as a privileged class within the american system as definited by the liberalmissionary class of american white man and because of this they have always had to be pawns and tokens in the white class war that constantly goes on trying to decide what to do with negroes the naacp sclc core and any other groups who advocate moral persuasion as their weapon of change reform have been members of the negro middle class or at least bound by that class social sentiments these organizations and others like them are controlled by the negro middle class and largely sponsored by white liberal monies all these people treat history as if it were autonomous and had nothing to do with the people or ideas old slavery for instance and its legacy contemporary social and economic slavery are looked at possibly as hideous accidents for which no one should be blamed the liberal mind is such that it is already trying to persuade us that no one was to blame for hitler or for that matter for joe mccarthy the times are to blame but the fact is that negroes in america are still either field slaves or house slaves the mode of oppression depending on the accident of social breeding one group having easy chairs in its cells the puppet uses to which the historic liberalmissionary syndrome have put the black middle class have grown more bizarre through the years simply because of the increasing dead weight of the black poor which this artificial middle class is supposed to exorcise but this weight if anything has gotten heavier and is felt by all the elements of this society the welfare state was the reformers answer it was and is like a rotten blimp attached to the sleek new airliner thirtyfive dollars a month and carfare to the welfare office is available to each poor negro who rides in this quasilighterthanair ship called ghetto each scream of agony that comes from the airship causes the black middle class who ride in a special airtight compartment of the airliner to ask for more zweibacks in their gleaming bowls so that now there must be a negro assistant press secretary a proposed negro chief of urban affairs a negro for housing etc all of which creates a tiny transistor like industry for the placing of negro tokens booker washington prepared the way for such utilization of negroes martin_luther_king as a recurrent social factor is the same man both men are simply public servants washington solidified the separate but equal lie when that lie was of value to the majority of  intelligent white men kings lie is that there is a moral requirement to be met before entrance into the secular kingdom of plenty this is the reason washington said negroes had to labor in the wings in the first place to get ready for this entrance rev king who is formed very clearly and expertly from the same missionary fabric comes bearing the same message of goodwill that once this moral requirement is met by all negroes ie the poor and brutalized will immediately rise once they understand this then they might pass easily and joyously into that burning building which he insists on calling heaven even though gasoline is being spread on the blaze on all sides by every suffering man in the world the reward for piety and high moral concern then is to be a membership in gomorrah in this sense kings main function as was washingtons is as an agent of the middle class power structure black and white he has functioned in montgomery albany birmingham etc as has the negro middle class in general as a buffer a cajoler against action not sanctioned by white intelligence however innocently these functions might collect as moral imperatives in his own mind let it be our blood he has said repeatedly to negroes and his sincerity on this point is not to be questioned he is screaming out to the blimp with the loud speaker of recent agonies he is a much publicized leader of the oppressed but how many of the oppressed are convinced for every token offered in the general interest of keeping goodwill between the black middle class and the liberalmissionary power structure the gap between this invented bourgeoisie and the majority of black men in this country is widened the tokens are more and more bizarre have more and more supposed power and influence but at each instance the poor black man gets even statistically poorer and less accessible to utopian propaganda but the public servant function of the black middle class especially as indicated by the performance of its chiefs like king roy wilkins whitney young etc is one of communication and control that is they present the demands of the black middle class to the white ruling class and in exchange as payment for the meeting of some of these demands usually such social treachery as token integration which involves the creation of a lucrative civil_rights industry they relay that ruling class wishes to the great mass of negroes while making sure that none of this mass becomes autonomous enough to make demands of their own the various vigilante middle class groups like the first student sitins the more militant chapters of core and sncc began autonomously enough but very soon they came into the fold of the mainstream moral suasion groups of which king is the titular if not actual head the reduction of the student nonviolent coordinating committee to mere membership on the rolls of this main black middle class reform element was signified quite blatantly by the censorship of its chairmans john lewis speech at the march on washington ceremonies the montgomery bus boycotts and later disorders as well as the birmingham nearviolence before and after the bombings were all quickly mounted by king and brought to sanctimonious halts hours after the birmigham bombings king was already there moving through crowds of negroes bringing them the word before that when the negroes were marching in that same city king and the other leaders swore that the white men were willing to bargain if only the moral commitment could be made by black men absence of violence was the commitment these leaders asked have always asked and again it was given by lower middle class negroes and those strivers who had to be on the scene and if word got back to the leaders that the silent weight the poor blacks were uneasy at being left to rot in the same ghettos without the slightest hope or chance of their misery being eased except by making that symbolic leap into bourgeois commitment which is the local utopia and dwelt by such uneasiness upon the impossibility of such advice then king would walk among them praying seeking to involve the most oppressed people in this country in an ethic that only has value for the middle class power structure and even in those uses remains artificial except as it maintains local and national social evils with an admirable stability when this uneasiness would manifest itself as actuality or actual possibility then these bearers of the missionary legacy would quickly seek to turn whatever energy that existed into confusion and always shame let it be our blood king says to the poor making an evangelistic identification he trusts even backward white people will understand as leadership and when that cry of passive resistance is translated into common social activity it means very simply do as you have been doing and some white miracle will prove your suffering was accidental and finally worthwhile violence or nonviolence as actualities have never really been real categories rather their use is symbolic in discussing possible goals of any negro progress in this country and the white west negroes except for isolate ie limitedly organized and uncon nected incidents have never been anything else but nonviolent there have been race riots when the liberalizing elements of the white power structure have been briefly stalemated and the brainwashed lower and lowermiddle class whites have clashed with those economically similar groups of negroes in purely idealistic terms the real tragedy is that these two groups could not find goals that were mutually attainable in some kind of egalitarian revolution that would simply overthrow their mutual oppressors and resurrect a system that would be workable for men who could utilize all their energies within it such a revolution was possible at the end of the civil war marx did not study the racial situation in america closely enough nor its macrocosm which has been world wide since the white man realized as e franklin frazier says in his book race and culture contacts in the modern world    the extension of control over the colored peoples of the world    but the suspicions bred out of race ties and in some cases inculcated in lower class whites by upper class whites purely for their own economic advantage eg at the end of the civil war are much stronger than any purely political method of organization but for the most part there has been no violence from the black man american indians tried violently to defend their lands from white expansionism but the material superiority of western culture and the peculiar aggressiveness of humanist industrialism was of course much too powerful it is a humanist industrialism that has always longed for the twentieth century ie when man really was the measure and literally had his fate clutched quite tightly in his spastic hands a century where the only gods are immediately useful and grow angry only as their worshippers do the moral priggishness of the western white man which grows to insane proportion in america is displayed religiously in every part of the world he has exploited the ritual murders in the name of reason and progress go on every hour in every part of the globe how many nonwhite peoples have been killed in asia in africa in latin america just since  in the name of some almost mystical need for a consistently accommodating order the free world is merely that part of the world in which the white man is free to do as he wants with the rest of the people there and he has ruled this way since the elizabethans when the white man says violence he means first of all violence to his system the possibility of outright war to change the political and economic categories of rule but this has to do with thought primarily rather than the actual utilization of arms by negroes to attain some arbitrary political and economic goals the middle class negros first word on the subject of violence as it is sheepishly and unintentionally given reference as a possibility in the real world is that we couldnt win anyway but the real idea expressed here is that the bourgeois black man does not believe he could benefit by a total withdrawal from white society which could be manifest by simple political rebellion and in this sense any attempt at such rebellion represents violence in the same sense the political overtones of the muslim movement represent this kind of violence against the liberal middle class missionary power structure ie as withdrawal and actual political rebellion this is why the intelligent white man and the middle class negro are so frightened of this group because certainly the only real terror in elijah muhammads program is the fact that even though it utilizes a fancied ethnic hegemony as its catalyst its goals and its version of us social history are quite practical as even a thinker like thomas jefferson has attested the slave    when freed  is to be removed beyond the reach of mixture    but a political rebellion within the existing social structure is impossible any energy seen to exist within the superstructure of american society is almost immediately harnessed within acceptable motifs and shaped for use by the mainstream whether the results of this process are called swing music or core the intent is the same white music there is no way the black man can be heard or seen clearly in the existing system muslims would be rounded up and dropped in the grand canyon before any kind of territorial gift would be made absolutely no violence ie real social or political rebellion will be tolerated by the static center and for this reason this center assumes a flexibility which allows it to sweep from right to left without actually moving at all it merely gets stronger and essentially more intransigent we will risk our cities to defend berlin is one answer since negroes have hardly ever tried to mount any organized physical violence and any political violence to the system is by the nature of the black mans oppression almost impossible even though there are attempts from time to time eg the new all black freedom now party which by the very exclusivity of its form proposes a very practical dissent hence violence to the existing party system one might wonder just why it is so necessary for white liberals and the negro middle class to exhort negroes constantly to follow a path that willingly or not  they have always followed it would seem if one examines the history of black men in the west and especially in the united states that they have most often been objects of violence rather than its perpetrators it would seem too that if there were any need to caution some group against violence and influence them toward a path of righteous passivity and moral indignation it would be the white man at this point who needed such persuasion as exiled exnaacp leader robert williams has said how much money has been expended to convert the racist brutes of the social jungle of the south to the ism of nonviolence and love how many nonviolent workshops are being conducted in ku klux klan dominated communities and racist strongholds of hate and violence against afroamericans nonviolence as a theory of social and political demeanor concerning american negroes means simply a continuation of the status quo as this theory is applied to define specific terms of personal conduct negroes are supposed to utilize it assumes again the nature of that mysterious moral commitment negro leaders say the black man must make to participate as a privileged class among the oppressed nonviolence on this personal moral level is the most sinister application of the western method of confusing and subjugating people by convincing  these people that they the white west know what is best for them since the negro exists at a particular place in american society which has been constantly redefined by the warring elements in white society nonviolence and passive resistance are only the echoes of a contemporary redefinition of the negros place as seen by the most powerful of those elements ie the industrialliberal nee missionary element which since the civil war has held the upper hand in the overall power structure of the society but even couched in purely secular terms the emphasis on passive resistance and moral suasion is an undiluted leftover from the missionary era and its intentions are exactly the same only god has been replaced as he has all over the west with respectability and airconditioning the negro must have both before he is ready for equality is the way another answer goes to enter into the mainstream of american society the negro must lose all identity as a negro as a carrier of possible dissent he must even assume a common cultural liability and when the time comes for this white society to die he will be asked to die with it and for the same reasons that it will die but there is no indication that the poor have any such communal suicide in mind not that they have any theories or bodies of social reasoning to the contrary it is merely that in most parts of america the social system still hews to the intransigence of its beginnings and no real advance into that mainstream is really being offered the white liberals plan is still too academic to really work but then what will happen what will negroes do are there any alternatives all black political thrusts that is any that could issue from the actual needs of the masses of negroes are blocked either by the sham leadership of the middle class negro whose whole tradition is based on abandoning his poorer brothers or by the intransigence of those whites who are behind the times as any liberal spokesman will tell them an america made up strictly of such backward types of white men would survive only a few more years before internal disorder andor external pressures resulted in out and out racial wars asia africa latin america and black america vs the white west but the feigned flexibility of the center permits a toughness for the american way that will take some pushing to topple completely nonviolence is such a feigned flexibility it allows some gesture of social and political protest but offers no real alter native to the existing order but again what is the black mans alternative very simply either he must find some way to do political and social violence to the existing system even though he is hampered at every step by the black middle class and the white power structure or an actual physical violence will result when those four children were killed in the birmingham bombing the us steel plant in that city should have been shut down by negroes black workers should have walked out of every job they hold in the city a general strike should have been called an attempt should have been made to shut down completely the citys industrial resources that city should have died should have been killed by negroes at this writing the bombers have still not been found and attempts have been made toward finding an equitable position for negroes in that city if thats what was supposed to have happened all of this happened two or three weeks after the great march on washington and nothing else could have shown the moral sham involved in that lugubrious display as horribly as that bombing martin_luther_king arrived in birmingham hours after the bombing to quiet the crowds and give a quiet light of hope to the middle class but no real hope or stance is offered by black leaders in the face of such treachery what has been offered is talks in poolrooms with the th st toughs about the dignity of man to men whose dignity consists in their constant resistance to the yoke of cultural compromise white men call their place one young  slick haired cat chalking his cue and looking straight into the television camera after that same bombing said theres a whole lotta people aint gonna stand for much more a this meaning i am not the presidents assistant press secretary nor the first negro to appear in a chemical com bank television commercial but nobodys gonna run over me because of it the point is i think that the poor black realizes at least instinctively that no matter what deal goes down ie no matter which side wins out the crackers or the government no help at all is being offered to him the desegregation of schools has been largely a lie the increase of employment among chronically unemployed negroes has also not happened the battle of housing is to see whether a negro who is able to buy a  house can live in it there is no doubt that soon he might be able to but that means little to most negroes at this moment even the administrations long touted civil_rights bill is being systematically compromised by its supposed sponsors not that it was very strong to begin with a television commentator says it is a reasonable bill wish to god this man were black so he could get a good idea just how reasonable the bill is such a bill at its strongest is only a token and has no practical application at allin the united nations a few days ago only the united states great britain france and the white free world abstained from voting on a resolution to make illegal any organization that promotes race prejudice in latin america governments change hands monthly and no matter how repressive illegal and nonrepresentative a government might be as long as they play ball with the united states and are anticommunist we say nothing it is only in cuba that something is going on of which we disapprove but why in south vietnam and south korea the united states has supported the most brutal governments in the world part of the sugar quota is transferred to south africa we sign a new contract with franco and this is the society rev king wants to get the poor negro ready to enter better hell itself but partnership in gomorrah is the best thing offered by the white man to the negro in america today this is in essence what the promoters of nonviolence represent to the negro masses the march on washington for instance began as an idea of protest against the system but was quickly turned into a nightclub act and a moral victory for the middle classes with marines and plainclothesmen on the scene just to make sure the audience liked the show they were going to put on nonviolence then is not a protest at all in the context it has been promoted into in america it has to do with india too just as rev king thinks it does just what did nonviolence accomplish there the germans were our enemies and they are better off today than the great majority of indians plague and hunger still ravage india and for all the lies and rhetoric that issue from the west about that countrys independence and the political individuality of mr nehru india for all practical purposes is still a crown colony it is still very much exploited by great britain and the rest of the western world not only does nonviolence usually mean no action at all but it is not nor is it likely to be useful moral concept in the impossible social environment of america especially not in the american south one cannot draw analogies between american liberal proposals for negro nonviolence and the recent algerian quietism under the terror of the oas simply because the algerians were waiting for the french to clear out it was a simple case of resisting a greater malice knowing that the french troops would return if too many colons were killed in retribution for the many algerians who were killed during that period it was a qualified military tactical device which kept the french from marching back at the flank but the negros goal has never except in the late stages of slavery been as clearly delineated as was the algerians in that situation nonviolence in the american context means at its most honest evocation a proposed immersion into the mainstream of a bankrupt american culture and thats all and as i have said even that proposition is finally a fake no such immersion is even possible it is much too late a closer analogy is the fate of the european jews and more specifically the fate of german jews at the hands of adolf hitler the german jews at the time of hitlers rise to power were the most assimilated jews in europe they believed and with a great deal of emotional investment that they were germans the middle class german jew like the middle class american negro had actually moved in many instances into the mainstream of the german society and wanted to believe as that mainstream did even when the antijewish climate began to thicken and take on the heaviness of permanence many middle class jews believed that it was only the poor jews who would suffer in such a climate like these unfortunate jews the middle class negro has no real program of rebellion against the status quo in america quite frankly because he believes he is pretty well off the blatant cultural assassination the social and economic exploitation of most ne groes in this society does not really impress him the middle class negros goal like that of the rest of the american middle class is to be ignorant comfortably what other goals can the negro realize in america the out of date white man who is perhaps in one manner of speaking more honest is offering the negro nothing at all except what has always been offered the black man in white society he is saying that if the negro wants anything further than what the white man has always given him he is going to have to take it and this kind of white man will take steps immediately to see that such taking remainsas it has always remained in the context of an orderly american societyunheard of the liberal white man does not even offer the possibility of such taking his only goal for the negro is that the negro remain nonviolent in exchange for this nonviolence this liberal power structure will send an army into mississippi to see that its symbols are accepted by white and black alike but in essence this is all that this power structure offers and what it hopes negroes will continue to accept it offers negroes nothing further in their or in its lifetime nonviolence then is not being offered as a means to an end but as the end in itself the negros real problem remains to find some actual goal to work toward a complete equality of means is impossible in the present state of american society and even if it were possible the society is horrible enough without negroes swelling its ranks the only genuine way for the negro to achieve a personal automony it seems to me this equality of means would be as a truly active moralizing force within or against american society as it now stands in this sense i advocate a violence a literal destruction of the american sociopolitical stance not only as it directly concerns american negroes but in terms of its strangle hold on most of the modern world the negro must take an extreme stance he must attack the white mans system using his own chains to help beat that system into submission and actual change the black man is the only revolutionary force in american society today if only by default the supposed christian ideal of nonviolence is aimed at quieting even this most natural of insurrectionary elements as as actual moral category all rational men are essentially nonviolent except in defense of their lives to ask that the black man not even defend himself as robert williams tried to defend himself and the rest of the black community of monroe north carolina a few years ago before he was framed on a bogus kidnapping charge by local whites with the aid of the federal government is to ask that the black man stay quiet in his chains while the most liberal elements in this country saw away at those chains with makebelieve saws the negro again in this instance is asked to be what the white man makes of him not only does the white man oppress the negro but he even tells him how to react under this oppression but surely the most patiently christian man must realize that selfdefense in any situation is honest and natural it is also obligatory otherwise there is no use in asking for any right since the asker will probably not be around to benefit by its granting but if the most violent political and social protests are muffled and the exile of robert williams seems to me an example of such muffling the attempted jailing of newsman william worthy for trying to find out about china and cuba another and the moral bankruptcy of the black middle class continues to be used by the white ruling class as its cynical symbol of negro progress then it seems to me that quite soon an actual physical violence will break out for every lie that the liberal power structure tells itself the black bourgeoisie and the rest of the world about the majority of negroes in this country alienates that majority even more critically by not allowing a real grassroots protest issuing from the core of the oppressed black masses the american white man is forcing another kind of protest to take shape one that will shake this whole society at its foundations and succeed in changing it even if only into something worse soon for every sham gesture like the march on washington or the still impending deal king and the other black leaders made with white birmingham there might be twice that many acts of unorganized responsive violence how much longer does anyone in this country black or white think that the th st toughs ie the oppressed black man who has made no deals with the white power structure nor received any favors is going to run from policemen and dogs or stand by and watch while unknown assailants blow up their pitiful homes is it possible that the american white man knows so little about negroes from whatever level he does his observing that he thinks these negroes believe or have ever believed in the justice and morality of the white man left to their own devices the masses of negroes will finally strike back perhaps even kill in a vertiginous gesture of fear and despair their anger will not even matter since it has been a hopelessly familiar element in their emotional lives nonviolence can be your goal if you are already sitting in a comfortable house being brought the news of your oppression over television it can be the normal conduct of rational men if they can  believe in the literalness and effectiveness of what they are trying to accomplish by such conduct but walk on any night from one end of th st to the other and count the hundreds of policemen then figure out the climate of rational conduct that is being cultivated by such an environment a legitimate negro protest movement unstalemated by the sham of tokenism and bourgeois intention might succeed in remaking this society and establishing an honest connection between it and the rest of the nonwhite world but most of the leaders of what passes as such protest the middle class negroes and white liberals who have access to courtrooms and picket lines have already sold their souls finally it would seem that for the mass of negroes such leadership as they need will come from within their own ranks bolstered by those young negroes from the middle class who themselves recognize the hopelessness of their social connections but this leadership is most likely to take solid form only in the most repressive and irrational of circumstances the most horrible vision i have is that the white man growing in terror of those suddenly ubiquitous acts of unorganized violence to which the most oppressed black men might resort will grow even more repressive and even the veneer of the liberal establishment will then be stripped away in much the same way that such veneer has been worn away in international affairs or in dealing with the possibility of actual domestic political dissent mail is being opened phones are being tapped the penalty for traveling to cuba is five years in prison and five thousand dollars fine they say where will such insanity lead and in such instances these unconnected acts of responsive violence would increase and perhaps even gradually find their connection the result of such chaos is anybodys guess guerrilla warfare concentration camps one of our congressmen has said recently that our only real ally in africa is south africa and the only foolproof way to completely stop negro protest especially as it grows more agitated by the lies and malice of most of america and agitated into actual bloodletting would be to follow the south african example or hitlers i hope this is a nightmare fantasy but there are very few white men in this country who are doing anything to prevent it the present emphasis on nonviolence rather than honest attempts at socioeconomic reconstruction will only speed the coming of such horror
sokagakkai target american negroes
from distant japan y p comes an ancient re £ ligion to win the spiritual support and allegiance of all americans but now with a special emphasis upon changing the religious orientation of the american negro this is the sokagakkai the twelve million member lay organization of nichiren shoshu buddhism the unique practices of nichiren shoshu buddhism are seven centuries old but its postworld war ii lay action organization seeks to make nichiren shoshu buddhism the religion of all humanity although dismissed at first as  just another harmlessly bizarre oriental cult the sokagakkai has during recent months been the special target of the japanese and american press for its membership in japan alone numbers some twelve million while powerfully active beachheads have been established abroad outside japan centers have been established in southeast asia in korea taiwan thailand hong kong macao and in vietnam sokagakkai groups are active in the philippines and in australia the movement is firmly established in hawaii okinawa and the united states the sokagakkai is making rapid inroads into portuguesespeaking brazil sokagakkai headquarters have been established in paris france for the promulgation of nichiren shoshu buddhism throughout europe translation of sokagakkai literature into the major european languages has already begun earlier of course sokagakkai literature had been translated and published in the english language explanations of nichiren shoshu doctrines and practice are available now to everyone although but relatively recently established in the united states the sokagakkai has spread its tightly knit organization across the face of america but top leaders in tokyo have felt that an even greater participation of all elements in american life in the sokagakkai is badly needed knowing no color bars the sokagakkai now actively seeks the participation of the american negro in a crusade to change the religious character of the united states and of the world what exactly is this nichiren shoshu buddhism which the sokagakkai is so actively spreading this is a system of esoteric buddhist teachings promulgated by a japanese priest nichiren daishonin  who felt that both japan and the buddhism of his day were corrupt and in need of drastic reformation nichiren shoshu buddhism teaches a system of atuning oneself to the basic power and fabric of the cosmos the threefold beginning is the twicedaily practice of the gonkyo ritual veneration of the gohonzon and the chanting of the mystic phrase nammyohorengekyo the gohonzon is a scroll enshrined by every sokagakkai member as a follower of nichiren shoshu buddhism the sokagakkai does not disparage formal and systematic study of its higher teachings but it feels that the gate to true enlightenment and understanding is first through practice contacts are told that the ultimate test of nichiren shoshu buddhism is a pragmatic one try it and see for yourself there is no teaching of a strictly personal god nor does salvation come from anywhere but ones own personal effort however there is a great sea of power within the cosmos which the individual using the techniques of nichiren shoshu can tap for his own betterment what does the sokagakkai seek for the individual personal happiness beginning here and now the sokagakkai teaches that strictly pieinthesky religion is based upon falsehood most of the evils of the world come sokagakkai leaders proclaim from religious faith which is divorced from reality the sokagakkai has been strongly criticized in japan and in the united states for its public and frequent declarations that nichiren shoshu buddhism occupies a position of unique religious truth yet this position of unique religious truth is not merely claimed by nichiren shoshu buddhism alone but by every other vital religion which has shown and is showing dynamic growth the sokagakkai has actually been accused of being militaristic hardly anything could be more untrue or more unfair first and foremost the sokagakkai refused to support many policies of the military clique which embarked japan upon world war ii sokagakkai leaders felt that these policies of the military government were morally and ethically wrong in july  the sokagakkai was officially suppressed its top leaders were imprisoned on november   tsunesaburo makiguchi one of the cofounders of the sokagakkai died of malnutrition in solitary confinement he died as martyr for his faith his humanitarian principles and for world peace immediately after the end of world war ii almost as american troops were landing as occupation forces the sokagakkai was reestablished to promulgate nichiren shoshu buddhism throughout japan southeast asia and the whole world where does the sokagakkai in the united states stand on negro civil_rights from the time of nichiren daishonin himself nichiren shoshu buddhism has held that human dignity cannot and must not be denied that which makes a man  less than a full man goes sokagakkai teaching is evil and evil must be fought between the four seas and under heaven all men are brothers declare the ancient writings of the orient and the sokagakkai cannot see where this is any less true today than when it was written four thousand years ago the sokagakkai in the united states has its national headquarters in los angeles the international headquarters of the sokagakkai in tokyo publishes an englishlanguage weekly newspaper the seikyo news which is available from the los angeles headquarters at a subscription of  cents per month the sokagakkai has been accused of being political but this is not true the former political section of the sokagakkai has been made an independent organization never at any time has the sokagakkai concerned itself with the political affairs of other nations nor does it intend to the sokagakkai is not antichristian but it places strong emphasis upon the nonchristian character of nichiren shoshu buddhism it feels that christianity belongs to the past for although being supposedly a religion of peace oceans of blood have been shed in its name too many consider that christianity hopelessly compromised itself by condoning slavery and the negro slave trade during the th century also the sokagakkai feels that such philosophies as marxism are fundamentally false for they are based upon a purely materialistic view of life man is neither a machine nor merely an accidental grouping of matter the sokagakkai rejects both materialism as represented by such philosophies as marxism and false supernaturalism and superstition it seeks the establishment of a third civilization upon the eternal foundation of nichiren shoshu buddhism this third civilization uniting all peoples and fusing the orient and the occident shall be altogether different from anything known in the past
youngest federal judge
there are those in philadelphia who say theres no telling where a leon higginbotham jr will wind up some see it as quite possible that he might be the first negro to wear the robes of a justice of the supreme court others merely observe that leon will be whatever he sets his mind to being time alone will tell of course but time is what the towering six feet five inches richvoiced jurist has in abundancetime and the ability to use it well at thirtysix higginbotham is united states district judge for the eastern district of pennsylvania the youngest man to sit on that bench in thirty years for more than a year before president kennedy nominated him last fall to the ayear post higginbotham was the first negro member of the federal trade commissionthe first negro ever to serve on any federal regulatory body and the youngest commissioner in history last year the us junior chamber of commerce named him one of the ten outstanding young men in america the same year he won the arthur s flemming award as one of the outstanding young men in the us government his professional and civic virtues have been recognized with enough plaques certificates and framed letters to fill a small hall of fame he hasnt had time to unwrap a few of them and they await unveiling on a shelf in the anteroom to his chambers at the us courthouse his childhood was far removed from the rarefied judicial world he was born in trenton only son of a factory worker who has spent fortythree years on the production line at a refrigerator company and is still there because he likes it higginbothams mother now retired was a domestic he went to public schools in trenton and got fairly high marks at trenton high he played tenor sax and clarinet in the school jazz orchestra summers he worked as a hotel bus boy factory laborer and shoe store porter in his spare time higginbotham frequented the ymca in trenton the ymca director was hilmer l jensen one of the most inspiring men i have ever known judge higginbotham recalled when i talked with him in his office recently this was a segregated y our best piece of equipment was a rickety ping pong tablebut mr jensen would talk to us of our future and our hopes and expose us to higher visions he made us feel somebody in the world cared about us higginbotham pushed on through high school went to purdue university to study electrical engineering while he was a freshman there he took the turn that led him eventually to the bench it began with a door slammed in his face as a member of the varsity debating team higginbotham had gone to evanston ill to take part in a debate with northwestern university when our team checked in the night before at a hotel in evanston the room clerk looked at me fidgeted slightly and murmured sorry we dont accept negroes here  young higginbotham spent the night at a ymca but he didnt sleep much by morning he had made up his mind i decided i would become a lawyer i felt i would make a greater impact against such inequalities as a lawyer than as an engineer he transferred soon to antioch college seeking a liberal arts course tailored to his new goal his first day there was more eventful than he realized at the timehe met a sociology coed who ultimately became mrs higginbotham higginbotham started doing something about the fight for racial justice at antioch he headed the students chapter of the naacp later was a research associate for the american council on race relations in chicago working under robert c weaver who is now federal housing administrator in washington after antioch higginbotham entered yale law school before he graduated in  he had won more honors in oral advocacy than any student in the schools history he came to philadelphia in  got a job as a law clerk with judges curtis bok gerald a flood and louis levinthal mayor richardson dilworth appointed him an assistant district attorney and late that year higginbotham joined the law firm of norris green and harris my clients ran the gamut from murderers to the national baptist convention and the ame church he recalls his star as a leader in philadelphia civic and human relations work rose rapidly governor david l lawrence named him to the pennsylvania human relations commission in  he was elected president of the philadel phia branch of the naacp over the protest of a faction led by cecil moore present head of the group who claimed members hadnt been given enough notice of the voting as president of the nations largest urban naacp chapter higginbotham proved a moderate who preferred the law courts to the streets as a battleground for equality says a minister who worked with him leon was never a rabblerouser he appeals to reason he prefers the force of logic and morality to demonstrations to this higginbotham agrees only in part it is every americans right to demonstratebut demonstrations must be lawful they shouldnt be held just to raise he hesitated havoc and he added demonstrations cannot be an end in themselves he took part in peaceful picketing of fiveandtencent stores in  because these chains were discriminating against negroes in the south after the supreme court decision of  outlawing school segregation higginbotham filed the first school case in pennsylvania using the supreme courts doctrine we filed suit against the lower gwynedd township school board for operating an allnegro school penllyn schoolin montgomery county we received an adverse decision by montgomery county court but the school board integrated the school system before we even filed an appeal he filed the segregation case against the philadelphia school system which is still pending while the school board has filed its own desegregation plan i asked him what he thought was the biggest single factor in the civil_rights battle there is no single solution to unequal rights except the granting of equal rights to all citizens he said progress is being made in this directioni think the negros cause has made greater advances since the kennedy era than in the hundred years before we are now in a process that is irreversible as i see it there is the need for a twopronged attack we must eliminate all of the barriers of actual discrimination that is essential but it is equally essential to stress to young people the change in environment that will permit firstclass opportunities that were not available to them a few years or even a few weeks before he pounded the arm of his chair for emphasis i wish i could make every young boy and girl see that they should prepare themselves on the assumption that the doors that are still closed to them will be open tomorrow but theyll be open only to those who are prepared if sidney poitier had assumed sixteen years ago that there would be no opportunity for him he would not have won the academy award that negro astronaut capt edward dwight jr would not have been appointed if he had dropped out of school years ago the point to me is that despite all deprivations we must stress preparation and i think the motivation should begin not in high school but in kindergarten that goes for white children too although the negro has an extra weight around his neck i mentioned the current chasm between the moderates and what are commonly referred to as the extremists among negro leaders i dont like the word extremist the judge said to many far too manythe fact that the negro dares to stand up and demand his constitutional rights is extremist in itself i agree there is a split between advocates of violence and nonviolence but i firmly believe that those leaders who urge nonviolent conduct will have substantial support of the negro masses he paused thoughtfully the major factor is whether the power structure will respond to their legitimate demands if employers refuse to promote qualified negroes if owners of public accommodations deny them serviceeach such instance causes a diminution of the nonviolent appeal by responsible leaders an implied lack of effectiveness in getting the problem solved so far he said at least ninety five per cent of negroes are behind such leaders as the rev martin_luther_king jr and naacp president roy wilkins most men regardless of their economic level recognize that they stand to gain most by a nonviolent kind of protest and by a respect for the rule of constitutional law he declared i wondered why communism has failed to lure more negroes the negro is realistic enough to know that he can eliminate his deprivation without substituting another form of tyranny despite various levels of education the negro has a high degree of political sophistication he wants racial equalityplus all the other components of democracy why settle for half a loaf i remarked that it was perhaps impossible for a white man to imagine himself in the negros shoes no one he said who hasnt himself experienced discrimination can appreciate it fully some time ago i took a camping trip with my wife and our two children we went to seattle wash and came back via the southern route we had to eat in the car because we wouldnt be served in eating places along the way i suppose some white persons would look upon this more philosophically today judge higginbotham frankly recognizes that his federal judgeship has curbed his role in the civil_rights battle in a narrow sense  he cant engage in political and lobbying activities i am supposed to represent all the people he said but i have not retreated from my convictions one step i said that whites often accuse negroes of being prejudiced against them i consider all prejudice and discrimination wrong he said i think antiwhite hatred is as undemocratic as being antinegro but as a realistic matter the twenty million negroes have basically been the victims of one hundred seventy million white americans and some negro porter may be as prejudiced as a white bank president but the consequences are quite different the white bank president can make it a lot harder for the prejudiced negro than the prejudiced negro can make it for the bank president    in court these days judge higginbotham maintains a rugged schedule he breezes into his office at  am studies briefs confers with lawyers thumbs lawbooks after lunch at a nearby cafeteria he presides over court until  sometimes stays in the office until  pm takes work home he often greets his secretary mrs essie brock with a cheery hows your adrenalin supply today says mrs brock ive never seen him tired or droopy hes just on the go go go all the time once in desperation i said oh judge why dont you fire me he just laughed and said that would be the easy way outnothing doing  the higginbotham family lives in a fiftyyearold house in germantown with six bedrooms three bathrooms and two powder rooms the judge likes to repair the plumbing paint the walls build furniture he likes to cook too and the results one admiring guest told me are out of this world judge higginbotham also tinkers with his trailer like to swim at a pool in yeadon and is a feared tennis player he keeps his towering frame in trim with vigorous basketball romps in his byfoot backyard with son stephen twelve and daughter karen nine i love space he says musing fondly on a trailer vacation trip the family took to nova scotia a couple of years ago marvelous the outdoorsthats real living but he added with a smile he enjoys his days in court too

are not many nr y negroes in advertis jt k ing  why «  this huge profession employs  people in the united states and spends over  billion a year growing larger every year it covers such fascinating fields as copywriting art personnel administration buying research marketing and merchandising in such varied businesses as direct mail television retailing mailorder radio public relations publicity outdoor advertising industrial advertising and publishing yet there are very few negroes working in advertising prejudices i personally have found very few signs of prejudices in advertising as a matter of fact ive seen many negroes considered for important advertising positions in the past few years yet turned down by prospective employers i was one of those prospective employers ive frequently talked to other advertising people particularly in the southern california area who have been forced to reject applications by negro job seekers we agreed generally on one point we turned down applicants for the simple reason that we were unable to accept a person totally unacquainted with some phase of advertising frankly though there was another reasona very important one let me cite two examples first my own about six months ago we decided to hire an assistant advertising manager to help us write and design direct mail brochures sales letters and catalogs as one of the largest mail order firms in america we turn out dozens of these advertising pieces every year my firm has not been averse to employing negroes right now of our  employees  per cent are negroes another  per cent have been hired from the mexicanamerican community in los angeles  one day the president of our firm suggested that i consider negro applicants in our search for an assistant advertising manager this applicant would if hired fill an important job full of exciting work and offering many opportunities ive been in the advertising profession  years and as advertising manager of my firm i could have offered this man helpful guidance i might have steered him into a career that would have brought him high pay prestige and security but unfortunately i didnt have time to break in or trainfromthestart a young man simply because he possessed a burning desire to get into advertising having the desire was not enough i was on the lookout for an applicant who preferably had earned a degree in english or journalism actually though he need not have possessed a degree at all if he could have met one important requirement i contacted three employment agencies in los angeles and hollywood i phoned the los angeles office of the urban league which operates a placement bureau i ran a classified ad in the huge los angeles times there was a grand total of five negro applicants for the job the urban league sent over two young men one of the employment agencies known in advertising circles for its fair employment policy sent two aspirants my ad pulled one negro applicant to  white applicants im sorry to say that not one of the negro applicantsalthough i found them all eager and intelligent could offer enough writing background either practical or collegeacquired to make me feel that i should hire him in the case of one applicant i blamed college training rather than the applicant for his inability to land the job this young man was  years old showed a friendly personality had certain aptitudes but his writing samplesthose hed written in collegewere very bad so bad indeed that his spelling and punctuation needed about  per cent improvement how he passed his college exams in journalism ill never know i really didnt blame himi just regretted that here likely was potential talent gone to waste i advised him to go back to night school and brush upno start overon his grammar and punctuation another case was similar a friend of mine whos been in the advertising agency business for over  years recently interviewed two negro men he had an opening in his organization for a young man who could show some writing ability another job opening was that of a fashion artist along with several caucasian applicants he interviewed these two young menboth eager to get into advertising but neither of them had prepared himself properly when one of them was asked if he had read any books on advertisingbooks which he could have picked up at his local libraryhe replied why no    how could reading a couple of books on advertising help me get a job in advertising i thought you were looking for somebody with writing experience    very well but had this young hopeful written anythingperhaps a newspaper story or a short story or a poem or anythingsince graduating from college no had he enrolled in any writing classes in one of the adult education programs at his local school no had he studied some magazine and newspaper ads cutting out layouts and whole ads studying and analyzing the wordage he especially liked and which appealed to his tastes  how were his writing samples the very few he could show to my friend were they good or mediocre today a man must sell himself to get a good job and by selling himself i dont mean displaying a golden gift of gab a smart applicant must display a real interest and be able to back up his reasons for wanting an advertising job by preparing himself for it this sells him having the ability to write well of course isnt the only channel by which you can enter advertising although it is one of the easiest many high salaried persons in advertising got there through art some got jobs through selling or retailing there are even some who entered advertising through the entertainment field others acquired advertising jobs through general office jobs such as finance personnel statistics etc but most of todays highest paid advertising executives reached the top of their ladder by starting from copywriting either by the printed word or by television or radio commercials yes some young fellow right now is earning  a week turning out those singing commercials if youre interested in getting into this business do something about it why not enroll in a writing course write a short story or article or even devise a few singing commercials of your own but write one young lady i know used to copy ads in newspapers and magazines she would rearrange the sentences to suit herself sometimes arriving at a brand new idea in the copy before long she was creating her own new fresh ads it was invaluable training when you go on an interview have something tangible to show the person interviewing you let him see that youre not only interested in breaking into advertising but that youve also done something about it heres a field that the negro has hardly dented opportunities are plentiful pay is good the people in advertising are intelligent and friendly and theyll help you over the humps one warning though if you want to be able to take your place in advertising you must learn to write good english know the fundamentals of spelling grammar and punctuation you must learn how to express yourself by the written wordin fresh interesting sentences if you can meet these basic requirements youre going to find it much easier to break into this exciting rewarding profession
the patient
he was a short bantam cock of a man with deepset dark ey es and black hair and he seemed vaguely familiarlike someone i had seen once standing in a schoolhouse doorway somewhere i waved him to the couch and he stretched out on it with a nervous quickness i notice that you didnt give the receptionist your name when you made the appointment i started in my easiest couchside manner just mr x thats part of it thats part of the whole thing he snapped back spastically i dont remember my name i dont know who i am at all  and thats your problem then i said presumptuously no no no he said quickly i told you that was just part of it the other is worse much worse all right shoot i said i realize thats pretty jazzy phraseology for a psychoanalyst but we headshrinkers have to live a little too my patient raised up on the couch and glanced nervously about him you sure there arent any of them here he asked nervously any of who here i inquired glancing around over my shoulders too you know any of them here he said confidentially theyre everywhere these days you know in the pentagon and the white house and the un and all the restrooms i still didnt know who he was talking about but i figured it stood to reason that if they were in the pentagon and the white house and the un sooner or later they would have to use the restrooms well i dont think there are any of them here i said because theres nobody in this room but you and i good good he said im glad to see you havent let them infiltrate your office i decided to use what is known technically in my profession as the imonyourside approach i certainly havent i said firmly you know thats my problem he said lying back down and seemingly starting to loosen up im beginning to think that im one of them too suppose you start at the beginning  suggested in what i considered to be a very sound professional tone well you see ive been making all these speeches lately he said in wisconsin and indiana and maryland and all over and i was careful not to say anything against them not directly i just talked about how our individual liberties were being taken away from us by the federal government and that the issue was really one of states rights and that i had never in my life said anything personal against any of them i see i said with a few somber nods actually i had no idea what he was trying to tell me but if you ask a patient what the hell he is talking about somehow it kind of shatters the doctorpatient relationship he went on but even though i didnt say anything about them i began to notice them everywhere i went they were on street corners and riding the buses and driving the taxis and taking my luggage up to my hotel rooms and when i would ring for room service one of them would show up i would go to a movie and there one of them would be sitting right behind me and i was walking down a street one afternoon humming a song and before long i noticed one of them walking along beside me humming the same tune hmmm i said then it started he declared i mean it really started i would be talking to a large audience and at first i noticed a few of them out there then as time went on some nights it looked like the audience was all them and instead of cheering me they would be laughing at me and they would all follow me back to my hotel chanting and singing all happylike and poking me in the ribs and tapping me on the shoulder and inviting me to sing with them my my i said it was like they were slowly enveloping me swallowing me up then it began to happen what what i asked sitting on the edge of my chair slowly i began to get sensitive about my tan he said im from the south you know and the sun gets pretty bright down there well anyway pretty soon it seemed like my tan was getting darker and darker even though i started staying out of the sunlight as much as possible and once i scared the daylights out of myself when i woke up in the middle of the night and looked in the mirror and couldnt see anything but my eyes and my teeth i nearly had a coronary before i realized i had forgotten to turn on the lights goodness gracious i said doctor he went on solemnly ive begun to think im colored ahem i see i replied clearing my throat and this disturbs you you damn right it disturbs me he shot back bolting upright on the couch wouldnt it disturb you if you woke up all of a sudden and found out you were colored well i dont know i said  look at it this way scientifically theres no difference in the races theres really only a visionary difference and perhaps a state of mind so what does it really matter if  what does it matter he shouted man dont you realize whats happening to me i get on a bus and i go take a seat in the back i take off my hat whenever i speak to white ladies i never get in front of a white person in a line im worried about my kids having to go to a segregated school and getting a secondclass education doctor ive got a problem i sat quietly for a moment looking at him as he tried to regain his composure finally i said yes i guess you do have a problem but we cant solve it overnight this is going to take a little time can you come back same hour same day next week i couldnt possibly make it next week he said oh i said inquisitively next week i have to go to st augustine fla to sit in a restaurant demonstration he answered matteroffactly it took me a minute to get myself together well then maybe the week after that i asked fine if im not in jail er sure sure well see you then governor i said he was halfway to the door and stopped why did you call me that he asked what oh governor well i dont know really it just seemed to sort of pop out thats it thats it he said jubilantly its beginning to come back to me thats my first name im governor somebody governor is kind of a funny name i said maybe its really a title dont be silly he snapped reaching for the doorknob who ever heard of a colored governor he slammed the door and was gone the psychiatric profession has come a long way from sigmund freuds time to this day but even now we have to admit there are some nuts in this world 
a negro novelist remembered
sometimes  gre £ are either not  nized or are forgo by the commun where they spent t early life but not always garet mcmahan wrote a sunday feature on november   for the fayetteville n c observer in

carolina he was one of the first north carolinians of either race to make a national name for himself in the field of letters the negro literary pioneer she was referring to was charles waddell chesnutt the subject of this article the negro woman chloe sampson and her daughter ann maria were leaving fayetteville the year was  and they were fearful and full of insecurity they were free colored people but laws had been passed which took away their suffrage the nat turner insurrection had taken place and the southern whites were jittery concerning negroes the free negroes no longer enjoyed any more civil_rights than the slaves ann maria was a young woman with a brilliant mind she had a desire to be a teacher and had in fact been secretly teaching slave children to read and write she did this at great personal risk because in the decade before the civil war the teaching of slaves was forbidden ann maria could no longer tolerate her condition in the south she prevailed on her mother chloe to go north in  they joined a little band of free colored people who were preparing to go north by wagon train they headed for cleveland ohio to join a colony of negroes who had gone there earlier in the group of pilgrims who were headed for cleveland was a young negro man named andrew jackson chesnutt he joined the wagon train but his destination was indiana where he hoped to live with his uncle a respected and wellknown citizen andrew jackson chesnutts father was a substantial farmer and drayman of fayetteville north carolina the elder chesnutt was a member of the cross

fayetteville state teachers college ann maria sampson and andrew jackson chesnutt fell in love as the wagon train slowly prodded towards cleveland it was heartbreaking for both young people when andrew departed the wagon train and continued alone towards indiana chloe sampson purchased a little house on hudson street in cleveland andrews uncle was helping his bright young nephew get an education in indiana but andrew couldnt keep his mind on his studies for thoughts of ann maria that kept intervening one day in june  andrew left indiana headed for cleveland on july   ann maria sampson and andrew jackson chesnutt went down to the probate court and obtained a marriage license the following day they were married charles waddell chesnutt who was the first of thirteen children was bom in cleveland ohio on june   the civil war started when charles was three years old andrew chesnutt joined the union army and served as a teamster at the wars end andrew found himself near fayetteville he went over to fayetteville to visit his father who had become old and feeble he found his father in such poor physical condition that he couldnt bear to leave him and return to cleveland andrew sent for ann maria and the children ann maria was reluctant to return to her place of birth because she enjoyed the freedom she had known in cleveland but being a dutiful wife she packed up and joined andrew in fayetteville andrews father set him up in business on gillespie street in fayetteville it proved to be a thriving grocery store young charles was enrolled in the howard school named for union general o o howard who did so much for negro education such as establishing howard university charles was a bright boy from the very start and earned a remarkable scholastic record george haigh was a leading citizen of fayetteville who ran a good bookstore he saw that charles had much intellectual ability and was enchanted by books haigh gave the boy the freedom of his store and encouraged him to read dr edward lilly a member of the fayetteville school board had the finest library in town he also recognized charles ability and gave the boy permission to make complete use of his library charles tried to aid his fathers store business by peddling needles pins thread buttons et cetra one of his students later said he would sit down and display his wares and while the customer made his selection chesnutt would become completely absorbed in any book within reach charles chesnutt was a precocious youth and he sold his first story a serial to a weekly newspaper when he was only fourteen years old even at this age he yearned to be a creative writer he wanted to express his feelings and thoughts in words that would be read by others chesnutts formal education did not extend beyond howard school which had the high school grades and some studies of the higher branches of learning but he had great intellectual curiosity and he was a voracious reader he devoured books by the bushel and acquired an excellent liberal education robert harris was charles teacher and principal at howard school harris was a spiritual man and charles greatly admired him harris had much influence on his young pupil robert harris brother cicero harris was the principal of a negro school in charlotte at age sixteen charles chesnutt was sent to charlotte to be an assistant to cicero harris young charles spent three years with cicero harris in charlotte sharing a room sharing teaching duties and eating their meals together charles was much taken with cicero harris as he had been with robert harris cicero had a great christian influence on his young colleague chesnutt spent the other two years between  and  teaching in other north carolina schools near fayetteville one of these years was spent teaching in a school ten miles from spartanburg south carolina during that summer he wrote in his journal i am in the woods again ten miles from spartanburg i came up here yesterday july   afternoon i am in a large old frame house my room is upstairs it is spacious and tolerably pleasant the people are very anxious to please i begin to feel a little charlottesick and to wish i could see j if she were here i should be contented i wish i could write to her without her mothers reading the letters i would write nothing improper of course but i would pour out my heart  i love the girl and i hope she loves me and will continue to do so here is a lock of her hair i kiss the lock of hair and press it to my bosom would it were she i wish i were about twentyfive years old and had about a thousand dollars or so and she were a few years older id marry her if shed have me and i think she would the lonesome young man had fallen in love with a young girl in charlotte charles wrote in his journal on march   judge tourgee has sold the fools errand i understand for  i suppose he had already received a large royalty on the sale of the first editions the work has gained an astonishing degree of popularity and is to be translated into the french now judge tourgees book is about the souththe manners customs modes of thoughts etc    judge tourgee is a northern man who has lived in the south since the war until recently    there is something romantic to the northern mind about the southern negro and there is a romantic side to the history of this people    and if judge tourgee with his necessarily limited intercourse with colored people and his limited stay in the south can write such interesting descriptions    why could not a colored man who has lived among people all his life    why could not such a man if he possessed the same ability write a good book about the south as judge tourgee has written but the man is yet to make his appearance and if i cant be the man i shall be the first to rejoice at his debut and give god speed to his work on may   charles wrote further on the subject in his journal i think i must write a book i am almost afraid to undertake a book so early and with so little experience in composition but it has been my cherished dream and i feel an influence that i cannot resist calling me to the task   but young chesnutts book writing was to wait awhile in the fall of  robert harris died the local board of managers of the state normal school at fayetteville insisted that chesnutt go to raleigh the state capital and apply for the position of principal of the school in november  at age  chesnutt started as principal of the normal school teacher training his salary was  per month while serving as principal charles bought himself an organ and taught himself to play it he served as organist in the old historic evans metropolitan methodist church he also served as choir master and superintendent of the sunday school on june   chesnutt had married susan perry the daughter of a welltodo and highly respected negro edwin perry proprietor of the barber shop in the fayetteville hotel on sunday mornings a familiar sight in fayetteville was chesnutt on his way to church with one of his babes in arms while serving as principal in fayetteville chesnutt met a white professor of german extraction chesnutt wanted to continue his learning on june   he wrote in his journal professor neufeld has consented to give me instruction in french and german three lessons a weektuesdays and thursdays from  to  and saturdays in the morning i am happy to have this golden opportunity i pay mr neufeld  per  month and i should willingly pay  if necessary he wrote further in his journal i do think that i shall ever forget my latin the labor i spend in trying to understand it thoroughly and the patience which i am compelled to exercise in clearing up the doubtful or difficult points furnish it seems to me as severe a course of mental discipline as a college course would afford i have now spent four months in the study of greek and according to my plans for the session i must now stop and devote my time to phonography and composition in preparation for a different work from the one i am now engaged in a little while later chesnutt began the study of stenography because he wanted to go north and earn his living other than by teaching he thought this would also prepare him for any field of knowledge he declared i hope to write  words a minute in two months time by may  the young principal had attained his goal and could write  words per minute he decided to take his family and start a new life in new york city the school board in fayetteville reluctantly accepted his resignation he had won the respect and esteem of the townspeople of fayetteville members of the school board wrote him glowing recommendations the fayetteville observer of june   wrote a flattering editorial on the departing principal immediately upon arriving in new york chesnutt found employment as a reporter for dow jones on wall street chesnutt didnt especially enjoy this type work he stayed with it five years and then he returned to his place of birth cleveland he studied law in the office of judge samuel e williamson later general counsel for the new york central railroad and was admitted to the ohio bar about this time  chesnutt began to write in a desultory fashion for various magazines and newspaper syndicates his first published story as an adult was uncle peters house  it was based on scenes across the cape fear river where his father had owned property his stories were shortly to appear in puck tidbits two tales the independent the overland monthly century magazine and the atlantic monthly the atlantic monthly in  published a negro author for the first time when they published chesnutts the goopered grapevine this was part of a series of seven folk stories later collected in chesnutts first book the conjure woman published in  by houghton mifflin and company the year  was a boom year for chesnutts writings he wrote the wife of his youth and other stories of the colorline and also an excellent biography of frederick douglass the negro leader the douglass biography was a part of the beacon biographies series on eminent americans the wife of his youth part of a group of short stories is a tale of a very fair colored man who just before the civil war by the aid of his negro wife makes his way from slavery to freedom to a northern city groveland cleveland he makes a success in business and becomes socially prominent and is on the verge of marrying a young white widow when the wife of his youth appears on the scene chesnutts first novel the house behind the cedars  is commonly given first rank among his novels in this story the heroine rena walden is sought in love by three men george tryon a white man whose love fails when put to the test jeff wain a coarse and brutal mulatto and frank fowler a devoted young negro who sacrifices all for the love of rena in  before he left north carolina chesnutt went to raleigh to report a speech by frederick douglass for the raleigh signal at this time he made this interesting resolve the object of my writings would be not so much the elevation of the colored people as the elevation of the whitesfor i consider the unjust spirit of caste which is so insidious as to pervade a whole nation and so powerful as to subject a whole race and all connected with it to scorn and social ostracismi consider this a barrier to the moral progress of the american people and i would be the one first to head a determined organized crusade against it the stories in the conjure woman are related by a wily exslave uncle julius to a white couple unlike uncle remus of joel chandler harris fame chesnutt has his uncle julius showing the tragedy of slavery his sly wit and a keen awareness of his own interests chesnutt had grave doubts on the question of dialects he wrote one of his publishers the fact is of course that there is no such thing as a negro dialect that what we call by that name is the attempt to express with such a degree of phonetic correctness as to suggest the sound english pronounced as an ignorant old southern negro would be supposed to speak it and at the same time to preserve a sufficient approximation to the correct spelling to make it easy reading i do not imagine i have got my dialect even now any more uniform than other writers of the same sort of matter the marrow oj tradition  has been called by some an american classic it was written shortly after the spanishamerican war had ended and is the first negro novel to deal with the negro question in the specific setting of imperialism chesnutt made this observation on liberty at the time he wrote the book the nation  was rushing forward with giant strides toward colossal wealth and worlddomination before the exigencies of which mere abstract ethical theories must not be permitted to stand the same argument that justified the conquest of an inferior nation could not be denied to those who sought the suppression of an inferior race one reviewer noted mr chesnutt has made a most powerful argument in favor of social recognition but it seems a waste of time and energy in the present state of american civilization chesnutt was disheartened by the small sales record of the marrow of tradition he wrote his publishers im beginning to suspect that the public as a rule does not care for books in which the principal characters are colored people or written with a striking sympathy with that race as contrasted with the white race  his next novel the colonels dream  which exposed peonage and the convict lease system did not have large sales either it was a hard blow charles w chestnutt was only  when the colonels dream was published but he wrote no more novels after that on june   chesnutt was awarded the spingarn medal for his pioneer work as a literary artist depicting the life and struggles of americans of negro descent and for his distinguished career as a publicspirited citizen  harles waddell chesnutt came to the end of his frutiful life on november   at cleveland ohio his body lay in his library surrounded by his beloved books people who represented every walk of life in america every creed and color attended the simple episcopal service margaret mcmahan the writer says charles waddell chesnutt has stood the test of time he remains one of the nations great writers and north carolinas most outstanding negro authora literary great a word artist

the first negro president of the united states
not ten minutes but nearly twenty minutes had passed and still the direct communications line from the alte mainzer palace in frankfurt am main to the cabinet room of the  white house in washington d c had not been repaired only general pitt fortney who had asked edna to order the coffee had not had the time to finish more than half of his cup impatient with the delay irritated by the unexplained inefficiency he had been up and down at the handset telephone and away from it and back to it belaboring the signal corps for not yet making the presidents private line operative minutes ago he had bellowed into the telephone at some pentagon underling dammit colonel if you arent fixing to get those wires up im going to get sac to fly me over in a b and do the job myself now get cracking they were no longer gathered around the cabinet table general fortney like a caged and offended beast was pacing near the telephone jed stover stood beside the bookcase beneath the mantel with its model ships examining the titles of the various volumes near him propped on the arm of a chair senator dilman was lighting the stub of his cigar and again reading a sheet of paper he held in his hand before the open door to ednas office senator selander and representative wickland were engaged in a conversation secretary of state eaton his back to the others his hands clasped behind him stood at the french doors contemplating the rose garden in the dull august morning governor talley was making an inquiry of leach the stenotypist thus it was that edna foster found them as she returned to the cabinet room from her office where she had met with tim flannery the press secretary to inform him that the conference call while still interrupted would soon be resumed passing selander and wickland she heard a snatch of their conversation senator selander was saying dont you worry your head none about old hoyt watson hes the most reliable member of the senate southerner or not hes still internationalminded hell go with t c its that damn troublemaker in your house im worried about cant you control zeke miller and that lousy newspaper chain of his he hasnt let up a day on aup representative wickland was at once defensive leave him to me i can handle him he likes t c hes received plenty of patronage from t c i tell him the president wants aup why zeke miller wont obstruct him senator selander appeared unconvinced for someone who likes t c hes sure raising hell with t cs cabinet did you see what he let reb blaser publish in the citizenamerican about eaton dirty politics i tell you edna foster who had hung back to hear the last saw that both majority leaders were turning to inspect eaton embarrassed at eavesdropping she hurried to her purse lying on the table opening it to find a cigarette she cast a surreptitious glance at eaton still at the french doors still contemplating the rose garden she wondered if he was thinking about reb blasers column in the washington citizenamerican leaving dinner last night george had bought the newspaper peering briefly at the baseball scores and reb blasers story as they walked toward her apartment george had showed her the column it had been devoted to the low moral tone of the department of state and then boldly revealed information from an inside informant that the secretary of state and his attractive socialite wife kay varney eaton were on the verge of a divorce the gossip column had pointed out that of the  days past kay varney eaton and her husband had been together in the capital city only sixtyeight days in fact reb blaser had pointed out she was now in miami being seen in nightclubs with cartnell the renowned decorator while herequally renowned husband rattled around alone in their elegant georgetown mansion we can only hope reb blaser had concluded that our secretary of state will be more successful in maintaining peace with the soviet union than with his wife of twoandtwenty years edna remembered that she had considered blasers column disgraceful and she had blamed his publisher congressman zeke miller for allowing even encouraging such attacks she had been surprised to find george defending both blaser and miller he had he had said only admiration for their news sense and for their honesty edna had quickly forgiven george understanding that as a member of the white house press corps he would naturally defend and admire his own now edna realized that arthur eaton had come away from the window and caught her staring at him flushing she turned away only to observe senator dilman going out the corridor door probably to the washroom she decided to talk to jed stover at the bookshelves starting toward the under secretary of african affairs she became aware of a folded paper lying on the green carpet behind stover quickly she went to it picked it up and opened it in order to find out to whom it belonged the embossed letterhead she saw bore the name trafford university in the left corner was the smaller lettering office of the chancellordr chauncey l mckaye it was addressed to dear senator dilman not meaning to go further but unable to escape the typed words in the single paragraph that followed edna realized that the head of the university at the suggestion of the dean of men was writing the senator about his son julian dilman a sophomore whose grades had seriously fallen off and who would have to be placed on probation if this continued she noticed words like inattentive and disrespectful and the phrase more interested in outside activities of late than in his schooling she folded the letter embarrassed to have seen its private contents but for the first time she thought of dilman as a human being of those in the room she knew senator dilman the least this was because since t c had been president dilman had been less frequently in the white house than the others only in the few days between the vicepresidents death and the presidents departure for frankfurt had dilman appeared several times with the majority leader but now this letter in ednas hand it gave him a son a son who was a problem and it made him a father not just another senator but a human being noticing that dilman had reappeared and was making his way toward selander and wickland edna hurried to intercept him senator i found this on the floor she said apparently you dropped it im sorry i had to open it senator dilman accepted the letter with the slightest smile its quite all right thank you edna turned in time to see wayne talley approaching eaton arthur its past two in the afternoon in frankfurt t cs probably gone back into the conference think theres any point in waiting around like this eaton shrugged he addressed not only talley but everyone i think we have no choice but to wait the president just may feel this is important enough to delay the conference he may want to speak to us further as if the deferment in resuming communications were a personal affront general fortney charged at the regular telephone once more for the hundredth time it seemed he was calling the signal corps about to continue to her chair and shorthand pad edna slowed down listening hard she thought that she had heard her own telephone ring in her office she was listening trying to make it out above fortneys voice when she heard representative wickland the person nearest to her open door call to her miss foster your phoneshe darted past the congressman into her office slipped between the electric typewriter stand and the table holding the television set and caught up the receiver in midring hello she answered the presidents office for a suspended moment she heard nothing more than the wavy swooshing sound that indicates a longdistance call then a voice came on a strange voice from far away and it said is this the white house who is this this is the presidents personal secretary miss foster may i ask who is calling oh miss fostermiss foster and suddenly edna felt goose pimples on her arms and a chill across her back for the disembodied voice was quavering and frantic miss fosterthis is zwinnambassador zwinn in frankfurtmiss foster the voice seemed to be choked and then it shouted out theres been a terrible emergency get me someonetalleyget me talley with emergency with terrible emergency edna found herself shivering and the receiver in her right hand shaking one secondone second please she blinked at the open door to the cabinet room and screamed out governor talley governor come here something terrible has happened talley burst through the door on the run puzzled curious searching her face she merely wagged her head wordlessly and shoved the receiver into his hands as he took up the telephone she backed away from the desk and could see the room rapidly filling with the others all looking from her to talley wonderingly   who talley was saying into the receiver zwinn oh ambassador i didnt know his speech halted as abruptly as if his throat had been cut he listened and listened and as he did so his lips began to move but dumbness remained and his face turned grayer and grayer until it was finally ghostwhite at last he spoke are you sure are you positive the president and then listening lifting his head from the mouthpiece to stare at eaton and the others yes ambassador he was saying again yes i understandi cant believe ityes yes i do believe you ill tell them well get right back to you talley lowered the receiver onto the cradle and stood rooted to the spot a portrait of stunned disbelief eaton came slowly toward him what the devil is wrong wayne what has happened talley tried to speak tried to form the words mouthing them then stuttering them out the prespresidentthe president is dead what eaton grabbed talleys shoulder roughly shaking him what in the hell are you saying who was that what did he say  arthur that was ambassador zwinn part of that building in frankfurt collapsedthat goddam ancient palacethe top caved in on two rooms and one was t cs studywhere he was talking to usthats what happened thats what cut off the call broke down everythingfell on him all of themkilled the presidents dead arthur dead eaton was ashen but controlled are you sure is it certain dead whimpered talley killed instantly blocks slabs of granite fell down on him crushed him they have the body two secret service agents in the room too dead all dead oh godgod what a terrible terrible thing that moment the corridor was flung open and tim flannery burst in crying out have you heard associated press just got the bulletin from frankfurt the president he halted eyes going from one dazed face to the other and then he knew that they had heard eatons face was hidden in his palms and then suddenly he looked up the president dead he said that means the speaker of the housewayne what about the speaker earl macpherson was in there what about him talley did not seem to comprehend eaton spoke louder dammit man is macpherson alive or dead alive muttered talley hei dont knowi think hes in pretty good shapenothing criticaltheyve got him over at the hospital theyre working on him this is the worst tragedy in our history the worst whats going to happen to all of us eaton closed his eyes us he repeated the roof just fell in on us too and when he opened his eyes edna foster could tell for the first time that they were wet it was hard to tell because she was weeping and she did not know if she would ever stop night had come to washington a city like the nation dumbed down in grief and mourning night had come to the late presidents oval office where those who had worked with him and for him who had known him and loved him who had depended upon him and needed him now filled the sofas and armchairs forlorn and disconsolate stood in corners heavyhearted and helpless waiting for they knew not what edna foster eyes swollen lips still quivering came into the office with the latest special editions of the evening newspapers and wobbled through the cheerless room passing out copies all who had been in the cabinet room ten hours before were present here but now there were also many others edna recognized attorney general clay kemmler secretary of the treasury vernon moody cia director montgomery scott senator hoyt watson admiral alfred rivard and at least a halfdozen more of equal standing it seemed that every nook and cranny in the oval room was filled except one and that one the vacant place tonight was the late presidents highbacked black leather armchair behind the buchanan desk having finished passing out the newspapers edna found that she was left with one copy the group beside the french doors that led to the rose garden the group consisting of senator selander representative wickland general fortney and secretary of state eaton were reading the front page of the newspaper that senator selander held out for them or rather edna became aware all were reading the front page except eaton whose attention was disengaged whose attention was turned inward  there was much more to the news story and many more similar stories on the front page but edna foster had no desire to read further casting the newspaper aside she realized that wayne talley and tim flannery were whispering in the doorway to her office now talley was returning heading for arthur eaton stand by edna he said then reaching eaton he said they have an open line to frankfurt no word on macpherson yet hes been almost three hours in surgery tim spoke to ambassador zwinn briefly the first phase of the operation was successful but theres still a way to go but everyone is feeling better they expect to swear macpherson in the minute he comes out of the anesthetic i think tim and i better draft a press release there are more than a thousand accredited correspondents out there baying for news go ahead said eaton disinterestedly talley hesitated i know howhow you still feel arthur i know how close t c was to you i cant get used to it myself im numb who would have ever dreamt that such a thing go draft that release said eaton curtly then he added let me know the second you receive any flash on mac okay edna saw talley signal her edna he said tim and i need you i know its tough but we have to dictate something about macpherson succeeding t c as president dumbly edna foster nodded her assent hating this moment of surrender of bitter truth when her employer would be supplanted by another she followed the presidential aide into her small office shut the door behind her and observed that tim flannery had already drawn up two folding chairs since he and talley were sitting she went around the desk to take her accustomed place in the walnut swivel chair she located her shorthand pad and several sharp pencils flannery waved toward the pencils dont take anything yet edna wayne and i want to talk this out first flannery had already handed the aide a sheaf of papers which talley was studying intently everything here talley inquired still reading everything said flannery the boys on the judiciary committee pitched in and also the justices gave us material and for the background we had the legislative reference service at the library of congress busy youll find the presidential succession acts of   and  in full with pertinent sections marked out then theres a lot of legal and background data all severely condensed isnt it amazing how you go along and never think of anything like this said talley youd think id know most of this but i dont i know eight presidents died in office before t c but i never knew this that eight vicepresidents died in office also nine vicepresidents counting poor porter ten days ago talley looked up blankly christ i forgot all about him today seems to have blotted everything else out half listening edna doodled on her pad then as talley read on she began to print the names of the nine presidents including t c who had died in office she printed william harrison zachary taylor abraham lincoln james garfield warren harding franklin d roosevelt john f kennedy and then t c she counted eight who was the ninth then she remembered and printed the name of william mckinley between garfield and harding next she tried to think of the vicepresidents who had died in office she could think of only elbridge gerry henry wilson garret hobart and porter and not another finally she gave up there was no use thinking about it she felt ill she heard talleys strained voice i somehow believed that almost every president who didnt finish his term was assassinated but it says here that not more than four were shot down lincoln garfield mckinley and kennedy said flannery fingers pressing his forehead harrison and harding died in part of pneumonia taylors death was caused by cholera morbus fdr suffered a cerebral hemorrhage like porter incredible but poor t c was the only one ever to be snuffed out by an accident he shrugged i suppose it had to happen to someone sometime then he added wretchedly only why did it have to be t c edna had been watching tim flannery as he spoke and there was a sweetness about him behind his whole facade of forced factuality that she liked very much he was a tall irishman with unruly rust hair and a small reddish mustache and a wide ingenuous florid face now puffy and blotched by sorrow he looked as tweedy as his suits with their leather elbow patches and he had been a midwest newspaperman who had written several highly respected history books on the side it said much for him that most of the cynical white house press corps and her own george among them liked tim flannery chrisamighty but im sure not in the mood for this governor talley was saying his one crossed eye contemplated the ceiling and then reluctantly came down to the papers in his hands well guess somebodys got to do it might as well get it over with    let me see tim says here that speaker earl macpherson will fill one year and five months of t cs unexpired term is that correct give or take a few days yes said flannery almost inaudibly he seemed to make an effort to pull himself together all the past vicepresidents who succeeded presidents had over three years of unexpired terms to fill except filmore who served two years and eight months of taylors term and coolidge who picked up one year and seven months of hardings unexpired term and lyndon johnson who served one year and three months of kennedys unexpired term macpherson will have a long enough way to go in thein the presidency yes he will said talley with gravity he touched the sheaf of papers in his hand you say here this is the first time in our history we have ever lost both men elected to serve us for four years never happened before said tim flannery but as clinton rossiter wrote in the american presidency this is no guarantee for the future how right he was flannery pointed to the sheaf of papers did you notice that other quotation from rossiter which one flannery had bent forward and pointed to a paragraph on the top page right there he read it aloud  if we are only poorly prepared for a double vacancy we are not prepared at all for a multiple vacancy and it is this kind of vacancy so i am told by colleagues who deal in the laws of probability that we are most likely to be faced with during the next hundred years and beyond  tally frowned im not interested in that im interested in the facts tim nothing else were faced with a double vacancy not a multiple one lets check the presidential succession act of  just get it straight before we dictate the release to edna he had begun turning the pages and at last he found it here it is okay clear and simple if the presidency and vicepresidency are vacant the speaker of the house of representatives shall upon his resignation as speaker and as representative in congress act as president  his gaze moved down the page yes clear enoughpresident vicepresident speaker of the house and after that the order of succession is president pro tempore of the senate secretary of state secretary of the treasury secretary of defense attorney general and so forth through the cabinet he raised his head any speaker even come half this close to the presidency before not while speaker no said tim flannery one former speaker polk was later elected president but none ever okay theres always got to be a first time said talley he handed the papers back to the press secretary so its the speaker of the house grumpy old earl macpherson himselfwhod have believed it possible okay thats the law and no matter how we feel we might as well start dictating some kind of press announcement flannery snapped his fingers i forgot to get a capsule of macphersons background some of that should be in too definitely said talley flannery twisted in his chair toward edna can you be a good girl and fetch representative harvey wickland in here he can give us what we need for now on macpherson edna came out of her swivel chair hastened to the door leading to the presidents oval office opened it and then halted surprised everyone in the crowded room was on his feet all converging upon arthur eaton who stood in the center of the room in the middle of the eagle of the united states design woven into the thick green presidential rug edna turned to flannery and talley somethings happening she exclaimed everyones gathering around secretary eaton immediately talley and flannery jumped to their feet pushing past her into the room toward eaton reluctantly edna followed them toward the center of the oval office eaton his voice dry and low was speaking aloud i have just been called outside to take a telephone call from frankfurt i have terrible news to report to all of you terrible news and it grieves me speaker of the house earl macpherson died in surgery on the table under the knife ten minutes ago this has been confirmed now the speaker is also dead a great gasp swelled through the room and off somewhere there was someone hysterically sobbing and after that there was a sickening silence edna heard tim flannery beside her whisper almost to himself multiple vacancy the first to be heard speaking aloud was governor wayne talley i dont believe it the second to be heard aloud was arthur eaton it is true then it was that general pitt fortney called out who in the hell is t cs successor  arthur eaton held up his head according to the presidential succession act of  the next in line is the presidents pro tempore of the united states senate for strange and suspenseful seconds the secretary of states pronouncement hung in the air and those who heard it were immobilized allowing it to sink into their minds as the curved walls with their niches and shelves of dead mementos seemed to close in on them the president pro tempore of the senate the attorney general intoned as someone might intone amen and then at once all at once collectively each in the room seemed to realize who this was who their next president of the united states was and all at once all of them collectively turned their gaze upon the one man who stood somewhat apart from them near the buchanan desk everyone it seemed was staring at senator douglass dilman and for edna it was frightening to see that in each persons eyes without exception there was registered a look of horror 
within thirty minutes the group grown larger from the arrival of other members of the government had assembled in the cabinet room they stood now in the semicircle with an opening in the center for two still photographers and two television cameramen representing the press pool clustered around the sevenfoot dark mahogany table once while waiting eaton had asked douglass dilman if he had any close relatives or friends in the city whom he might wish to have witness the ceremony he had replied in an undertone no sir no one once minutes ago eaton had beckoned to edna and tim flannery and demanded a bible there was much scurrying about but no copy of the bible was to be found until edna remembered the one in the lower drawer of her desk she had gone to get it and found the cheap battered bible a gideon bible she had borrowed from a hotel room in memphis once on a trip with t c and had forgotten to return and which she now retained for reference purposes guiltily she had brought in the gideon bible and given it to eaton she found herself still standing beside eaton who leaned against the highbacked leather chair bearing the tiny brass nameplate secretary of state she heard eaton inquire of senator dilman do you wish this open on any particular passage she heard dilman reply psalms  slowly eaton leafed through the book and then he said is this it except the lord build the house they labour in vain that build it except the lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain  he glanced inquiringly at dilman and dilman swallowed his adams apple bobbing and said yes sir that is it it was during this moment that noah f johnstone chief justice of the supreme court came through the corridor door and across the room gravely nodding at the familiar faces turned toward him even without his robes edna thought even in his bow tie and dark suit the chief justice appeared impressive he was a giant of a man with a slight stoop and an uneven gait his sunken face wrinkled and wise betrayed no emotion he came around the cabinet table into the glare of klieg lights nodding to talley and then to dilman and eaton and he took his position behind t cs old chair are we ready he inquired of no one in particular and then he accepted the open gideon bible from eaton squinted down at it and said to dilman take the holy book in your left hand and raise your right hand i will recite the oath of office as it is written in article ii section  of the constitution of the united states when i have finished please repeat the oath he proffered the bible to dilman who took it and held it with difficulty in his left hand and raised his trembling right hand chief justice johnstone lifted his own right hand and measuring each word he rendered the oath of office when he was done he waited after a painful interlude douglass dilmans thick lips moved and the words that he repeated came out low and slurred i douglass dilman do solemnly swear that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states he halted and looked around the room bewildered as if seeking a friend in a company of strangers the harsh kliegs blended with the light of the overhead neon grill made the witnesses to the historic tableau seem ghostly he had lowered his right hand and suddenly chief justice johnstone reached out and grasped dilmans right hand in his own and shook it mr president the chief justice was saying we deeply mourn the passing of our beloved past president but the continuity of our government the welfare of our country must stand above any one individual in these perilous times our hearts go out to you for your double burden and may the lord in heaven bless you and watch over you as the new chief executive of this nationandas the first negro to become president of the united states  it was the muffled sound of argument that awakened him there was a thin line of ache behind his forehead as he listened sorting and separating the muffled sound into two sounds the first shrill and feminine cross and indignant the second low and male calm and placating his head was deep in the fat pillow so deep that when he turned he could not see the time the pillow had been handmade by aldora almost doublesized and stuffed with gray goose down and presented to him on their first anniversary so long ago when their marriage still had hope the cross fire of altercation beyond his bedroom wall increasingly abrasive continued louder he lifted himself ever so slightly on his forearm and was able to make out the time on the electric clock humming upon the end table beside the bed it was eight fiftytwo and although the room was darkened by the drawn shades he knew that it was morning he realized that he had meant to be awakened earlier had meant to set the alarm but had forgotten to do so before falling asleep the shutoff lever on his telephone had banished all calls and in his utter exhaustion he had slumbered on and on it was shameful he thought behind the headache and as always to do anything shameful alarmed him other men could afford mistakes small and large but he could afford none not the smallest one several times during his residence in washington he had awakened with the remnant of the same dream that he had been treading water in an enormous aquarium and that all its sides were painted with blue eyes staring at him the shimmering fragment of dream had always left him uneasy but now the private hook of humor that he possessed but had not dared to reveal to anyone but wanda and his closest friends extricated him from the fish bowl and he was free to admit to himself that he had performed his first act as the president of the united states he had overslept suddenly the enormity of what had happened last night and of what he was oppressed him with its unreality and automatically forced him to retreat into the cup of the down pillow he had he remembered been told by someone last night that after formally resigning from the senate he had become the president of the united states at ten thirtyseven in the evening he had not been returned to his brownstone row house until after one oclock in the morning it was almost impossible to recollect what had taken place in the time between he had signed something yes his first official signing he had affixed his name to the proclamation that poor speaker macpherson was sup  posed to have signed the same statement that had been hastily prepared for the speaker and was to have been flown to frankfurt this proclamation was the official announcement of t cs funeral and the period of national mourning he had listened to secretary of state arthur eaton and governor wayne talley expound on the critical roemer conference and he had not absorbed a word of it he had sat with them smoking cigars until his eyes smarted and his throat felt blistered and he had sat with the sympathetic press secretary yes tim flannery the redhead preparing the carefully worded release to all the news media then others had swum about them senators and representatives whom he had known during work hours for years and t cs cabinet members whom he had hardly known at all and they had spoken of approaches and strategies and public relations and the party and he had been grateful that they had addressed eaton and talley and flannery and not himself he had been almost physically ill from the tension of the events of that day and evening and after midnight there had been a stirring and rising and he had been released guided to a cadillac limousine outside the south portico he remembered protesting against the two secret service agents who had entered the limousine with him and protesting with embarrassment against both the motorcycle escort of police which had preceded him and the second car of agents which had followed him to his home he recalled the scene outside his home and how he had begged hugo gaynor the chief of secret service who had followed him into his living room to go home and how gaynor had been adamant about staying and he remembered how he had surrendered from exhaustion desiring only to escape to his bedroom and sleep alone away from the blue eyes around the glass aquarium the sound of the argument beyond his bedroom wall was persisting it had probably been going on steadily in the seconds of his introspection and now at last he was able to place himself accurately in the time of day and the routine of his former life and he knew what was going on in his living room it was crystal and a secret service agent who were locked in debate crystal had come to him through an employment agency during his fourth term in the house of representatives and because he had been alone and was still alone she had grown fiercely maternal in her devotion to his comfort five days a week she appeared at eightthirty to prepare his breakfast make his bed clean his flat market for him she worked until twelvethirty then disappeared to tend to her own home which included her sisters family and then returned at threethirty remaining to cook and serve his dinner often not leaving until eight oclock in the evening she was a poor cook a burner of toast and a slipshod housekeeper a sweeper under the rug but she was prompt loyal busy and relatively unobtrusive that is until recently when she had taken to carrying on always quoting her brotherinlaw a gas station attendant about the tumerite group who were out to ruin the one chance that the colored folk would ever have for economic improvement through that rehabilitation subsidy act for negroes that was being talked about at once the reason for the altercation in the living room was clear to him crystal had arrived as usual and found the secret service waiting which was unusual the irresistible force had collided with the immovable object douglass dilman threw aside his electric blanket and swung out of bed he stood up straightening his blue pajamas stuck his feet into the misshapen slippers picked his polkadot cotton robe off the chair and pulled it on he walked to the bureau mirror and looked at himself his black kinky hair as always after sleep was shoved high into a peak at the back of his head he took the widetoothed comb and ran it through his full hair smoothing down the peak he poked at the inner corners of his bloodshot eyes to wipe and clear them he studied his broad indelicate countenance he was darkwell black but not coalblackand his features were negroid his forehead was high his nose full and wide his lips heavy and protruding at fiftytwo years of age he was overweight not yet fat but stocky and thick tim flannery he remembered had asked for the statistics last night and he had said that he was five feet ten inches cheating a halfinch for more stature and  pounds his appearance a bigcity ward heeler had once told him worked for him his lack of height his tackiness the antithesis of the fearsome young negro buck combined with mild refined caucasian speech and mannerisms made him more acceptable to the white labor voters his unmistakable negro features made him authentic and agreeable to the black menial voters oftentimes in the past he had wished that he could be all one or the other like the members of his family pitiful dead aldora had been light tan often mistaken for a spaniard and he was sure this had contributed to what had happened wretched julian his son was as dark as himself black really but possessed of features less coarse than his own pathetic mindy his daughter was or had been when he had last set eyes on her six years ago white and beautiful white and lovely which had pleased her mother had worried him had made julian resentful and had made mindy herself haughty and impossible he thought that he heard crystals sharp voice through the wall wake him up she was demanding he knotted the belt of his robe crossed to the door went through the narrow hallway and turned left into the living room the sight that met him was not unexpected beneath the arch that led from the entry hall into the living room stood the shiny bulging crystal shapeless in her tent of brown coat still holding the morning newspapers in one hand and the inevitable huge straw basket for leftovers for her sisters hound in her right hand blocking her way stood lanky elderly hugo gaynor chief of the secret service the wellproportioned excalifornia athlete whom dilman recognized as lou agajanian chief of the white house detail of the secret service it was crystal who saw dilman first she waved her fat hand and shrieked senator they wont let me ini gotta get up breakfast gaynor spun around and agajanian did the same and both were instantly respectful and apologetic mr president gaynor said we have no idea who this lady is we cant let people without credentials in here simply because they say they work for you can you imagine what dilman nodded shes quite safe mr gaynor crystal has been my housekeeper for years i should have advised you last night    hello mr agajanian i think weve met once or twice    good morning crystal its all right now you can come in obediently the agents parted backed off and the magic of it made crystals eyes bulge her unsubtle black face was almost comically transformed from indignation to triumph to pleasure to awe she waddled toward dilman halted eyes widening ii almost forgot to say senatorpresidentmr presidentbut i want to be the first to congratulate you and also for my sister and brotherinlaw and the kids thank you crystal thank you she began to go sideways still awed and then she stopped we stayed up late and it was all over the television everyone was sorry about the others but were happy that if it had to be then mercy were sureenough happy it is you ii almost didnt come here this morning i was sort of sure youd be in the white house with a special fancy staff and not needing me any more dilman smiled i wont be in the white house for a while and you can be sure crystal ill want you then as much as i want you now she seemed overwhelmed with relief thank you senamrmr president suddenly her round face broke into a toothy smile enamel  and gold and she said ill have to take lessons how to talk to you whatll it be this special morning anything special the same as always crystal give me fifteen minutes or so ive got to shower and dress she was off to the dining room and kitchen straw basket swinging and dilman smiled at the two secret service executives shes here every day he said and weekends her niece comes in gaynor said well have to trouble you for a full list of your employees and friends youll have it today mr president there are a number of calls that have come in anything important i dont believe anything urgent the secretary of state wants to speak to you when youre up oh yes one personal callwell he phoned two or three times from new yorka young man claims to be your son julian thats right mr president gave the name julian dilman said hed call back again at half past nine all right better give me time to get myself cleaned up and into some clothes he started to go then said over his shoulder you can ask crystal to make something for you you must be starved thank you mr president the two secret service officers said in duet the tone of their voices hung inside douglass dilmans ears as he walked back to the bedroom he was attuned to every nuance of every utterance that came from his white colleagues the changeable inflection of speech was their civilized weapon of subtle mockery and superiority without insult even when you were a congressman this was their best weapon when they found that your skin was black and thin you could not prove disrespect but you could know its vibrations he remembered one committee hearing when general pitt fortney had appeared as a witness before him and the others he had posed a question and fortneys reply in print on the record had been beyond reproach in writing it was a general replying sensibly to a senator across the committee tables verbalized it had been a west point white general speaking downward to a semiliterate jigaboo perhaps he had been oversensitive that time and on several other recent occasions for years he had tried to curb his excessive sensitivity as other men tried to reduce their weight it took diligent unremitting work it could be done but then every once in a while you put on sudden sensitivity as you put on extra weight and suffered for the added burden throwing aside his robe entering the bathroom he decided that the two secret service heads gaynor and agajanian had been courteous in their behavior and now it seemed reasonable that they should have been to their dedicated eyes a mr president was a mr president whether he was grover cleveland or woodrow wilson or dwight d eisenhower or t c or douglass dilman all that mattered to them their jobs their future their pride was that they keep the pounds of flesh entrusted to them whatever its pigmentation alive he unbuttoned his pajama top stripped it off and removed the pajama trousers opening the shower door he adjusted the knobs inside then started the spray of water finding soap and cloth he wondered how many other white men would be as courteous as his bodyguards the personalities whose speeches he had heard whose bright remarks he had heard whose prejudices he had known crossed his mind the southern congressmen the northern committeemen the western rightists the eastern ivy league snobs a son of ham he thought in the white house in the oval office of the west wing in the highest seat extant in this red white and blue not black republic despite the old prediction of robert kennedy as attorney general that there could be a negro in the presidency in thirty or forty years there had been no one of equal stature then or now no matter how wise or liberal who believed that it could happen then or in this century yet it had happened by accident stepping into the shower cell he knew that he had been insulated since last night from what was happening out there in the capital city in the cities of the fifty states how stunned the american people must be this hour to learn they would have to look up to an outsider a member of the tenpercent black minority of their white country it was not the first spray of die shower that chilled him but the first realization of what had happened and how wildly it would be resented he remembered the short poem how odd of god to choose the jews he paraphrased it how odd of god to choose me to choose one who had already gone high enough too high for comfort and had wanted nothing higher for himself one who wished only to be limited to his legislative height where reticence and diffidence would still keep him an unresented exhibit that was a sop to the liberal conscience of the north then the chief justices wrenching words of last night came back to him may the lord in heaven bless you and watch over you  as the first negro    president of the united states his limbs felt weak so weak and his heart thudded inside its chest cavity there were a million white men who were right for the job there were a thousand black men who would have bravely and defiantly welcomed the godsent opportunity and called it godsent yet something something had gone wrong up there the lord had poked his heavenly finger at the wrong name and now it was too late he wanted to rebuke the maker for his blunder and then strangelyout of respect to the memory of his mother and father and aunts in the midwest earth out of fear of the hellfire that had been sounded in that old michigan church in the room behind the brokendown social club when he was in knee pants he was humble before that god and the son of god and his bitterness and fear really it was deepdown cringing fear turned to shame this was no place for kneeling but when there was the time and the place he would beg forgiveness and beg for help yet jesus jesus why did it have to be himself douglass dilman who was not white and who was afraid of being black and who was without armor or grace then as the showers liquid needles warmer now hit his soapy chest and the foam ran down his stomach and thighs and as he absently rubbed himself with the soapy cloth and allowed the stream of water to dissolve the soap he thought that his position despite his secret inadequacy was not entirely bad his mind went backward to last night or the early hours of the morning when the white house limousine had taken him home what had happened then was in retrospect heartening when he had become a member of the house of representatives he had leased the upstairs frot apartment of a red brick twostory apartment building between georgia avenue and sixteenth street the three rooms and kitchenette modest and clean had been sufficient to serve his widower existence the location had been comfortably in the midst of a onetime white neighborhood now occupied by upperclass negroes but the apartment had become too small for him senator espinosa who had become senile and disabled had resigned twothirds of the way through his term the governor of dilmans state to strengthen his position with his vast negro voting populationwhich had trebled with the influx of colored families from the southand with the liberal union leaders had appointed dilman to espinosas vacant office for the two years remaining dilman as senator had found himself briefly a nineday celebrity having left washington dc to campaign in a preponderantly negro district for his fourth house term he had returned to washington as a senatorial appointee one of the few negroes to achieve so high a seat in government he had been the subject of a lead article in such magazines as life look time and newsweek and he had made the covers of ebony and sepia he had vaguely felt a freak and been discomfited but encouraged by the party bosses he had cooperated with one and all it had been during this transitional period when he had been the object of so much attention when his mail had swelled when he had received callers mostly political mostly pressure that he had decided that his rented apartment could no longer serve him he had found that the parlor and kitchenette were too cramped and there was need of a study and library at home he had begun to search for a larger apartment but the rents demanded had appalled him gradually he had decided that it might be wisest to buy a house washington was after all his adopted city and would likely remain his home for years to come while he was a senator from his state by appointment and only for a short period and while he had no idea if he would be a senator again he was confident that he could regain his old house seat and even if that were not possible he could go into private law practice in the capital city where with a population  per cent negro a highly reputed negro attorney would have enough client to keep him occupied and secure guided by real estate brokers he had visited three brownstones in his neighborhood and in each instance had felt that the house was overpriced and too expensive for his meager savings the fourth brownstone had come to his attention by chance seated one morning behind his desk in the old senate office building he had learned that the reverend paul  spinger was in his reception room eager to see him a visit paid by spinger was not in itself unusual spinger as director of the largest negro organization in america the crispus society had often come to dilman to discuss civil_rights legislation that morning as far as dilman could  recall there had been no immediate business to discuss he had invited reverend spinger in and the elderly but energetic clergymanlobbyist had said that the word was around that dilman wanted to buy a house if true he happened to know of a house not yet on the market whose owner j had to sell in a hurry and which might be bought at a reasonable price j in view of its value as an investment it was a tenroom twostory brownstone off sixteenth street on van buren northwest and it was a bargain at  it was spinger had said a solid aged abode that one day could stand remodeling but was comfortable enough and well located on the fringe of the wealthier negro section near walter reed general hospital spinger knew about the house in advance he had said because he and his wife rose and a boarder had rented the upstairs for several years the landlord had lived downstairs half jokingly spinger hoped that senator dilman would consider it if someone else bought the house they might need all ten rooms and evict the spingers the senator spinger had reasoned was a widower with his son in boarding school and would have no need for more than the downstairs rooms i senator dilman had gone with the clergyman to visit the brownstone i and he had been enchanted by the quiet residential street with its maple trees the small green front lawn the walk up to the entry hall the generous comfortable rooms and nineteenthcentury fixtures immediately he had bargained for it and closed the deal that had been five years ago more than five years ago and not one day had dilman regretted the financial encumbrance for to this brownstone off sixteenth street dilman owed not only his first real pleasure in having a place where he belonged but also his enduring relationship with wanda gibson and because of last night he owed to this house his first feeling of acceptance as the new and accidental chief executive of the united states last night he thought and then his memory held on last night the feeling of acceptance had come at some time after one oclock in the morning as his chauffeured limousine turned into van buren street dilman sandwiched between the secret service agents had become aware of a phenomenon this was a welloff negro neighborhood but a hardworking one and its inhabitants went to sleep early the thoroughfare was always blanketed in darkness well before midnight but last night after midnight the street was lighted with illumination from every house and alive as a mardi gras and then as they had neared his brownstone dilman realized that van buren street was thickly lined on both sides with people neighbors and others of the capital city who had come to be the first to set eyes upon americas new president when the limousine had drawn up before his front lawn and he had emerged the size of the crowd in attendance had overwhelmed him almost one thousand persons he had guessed the faces many recognizable had been mostly black but there were whites here and there although dilman had been unable to discern if they were reporters secret service agents or simply curiosity seekers of the kind who rushed to accidents as he had walked between the agents to his front door the applause had begun then swelled and there had been cheers dilman had paused deeply moved and had exhaustedly waved and waved and then gone inside his house  he had fallen asleep so quickly he now supposed because after the first fear and trepidation the paralysis induced by change and sudden elevation he had been warmed by friendship and approval but now the harsher light of morning was upon him the soothing blackness was gone the uncertain whiteness waited he shut off the shower emerged dripping onto the bath mat quickly dried himself then went into the bedroom to dress this was a momentous day and perhaps he would be expected to attire himself specially for it he considered his dressiest sunday black suit then decided that it would be awkward in the morning he settled for the charcoal one he had purchased readymade at garfinkels for his first appearance as temporary presiding officer of the senate during the vicepresidents last trip abroad six months before his death  as he dressed himself his mind compulsively revived one more event of last night one that had taken place a few minutes before he retired sitting on his bed last night wondering if the secret service men in the living room could hear his voice he had dialed the spingers upstairs the phone had hardly begun to ring when it was answered the voice he had recognized as belonging to rose spinger hello rose i hope i didnt wake you this is doug her response had been pitched high with excitement oh doug we hopedheavens i mustnt be calling you doug any more or even senator or landlord he had smiled to himself tiredly please rose no formality nothing has changed between us i thank you doug oh my heavens to think of it did you see us outside in front in that mob waving to you im not sure i saw wanda for a second of course you would have were all so thrilled were sorry for that accident in europe but since it was gods will were happy you will be there to guide us we need you doug we all need you and the reverend says this is the hand of providence    oh heavens hes telling me to be quiet and let you speak to wanda all right except i want to say for the reverend and myself from our hearts that we wish you strength and courage thank you rose i need that the reverend went to knock on wandas door shes still up shell pick up her phone in a second ill wait thanks rose in the seconds that he waited his brain had become alive and projected the early pictures of wanda gibson when he had bought this brownstone five years ago and while it was still in escrow he had been invited to dinner by the spingers to celebrate his acquisition he had met the spingers before many times but always about the hill or at crispus society affairs or at parties given by african embassies near sheridans circle this was the first time that he had accepted an invitation to their home twice as a representative he had been asked to their dinners and twice he had declined with fabricated excuses as a member of the house he had not wanted to be in the position of having to answer to white colleagues who might charge that as a negro he was being used by the head of the most important negro organization his timidity had been ridiculous he had known especially since other negro congressmen and white liberals had attended those dinners in a natural way and had enjoyed rose spingers cooking thereafter he had told himself that if he was ever invited again he would accept the familiar timidity had assailed him but one more time just before signing the escrow papers on the brownstone house he had wondered what those on the hill would think once it got out about a senator owning a house in which he permitted the leader of americas largest minority pressure group to live nobody apparently had cared perhaps oilman thought wryly because nobody apparently cared what he did at any time in the senate until his surprising selection in party caucus to serve as president pro tempore of the body when vicepresident porter was out of town or ill few had seemed aware of his existence he was one of a hundred names on the roll call rarely absent but almost always silent and withdrawn he made no speeches gave no interviews introduced no bills and he went along with the party and t c and everyone even though after filling espinosas unfinished term as senator he had been endorsed by the party to run on his own with strong negro and labor support against a weak opponent destroyed by a graft expose four days before the voting and he had been reelected to the senate on his own he had felt an interloper he had accepted the spingers third invitation to dinner not as a senator but as their landlord and he had gone unafraid knowing at last that no one not even such southern redneck mouthpieces as representative zeke miller or senator bruce hankins cared or gave a damn there had been six of them at that intimate dinner at the spingers five years ago the host and hostess a colored engineer and his colored teacher wife himself as the personage and guest of honor and wanda gibson it had been his initial meeting with wanda gibson and for the first time in the many years since aldoras death he had realized that affection and desire within him had not atrophied but had only been sublimated even then five years ago wanda had not been a girl but a mature womana lady he had always thought of her as being a ladyof thirtyone when he had been fortyseven she was a graduate of the university of west virginia with economics as her major and she had worked for her favorite professor in morgantown and charleston and followed the professor known for his liberal books to washington d c when he accepted a government advisory job in the latter part of the lyndon johnson administration when t c had become president and wandas professor had gone back to his university she had stayed on in washington for the last two years she had held a wellpaying position as executive secretary to the director of vaduz exporters in nearby bethesda maryland from the first dilman had known that wanda was a remarkable find her intelligence and wit her good nature and humor her wellbred manner had made it seem incredible that she had not ever been married as he came to know her better dilman had come to understand her avoid ance of marriage her parents who had lived in west virginia where her father had been a shortorder cook dishwasher janitor in an allnight diner servicing coal miners had sacrificed much of their comfort and the futures of her younger brother and sister to educate and launch her when first one parent and then the other had been hospitalized and afterward confined to costly sanitarium care wanda had accepted full responsibility to support and look after them not only as daughter but as debtor she had a burden and she could not discard it in favor of marriage for which she was so perfectly suited but two years ago her father had died and less than a year ago her mother and at last wanda had been free to live her own life as her own person she had expected him to propose marriage last spring dilman knew and he had not and it had created for the first time an undercurrent of unhappiness between them she had known that he wanted her for his wife he had known that he needed her the proposal was up to him and yet while he could profess affection and love articulate his need for her he could not bring her from upstairs to his downstairs flat as wife he had thought about it a thousand times since spring and had known that the failure was entirely his own marriage was an affirmative act and he had been shackled by countless negative fears he had tried time and time again to narrow in on specific fears small ones avoiding the major one until at last he could see what was left and what in himself taunted him with contempt wanda gibson was a mulatto that was the center of it as a mulatto she was more white in appearance than black in most communities she could have passed for white her hair while brunette and curling was soft and long her eyes were light brown her nose delicate and upturned and her lips and mouth small her figure was trim well hipped but otherwise slender she considered herself a colored woman and she lived as a colored woman but for douglass dilman how she regarded herself and how she approached her life were not assurances enough the nagging cowardice within him that avoided marriage to the one good companion of his life was his fear of how she would look beside him and how this would affect his political career with wanda as his mate he would appear blacker with himself as her mate she would appear whiter whatever the facts and truth it would give the impression of an interracial marriage it might not cause talk in washington and in his home state but on the other hand it might it was an unnecessary risk it would rock the boat in times like this or at least it might dilmans solution had been to avoid the issue the weekly platonic meetings had continued the senator and his ladylike lady friend in the spinger living room in the loges of loews capitol theater and ever so occasionally in the golden ox or the lincoln inn recently dilman had become aware each rendezvous had been less comfortable less warm and communicative it was as if they were both present each desiring the company of the other but now that she was free of parental commitment and he was temporary presiding chairman of the senate there had fallen a thick steel grill between them you could see you could hear you could not touch you were two not one and might never be one and wanda gibson for all her evenness of temperament and understanding had begun to resent this failure in douglass dilman since his invisible antenna of sensitivity had picked up and recorded her disappointment in him dilman had recently taken to reviewing and brooding over this relationship and his own life some weeks ago he had almost arrived at the decision to propose marriage and to the devil with the consequences if any after all he had asked himself in a practical way how could he any longer be hurt but then he had been sidetracked by his activity and sham importance in serving the senate in the vicepresidents place and now overnight cruel destiny had touched him he had become the president of the united states the personal choice ahead was clearcut should he be james buchanan or grover cleveland buchanan had been the only unmarried president to serve his country cleveland had been the only chief executive to be married in the white house when the choice was weighed thus the scales tipped toward buchanan a showy wedding like clevelands in the blue room before the world and the press a marriage to a mulatto a mulatto who might almost be mistaken for white would merely serve to incense the enemies of his race his uncertain position and precarious image before a broken and divided country would be worsened this had been his rationale last night as he waited the telephone receiver in his hand to hear wandas voice his private decision he had known was neither courageous nor honest it was merely expedient and political it solved nothing but simply traded off a personal problem to avoid a more fearsome one gazing down at the receiver in his left hand he had wondered why under the circumstances he was trying to speak to her at all at least at this time he had no idea what he could say to her yet somehow as president of the united states for more than three hours he had to speak to someone before sleeping and then waking to the terrible fact and the only one who might care about him reassure him was wanda as he waited for wanda his mind drifted to mindy his attitude toward the two of them was one and the same he avoided taking a wife he needed for the same reason that he did not seek out a daughter he loved he was black and still afraid hello doug she was calling down to him through a wire from upstairs and yet she had never been farther away wanda i wanted toto say good night before going to sleep doug its overwhelming the whole thing what does one say do i congratulate you that sounds wrong you commiserate with me and with the whole country no dontdont talk like that its not true that accident in frankfurt was horrible but it happened doug those things happen remember how we once talked about what we were doing the moment that we learned fdr had died and how we felt even as youngsters we felt the world had come to an end that we were dying too that there was no hope yet nothing happened to us life went on maybe differently than it might have had he lived but not that differently well doug t c was a good man im sure and popular but he was no fdr and neither was macpherson i know youll do as well as or better than either no one is born to be the only one to be president thousands of men could be president just as well as the one who fought to get the office if it had to be someone else i think it could have been no one better than you wanda dontyou know me too well for thatyou know my weaknesses everyone has weaknesses doug be sensible stand off and look around lincoln had weaknesses and t c had too many to count and probably dozens we couldnt see to count of course you have weaknesses but youre strong enough to handle the job dont discount your strengths i cant forget what you refuse to remember with the kind of background you had all that poverty how did you get through university and law school how did you get elected to the house of representatives four times and then get into the senate and even become its presiding officer it took something doug it took very much i know you maybe as well as anyone knows you maybe better and i am positive the whole countryonce they get over the shock of theof t cs deaththeyll see you for what you are and theyll be proud of you wanda wandayoure doing your best i knowi appreciate it but wanda im blacktomorrow morning  million americans are going to wake up and

sleep iill be here you call me when you can anytime ill be here ill call you tomorrow anytime    now sleep dearest and know we are all with you good night doug good night wanda good night after hanging up he had tried to analyze their talk she had offered him encouragement and her language had been warm and yet toward the end especially he had sensed her remoteness still he had thought as he reached to turn off the bed lamp and then pushed his fatigued body beneath the blanket she was for him and with him no matter how disappointed she might be in him and that was comforting that was something and then he had felt drowsiness and then he had slept
