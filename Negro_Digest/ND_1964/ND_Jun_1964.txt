enriched history for the white man
he milling process j r  £ destroys the vitamins  ii  and sucks the minerals out of our tlour  for years this resulted in malnutrition in families whose diet centered on bread rickety spavined pimply or otherwise defective bodies were the consequence only when the millers accepted the simple suggestion of some genius that they put back what theyd been taking out was this source of social evil stopped the restored product was called enriched flour honest white scholars have most of them come to agree with what negro scholars have long known for many decades reaching back prior to the turn of the century the school subject that was taught as american history wasnt that at all the vitamins of the contribution of the negro to our nation and its heritage and the minerals of the truth about race relations were carefully removed the effect of the resulting mental malnutrition has been devastating to the negro it was destructive of his sense of personal worth of selfrespect of identityexcept when through family traditions or by benefiting from the single virtue of a segregated college he learned some of the truth to the white it was a calamity it contributed largely to a corruption of the spirit rickety and pimply mental and spiritual attitudes were the effect of the bleached history product through the years an awakening and fighting talented tenth has promoted a subject which for lack of a better name has been called negro history w e b du bois and carter g woodson were the founding fathers of the fight until very recently the work of exploiting their breakthroughs was confined within racial channels it was almost exclusively the negro writer editor reader and student who obtained the benefit the result was separate and not very equal it was not the true american heritage the isolated presentation of the story of the negro in america was as incomplete in its own way as the story of america without the negro short of the day when the integrated story would be told two incomplete tales were better than one the average american public school has continued to teach the standard bleached product devitalized at best in its absence of reference to negro achievement and participation in american life poisoned at worst in its falsehoods and distortions concerning the role of the negro in such epochal periods as the abolitionist and the reconstruction eras  this is a problem and an evil that has not been sectional moreover during a period when under the pressure of the negro revolution the moral climate has improved somewhat there has been little mitigation of the faults of the past in  professor lawrence d reddick wrote for the journal of negro history a study of southern u s history texts among his findings the place and development of the negro in the national life since the granting of freedom and citizenship are ignored almost completely    these authors usually depict the negroes as pawns passive instruments in the hands of others during reconstruction in  dr lloyd marcus compiled for the antidefamation league a study of the treatment of minorities in texts the achievements of living negro americans are mentioned in very few books    american negroes are portrayed for the most part in the eras of slavery and reconstruction what comes through in most books is a stereotype of a simple childlike superstitious people    thus what professor reddick saw in the southern school textbooks of the s was found by the bnai briths researchers to be true on a national scale in  lacking in the adl evaluation is one critical fact that the reconstruction sambo stereotype is the product of gross falsehood the cumulative result of a libel on a whole people gross falsehood is a strong phrase not lightly used by one trained as an attorney to be careful in the choice of words but it is not my own it is the phrase of professor arnold rose coauthor with gunnar myrdal of an american dilemma as a sociologist whose principal concern has been with the problem he has studied and evaluated most u s history writings in an effort to get at the roots of bigotry and prejudice in our land he focuses his attention on this issue in his essay in the new book that he edited assuring freedom to the free and how does it happen asks professor rose that most white americans believe this gross falsehood it happens because their teachers teach it in the public schools and the teachers learned it at the teachers colleges and the teachers colleges got it from the professors at the great universities the professors got it not out of scholarly researches but out of the postreconstruction apologies for the south written by negrohaters now a gross falsehood is just another way of saying big lie and those of us who are old enough to remember joseph goebbels know that hitlers masterpropagandist preached and practised the doctrine that a falsehood repeated often enough can enslave the minds of men those whites whose image of the negro is derived solely or primarily from what they have learned in school histories are vexed and perplexed today taught all their lives to believe in the stereotypes that were created to justify separation and inequality they find themselves suddenly preached at and told they have been wrong youve got to be taught to hate and fear ran the song in rodgers and hammersteins interracial hit south pacific youve got to be carefully taught should it surprise us to find that some whites resent moving over and making room foror even extending a friendly hand tothose they were taught to hate when an individual is libeledthe victim of a malicious falsehoodthe law requires retraction or compensation or both what is the remedy for decades of libel against a whole people belatedly educators are coming to see said time magazine commenting on the district of columbias new separate supplemental pamphlet for school history classes the negro in american history that it is high time to desegregate the teaching of u s history not only is it high time it is too little and too late french statesman georges clemenceau is supposed to have said that war is much too important to leave to the generals the need for remedying the misteaching of american history is too vital to leave it to the schools and the teachers the educators have failed us they have bequeathed to us three generations of white americans whose many variants of the question why are they pushing so fast betrays their ignorance of their own heritage as much as it does their utter lack of moral sense there are various schools of psychiatry today differing theories as to how mental illness should be treated most agree that the important objective is to cause the patient to develop insight into his character structure something most effectively accomplished by reexamination of ones early life so that one can get at the root of false beliefs about himself the psychiatrist strives to demonstrate the contradiction between the way a situation actually was and the way the patient thought it was between the way the patient was behaving and the way he thought he was behaving the irrational rejection of human beings because of the shade of skincolorphobiain the united states is the greatest case of mass mental illness in the worlds history it cannot be cured by laws alone nor by simply saying that what was right yesterday is wrong today who is there to do this job that the educators have made necessary this is the hardest part of the fight as the negro revolution moved into its decisive phase loren miller correctly pointed out that freedom nowtoday is a slogan that implies rejection of the dogma that racial reforms must await a change in the hearts and  minds of men what the militants have missed however is that those hard hearts must be moved and those warped minds cured there is nothing sensational glamorous or exciting about history the ambitious or publicityhungry leader sees no percentage in it they debate in their press releases about the resistance the white backlash the need for new toolsand give little attention to the importance of the freedom writer to consolidate the grains that the freedom rider has achieved what is needed as a weapon to win the negro revolution is an adult education program of unimaginably vast proportions its content should neither be called negro history nor constitute merely that there is a hidden american heritage to be unearthed that can enrich us all few white americans know the magnificent life story of frederick douglass one can return again and again to his writings and find a lesson for today but the culturally deprived american has not been told of wendell phillips either or been given his magnificent insights into the nature of the relationship between capital and labor one perceptive theologian prof a j heschel has likened the  phase of the negro revolution to the crossing of the red sea by the israelites there still remained ahead of them the hardships of the wilderness the israelites murmured against moses in the desert and said what shall we drink for there was no water in the same fashion the negro will justly cry out after a civil_rights bill is passed what shall we eat we want adequate education decent housing proper employment there are lessons as to how these problems can be solved in the enriched history that we must all learn the vitamins and minerals that have been removed include not merely the contribution of the negro to our heritage few know the lives and teachings of such great and nearforgotten americans as theodore parker the brook farmers and the other radical reformers of the abolitionist era or john boyle oreilly john peter altgeld and the populists not all of whom became racists of the later nineteenth century the great lesson to be learned is that a war on poverty cannot be waged from the top the poor and the men and women of conscience of the middle class must unite in political action if the causes of poverty are to be removed understanding the past said arthur schlesinger jr can be the key to the future the past is never dead says one of william faulkners characters it is not even past the present condition of the human race is solely a product of its history if that condition is to be changed for the better it can be effectively done only by beginning with a reexamination of that history we must find out what really happened as the psychiatrist says to cure ourselves from the sickness that comes from what we have been deluded into thinking was our past when dr w e b du bois wrote the declaration of independence of the third american revolution the resolutions of the niagara movement of  he said the battle we wage is not for ourselves alone but for all true americans some of the white trash of the north who have been revealed in the last few months will never understand this there is some folks said louis armstrong once that if they dont know you cant tell em but most americans can and will come to learn that the negro revolution is their own cause after they have  relearned their history and cast aside the myths and stereotypes they learned in school will they understand they are not merely doing something for the negro when they ally themselves with him the battle for justice to the negro in our history is but a part of the battle for justice to the whole truth in our history when that is gained ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make ye free 
f for balt i m o r e   gaines the announ cer intones its the seventh inning of a sunday game at tiger stadium in detroit a solidly set negro jogs out to his position peers at the sky and adjusts his sun glasses gaines whos he one fan asks another a shrug some substitute they use him against lefties once in a while i think the second fan was right he would also have been right had he added and aint that something tommy davis a negro was the national leagues best batter in  clarence choo choo coleman also a negro was the worst with a resounding average of  and that is far more significant it is seventeen years since jackie roosevelt for teddy robinson suited up for a game of ball where an apartment house now grows in brooklyn quite likely there are high school seniors born on that cloudy april day in  to whom allwhite baseball belongs with prohibition suffragettes and the depression they know such things once were but why bring up that ancient history to a fan a bit older than seventeen observing the passage of the seasons from a threatened st louis cardinal player strike against robinson to a st louis cardinal lineup with bill white curt flood and bob gibson taking the field the interesting thing is this negroes of varying abilitiesstars almoststars journeymen and shortlived flops have come in played and hung up the routine flowthrough is under way celebrating the fact that colored athletes have achieved the inalienable right to be ordinary and even mediocre big leaguers twas not always thus hardly years after robinson quite literally changed the complexion of the game a negro ballplayer had to be decidedly better than good if he couldnt make it big and quick not for him the luxury of a fairtomiddlin batting average and a seat on the bench at big league pay whats more he was expected to comport himself at all times and under all provocations as a colored little lord fauntleroy toward the opposition and his majesty the umpire robinson seven years after retirement from the game a poor second in the national most famous jackie sweepstakes bore much of the initial brunt of baseballs social progress a lonely figure swinging around the allwhite circuit at phiadelphia boston new york chicago pittsburgh cincinnati and st louis he would wryly tell friends coming out to the game youll be able to tell me by my number  of course they were also able to tell jackie robinson by his electrifying skills with bat glove and flying feet managing to win rookie of the year honors while in the frightful pressure cooker of pioneering must be one of the sports accomplishments of all time two years later he was voted most valuable a tightlipped performer out of agreed necessity at the start by the time he finished he might also have been voted most voluble the real jackie robinson had stood upoutgoing aggressive proud sometimes irritating but rarely dull now three years older than the uniform number he dramatized jackie is portly and quite gray though unmistakably jackie robinson with quickly intense small features nearfalsetto voice and pigeonlike gait many may have already forgotten the characteristic way he went  out in a welter of headlines and conjecture after the  season he was traded by brooklyn to the giants about par for the course in the business of baseball never exactly noted for unwavering devotion to its stars black or white once their usefulness wanes babe ruth was sluffed off by the yankees to the boston braves ty cobb was sent from tigers to as tris speaker from indians to senators dizzy dean from cards to cubs and so it goes baseball owners are less sentimental than baseball fans and usually wealthier just as new york fans were becoming intrigued by the thought of grizzled old number  facing his old team in a crucial game grizzled old number  said the hell with it and became a youthful food chain executive more recently and more quietly finished was larry doby first to make it into the other league though somehow rarely thought of as a symbol six years younger than robinson this brooding outfielders career was cut short by leg muscle in juries which are no respecter of stereotypes about special kinds of muscles beneath black skins there were no big articles about dobys decline and fall nothing summing up the kind of athlete the big leagues second negro had been even at his best there often seemed in the press boxes a feeling of disappointment about larry the tendency was to think of him as one who never fully realized an extravagant potential his temperament it was said hurt him unlike robinson he did not have the ready catharsis of giveandtake articulativeness and sometimes carried his real and fancied grievances into the dugout as a private weight yet a glance back at larry dobys record makes it pertinent to wonder if the mixed judgments were not tinged by the now happily disappearing double standard in which a negro was always expected to be exceptional after all here was a youngster who jumped directly from the haphazard negro leagues to cleveland batted over  as a key regular on a championship club in his first full season and made the allstar game five times in  when cleveland won a record  games doby led the league in home runs and runs batted in hit into only seven double plays and was a superlative defensive center fielder for  games black or white introvert or extrovert thats a lot of ballplayer robinson and doby    these were the first the special ones starting the long overdue process of taking the quotation marks from around americas national pastime partly because of what they went through with so much fortitude  lineups included not only the scintillating likes of willie mays elston howard henry aaron tommy davis maury wills orlando cepeda frank robinson willie mccovey juan pizzaro earl battey vada pinson bill white etc etc but the aforementioned choo choo coleman a yankee substitute named hector lopez and journeyman parttimers such as pumpsie green felix mantilla jake wood bob perry and joe gaines not to knock the latter group like ranking the astronauts its all relative nobody in this highly exacting craft who makes it to the big leagues is an oaf with three thumbs but within the high context of the lands best  ballplayers the greens and mantillas are brothers in ordinariness to lesser lights in whiter epidermis perhaps the paradox of progress to mediocrity can best be seen in the growingly varied caliber of those who have joined jackie robinson and larry doby as negroes who once were big leaguers george crowe muscularly owlish parttime first baseman and pinch hitter  jim pendleton who never quite cut it after a good start    ray noble and charley white a couple of commonplace catchers who moved up but couldnt stay there    bob boyd smalling stylish fielder who set no worlds afire at bat    bob thurman a not quite benchwarmer in fact you name a particular type of ballplayer and by now theres likely to be a negro big leaguer or former big leaguer to fit the description like the highly touted minor league prospect who is too much and cant miss but does pitcher humberto robinson who came to the eager milwaukee braves in  from an astounding season with jacksonville where he led the sally league in victories percentage earned run average shutouts strikeouts and what have you the collegiate bonus beauty who fizzles in the big time earl robinson plucked off the university of california campus with a sizeable check by the dodgers they got their investment back by selling him to baltimore where it was discovered the name robinson does not guarantee stardom the what happened to himt type who seems on the edge of greatness and suddenly poofs out pitcher brooks lawrence the eternal wanderergeorge altman and charley neal about to play for their third team in as many seasons the oneyear wonder flopping as a sophjake wood of detroit the nohit pitcher immediately lapsing back into unevennessearl wilson of bos ton the guy they all gave up on and forgot who returns from minor league exile to all star status leon wagner toast of the poor mans los angeles team the angeles or doesnt one call gene autry a poor man now with the cleveland indians the negro pete reisers real good ones kept from probable hall of fame stature by injuryluke easter and monte irvin theres been the classic version of the rubber armed relief ace used up in one or two fantastic seasons and fading to a premature exit the joe page jim konstanty ted wilks type this was joe black brooklyns rookie of the year in  when he came out of the bullpen  times more than onethird of the games played won  and lost  saved  more and whipped the yankees as a surprise starter in the world series he was never nearly the same thereafter though before anyone shouts how could he be regard the typedefying case of hoyt wilhelm blacks paleface alter ego of  when he relieved for the rival giants no less than  times though blacks great record hoyt too backslide after this frenetic rookie year and in fact was written off as finished some years ago by the giants but here he is older than the longgone black hurling effectively in the american league at the age of  that too is baseball which like life sometimes defies logical explanation all through at  was don newcombe a lumbering giant of a pitcher with tight shoulder muscles who appeared to the opposition as an awesome automaton when he loosened into his midsummer groove don won a staggering  games for the dodgers one year and was mr big in several successful flag drives but was pretty much yankee meat come october he was the first negro pitcher to make it big though not the first negro pitcher that was dan bankhead who drew brooklyn paychecks for three seasons finished too is little sandy amoros who could never quite fill the historic left field gap on the great dodger clubs the conditionedreflex response to his name is great catch on berra in the series which fixes sandy immutably in fan chatter as the colored a gionfriddo an early parttime dodger left fielder who similarly robbed di maggio theyve just about all been up there by now including the player whose name gets a blank who from fans who dont forget many try luis marquez a nonhitting outfielder who made it into a few seasons with the browns we even have the colored elder statesmanjim gilliam who came up as an eager second base rookie after jackie robinsons job in  and is now the sage wisdomdispensing veteran of veterans on the dodgers championship roster not all negro ballplayers can be successfully fitted into general classifications no white parallel comes to mind for the harsh immobilization of the remarkable roy campanella who moved from ebbets field into a wheelchair youd wear yourself out trying to find more than one pitcher who broke into the middle of a hot pennant race as a yearold rookie and turned the tide with a record of six victories and one defeat there are no neat categories for such as the unlikely satchel paige who probably missed being the greatest big league pitcher of all through his mistake of being born twenty years too soon but certainly the casually wide ranging nature of the roster of colored former and present big leaguers seventeen years after jackie robinson suggests there isnt too much of a negro question left on the playing fields of our national pastime
for most of the worlds f g people the union of r south africa is noted for two products both   rockhard and apparently durable though one product is synonymous with wealth while the other is the embodiment of evil the products are diamonds and apartheidthe one a brilliant jewel the other an ignominious political plot the diamonds provide the countryand much of the western worldwith riches which in the way of that world justify whatever else is done to make the riches possible and apartheidwhich means simply racial discrimination on a grandiose scaleprovides the white rulers of the country with the endless supply of cheap black labor needed to dig the diamonds from the earth in recent years however parts of europe africa and the united states have been exposed to still another product from south africa a woman with a talent as firm and dazzling as a diamond and invested with all the bittersweet soulfulness bred by the struggle against apartheids dehumanizing forces she is zensi miriam makeba and her brilliance is a match for any diamond since her arrival in the united states in  miss makeba has appeared on numerous television shows toured the country in a series of concertswith harry belafonte and aloneand entertained in a range of night clubs from the cozy village vanguard in new york to the plush san souci in las vegas there was nothing quite like her then and there is nothing to equal her now she is absolutely unique as all great performers must be and yet paradoxically there is nothing unusual about her consider she is small of staturepetite reallywith large expressive eyes a crown of short unstraightened hair and a pleasant but unpretty face her voice is soft and low altogether feminine but also otherwise unremarkable one has the impression thatin a crowded roomshe might slip unobtrusively into the background and that the other people in the room might leave her there she seems that shy and retiring and that deserving of respect but once she takes the spotlight she is transformed she seems to literally grow in size the dark eyes flash with fire and the voice flows out all honey and steel and crystal following miss makebas opening at new yorks blue angel a few seasons back time magazines hardbitten critic was disarmed the closecropped woolly head and the sleek white fifth avenue gown come from different worlds but the combination has a charm and a grace of its own he wrote in a ballad she maintains the clean classic phrasing of a church singer she can be roguish in a west indian ditty about a naughty flea and she can make a chilling lament of a warriors retreat song    indeed she is a magician with moods within moments she can set her audience laughing leave them awed into silence or bring them close to tears audiences are particularly delighted with her click song a tonguetripping number in which she employs the incredible soundswithinsounds which her people the xhosa pronounced khosa consider routine click song is really qonqgonthwane but it seems few people other than the xhosa can do it justice zensi miriam makeba was born march   in prospect township one of the allblack settlements surrounding johannesburg her father was a schoolteacher and her mother worked as housemaid a job young miriam also later took she attended the kilmerton training institute in pretoria for eight years but dropped out and went to work with her mother when tuition could no longer be paid although she had been singing at school church and at weddings funerals and benefits for years it was not until she was  that miss makeba was invited to join an established group of singers the black manhattan brothers she was the lone girl with  men the group toured the rhodesias and the congo as well as south africa but it was mostly rough going the bus often broke down she recalled and after the first five months i was crying all the time but they kept telling me the show must go on we always managed to get there on time her reputation grew however and she was soon making records and appearing in revues then she was cast as the female lead in the musical king kong based on the life of a local prizefighter and she was on her way the musical did not have easy sledding for it was opposed by racists and banned in some cities still it managed to play in south africa for eight months it was the first time a production written by an african had ever experienced such success and london was interested for months miss makeba had longed to go to london thinking that in england she might earn real money and perhaps achieve the fame routinely denied black entertainers in south africa she had applied for a passport and after nearly two years had received it during the run of king kong american producer lionel rogosin had spotted miss makeba and he offered her a singing role in a movie he was shooting surreptitiously the was movie entered back  africa venice come in the film festival and on the strength of her performance in it miss makeba was invited to venice she was permitted to leave south africa meanwhile rogosin screened his film for steve allen who offered to feature show and miss makeba on his nightclub owner max gordon was persuaded to book her except for flights back to england and africa kenya and tanganyika not south africa she has not been home since but south africa remains home her beloved country makeba confesses thatand miss someday there she wants to go home again not now because as she says down if you arent white you may be a star but youre still a nothing and miriam makeba is certainly something
a new era in race rej  lations ushered in at   birmingham by a peo  pies revolution demands that a major national effort be made to prepare the negro masses to use the rights being won for them such a program is urgently needed because attainment of civil_rights will not secure equality for negroes a program of preparation must go handinhand with desegregation efforts if the problem of secondclass citizenship is to be solved once and for all a negro alliance for progress could be the answer until recently most southern whites have pretended to believe that negroes were satisfied in their status and the majority of other white americans have been either apathetic or indifferent to the negroes plight recent events and incidents have caught the whites ill preparedwith no plan to direct the coming changes toward equality of status for the most part negroes have been engaged in assaulting the crumbling walls legal and other forms of segregation and discrimination keeping their gaze fixed on the operations or giving moral and financial aid to the cause but organizations devoted to the moral cultural and intellectual standards have been sadly neglected now through direct action negro leaders have succeeded in getting the whites to listen they must seize the opportunity to prove that they are not only striving to change a social order that excludes onetenth of its citizens but to construct a better order which encompasses freedom and justice for all negro community leaders should begin at once to organize socialwelfare programs in every negro community in the nation to help the disadvantaged masses all along the linein every department of public life the problem is of great magnitude but leaders must perceive the need and face up to the task now inasmuch as negroes have been subjected to an inferior status for hundreds of years the federal state and local governments should assist them in bridging the gap into normal american society because of the tremendous breadth and scope of the problem and the need of national direction the federal government should set up a negro alliance for progress it should train people as if to serve in the peace corps the trainees should be prepared to go into the city ghettos and slums of the nations cities to work at the grass roots of the gigantic problem they should help negro leaders perfect community organizations the object of which would be to give the negro masses purpose motivation and incentive to better their lot community chapters of a negro alliance for progress should be widely based to form its official family negro leaders must reach out into the communities for representation from as many institutions and organizations as possible a negro alliance for progress organization must operate in a community center its finances must come mainly from participating organizations and from private donations but the federal government should contribute to the maintenance of the staff especially the experts coordinators to help in the overall operation the work of the organization should be carried on through a number of departments and committees there should be an executive officer in each community organization the alliance would have such departments as education civic affairs family life child care and recreation all workers would give volunteer service its professional help would be drawn from teachers social workers college students and retired people since education is the surest way out of the slums special stress must be put upon this phase of the alliance basic instruction should be given in reading arithmetic and english for those who cannot profit by attending the established adult education schools operated by city school boards training of this kind is urgently needed by unemployed undereducated adults and young people many of whom are school dropouts such training will prepare them to acquire the skills needed to compete in the job market in this connection the alliance can give the individuals counseling and guidance about the type of training they need to secure technological employment and about the places to get such training counselors should also make a determined effort to get dropouts to return to school an alliance could promote trips for youth to cultural centers of interest and familynights at the center workshops and discussion groups on housing employment and education should be sponsored there should be a concerted effort through committee work and clubs to combat a feeling of helplessness futility and resignation that pervades the negro slum and ghetto communities especially in the nations big cities efforts must also be made to build a spirit of pride and high personal standards of honesty integrity and responsibility in view of the fact that voting apathy exists to great extents in negro communities a feature would be to build up in the masses the incentive to vote voterregistration drives would not be the answer the negro masses must be imbued with the knowledge that voting is not only a part of their civic responsibility but it is for their own selfinterest as well the alliance should sponsor a cooperative child care center  staffed by volunteers the services of many ablebodied women whose only reason for not working is caring for one or more minor children should be utilized as there are many homes in the negro community where boys in particular who need a father are growing up without one the alliance could sponsor a big brother guidance program in which men of good community standing would take the responsibility of guiding a boy that is offer him an adult male to learn from the negros social problems are mostly lack of adjustment to city lifethe demands of a cold impersonal environment according to the  census  per cent of the negro population live in cities ninety per cent of the nearly  million negroes living outside the south live in cities especially in the big industrial cities of the north and west an important function of the alliance would be to help them alleviate the conditions of a harsh environmentrestore their selfrespect and confidenceby helping families as well as individuals to become oriented and assimilated into the community for example the writer has personal knowledge of a family of eight who moved to a neighboring city from the rural south last year this man and wife whom i shall call james and mary smith not only found some of the problems they had hoped to leave behind but new and more complex ones for three months they were obligated to live with relatives in an already overcrowded tenement apartment at the end of that period james smith who has only a fourth grade education found work as a laborer with a construction company he immediately moved into a fourroom substandard apartment of his own in the same slum area the four school age childrenjames jr  sarah  frances  and annie attended the overcrowded ghetto schools after two months james sr was laid off from work the family is now on welfare aid a community alliance organization could bring this family into its selfhelp program by getting the father to take its basic training it would prepare him for a jobtraining program which would enhance his chances to get skilled or semiskilled employment in the meantime the alliance could also assist him in finding a job which he could perform thereby getting the family off relief it could give the family assistance in getting more adequate housing the wife mary through the homemaking classes of the alliance would be helped to become a better and more economic manager of her household as she has finished elementary school she could give assistance at the childcare center there she would be taught how to handle groups of children and how the program is maintained in this family which serves here as a demonstration of many the local alliance could give yearold james jr the additional counselling which he so badly needs he has been sent home twice from school for misbehavior and is becoming a problem both to his school and family he could through the alliance be found an afterschool job which would assure him that he is a needed and useful person the lack of such assurance is the cause of much of the delinquency among negro youth he could be brought into the recreation program of the alliance through membership in a youth club of his age group and the alliance could provide sponsors to get the three schoolage girls into youth clubs this family has not joined any church an alliance sponsoring them would provide a welcome for them into a church of their choice if the family has no choice the family sponsor could introduce them to representative members of community churches in this manner they could be helped to become a churchgoing family with new ideals and aspirations it could through the family sponsor get the father and mother each to join an alliance committee and to participate in other community activities in this manner all families such as this one in need of assistance would be helped to solve their problems there are to be sure some very successful programs being conducted in a number of cities for underprivileged youth the majority of whom are negroes these programsnew yorks new horizon the phoenix arizona career clubs the banker district in st louis the hunters point training project in san francisco and those in some other citiesaffect only a minute fraction of negroes who are in dire need of special help they do not even touch the lives of hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged and restless negroes trapped in the slums of u s cities automation is upon us negroes who are below average in education and training are going to find it increasingly harder to meet the requirements of tomorrows job market there must be a massive allout effort made to prepare these underprivileged masses to take advantage of present and future opportunities the proposed negro alliance for progress would not be a duplication of government programs designed to assist negroes most negroes must get training of one kind or other before they can take advantage of the manpower training program the alliance could conceivably come under the national service program called for by the president and now before congress in any event besides providing an opportunity for the masses to prepare to enter the mainstream of society the alliances committees could gather valuable data for federal state and local governments the information could then be used to determine what kind of aid should be  provided to maintain an effective program while a negro alliance for progress to be persuasive should be in the main selfhelp community programs with federal help and direction there are many ways in which state and local governments can assist they can provide facilities subsidies vocational training and help with juvenile delinquency programs to mention a few to operate the proposed alliance will entail cost but it will be a paying proposition which would more than compensate for expenditures made in reduction of welfare checks unemployment compensation and juvenile delinquency moreover preparing negroes to take their places along beside other americans in the producers and consumers market would expedite a change for the betterall along the linenot only in the cities but in the whole nation in all probability there will be opposition in some quarters to any such program as the alliance calls for it will no doubt be attacked as a proposition to give negroes special treatment if this is the connotation negroes have been getting special secondclass treatment for  years to the tune of billions and to the detriment of the nation and all concerned the cost to help the negro bridge the gap between his subculture and the main american culture will be a small fraction of what it is costing to keep him in his secondclass status  negro leaders should however ponder the statements made by professor james q wilson of harvard in his book negro politics negroes he says are the object rather than the subject of civic action things are often done for about or to or because of negroes but they are less frequently done by them there is a paucity of leadership among the cultured and materially privileged negroes some even disdain the masses with the apparent attitude of  why should i worry i have it made  these privileged people should be reminded the more privilege one has the greater his responsibility and the spirit of the time and the revolution is group elevation not individual advancement if the negro would be free he must invest in his own future negro leaders must devote more time and attention in reaching the hearts and minds of the masses and the local communities are the places to begin by addressing themselves to this aspect of the problem leaders will be giving impetus to its resolution the achievement of which history may well record as the greatest social accomplishment in this century although it is the negro leaders imperative duty to take the initiative through community programs to prepare the masses for assimilation into the nations social fabric it is not their duty alone white community leaders must also assume their responsibility and cooperate to resolve the problem for it is not just the attitude in the negro community that must be changed the attitude of the whole community must be changed this is societys problem a united community is the need it is the duty of all white community leaders to work to change the attitude of their own raceconvince them that social political and economic equality are the rights of all americans that the resolution of the problem means complete equality finally the hour has arrived for all americans to make a judgment not only is the negro cause an understandably just one american democracy is on trial before the world and the wave of the future is freedom for our own security and that of the free world the problem of equal status for the negro must be solved we dare not do less
portrait of a child
first saw letty when  irr £ i observed some classi £ es for blind children in the public schools  as a college assignment letty was a blind negro child of  a twin and the twin brother was blind too letty was large for her age and appeared to be a teenager there was no father in the home and the family was on relief letty had just resumed talking after two years of silence by being blind she had been able to start school at  years of age but she had stopped talking when she was  she continued to attend school during her silent two years following directions and doing the assigned school work but would not answer questions or talk to anyone at home or at school neither the school psychologist nor a private one were ever able to determine why she stopped talking and just as suddenly resumed talking again before letty stopped talking the mother sent her to school neatly dressed but after the speechless period no one in the home evidenced any concern with her appearancethe most rudimental phases of grooming being neglected when she again talked the speech was different too it was so guttural and southern or dialect that it sounded stereotypic during recess some of the sighted children liked to surround letty and get her to talk as they found it game and funny she enjoyed being the center of attention and declaring to her young audience that she wanted to be a preacher she would praise god and quote the scriptures at length if a teacher was near such actions were at once interrupted and the child was encouraged to just walk around the school yard if she didnt want to play the first saturday that i did volunteer work at the recreation center there were  handicapped children busily and noisily taking part in a variety of supervised games and activities i was surprised to see letty and her twin brother as they were the only negro children in the group together with  other volunteers and a staff person i was assigned to accompany a group of  youngsters to the childrens playground in golden gate park we were to be the guests at a picnic lunch there as we were the largest group taking an outside trip this saturday we were able to use the volkswagen bus for transportation in our party were two children confined to their wheel chairs and  blind children including letty on arrival at the park we found ourselves the project and guests of a rainbow girls chapter they and two of their mothers were holding tables for us in the picnic grounds near the merrygoround the drab wooden tables had been made festive with colorful paper tablecloths napkins and paper decorated with a circus motif there was even a large sheet cake  topped with a candy merrygoround in the center there seemed to be an unlimited supply of sugar cookies all kinds of decorated cup cakes iced soft drinks and a huge container of frosty punch the children had brought lunch bags from home and upon being seated letty hunched over the table and tore open her lunch bag with her face buried in the folds of the bag she wolfed down the meagre unbuttered meat sandwich a wizened green apple and an unwrapped candy bar when she finished before many had barely started she wiped her nose and mouth with her coat sleeve when a napkin was again placed in her hand it was used vigorously as a handkerchief and dropped on the lawn in the small silence that followed a rainbow girl set a plate of cookies in front of her and placed a cup of punch in her hand the cookies being greedily and hastily eaten were replaced with others the staff person having postponed her lunch to help with the needs of the children stood up and announced loudly the rainbow girls are treating us all to rides on the merrygoround i have tickets for everyone lets you and i go first letty nah letty answered ah just want to stay here and have a conversation and eat was implied as she was hungrily and thirstily gulping a bottle of pop the staff person then asked me to take two of the blind boys over to the slides that is their favorite spot and they can almost be on their own there just watch that they wait their turn in line they are so eager they sometimes push ahead of other children and fights start they dont want the other children to know they are blind and resent overt help before she finished talking the two were off tuning and found the slides with no guidance from me when my small charges and i came back from innumerable rides on the merrygoround as well as the slides it was time to clean up and leave letty appeared not to have moved all afternoon and was still wearing her heavy coat she was eating a large slice of the sheet cake the rainbow mothers had already packed up their picnic things and were sitting on either side of letty quietly listening and talking with her and occasionally patting her on the shoulder as if in encouragement of her talking as the rest of the children and volunteers gathered there was a final cup of punch for everyone it took us a halfhour to get startedsome final rides on the merrygoround to use up all the tickets trips to the rest rooms folding and rearranging the wheelchairs so no one was too uncomfortable and then finding an empty lap for a small pair of crutches while one of the volunteers held the child when we reached the center the children tumbled out of the volks wagen and those who could hurried into the building as if following some previously outlined plans as we tied the straps of the wheelchair bound children above the hubbub i heard lettys deep voice demanding where is mah record and mah chair i told ya not to move them as the children wheeled themselves through the doorway i followed the sound of lettys plaintive wrangling voice i found her in a room that i hadnt entered before it was easily the most spacious and lightfilled room in the building and it had been planned to take advantage of the splendid view of the ocean across the highway the ocean waves were frothing against the beach and it seemed odd to see them so near and not hear the surf as there was even salt spray on the huge picture window that extended the length of the room here is your record on the machine and your chair letty a volunteer stated letty drew her chair up as close as she could to the juke box and the room was suddenly filled to the overwhelming with the sound of ray charles singing you dont know me letty started rhythmically rocking back and forth back and forth in perfect time with the music she was completely relaxed and lost in her thoughts and her face was ecstatic after the record had played over and over her twin tried to push another button on the juke machine but letty vigorously pushed him awaynot once ceasing her continuous rocking movements it seemed by unspoken agreement that the machine was lettys province as none of the other children ventured near it had been a chilly and gray day but now the sun was splintering the heavy purple clouds clustered above the ocean and there would be a warm orange sunset on the horizon i heard my name called as the children were being assigned to cars to take them home some of the parents were arriving to pick up their children and others were being driven home by volunteers just now arriving although we only had three youngsters in our car we were the first scheduled to leave as we had the farthest to go above all the commotion at the crowded exit the clank of braces refolding and storing wheel chairs last minute typed directions being distributed and the childrens now tired and querulous voiceslettys blaring record dominated the air as we drove away i wondered who was calling for her but letty will be alright i thought she possesses the true dignity of childhood she is undefeated
the negros stake in africa
the american society ra £ of african culture was j i f founded upon the assumption that there exists a core of common experience a skein of common values and a common identification which unite men of culture of african descent there is no implication in this assumption that there do not exist other areas of experience other sets of values and other feelings of identification which bind the feelings of people who are of african descent to those who like them are also americans to those of similar occupations or similar status or to those who share similar taste in music or literature or even a similar interest in africa indeed i doubt that there is a member of this society who is not also a member of one or more organizations composed of people of varied ancestral origin founders and members of amsac are not believers in the mystique of race or blood nor do they believe in ethnic or racial exclusiveness they simply face the fact that a common fate involving certain historic disabilities has generated certain common problems and common responses to those problems all of which have led to a universe of discourse to use a somewhat sociological phrase popular in the s among peoples of african descent so they have joined together to carry on the dialogue among themselves and others talk always leads to action and that is why we are all here tonight of course not all people of african descent care to face these facts or to give a reaction to these tacts those of us who have wanted to face these facts have attempted through this organization to give institutional expression to what we feel are common values common experiences and a common universe of discourse with those who do not care to face these facts and give them institutional expression we have no quarrel but also for our own action we make no apology in a country where polish people make their identification as polishamericans some jews as jewishamericans and some italians as italianamericans there should be neither surprise nor fear at finding those who make an iden tification as lroamericans there is nothing more american than this pluralistic conception of american identity the only time that anyone really feels that hyphenation is a threat to national unity or national welfare is in time of war and i hope we are not going to have a war with the new emerging africa i shall return to this problem of identification again before i conclude my remarks but at this moment i should like to comment briefly upon the origins of this society because this is one phase of the question of whether panafricanism is a myth or a reality amsac came into being because there was a society of african culture that is there is an american society of african culture because there is a society of african culture without the word american in front the society of african culture came into being in france in  but its origins are to be found in a remarkable group of french negro intellectuals which came together in paris after the second world war the core was a group of west africans but from the outset the group included haitians malagasies and other individuals of africa south of the sahara one american negro richard wright was a member of this group among its patrons were some of frances most distinguished social scientists and men of letters whenever two or three intellectuals are gathered together they always think of a magazine or journal this group was no exception and presence ajricaine was born in  from the outset the pages of this magazine were open to contributions from men of all races some of its best contributions have come from men like jean paul sartre and andre gide and albert camus who are not men of african descent but whose insights were welcome in the journal by men of culture of african descent this being the rather elegant french phrase used for persons of the rather elegant society men of culture of african descent but also from the outset it was concerned with what aime cesaire and leopold senghor had dubbed negritude that perhaps indefinable and intangible something which the folk as well as the intellectuals in africa and negroes in the west indies were thought to have in common and what was this negritude every time i mention the word negritude i begin to hear duke ellingtons in my solitude in my mind and think that somebody should set to music in my negritude but what is this negritude first a passion for similar types of music dance and graphic and plastic art forms which exist in what i call the panafrican aggregate second a soft and resilient rather than a hard and mechanical approach to life third a deep resentment whether expressed or unexpressed over subordination to white people during the four hundred years of slave trade and the subsequent structuring of caste relations here and in africa this was the reaction which sartre in his essay black orpheus calls antiracist racism and to which cesaire once gave a marxist interpretation antiracist racism was not viewed as an evil thing but as a quest for dignity a yearning for respect and an assertion of worth it was viewed dialectically as having been brought into view by its opposite which is aggressive exploitative racism and the whole concept of negritude assumes in its dialectic that antiracist racism is destined to disappear in some higher synthesis the american term integration sometimes implies this remote future in short negritude was thought of by this group as something to be proud of not something to be ashamed of about five years ago a group of americans of african descent were invited to join in the dialogue to come to paris for confrontation to see if they too had negritude there was never any doubt in the minds of the french intellectuals that the americans had it one african poet senghor had written of the softening effect he thought the negroes had had on new york he thought that harlem had put the hard oil on the mechanical life of new york and all of them had caught the tones in american jazz in countee cullen in langston hughes in alain locke and w e b dubois and in the folk and traditional and artistic productions with which they were acquainted by the time the confrontation was over amsac was born it was not a painless birth the recognition of the reality of the existence of negritude among afroamericans as well as francoafricans did not mean that the two groups saw eye to eye on every issue this is one of the major points that i would like to make the feeling of a common identity does not necessarily mean that those involved always get along or always agree on everything i think that within the framework of this international operation this fact has been rather obvious nobody has tried to conceal it if you will look at the introduction to africa seen by american negroes you will see a note there by the french editor who says that there were some members of the presence africaine group who werent quite in favor of dealing so closely with the american negroes not because they didnt feel an identity but because they felt the americans were agents of imperialism this must have been one of the extreme marxist fringes of sac we have no extreme marxist fringes the society of african culture in paris which had such fringes had to make a decision and as a result the fringe group was slapped down this volume came out and there was a strong statement that we do accept the idea that american negroes as well as haitians west indians and others form a part of  this group so although there may be disagreement on details and even on issues in this broad fraternity they are not serious they are disagreements within a framework of agreement the continuing association between amsac and sac is itself a testimony to the reality of the ties however much some people may try to talk those ties away or to brainwash them out of the minds of american negroes some of these people well mention later it is interesting to note that the first institutionalization of ties between the scattered bearers of negritude was at the level of an interest in art literature philosophy and other cultural realms it is perhaps significant that this was where the first cementing of ties was madeon the level of high culturenot on the level of politics or on the level of interpersonal relations i think we ought to bear in mind that relations between africans and afroamericans occur on these three levels political cultural and interpersonal these three ought to be kept separate in our discussions they may not be of equai weignt or value at any given moment while the african intellectuals in the french tradition were empnasizing culture other men of african descent were seeking to find unity around a framework of political action we must first examine this group briefly just as we might call the sac and amsac develop ment cultural panafricanism so might we refer to the other phenomenon as political panafricanism these of course are not watertight compartments but they help us to channel the flow of history for our purpose this evening dr w e b dubois is often referred to as the father of panafricanism and in recent years has received honors in africa as such all of us know of his four attempts to convene effective panafrican conferences between the first world war and the depression his work illustrates my meaning when i say that these are not watertight compartments dubois is most often thought of as having given expression to political panafricanism i attended a dinner given for dr dubois at the academy of learning in ghana a few months ago he was honored as the father of panafricanism i was rather surprised that the chief justice of ghana sir arku korsak in introducing dr dubois said that he was not interested in dr dubois political significance my first awakening to the meaning of africa and to our own potential dignity he said came when i was a student at sierra leone and we all read regularly the column as the crow flies which was published in crisis magazine in the s now nobody on this side thought that the future chief justice of ghana in a small cottage in sierra leone was reading dr dubois column but this was the first thing that he said in his intro duction so here was the cultural side of panafricanism at work not wellknown is the fact that the first conference with the name panafrican was really convened in london in  by a west indian lawyer named sylvester williams the tradition has now become set so we come to think of the  conference set up by dr dubois as the first one new world negroes took the initiative in trying to mobilize negro intellectuals in the fight against two things colonial oppression in africa and discrimination against negroes and other people of color wherever it existed but they had no mass base and the time was not ripe for effective action these were the pioneers american negro intellectuals on the whole have failed to treat seriously the most powerful segment of the panafrican movement prior to world war ii i refer to marcus garveys universal negro improvement association and the african communities leagues i think any objective person looking at the world of negro intellectuals would ask why the biography about garvey wasnt written by a negro black moses was written by a white man i think the flamboyance of marcus garveys insistence on one god one aim one destiny and that you should have a black god and black angels and a black jesus christall of this has been a rather painful episode in american negro history for negro intellectuals who tend to wince a bit at it and believe that garvey was a bit of a buffoon we may be ashamed of garveys black masses walking down the streets of harlem with their plumes but some of the african leaders are not they tend to link the names of garvey and dubois as parts of the same historic stream one of the most vivid memories i bring home from ghana was the convening of the all african peoples conference in december  leaders from all over africa were there and at the last session dr nkrumah began his speech by saying we are so glad to see so many of our friends from the new world here with us i think i am quoting him precisely before we were conscious of our own degradation it was they who raised the banner of african liberation in the new world i want to mention especially marcus garvey and dubois this was before the assembled group of agitators who were going out to liberate africa and the statement was made by nkrumah and he named these two people equally significant i suppose is the fact that the first ghana steamship line was called the black star line garveys ships never got across but ghanas ships do manage to get around i am sure that marcus garvey would be turning over in his grave one of his weaknesses was his antisemitism and the first black star line was a joint operation of the zim navi gation company of israel and ghana but we often forget the weaker side of our panafrican symbols in the same way that this happens in other parts of the world i am watching the process by which the emphasis is being put on dr dubois as father of panafricanism with an attempt to say well we dont buy his devotion for the soviet union and eventually that will be forgotten as a part of the tradition assuming that africa does not fall into that orbit in looking back at these two predepression movements garveys and dubois i think we cannot understand the emergence of either of them unless we face the fact that there was a basis among the masses in america the west indies and africa that made both of them possible there would have been no panafrican movement led by dubois there would have been no marcus garvey movement had there been no apperceptive mass which nourished and sustained them there was an identification with africa as a land of ancestral origins which was already there despite all the stereotypes and distortions and all the existing unpleasant realities of contemporary africa and that apperceptive mass is still there i grew up among rather ordinary and common folk who exalted the glories of ethiopia in the past who talked constantly of egypt as being our country which started civilization and who believed that someday princes would come out of ethiopia and it would stretch forth its hands unto god most american negroes probably grew up putting pennies into the church basket which were supposed to go out to some missionary in africa we dont forget that the early denomination included the african methodist episcopal church and similarly named churches this is evidence of a kind of identification one of the early negro organizations were known as the african society i have a theory that the word african began to drop out after the american colonization society was started in the hope of getting negroes forcibly or persuasively back to africa at this point it was probably safer just to drop the word african and use colored if you talk too much about being an african maybe someone will ask you why you dont go back there the point that i have been trying to make is that there was a time when there was an acceptance of the idea of african origins and at the mass level it persisted through the years nobody has ever dealt adequately with the sentiments in africa with regard to the american negro in doing research on panafricanism last summer i found that when the congress of british west africa was started by the famous casley hayford to unite the colonies of british west africa he mentioned in the inaugural speech that on the other side our people have formed an organization called the unia and they have some ships and will probably be coming over here to the gold coast soon we ought to get prepared for them he said he was for strict constitutional action and he said that they may not know how we run things over here and we have got to teach them how to be constitutional here was a serious acceptance of what was supposedly going on on the other side and of the idea that one ought to get ready to welcome garveys ships which never got there the depression years were years when racial solidarity was either subdued or assimilated in the international communist movement all of us remember the concept of the black belt republic and the expression of negro protest in marxist idiom but we must not forget that this was also a period when the comintern made strenuous efforts to mobilize the black masses in africa and also made its worst blunders during the first four years of the thirties perhaps the most energetic person involved in this attempt to get africans into the communist movement was a man from trinidad who had already joined the movement i refer to george padmore who ran the negro worker and was supposed to be lining up africans for the cause of the soviet union some english friends still think that george padmore was a communist influence on dr nkrumah although padmore broke with the communist movement in  this break was a very important one because having broken with the communist movement but also having learned a lot while he was in it padmore and a group of west indians began in london to organize the socalled panafrican federation and between  and  they kept up much agitation around hyde park in london in about  nkrumah arrived in london knowing no one and he met george padmore in  nkrumah padmore and others convened the fifth panafrican conference they had dr dubois come over as a symbol of panafricanism the movement was for the first time beginning to receive mass support because these were africans mapping out their own destiny this is considered a turning point in the african liberation movement when decisions had been made at the conference the men decided to return home to their native lands with the idea that the first of them to liberate his own country would call the sixth panafrican conference this was taken as a vow between the men as soon as the  conference was ended george padmore went to ghana to serve as the adviser on african affairs others of that  conference also went back to ghana because they felt that they should all work from that base in december of  it was nkrumah who  called the sixth panafrican conference under the title of the all african peoples conference dr dubois was unable to attend but his wife was there to read his speech which advised the nations to look to the east and to reject the west little attention was given to this advice however it was agreed that regardless of his political position dubois was still the symbol of panafricanism all of the nine independent states of africa attended that conference and the nature of that conference has great bearing on our central topic panafricanism myth or reality it is a reality in terms of the limited aims which it set for itself the  conference first popularized the term african personality differing from negritude african personality was an interesting concept in the first place padmores definition of what is an african becomes anyone is an african regardless of race creed or color if he acts right that is if he believes in one man one vote and in economic political and social equality one of the other slogans at the conference was the sahara no longer divides us it unites us half of the delegates were not black africans they were from libya tunisia morocco and egypt padmores version of the african personality meant that on the political scene we will stick together on all issues involving africa the african nations have set up at the united nations a working arrangement with a rotating chairmanship and regular caucuses until the time of the congo crisis i dont think there was any crucial issue involving africa over which the group split this was the african personality demonstrated through a show of the political presence of africa i consider this a very important turning point because now there develops a new definition of panafricanismwhat i call residential panafricanism not racial panafricanism this begins to pose problems for those who were panafricans what weight shall you give to the uniting of black people in the west indies africa and america as compared with the uniting of all people on the continent of africa panafricanism now has two sides to it one is that all negroes must stick together the other is that all africans must stick together whether they are negroes or not now i dont think the older people have at all rejected the first aspect one of the most moving scenes that i have ever witnessed was the funeral of george padmore when the funeral oration was delivered by dr nkrumah some of the tribalists in the area said that they didnt want a strangers ashes put in sacred land this made dr nkrumah fighting mad and he said in his oration that this man had to me that indescribable relationship which exists only between brothers from this very spot his ancestors may have been carried off across the ocean while their kinsmen stood by weeping we have brought his ashes home and put them to rest where they belong this was the old panafricanism when there was great emotional stress on west indian african and american negro solidarity but i think that the new concept is becoming the dominant one and as it becomes the dominant one we must reconsider what part the old one will have what is the role of the west indian and american negro auxiliaries if one may call them that in the political phase of the african struggle i would say that until the congo crisis the racial concept of panafricanism had reality as you know with the emergence of the new african states africa has become divided into three really big blocks the casablanca five ghana guinea mali egypt and morocco which consider themselves militant neutralist and which supported lumumba a rather conservative group and a group that floats in between we have to realize in structuring our relationships with africa today that all africans no longer think alike once independence comes there will be ideological groupings and that same complication which attends our relationships in the united nations it seems to me that in our country there is a certain fear about the identification of negroes with africans a fear among both negroes and whites yet this is a time for sober analysis now that this whole matterwhether or not racial panafricanism should still be preservedis open to question the whole problem of how to relate ourselves to the new kind of residential panafricanism is here our task has not been made easier by the publication of a couple of articles which i think have tended to confuse not only american negroes but the general public about this particular problem there is fear in america about negroes intense interest in africa and i think these articles have tended to increase the fear and uncertainty in africa what they call the equivalent of this is the propaganda for balkanization or for dividing and conquering to use a cliche from agitators i might state that  do not think it was accidental that these articles appeared at the specific time that they did i refer to the article in the new yorker may   by harold isaacs and the one in the reporter june   by russell b howe the feeling for a need for such articles was in the air in certain circles there was almost a kind of inevitability about the appearance of these articles if the american journalistscholar and the english journalist had not written them i have no doubt at all that someone else would have written them i speak with such assurance on this particular subject because of a personal experience about a week after the eruption of the  american negroes in the united nations during stevensons speech i received a long distance phone call from new york it was from an editor of the reporter who asked since i was just back from africa if i would do an article for the magazine he claimed that there is great concern in many quarters over the way in which american negroes are tending to identify with africans and that an article of some sort should show the american negroes once and for all that these africans dont care anything at all about them and that there is really no kind of tie between them i asked him who had told him to come to me and he mentioned a couple of american negro leaders who had said that things are getting out of hand that some american negro ought to write an article o get this thing straightened out and that the american negros identification is with america and not with africa i begged off on the truthful grounds that i was very busy and that an article of this sort required a kind of study that i did not have the time to give to it i cannot say whether messrs isaacs and howe received similar invitations i will admit however that my paranoiac suspicions were aroused when i read these words in the fourth paragraph in isaacs article the outburst of some negroes in the gallery of the united nations security council in new york during the lumumba demonstration in february at least served to make more people aware that american negroes are experiencing their own kind of confusion over the events in emergent africa it is a peculiar and painful confusion cutting to the core of what negroes think about themselves and about their place in american society and in the world everything is changing in their universe those winds blow not only across africa forcing upon them all kinds of new conceptions and selfconceptions and among these are new ideas and emotions about africa itself the hitherto remote and rejected ancestral homeland the gallery demonstrators were merely an extremist handful but at some point these new stirrings touch all kinds of people in every part of the american negro community as i said my paranoiac suspicions were aroused only one of these articles the new yorker piece merits any serious discussion for it was written by a seriousminded exjournalist now attached to an international relations research program at a large and influential academic research institution he is also a man whose devotion to the cause of social justice and civil_rights is beyond dispute i treat his article seriously as to the other gentleman mr howe i only hope that those in positions of power and influence in america will be as skeptical as i am contemptuous about anything that he has to say on this issue the writer in question is a young man who has traveled widely in america and africa he is witty and to some peoples taste charming but quite unable to evaluate facts and weigh them he was declared persona non grata in ghana for repeatedly publishing unverified news as fact at the all african peoples conference in tunis where he represented the sunday times he published an article stating that mboya had said he would never give an invitation to george padmore to come to a conference because he didnt believe in outside negroes interfering in african affairs i interviewed mr mboya the following summer in kenya and he stated that he had never said anything of the sort whether he did or not i dont know but at least this is the kind of mischiefmaking that makes i think howes articles suspect he then went over to the neighboring state of togoland and became a speech writer for mr olympio because he was feeling vindictive about ghana and if anyone wants to check up on what i call very bad reporting read mr howes book black star rising over africa you will find more errors per page than in any other similar book some of the errors fall on the side of what i call claimtheworld american negro history this is simply an unreliable person but one who can do a great deal of harm isaacs for instance stated in his article that he thought the liberians and dr nkrumah didnt want to accept a negro ambassador howe said that nkrumah told him on independence day that he didnt want a negro ambassador then mr howe goes further and says that it will be doing a disservice to the negro to africa and to the united states to send any negroes to africa it would be a disservice to all three he then suggests that we should be guided by the experience of all the missions in africa which never used negro missionaries supposedly because they knew africans didnt respect negroes and therefore could not be converted by negro missionaries now this is the kind of thing we are confronting today i said that i was going to treat mr isaacs article seriously and i will try to do so within a few minutes this article has not only set off widespread discussion among all american negroes who are intelligently concerned with africa but is also being used i am told by those in washington opposed to having negroes in diplomatic posts it is being used to bolster the argument that negroes are a liability in diplomatic circles i read and reread the article weighing the facts cited and opinions expressed trying to catch the nuances and trying to imagine its impact on various groups of people here in america and in africa my own conclusion about the article is that i dont think that it had the intent that howes did but it probably has had the same effect and i am hoping that the author will do a back  to africa part ii and make it very clear that he repudiates russell howes position and that he doesnt like the use to which his article is being put what else would i have to say about the isaacs article one is that i feel that so perceptive an observer and so diligent an interviewer as harold isaacs should not have missed the point in so many places and misunderstood the nuances in so many situations it may have come partly just from  his not having stayed around long enough for those interviews in africa if anyone interviewed me in ghana at midday he would get quite a different reaction to africa than he would at  in the morning because by midday  would be hot and tired therefore it seems to me that this matter needs a much more prolonged and deep analysis than was given to it just one other small matter isaacs said that africans scornfully reject the term negro because they think it represents something lowly or unworthy this supposedly leaves the black brother from america confused and resentful this is just not true the term negro is used by the west african pilot all the time the term is used often there so this kind of statement comes from not being fully acquainted with the scene the other main difficulty in the article is that it overgeneralizes what i miss throughout the article is any sensitivity to the complexity of differentiations within africa itself instead there is a tendency to generalize about how africans feel toward american negroes which africans where in what status positions and having what political orientation these are questions you must ask in dealing with the attitudes of africans toward american negroes in ghana today most negroes tend to lean to the noncommunist socialist left they reject negroes propagandizing for capitalism on the other hand other negroes are roaming around and developing intimate and warm relationships the question turns on which negro is being reacted to and who is doing the reacting thats the greatest weakness in this particular article maybe isaacs can afford to ignore the complexity of this problem in a short article for a presumably sophisticated american audience it really isnt fair to them or to the subjects that the author does not explicitly admit he is oversimplifying for our society to ignore these complexities would be fatal for amsac to ignore them would be to jeopardize the success of all our efforts and leave us as confused as some of the people whom isaacs interviewed in the future course of our individual and collective relations with africa we must be crystalclear about the nature of the reality we confront i think that we need to start with the proposition that the question that matters to amsac is not whether some american girls are having a rough political orientation these are the bands or whether some africans dont like the word negro or whether most american negroes suffer from cultural shock after being in africa for a few weeks or even whether a wellknown negro social scientist was invited to the homes of his african colleagues nor should we be particularly concerned about whether anyone in africa appreciates our efforts the question that really matters to amsac is first a power question do the leaders of the newly independent african states those in power at the moment wish to sustain friendly relationships with amsac if they do ultimately the educational forces which flow from these relationships will reeducate a population and reduce some of the attitudes referred to above i think that the answer to this question is that some of these leaders do some of them dont and some dont know anything about amsac but this nevertheless is a crucial question the next crucial question i think is what do we want to do in africa regardless of how visitors get along at the personal level therefore i go back to the three levels there are political problems but political panafricanism is not amsacs problem at the other end i dont think the question of interpersonal relationships is primarily our problem our problem is at the level of cultural relationships this is a matter of relationships between groups and groups and this gives us our broadest approach to africa cultural panafricanism is not a myth it is a reality nobody denies the cultural ties and everyone is interested in implementing exchanges of artists and books etc therefore our problem is relatively easy the problems of individuals who go out to africa are not easy in this respect there is a certain amount of truth in isaacs observations but the point is missed that these personal problems are not the crucial matters in africanamerican relationships i could recount the same kind of problems faced by africans educated in england who went home and had the task of keeping first second and third cousins from moving in on them these are individual problems and each individual is going to have to fight them out himself before us there are some signposts and to my mind they are these first the oldtime sentimental panafricanism is a feeble and slender reed on which to lean all other things being equal color helps but the other factors must be equal i dont think my students in africa could have cared less about my color they were only concerned with the university of londons exam if a white or green person could have helped to get them ready to make an upper first they would have wanted him if a negro couldnt help them to get ready to make an upper first they wouldnt want him but vhere other things are equal on a personal level i think the feeling would be in favor of having a negro around in my case the institution had been there for twelve years they didnt have an african head of department and i was the only colored head of department so i was showing the flag whether anyone liked me or not was irrelevant i was the one splash of color my students might have hated me on a personal level but until they get a good man ready to take that post they would rather see in it a west indian or american negro this may be a part of our fate a part of what we are supposed to do to accept the lack of the warm interpersonal relations and still do the job which africans need done at this particular moment i should like to conclude my remarks by reverting to that illusive and tantalizing subject of our quest for identity in africa today this takes form in the shift from tribal to national solidarity and in the quest for identity as an african we in the united states arent the only people who have a problem of finding an identity and if anyone thinks that panafricanism is a myth look how the votes run on boycotting south africa africans may disagree on everything else but when it gets down to the crucial tests the votes go twentyfive solid so when you ask whether panafricanism is a myth or reality find out in respect to what issues the american negro has a problem of reconciling his citizenship status and cultural heritage with the fact of being a negro this does not merely mean being black because being a negro doesnt have much reference to skin color in the united states the new african definition of panafricanism which includes white africans from tunis is like the virginia definition of a negro anybody with an ascertainable trace of negro blood so you now have white africans in africa and white negroes in the united states again this is not just a matter of color i feel that panafrican identification lends powerful support to successful individual and collective adjustment of american negroes  do not consider it escapism to make this identification i say this because i do not share the optimism of those who feel that the trend toward integration will mean the disappearance of negroes as a group in the us or the distintegration of negro institutional life even if this were desirable for all there are going to be black people designated as negroes in the us for a long long time to come along with brown and fair people with enough telltale traits to mark them as being of partial african descent and by law and custom here in america partial means whole marry a person from the white community and as soon as the baby comes along that baby is over in the negro community so for those who intermarry their children are going to be colored children negro afroamerican and not white africans and other negroes who come here from abroad are going to have to share our fate to a great extent they may get special dinners such as the ambassador of sierra leone got the other day but for a long time to come not only are we going to be identified as negroes but africans are going to be sharing a common fate with us while theyre here what we are heading for in america i think is a social structure like hawaiis and not like brazils i am always interested in how we hold up hawaii as a great example of good race relations in hawaii ethnic groups have not disappeared there are many ethnic groups but nobody is ashamed of being in one people are tolerant of each other and if you intermarry you pick which side youre going to be on this is quite different from the brazilian situation where there is some emphasis toward the attainment of one big brazilian race and particularly toward the eradication of all evidences of african culture thats a part of what integration means in brazil eradicate the blacks oy marrying with them get rid of the color then quickly get them educated and get rid of this african survival system i dont regard brazil as any paradise for one who has respect for his africanism now we can either accept such a prospect or we can deplore it try to evade it or if we are light  enough try to pass out of it since most negroes arent light enough to do that as are some who prefer to identify with the whole i am for accepting our negritude for trying to inject new meanings into the word negro and for discovering new appreciations for aspects of african culture i am in favor of all of us africans west indians american negroes and our white allies fighting together on all fronts the political front the cultural front and even fighting the battle of the interpersonal relationships this gives us the satisfaction of knowing that we are not fighting alone if we take this position i think we will build strong personalities we shall produce individuals who have the aspirations of the poet claude mckay a west indian who lived and wrote in new york one of his poems that i like very much reflects this attitude of accepting our negritude of becoming a part of the great panafrican fight

the afternoon was about v r i £ gone and amanda  i £ stonecutter wondered she could finish iron       mg her last bundle before it was time to start supper it was friday and she liked to finish up before suppertime so she would have the week end to do her own chores then a sudden noise from the back porch pulled her head up and she saw her husband rushing through the door waving the evening paper you see here manda them fool kids done gone and got throwed outta school he shouted we told hal not to hang round them troublemaking demonstrators yet there he was leading the pack for a moment she stared at him then slowly cut her iron off and came to gaze at the newspaper spread on the kitchen table i heard the news on the radio she said finally they didnt give names but deep in my heart i guess i knew hal would be in it some where she sighed sitting down her legs suddenly too weary to hold her up he was one of the main ones its right here in the paper jim declared pounding the paper vigorously mr allen showed it t me and he said hal ought not to come back as haycroft aint gonna stand for that mess amandas face turned a dull gray as the blood drained from it they never did like hal them white folks here didnt theyll be laying for him now thats for sure she said in a flat lifeless tone which seemed to deepen the look of sadness in her eyes then anxiety and an overpowering sense of utter helplessness propelled her to her feet hugging her folded arms tight against her narrow palpitating chest she wandered up into the living room and stood at the window halfexpecting to find a mob already gathered in the front yard jim what are we going to do she asked suddenly turning to face her husband who had followed her into the crowded boxlike room hes nearing twenty they wont let him get away with the things he did when he was growing up dont upset yourself manda he began and she knew by the set of his mouth that he had news of some kind that he hadnt told before mr allen lent me money and i telegramed it to hal i told him to go on up to new york to be with his sister helen till this thing blows over  youyou think hell do that she asked hopefully jim nodded his small round head bobbing like a top hell listen hes older now manda he knows people here dont want things all stirred up his wishful thinking and the placid look on his childlike face were almost too much for her to endure and the feeble ray of hope struggling in her bosom quietly expired as the scattered veins of fear darting through her body converged into the hard lump which settled in her chest she leaned one bony elbow against the peeling window frame and wondered in silent desperation what would happen to the other children if their eldest son came back and started offending the white people who nowadays seemed more easily provoked than ever finally shaking her head as if to clear away some dense fog she turned from the window to see that jim was already comfortably stretched out on the couch i guess id better go start supper before the children come she said trying without success to suppress another weary sigh out in the kitchen she lifted the halfironed shirt from the board with tired workknotted fingers and for a moment she stared at it with blurred eyes a white shirt a white mans shirt in the eyes of her country she was only a black woman who took in washing she was not supposed to have problems or feelings to care about those problems she was expected to be a workhorse not a mother who loved her children who worried about their wellbeing then relaxing her fingers the shirt dropped into the basket and she took the board down she would have to finish the bundle after supper now and jim could take it by mrs baines on his way to work tomorrow morning then yawning and stretching jim entered the kitchen i reckon id better set this out he said lifting the wicker clothes basket and taking it out to the back porch she watched him moving stiffly like a tired old man and marvelled at the swift cruel passing of time the children had always kept her so busy she had never had time to wonder whether the years were good or bad even when hal was about ten and started his fighting campaign to reform the world her hands were plenty full for the twins mike and ike were only five and annie ruth just a baby then at long last with the help of the good lord and rev mills the kindly old minister who had baptized all the children and mr waterman the principal who had once taught jim hal finished high with honors and a scholarship and she had thought the problem solved for good when he went off to florida to am  i but now here he was expelled in his senior year and only god in his heaven knew what was coming next what came next the following day in fact was hal himself just as they were sitting down for the noonday meal he strolled into the kitchen plunking his suitcases down onto the freshly scrubbed floor saddened but not surprised amanda quickly looked at jim who for the moment was ashy white and quite speechless but not the children they whooped for joy and rushed to embrace him their conquering hero home in person you got th wire jim finally asked sure pop i got it hal grinned tossing his cap onto one of the suitcases but i figured what the hell harlem can wait ill liberate mississippi first the children whooped again and amanda felt rather than saw jim sag in his chair then hal came over and bent down to kiss her youre looking great mom he said but his eyes wondered if she understood why he had acted contrary to his fathers command and to her utter despair she knew her own eyes assured him that she did understand but oh how her heart ached for him food was forgotten as the twins told hal about the special assembly yesterday when mr lacker their new principal warned them not to start that sitin bit in haycroft if they wanted to stay at good old booker t high the handsome mobile face quivered with emotion as he began pacing the floor yeah i am very well acquainted with the educated uncle tommies he declared  wait go slow it takes time they cry joining hands with their great white brethren to quote from that venerable script someone wrote coming back from lincolns funeral well im here to tell you that crap is from squaresville theyve got to get some new material sure a lot of us got thumped on our behinds and kicked out of school too but we have started something and they aint seen nothing yet just wait till we hit that second thrust theyre going to realize were shooting for the moon not just for the front of the bus jim stared in speechless fascination and the twins whistled and banged the table with fists and silverware annie ruth ran to hal and hugged him again and again while amanda holding her throbbing head tight in her hands frantically prayed dear god please send him north or shut him up before its too late news of hals homecoming spread around town like an epidemic and a few of the more curious souls came to see with their own eyes first on the scene was one of amandas insurance men harry bicker who ordinarily collected on tuesday jim had gone back to work and the rest of them were still in the kitchen listening to hal tell about the sitins in florida when harry bicker came back and right off hal wanted to know what was wrong with the doorbell  but amanda hushed him up and took harry bicker up front but hal followed them staring at the white man while he collected his money and marked up the book then after his hasty rather nervous departure hal turned on his mother why dont you pay those vultures by mail every week here they come a pack of whiteshirted hyprocrites it would kill one of them to sit next to you at the drug store counter yet theyre living off us just as sure as buzzards picking a dead mans guts then amanda as impetuous as he in many respects got angry too whyd you come back if you hate it so much here you know what its like why you think you can change em annie ruth followed by the twins came in then and hal flopped down into a chair his mouth clamped shut and amanda tightlipped and boneweary put the insurance book back on top of the mantel and was heading back to the kitchen when the horn started blasting out front she froze and for a moment dead silence prevailed as they stared at one another knowing that none of their colored friends had cars and if they did they wouldnt blow quite like that but annie ruth the youngest and therefore the least frightened jumped up and ran to the window mama its mis baines she said turning to face them you want me to run out and tell her daddy took her clothes this morning ike the taller twin looked at his mother why cant she come in here if she wants to see somebody mike snorted shes scared a little color might rub off on her and shell lose ninetenths of her privileges man shut up amanda snapped but the little tableau was not lost on her she realized the twins were only trying to impress hal but she also knew they were apt to keep trying as long as he remained home somehow she had to get him out of town and suddenly the thought came to her that perhaps god had sent lucy baines to help her standing beside the new blue convertible amanda glanced at mrs baines somewhere between her thin upturned nose and her long ducklike neckline and wondered how it felt to be white and therefore right envy was not in her heart but the rank taste of fear fouled her mouth by now she was most adept at ignoring the fear for it usually erupted when a white face ventured too close vaguely she knew it sprang from a rockbed of hate and she resented the hate even more than she did the fear god didnt put man here to hate she thought despairingly but what were you to do when people pushed you to the ground and kept you there till you were dead and buried then her eyes strayed into the pale blue eyes of lucy baines and she saw fear there too it was only a flash but amanda caught a glimpse of it and she knew she couldnt ask mrs baines to help with hal for if lucy baines was scared then she hated too finally amanda realized mrs baines was saying something about odd jobs for hal to keep him out of further trouble and she nodded her head grinning the foolish grin that was expected of her she promised to talk to hal about the work but he probably would be going away soon helendid mrs baines remember helen who useta help her out after schoolwell helen was looking for hal to come up to new york to visit with her any day now back in the house amanda motioned for hal to follow her out to the kitchen where she told him what mrs baines had said and what she had said to mrs baines but hal would not be compromised mama he began patiently i know they dont like me here because i dont grin like an ape when they come sneaking around well im not an ape and im not going to act like one    hal amanda interrupted sharply how can you have so much education and yet be so dumb you cant fight a whole town and neither can you change it by agitation theyll just be waiting for you to start something now why your head so hard boy he backed away from her as though she had struck him throwing his hands toward the ceiling all right so im an agitator so i want to look up at the sun and go where every man but one with a black face can go in his own country is that so wrong look at that barry roth who came here from germany years ago he practically owns the town now a jewhating nazi can have the country but i have to stand up to eat a lousy hamburger at the bus terminal you think thats something to grin about you think i ought to run up to new york and rot in harlem and call myself a man is that what you want amanda clutched at his swinging arms you are wrong to stay here and get yourself killed she cried what good would it do answer me what good would it do hal but he would not answer her perhaps he could not he was flesh of her flesh blood of her blood but not of her generation and through her tears she watched as he finally left the kitchen and retired to his old room upstairs at the back of the house where he stayed for the rest of the day banging away on the portable typewriter helen had given him when he finished high several times she had a notion to go back there to try talking with him again but since she had no real plan formulated yet she decided to wait until she had one at church next morning amanda found it virtually impossible to concentrate on the sermon more than once she caught herself up sharply as rev thornton pounded the  lectern bringing enthusiastic amens from the congregation the children sitting in the pew ahead of them were somewhat more fidgety than usual but jim sat quietly beside her moving not an eyelash then her restless eyes fastened on the tall lanky man pacing the pulpit he was young not much older than hal and amanda realized now that she had never really felt comfortable in his presence he reminded her of mr lacker the new principal in manner more than looks the town had certainly changed she thought ruefully the old faces gone replaced by bright eager young men in dark gray suits and buttondown collars they always had the right word at the right time but somehow she felt they were lacking in many of the old virtues rev mills or mr watermaker would have taken hal aside and maybe talked some sense into his head but these new people were different they were probably afraid of a boy who talked too much they seemed more interested in hanging onto a job than going out of their way to risk hanging from a tall strong oak and who was she to condemn them leaving the tiny red brick church smiling and nodding at friends evading their questions concerning hal as best she could amanda walked along beside her silent husband more heavy of heart now than when she left the house but she attributed this more to the restless wanderings of her mind than to any defects of the service then when they reached home and she saw the sheriffs car parked out front she thought already god is punishing me for not listening to his word in church sheriff osborne and his deputy young timmy updyke who had once received two black eyes from hal for calling him a nigger got out of the black mudstained vehicle as they came up amanda looked at jim and saw his face turn whiter than either of the two other men then seeing him scared like that her own fear left her and she reached out to take his trembling hand in hers timmy said nothing in fact he barely looked at them but amanda felt the antipathy in him and the way he fingered his night stick in a sort of unconscious caress while his dull gray eyes stared out into some eternal void chilled her to the bone she knew that if they didnt soon get hal out of haycroft timmy updyke would see that they carried him feet first to the graveyard reluctantly amandas eyes moved on to the sheriff who was now saying what he had come to say in plain good old mississippi english and even before he had finished jim was vigorously nodding his head and promising up and down that hal wasnt thinking o starting no trouble heah in haycroft no sir not hal the sight of jim grinning and bowing tore amandas heart and she could have vept knowing that somewhere in the house hal watched wretched with indignation but god must have heard her plea for he did not come out to intervene they waited until the car disappeared around the corner in a faint cloud of dust then went into the house to find hal sitting in the living room staring at his feet propped up on the piano stool he nodded to them but made no mentioned of the sheriffs visit and somehow his silence was more disturbing to amanda than any of his long speeches had ever been and while she and jim changed their clothes upstairs her searching mind finally landed on the same old question should they all move north the subject was first discussed when helen was bom and they had rejected the idea agreeing that the north was too crowded with people and covered with cement everywhere and no place for children to grow up in as the tall buildings blotted out every last drop of gods good sunshine later however she came to realize that most important of all a child needed a good emotional climate but jim was rooted now and too removed from reality to think clearly about troublesome situations nevertheless she did voice the question once again jim was about ready to go downstairs but he stopped near the door and surprised her by not flying off the handle what would happen to us up there manda he asked his eyes squinting in the little face which had screwed up like that of a worried child then he answered his own question relief probably im near fifty with not much education  he came back and sat on the bed his small yet powerful workstained mechanics hands spread upon his thighs i reckon relief aint no worse than this though all these years hearing hal shoot off at the mouth i wouldnt listen cause i knowed he was right i wanted to be a man too when i was his age i didnt like looking at the ground and grinning like a fool every time mr charley walks by they do something to your insides here and when you gets to be as old as me its like walking round dead it was such a rare thing him unburdening himself like that until amanda in the midst of rebraiding her hair hardly knew what to do then she let the long braid fall and moved forward her eyes seeing what they had not noticed in many a long year a man a human being with hopes and fears yet a longing to live in his own way and for the moment hal was forgotten as she reached out her arms to her husband by eleven oclock monday morning amandas first wash hung on the line swinging under the hard october sun which climbed toward high noon and she decided to take a break and look in on hal an idea had popped into her head earlier that morning and the more she thought on it the better it  seemed to her they had a cousin in atlanta and if she could persuade hal to go there he might keep out of trouble and also finish his schooling it was risky for they were sittingin there too but anything was better than having him stay in hay croft she dried her hands on her apron as she trotted up the back steps her mind suddenly urging her feet to move faster if hal were around tomorrow when all those insurance men came anything might happen he never had liked them or they him at the foot of the stairs in the living room she rested one hand lightly on the newel post and called up to him uneasy when he did not immediately respond she walked part way up the steps and saw his door standing wide open fear clogged her breath and she dashed up the remaining steps so fast her slippers nearly threw her on the foot of his bed she saw a worn pocketsize new testament and in the center was a stack of neatly typed papers edging over almost furtively she bent down to read the top sheet and now i sit me down a novel by harold lawson stonecutter so thats what hes been typing she thought in some confusion but about what she wondered slowly picking up another page which she started to read this is the day tom thought as he stood at the window idly exam ining the withered branches of the dying peach tree while another part of his mind remembered how it had been back at collegetown you were scared to death sitting there with the snarling mob at your back every hair stood out on your neck and you prayed like crazy asking god to give you courage enough not to swing at one of them then peace came as renewed strength flowed through your trembling body and you knew god was with you in the mirror you saw the contorted faces filled with ignorance and you knew they were the lost souls then you prayed again asking god to show them the way he turned from the window a slight smile on his face as he knelt by his bed then finally he got up got his cap and left the room this was the day suddenly amanda gasped holding her throat as if about to strangle hal she cried softly oh hal how could you blindly she fled from the room down the steps and out into the bright sunlit day yet she knew it was too late even as she prayed with every breath in her body even as she heard the screeching sirens in the distance she knew it but she kept on running and calling his name
the role of the negro writer in an era of struggle
itre most successful pot lemicist of this it  eration is a boysized genbugeyed negro named james baldwin ivory towerist vs activist the role of the negro writer in an era of struggle by hoyt w fuller who despite it all wants desperately to be known as a good novelist in a decade he has produced three novels and while the most  v i f elill vvvvavxy  james baldwin invests energies in seeking truth in work and life recent one another country was a bestseller none of them has received the sort of critical praise the author would like for his fiction on the other hand mr baldwin has published three collections of essays gained for him the wildest critical acclaim ever accorded a negro  writer in this country two of these volumes nobody knows my name and the fire next time also have been bestsellers and the third which in fact was his first published work of nonfiction notes of a native son has been rushed into print again to capitalize on the authors sensational popularity mr baldwin is quite pleased with the reception of his books of course both because it means the reading public is receiving his message and because it means financial independence for him but he will readily admit that his personal ambition remains to be fulfilled he wants to write novels which will draw from nonaxegrinding critics the lavish kudos his nonfiction already has earned following publication of another country in  mr baldwin undertook a series of lectures and public appearances which took him to major literary centers across the country his face and his statements became familiar in newspapers magazines and journals then in november  the new yorker magazine published a long rambling extraordinarily searching essay by mr baldwin which literallyas well as literarilyshook up the american reading public that essay of course is the meat of the book the fire next time which was rushed into printa few weeks following the appearance of the magazine suddenly organizations and literary and socialconscious groups all over the country were clamoring for the writers attention every newspaper and periodical of any significance whatever published news or reviews about him and his books and time magazine put him on its cover the television networks brought him before their cameras and it became a common sight to see the small intensely alert figure with the great eloquent eyes solemnly setting forth his con cept of the american failure and the american future on the nations tv screens he was interviewed and taped and even recordings of him talking and reading became bestsellers core beckoned and he went launching forth on a physically exhausting national tour to deliver his message in person while bringing in badly needed funds for the vital work core is performing and finally the u s attorney general called and then came calling and in a remarkable session which may have no parallel in history the negro writer who five years earlier was unknown to all but a few discerning readers was telling the man who then sat on the right hand side of the president of the united states that negro americans have reached the end of their endurance and that hereafter they would be in no mood to accept anything short of their full rights as citizens  of this country that done the little black writer hied himself off to puerto rico and again took up his typewriter to finish his play blues for mr charlie he was he explained a writer really not a politician and it is a writers duty to write nevertheless in taking valuable time away from his work to become a civil_rights activist mr baldwin demonstrated most dramatically whatfor him at any rateis the black writers role in this era of struggle it is a role which many great writers of the past have played one such was voltaire the th century french dramatist and philosopher whose attacks on religious fanaticism and political injustice twice landed him in the bastille drove him into exile and it has been said helped to bring about the french revolution another was thomas paine the american patriot whose pamphlets fired his countrymen to action in our own revolution this is a role then which involves commitment of the writer to the noblest of human values which demands of the writer as artist that he dedicate his skills to the proposition every man has the right to be free in pursuing such a role the writer serves as disturber of that spurious peace which is arrived at through the degradation of some men he seeks to move the uncommitted to positive action on the side of freedom and he exhorts those who are numbed by oppression or blinded by bigotry to turn their eyes and their energies toward that which is true and just and which is both balm and sustenance for the human spirit it would seem that the black writer himself a member of a group struggling to rise from the morass of degradation and apathy and neardespair would find such a role tailored to his peculiar specifications naturally however there are those who hold different views of the black writers role in thisor anyera of struggle particularly if that struggle is racial in the chorus of general praise which has greeted the articles and declarations by james baldwin for instance there have risen strident and discordant voices lashing out at mr baldwin in what masqueraded as a review of richard wrights posthumous novel lawd today exlife magazine correspondent arthur shay branded the writer an oedipal wreck and cried has nothing changed in the quarter century separating wright and baldwin doesnt the american dream now include some negroes in an attack on the two negro writers which bordered on hysteria the critic expressed dubious sympathy for his black compatriots the american negro has had an extraordinary run of bad luck in his literary spokesmen mr shay wrote supremely ignorant of the fact that he spoke only for white people they go mute with rage expatriating themselves from the theatre of their anguish as richard wright did they retire to some dark olympus of the spirit as james baldwin is doing and issue warnings like mail order seers mr shay conveniently forgot that richard wright was in rather distinguished company in expatriating himself great and sensitive souls have been fleeing the american nightmare for generations and they have included henry james ezra pound t s eliot gertrude stein and ernest hemingway to name a few and even so narrowvisioned an observer as mr shay ought to be able to discern by now that james baldwins warnings may have come just in time to deflect a national cataclysm partly because of them persons in authority from the white house down to community churches have been making an extra effort to put our national house in order mr baldwin never said the fire was inevitable what critics like mr shay really find so hard to bearapart from the indignity of having to listen to negroes making demands rather than pleading for mercyis the refusal of negro writers to accept the crumbs of tokenism for the whole loaf of freedom doesnt the american dream now include some negroes he asks and the inference is of course that negro writers ought to be celebrating the advances that have been made rather than endlessly complaining about remaining injustices there are after all marian anderson and ralph bunche these critics consider writers like james baldwin as dangerous as well they should although they rarely have the candor to state just what the writers are endangering after taking a series of editorial potshots at mr baldwin in his chicago tribune magazine of books column world almanac editor harry hansen admitted his irritation at the negro writer although his reasons for discomfort were singularly unconvincing mr baldwins way of talking is doing the negro writer some harm he put it displaying a sudden and touching concern for the welfare of negro writers it remained for national review editor william buckley the darling of the rightwing to state as only the rapiertongued mr buckley can state what was on all these critics minds baldwin is an eloquent menace mr buckley wrote in his syndicated column going on to equate mr baldwins indictment of white american society with adolf hitlers indictment of the weimar republic and karl marxs indictment of capitalism we need to improve mr buckley conceded speaking for the white race simultaneously we need to reorder more generously our relationship with the negro race and to reject out of hand the preposterous and suicidal counsels of the negroes most inflamed spokesman it may not be too much to assume that mr baldwin had he read mr buckleys assessment of him would have been highly complimented no selfrespecting black man could desire the approval of a man who would express even his guilt in such racially patronizing terms and that ultimately states the problem and defines the protagonists the problem concerns human freedom and dignity and those who believe in it have joined battle with those who do not it may be that some black writers being only human and therefore frail can stand aside and pursue only their muse but in this era of struggle as in all the others which have preceded it such men are not easy to imagine

the valley of death is t  ll v spread before us but i  we swallow our bitter ss»sb dosage  of lift and move ignorantly toward the hereafter one knows and scarcely knows what to expect one black hereafter is as good as a white one i had to kick their law into their teeth in order to save them each person blighted by darkness broods heavily and carries the business of hate inside like giant cobras carry their venom to alien bodies we are indeed things of dry hours the whole mess of blackness is a spit in the eye of our so called christian society a dryness is upon our house and no black man in america really owns one we have lived the life of impostors and now we must reckon with the broken spirits of our children who through their sectional marches and rides have saved us from everlasting shame in the eyes of free men everywhere save home bom in alabama bred in illinois he was nothing but a plain black boy so we go into drug stores and lunch counters displaying our painted black faces while cockroaches chase the babysitter and we declare our middleclassism wear the mink pay twice for a loose fitting store bought yes sir suit kid the kids negroes whats a negro her body is a honey bowl whose waiting honey is deep and hot what ever happened to those fun loving dancing happy people ones not a man ones not a woman grown gwendolyn brooks is a prophet and a brooder her poetry ranks with the best produced in this wild untamed country one might call her a disciple of truth she speaks of a time and country and people not easily found in the verse and prose of her peers her collected poems intensify all the known and unknown vicissitudes of negro life in america her song is too sad and delicate for the ears of white america but by sheer technique she has managed to capture a few catchers in the rye her song is too pointed and studied to awake the amateur reader among her race the high and mighty read eliot and those facile minded lows read dunbar and the rest she is alone and i fear she knows it beneath the strict didactic tones of her verse there is nothing seeable save a heart full of love and controlled hate and fantastic nostalgia hung up in the mouth of deaths life
ill never forget the summer before i was £ married how needlessly i worried about so many things all the usual difficulties expected of a new marriage were not enough for me i had heaped imaginary problem upon problem until i felt i would be crushed by the load i fancied myselfan inveterate country girlconstrained to city slums for life unclaimed by my family shunned on every side by those around me of course my worries were not completely without cause i grew up in an allwhite environment by the time i was in high school there were a few negro students attending the university in my home town but i knew no more about negro life than the snatches of news and gossip i had overheard from my uninformed and sometimes biased associates as i went through two years of college and began working i made friends from many sections of this country and some from abroad who helped liberalize my cultural outlook even among most of them however i was encouraged to look elsewhereamong my own kind for love and happiness perhaps it was because so few believed that i could make a success of an interracial marriage that spurred me on but i became determined that love was more important than a whole worldful of opinions i began to read every book and article i could find on the subject of negrocaucasian intermarriage integration education culture etc i even found articles by children of these couples which aided me considerably since most people hold the view that these children suffer intolerably naturally i had a firsthand source of information to which i could turn at any time i needed it he never spared the truth in telling me what i might expect from one group or the other i think my greatest lesson came when i was introduced to some of his negro friends for it was here that i discovered that they like he were just ordinary people some became very dear friends while others were as obnoxious to me as some other folks i know during my associations with these people  have noticed no difference in subject matter intelligence morals or any other stigma that is thought to be characteristic of the negro i found each person must be judged for himself not as a member of any group though all this may have been known by some for many years it was all new to me the more i learned the more confident i became i reached the conclusion that the only way i would ever know what it was to be the wife of a negro was to become one the day we exchanged wedding vows i was no longer afraid i looked forward to the future with hope courage and pride and i knew then as i do now that i  would always have them no matter what trials should come my way looking back on all of this now seems like remembering a dream we have encountered none of the problems i had imagined true we are sometimes stared at and some people go out of their way to be friendly but among the people we know we are just another couple i sometimes wonder what life would be for me if i had let anyone change my mind during those fearful unforeseen years we are so happy now enjoying life together thrilling over the accomplishments of our small son and busy carrying out plans for today and all the tomorrows that we will share
my people is the enemy
deception is more humiliating than rejection exploitation is more inhuman than exclusion indifference is more emr bittering than open hostility condescension is more provocative than hate the estrangement of the races in the north is more volatile more apt to explode into violence as far as i can discern than is the segregation of the races in the south the alienation of the races in new york city or chicago may turn out to be more calamitous than whatever happens in jackson or birmingham for negroes in the urban north revenge may seem sweeter than equality and violence more decisive than patience and both more honorable than the tolerance of further appeasements and postponements of course i say this out of my own experience in new yorkin harlemand from a good deal of contact with the people of the ghettos of some of the other northern citieschicago boston and detroit especially but i assert it also in the perspective of some exposure to and experience in the south during the years i lived and worked in harlem i had occasion to visit the south a good many times sometimes in mississippi and in louisiana the southern visits involved legal cases but there were also trips to georgia south carolina virginia florida and arkansas to lecture at law schools and colleges and to visit some of the churches of the south there were opportunities to give legal counsel to those involved in the sitins and freedom rides and other demonstrations both in the south and the north indeed i myself was involved in what must have been one of the original sitinsback in when i was in college in maine some of us had observed that negroes were not served at a certain hotel and that discrimination existed and was practiced in some other public accommodations although it must be said that the issue was hardly noticed publicly in maine because there were comparatively few negroes in the state there was however discrimination in some places against french canadians who had migrated to maine a bill was introduced into the legislature that condemned racial or ethnic discrimination and sought to establish a commission against discrimination several of us were working for the bills enactment one day the legislator who had sponsored the measure a man of french extraction came to see us to report that the legislation had almost no chance to pass since there was so little public interest in the issue after long discussion it was decided that three of us would go with a negro to the hotel which barred negroes and ask to be served it was arranged in advance that the legislator would be dining in the same hotel that evening and would have with him a newspaperman the expectation was that we would ask to be served and as had been the custom in the hotel be refused we would protest and the legislator having noticed the incident would intervene in our behalf while the newspaperman took photographs and got a story the publicity of the incident was supposed to enhance the prospects for the passage of the bill at the appointed hour our party arrived at the hotel and went into the dining room the senator and the reporter were halfway through their entrees after we had been sitting at the table for several minutes we noticed that the waiter had gone to speak to the manager we could not hear their conversation but soon the waiter came and asked to take our order we had to order something of course ironically we had already eaten at the college so sure we were that the hotel would not serve us among the four of us we had only about five dollars so the unfortunate senator ended up paying the checkfor our second dinner of the evening that was the result achieved in this pioneer sitin it is against the background not only of harlem but of a bit broader involvement than that that i conclude that the decisive front in the racial crisis in america is the urban north and not the south i have immense admiration for the restraint dignity and resourcefulness of the civil_rights movement in the south but the case remains that the immediate and stated objectives of that movement in the southern jurisdictions are goals that have already been substantially achieved in the northern cities at least so far as court decisions and legislation are concerned and also to a significant degree so far as integration in public transportation hotels restaurants and the like are concerned these things were attained in the north for the most part in the years after the second world war and what is to be seen when one looks now at the northern city is what happens after these legal rights and remedies which the southern demonstrations seek to win have been won the northern city in other words is setting the precedent for what is in store for the southern cities once the legal struggle to vindicate the civil_rights of negroes has been concluded and if in the days that lie immediately ahead the relations between the races are not somehow resolved peacefully then the whole nation is in for an ominous and dreadful holocaust let no man take comfort in the racial troubles of the northern cities least of all any white man from the south any more than any white northerner can appease his conscience or rationalize his indifference by the racial strife in the south no man is made innocent by the mere culpability of another man the lost frontier harlem had considered itself for a long time to be the pioneer negro community not only in the united states but in the world that seems a not unjustified pride after all new york city had been the place where the great succession of peoples of different tongues nations religions and customs had come and found albeit after patience and travail mutual accommodation a general acceptance and a share in the prosperity culture political power and common life of the city new york city represented the hospitality of american democracy to each man and to all men surely the american negro migrating from the south and the west indian negro immigrating to the continent could find here if anywhere welcome opportunity dignity and hope surely the negroes of new york would become and be here the pioneers of their race an example and encouragement and enhancement to all negroes everywhere this pioneer psychology in harlem was fed for years by the accumulation of civil_rights laws and statutory disclaimers of racial discrimination by the ceremonial use of negroes in public affairs by the praise of social equality for negroes heard in the churches downtown by the integration although here it was from the outset the most obvious economic necessityof public transportation and accommodations by the gradual if begrudged inroads of negroes into the lower echelons of public and quasipublic employment by the notoriety that some few negroes achieved in white society particularly in athletics and entertainment harlem was the leader so long as the african nations remained largely colonial harlem was the pioneer so long as the south remained segregated but now under the impact of the events in africathe emergence of the new nations there and the increasingly decisive power of africans in the united nationsand with the disruption and accelerating disintegration of southern segregation harlem frets over its destiny harlem wonders whether it has lost its pioneer initiative and suspects that every achievement of negroes in new york city and every opportunity of negroes in new york city is illusory or fraudulent or guileful no wonder a few years ago legislation was enacted in new york city barring discrimination in private multipledwelling units a law much celebrated by the local politicians as a milestone for negroes and other socalled minority groups in the city yet few negroes look for housing outside of harlem without encountering discrimination in one guise or another and even where the discriminating circumstances are such as to legally justify filing a complaint the procedure for administration of the law is so cumbersome as to be of practical consequence in only a handful of cases the new construction and renovation of housing in new york have been an efficient instrument of segregation the east side of manhattan for instance from yorkville to gramercy park is more effectually segregated today than it was fifteen years ago because the vast reconstruction of that sector of the city has made the rental or purchase of housing beyond the means of most harlem negroes yet at the same time i have been offered an apartment in yorkville for pretty much whatever you want to pay by a landlord who wants to keep the building white and if a negro family wants to move out of harlem and to queens say and purchase a house there they will find that the banks are helping to resist such moves by charging both the seller and the buyer placing fees in order to merely receive a mortgage application insofar as negroes disperse in the city both the negroes and those willing to sell housing to negroes have to pay a penalty for it the effect of factors such as these despite the legislative denunciations of discrimination is to induce the formation of new ghettos for negroes in the places in the bronx or queens or brooklyn or beacon or newburgh to which negroes move from the harlem ghetto as the negro population increases new harlems are spawned which suffer the same isolation from the rest of the city that the old harlem has known for more than a half a century housing is crucial of course because of the vicinity of neighborhood life and the importance of neighborhood institutions in the city if housing is segregated then there will also be and is de facto segregation of schools hospitals political clubs taverns stores and churches even without other considerations that favor segregation in education religion politics and the likewhere slums have been displaced by public housing projects in areas like harlem the people have often been exploited by private businessmen to take advantage of the ignorance of people with regard to their rights one of the common frauds is the furniture dealer who visits a family which has been accepted for public housing to inform them that a prerequisite for moving into their new apartment is that they have new furniture such transactions typically result in the commitment of the family to a heavily mortgaged purchase of furniture of indifferent or inferior quality with such small installment payments that they pay many times over the true value of the goods and are lucky if the furniture lasts as long as the payments of course default in the payments entitles the seller to repossess the property ironically many of these sales based upon misrepresentation are foisted on families who have been admitted to public housing because they are good rent risks that is because they have a stable if low and steady if insufficient income some could in fact qualify for credit in reputable downtown department stores but as in the case of shopping for food are reluctant to leave the neighborhood feeling that their business is unwelcome in the white stores and fearing rejection because they are negroes if they apply for credit negroes have too much and too long been not only the victims of such charlatan businessmen but also have suffered exclusion both from employment in and ownership of business enterprises even within the ghetto this is the situation which gives rise to efforts to boycott liquor stores furniture stores and other businesses in harlem itself and to campaigns to buy black during the demonstrations of the summer of  in one section of the city protesting discriminatory hiring practices of a certain restaurant chain in which scores of arrests were made it turned out that the strongest opposition to the demonstrations within the business community of that section was the crime syndicate the businessmen of organized crime were distressed by the demonstrations because they caused a substantial increase in the numbers of policemen assigned to the area and thus made it more dangerous and difficult for drugs to be peddled and for the numbers racket to operate it is also likely that the syndicate fears integration in business because it might eventually require admitting negroes to the rackets as well as to legitimate businesses the sanction invoked by the syndicate to line up the opposition of businessmen and others in the area was to threaten to call in and collect loans made by the syndicate to otherwise legitimate businessmen who might be ready to go along with integration in public accommodations stores and the like or take hospitals not long ago i had a negro client who had taken her child one sunday to a public playground the child who was five years old fell at the playground hitting his head on the concrete surface a few blocks away there is a private hospital related by the way to one of the churches the mother took her child there and after waiting nearly an hour in the socalled emergency reception section was finally interviewed by a doctor who explained that the mother would have to take the child to a public hospital since she could not afford care at this institution and since thats what the public hospitals are for actually of course the private hospital could have been reimbursed by public welfare for any care given to the child although at rates set by the welfare authorities rather than by the hospital administration the nearest public hospital was four miles away so after having been turned away the mother took the child there walking part of the way and going by bus part of the way since she had no money for a taxi after a further wait at the public hospital the child was examined and it was found that he had suffered a serious injury which might permanently disable him the doctors say that if the child had received prompt attention the consequences of the injury would likely have been much less serious the mother in the case worked as a domestic she told her employer about the matter and he in turn reported it to me it seemed likely that the reason the child had not been admitted to the private hospital was either because the family was poor or negro or most likely both the mother however refused to make any formal complaint against the doctor and private hospital because as she explained she had no hope whatever that she could prevail after all why should she a negro expect to be treated fairly or humanely by the law any more than she had been by the private hospital and besides the prosecution of the complaint would not heal her child while the matter was being discussed i called a friend of mine who is a reporter on one of the major new york newspapers one which professes a great concern for human rights  told him what had happened and suggested that it might be worthwhile publicizing this incident to call attention to discrimination in the private hospitals of the city but he said that the incident was not newsworthy and that his paper received as many as a dozen reports a day of similar cases its only a story for us he said if the kid dies or if the injury is really grotesque one of the uglier incidents which was thought to be newsworthy happened a few years ago in harlem a babyjust over two years old developed a high fever and his mother a negro took him to a public hospital the interne who examined the child told the mother that it was a minor respiratory intection and prescribed some medicine the mother took the child home administered the medicine but found in the next day or two that the fever did not abate they returned to the hospital this time a different interne was on duty and he sent the mother and baby to the tuberculosis ward saying that he suspected that this was the ailment testing there indicated that it was not and again the mother and baby were discharged after having been given some additional medicine three days later when the babys fever and discomfort persisted the mother for the third time went to the hospital waited her turn and while the child was being examined by the doctor it died an autopsy subsequently established that the child had died not from a respiratory infection not from incipent tuberculosis but from an infection caused by the bite of a rat thats the sort of story that makes the newspapers and that is the sort of incidentalong with the playground casethat causes many negroes to conclude that they can expect little care from hospitals or at least little competent care in short in virtually every sector of the citys lifehousing education and medical care in business politics and employment in the welfare administration and the enforcement of the lawnegroes still suffer discrimination and segregation despite the legislative disclaimers of discrimination and the public promises of the politicians the tragedy and irony of harlem is that while negroes have been lost in fondness for the image of harlem as the pioneer for all negroes harlem has remained the place and symbol of persistent if sometimes subtle discrimination excluded from the housing politics lawful protection commercial enterprise common culture education economic opportunity sanitation and free access characteristic of the rest of the city and taken for granted by the white people downtown the great affront to harlems pioneer destiny is that harlem still exists 
the passion for revenge this is no report by the way about the extreme racists within the negro community about the black muslims or the black nationalists although both exist and increasingly thrive in harlem and in the other great urban ghettos of the north and they are by no means to be dis counted or underestimated indeed as far as the muslims are concerned they are well financed some say with funds from the arab sourcesand apparently they are congenial with the white racists of the american nazi party at least i myself have seen some proof of their association with the american nazi but these extremiststhe muslimsseem to have made a fatal tactical mistake in their attempts to exploit the unrest and frustration and sentiment for revenge among american negroes especially in the north they have required their adherents not just to hate white men though that is their central doctrine and essential aopeal they also require that their members renounce their relieious inheritancewhich in harlem is either the gospel tradition in protestantism or in the case of west indian immigrants roman catholicismand embrace the indoctrination of a new and strange and unfamiliar religion which incidentally bears little truthful resemblance to historic islam and to further submit to the discipline and rigorous piety of the new faith with respect to practical behavior from day to day the muslims have made hate too complicated and difficult and much too contingent upon a peculiar moralism to become a movement that receives mass support or so it seems to me simply as an observer yet there is no doubt that the central emphasis of the extremistslike the muslimsin the negro communities of the north upon the simple hatred and rejection of white men because they are white men has enormous and increasing appeal among the negroes of the city ghettos the great danger for both negroes and whites is that some leader will emerge who will turn to his people and preach a blunt doctrine of hate and revenge because the ground has been so well prepared by extremists of both races it will be difficult to organize longsuppressed emotion and legitimate grievances into a powerful movement if that comes to pass the peaceful demonstrations in the streets will cease and the revolution will become an insurrection if that does happen if there is a violent and bloody calamity perhaps white men will then recognize that the incumbent leadership of the negro revoltnotably martin_luther_king with his great dignity and discipline and restrainthas been the best friend of white americans both in the north and the south each day of diehard indifference of white people in the north each day of diehard segregation in the south invites disaster by making it more difficult for the negro leadership favoring and practicing nonviolent protest to maintain its leadership the nonviolent demonstrations have after all been going on for about five years on a significant scale and reached a climax in the march on washington in august of  if from these demonstrations there is not some tangible result to which the present negro leadershio can point it may be expected with certainty that the patience of negroes will be exhausted and they will turn to other leaders and to other tactics and turn from seeking redress of their grievances to taking revenge for the indignities they have suffered through three hundred years of slavery and segregation no account is given here of the extremists in harlem but the danger is that harlemalong with each of the little harlems of the nation is driven to extremity one sign of how much racism tempts negroes is the degree to which some leaders among them who are not muslims or nationalists feel constrained to imitate and recite racist doctrines some of the statements of congressman adam clayton powell reflect this change in the mood and militancy of harlem i recall for another instance attending a rally in harlem some time ago protesting police brutality one of the speakers was a certain negro minister whom i know well and who has been very moderate it happens that this man is of very fair complexion and could easily pass for a white man when he began his speech he apologized for his light color whereupon he was booed by the crowd he persisted in his apology and said that though he was light he knew the full burden of being a negro in america more booing he changed his tactic and launched into the most provocative and virulent racist speech i think i have ever heard advocating among other things black supremacy and resort to violence to oppose the violence of the police this time the crowd was with him he had sensed the depth of their hostility and had appeased it but there is a sequel to the incident after the rally i went to greenwich village where i had a date to have a drink with a white student who had just returned to the city from a freedom ride in mississippi as we sat in the restaurant who should come in but the minister who had given the racist address at the rally and guess who was with him a white girl the important thing so far as i am concerned is not the duplicity of the ministerthat is a problem he must live with all alonebut rather that he had felt that black supremacy and revenge had become so much the spirit of harlem that he had to identify with it he tried first of all to do that in his pitiful apology for his light skin and when that failed he succeeded in gaining the crowd by outdoing even the professional racists in harlem a particularly ominous sign of the extremisties of negro animosity is the emergence in the open of negro antisemitism it is a complex phenomenon and one which has as far as i can observe been spawned over a very long time part of the picture is a sense of the uniqueness of the negro cause as such and a reluctance among negroes to identify their cause with that of other minorities not only the jews but also for example puerto ricans this sentiment much prevails in spite of the historic interest of the jews in america in the civil_rights of all citizens and in the case of the puerto ricans in spite of their common problems negroes do not want to be lumped together with other minorities but there is evidence of particular resentment at being associated with the jews one reason for this is the direct competition now between negroes and jews in politics in new york in the succession of migrations and immigrations of the different ethnic groups there has been a succession to political power that roughly parallels the order of the immigrations for a while the germans were politically powerful but they were displaced by the irish and the irish in time by the italians as the dominant group but in this succession the jews did not receive their turn they were not welcome in politics although their numbers justified political recognition it is only comparatively recently through the device of a third party with preponderantly jewish leadership and membership and through the socalled reform movement in the democratic party that the jews have received something like the political recognition and patronage status that their numbers and social and economic influence would have brought to other groups long since the problem is that the jews have belatedly emerged in great strength in city politics at just the time when the negro demand for political power and patronage has become insistent consequently the two minorities which have suffered the most harsh discrimination in city politics are now in the position of competing with each other for political power and patronage rather than being united in a common political cause but politics is not the only cause of negro antisemitism there are unfortunate instances in which negroes have endured illtreatment at the hands of individual jews a typical instance is when tenants live in slums where the landlord happens to be jewish i have had two cases where the landlords of abominable slums were rabbiswhich hardly improves the image of the jews in the eyes of negroes the fact is too that some of the furniture dealers who have victimized negroes moving into new housing have been jewish and this further feeds antisemitism even the substantial philanthropy of jews for the civil_rights struggle and their sincere sympathy for the plight of the negroes are greeted with suspicion and resentment who are they to speak for us is a common form which this hostility takes nobody but a negro can know what it means to be a negro is the sentiment which rejects identification on the part of jews with the negro cause yet the overriding reason for negro antisemitism as far as i can discern is that it is some awful emulation of the antisemitism so long prevalent and so unyielding among middle and upperclass white protestants and catholics for generations these citizens who have been ascendant in american society have made antisemitism a mark of social and political status something which while it seldom took the form of open persecution was and still too much remains an accepted attitude and practice insofar as this is the basis of negro antisemitism it places white christians in an excruciating position on one hand they must now stand beside the jews and share with the jews the hostility of negroes toward all white people but at the same time they themselves are authors of one form of that very hostilitythe antisemitism of negroes which imitates the antisemitism of white protestants and catholics such is the economy of judgment in any event now it is at least in the open no longer latent and snide and festering but brought into the open by the boycotts of jewish merchants in harlem the rent strikes against some jewish landlords and the attempts to integrate some unions and industries that have heretofore been predominantly white and jewish now that it is in the open perhaps it can and will be dealt with in a way which both affirms the uniqueness of the negro and the grandeur of the negros struggle and also in some way works a reconciliation among negroes and jews and white christians the spirit of revenge which stalks the streets of harlem and the other urban ghettos is one which increasingly regards any association in public between negro and white as suspect as a guilty association one which calls into question the loyalty and racial pride of the negro one in which the negro is thought to be tempted or intimidated or cajoled or purchased into some compromise of his integrity and identity as a negro an event like the censure of a philip randolph the distinguished leader of the american negro labor council and virtually the patriarch of harlem by the executive council of the aflcio for his exposure of racial discrimination in the unionsthe proof of which has been amply documentedabets the suspicion that when a negro tries to negotiate or collaborate with whiteseven those who protest most that they are liberalshe must either betray himself and his people or suffer humiliation even the word negro is dropping from usage in favor of the term black man in order to express the pride a man who is black should have in being black and the disdain that black men should have toward white men there was a time for example when prostitution in new york involved supplying negro girls to white patrons from downtown and when some brothels in harlem catered largely to white customers those days are gone a negro prostitute does not have white customers any more no matter what the price because to associate with white people is a disloyalty to her race and people and their cause just as much ior a prostitute as for any uncle tom in politics or the churches the intensity of the rejection of association with white people apparent among negroes should be enough to put to rest the red herring in the civil_rights crisis regarding intermarriage the fact is bluntly that most negroes hate white people when there is as there will surely be integration in public life in americahousing and education and politics and jobs and public accommodationsthere will not suddenly be a great increase in marriages between the races at least i have detected no greater interest in the subject among negroes than among whites and why should there be much interest in the subject nobody is interested in marriage in the abstract marriage is a personal issue and decision and it remains that with respect to marriages between the races if marriage in a serious and responsible sense is being contemplated the intermarriage issue is empirically baseless and where advanced as an obstacle to the right of negroes to be received and welcomed as citizens in public life represents a gross irrational and stupid vanity on the part of white people and it is aptly the subject of ridicule i know a seminary professor a native white southerner who is a strong advocate of the negro cause long before the present crisis he was an eloquent and effective witness in the south for civil_rights he has a very attractive daughter eligible for marriage he tells me that he is invariably asked after giving a speech in support of civil_rights what he himself would do if a negro proposed to his daughter his stock answer to this query is to say first of all i would ask him whether he was a protestant a catholic or a jew or to show how ridiculous this intermarriage issue is from another point of view i recollect recently being in the south and meeting an elderly negro gentleman he as it happensand as is the case with many negroes of slave ancestry in this countryhad a white father asked one day by a white southerner about this he replied that he indeed had a white father the conversation was overheard by another negro who after the white southerner had departed approached my friend and said tom dont you ever ever do that again dont you ever admit to a white southerner that your father was a white man you tell em that it was your mother who was white in other words intermarriage when posed as an abstract and impersonal issue is irrelevant to the civil_rights of negro citizens there is no serious evidence of any significant interest abstractly and impersonally in intermarriage among either whites or negroes whereas there is plenty of evidence of the slavery era having fostered many many interracial liaisons and later on evidence of negro prostitution for white customers so let the specter of intermarriage be put to rest the issue it really raises is the sexual ethics of white men outside of marriage both in the days of slavery and in the days of the traveling salesman and let two people fall in love and marry if they are given the gift of love even though they be of different races though they be different in any other way they will have and probably will continue to have for a long time more difficulties than most marriages in this society but the issue then is not so much societys as theirs and if under the burdens which this society adds to any interracial marriage they survive and prosper as man and wife and as a family that only enhances the dignity and maturity of their love it is in anv case no reason to oppose or deny any negro his place and his prerogatives as an american citizen ironically though the passion for revenge is active and i fear increasing within the negro community especially in the urban north that which has subdued and controlled this passion is the same thing which in the end mav be the proximate cause of vengeance and violence what has mainly quieted the advocates of violence and counseled extraordinary restraint in the negro revolution has been the leadership crisis within the negro community itself if any proof were needed which none isof the profound humanity of negroes it is supplied by the infighting and pettiness and personality conflicts the competitiveness an throatcutting within the negro establishment itself they are just like white people scrapping and fighting and destroying each other in all this maneuvering and internal struggle for leadership of the negro revolution the rest of the nation has gained some time to acknowledge and respond to the revolution but now that time is running out and if the negro leadership crisis among core naacp sclc the urban league the student movements the black racists and the remaining uncle toms is not resolved then racial chaos is urely in store for america the masses of negro people have at last been moved they will not wait long for a leader nor dally about who the leader is they will move by themselves if need be without a leader and the revolution will become an insurrection they are tired they are frustrated they are angry they are impatient they are aggressive they are ready for a leader buti thinkthey are also ready to go into the streets without a leader all by themselves as other men have had to do from time to time to defend and vindicate their own humanity the depths of estrangement if one looks today at the cities of the north where the decisive struggle in the negro revolution is taking shape the conclusion is inescapable that the estrangement between the races in the north is virtually complete despite the northern civil_rights legislation despite the commissions on human rights despite the ceremonial presence of negroes in public life despite the liberalism of many white northerns despite good intentions and naive sincerity racism has not been exorcised indeed racism increases it not only becomes more evident and intransigent among white people as negroes press their claims with greater vigor and determination but latent in negroes it begins to emerge and flourish among them the truth is that in the years since the beginning of substantial migration of negroes from the south to the northern cities and of the immigration of negroes from the west indies to the northern cities there has been precious little honest honorable or significant communication between the races the platitudes of tolerance it turns out conceal the practice of discrimination for the american idea of tolerancethough it be less vehement than south africas apartheidis after all a generically similar doctrine of racial coexistence the promises of acceptance freedom and society in the northern city have not been validated in education jobs housing politics or the equal protection of the law everything seemed fine for many years but the condition of that tranquillity was the acquiescence of negro citizens in a secondclass status and a ghetto existence separated from the comforts mobility and opportunities of life in the outer city the platitudes and promises the liberalism and benign intentions of northern white society during the last fifty years in which the negro migration to the cities has taken place mean little when it remains true to this day that eightyfive per cent of all negroes in metropolitan new york for example live in one or another of five neighborhoods which are virtually entirely black and in consequence send their children to black schools worship in black churches dine at black restaurants attend black movies theaters and in all the ordinary facets of community life associate almost entirely with their fellow negroes the main contact with the white people for the multitude of northern negroes has been when some negro has left harlem to go to workas a domestic in an east side penthouse as a sanitation department employee to collect the waste of the rest of the city or to wait on tables in a downtown restaurant which seldom has a negro customer to scrub the floors of empty offices late at night to sell body and dignity to a white businessman for a night or to entertain white people in a club or bar of course in all this time some negroes have made the grade and have achieved a certain acceptance in and access to white society some have made it as has been earlier mentioned by becoming quislings only a few have made it without that humiliation one is dr anna arnold hedgeman despite the eminence she achieved it is constructive to see how she constantly had to resist being used by white society dr hedgeman began her professional career as a school teacher in  the dark regions of mississippi but later after some years of community work in the midwest moved to new york where she was an executive with the harlem ywca engaged in a multitude of efforts to raise the educational occupational and cultural level of harlem long before the present sitins and demonstrationsindeed before some of the leaders of the present negro revolution were bornshe and others including a philip randolph were engaged in trying to qualify negroes for jobs in urban society and then in trying to secure jobs for them the reason the major department stores in new york have negro salespeople today is a credit to anna hedgemans pioneering work twenty years ago from her baptism in teaching and community work she went to washington as the executive director of the national council for a permanent fair employment practices commission she led the effort to enact legislation to make the wartime fepc permanent president trumans support of this legislation motivated mrs hedgeman to campaign and to raise funds from negroes across the country for trumans reelection in  as a result she was appointed assistant to oscar ewing the head of the federal security agency mrs hedgeman later returned to new york city was an assistant manager in the first campaign of robert wagner for mayor of new york and after his election was invited to join his administration it soon developed that this was an invitation to become an uncle tom it was an invitation to have a negro presence adorn the city administration but not engage in any serious work or exercise any significant influence on the policies of the administration three different jobs were offered to mrs hedgeman one was a post already held by a negro she refused this on the grounds that it represented no gain for her people or recognition for her if she simply replaced another negro in a position that had already been allocated to negroes in accordance with the de facto ethnic quota system which prevails in so much of new york politics then she was asked if she would become a seventh deputy police commissioner again replacing a negro mrs hedgeman had no specific qualifications for such a position and would have been consigned there to a merely ceremonial role she would have no part of that in spite of the salary prestige and publicity to be gained by accepting finally she was tendered an office in the mayors cabinet which she did accept in the mayors cabinet in new york there are several positions of ministers without portfolio often acting as trouble shooters in city affairs reporting and directly responsible to the mayor without going through departmental channels in practice these offices are dispensed in a way that insures the ethnic balance the mayors administra tion needs to attract and hold support from the various ethnic blocs in the citys voting population in appointing mrs hedgeman mayor wagner may have felt especially inspired for here he had a representative of three of the citys neglected minorities mrs hedgeman was not only a negro but a woman and a protestant the day of the inauguration came and with suitable fanfare the cabinet was sworn in it was not long before mrs hedgeman discovered that she was not expected to show up at city hall or to maintain an office there her function was to decorate occasions when it seemed important for the image of the administration to have a negro or a woman or a protestant or some combination thereof on the scene even after being sworn in as assistant to the mayor she was again unsuccessfully offiered the police assignmentan inept attempt to relegate her to a nominal and vassal role there was some consternation at city hall in the davs and weeks that followed because of mrs hedgemans insistence that she wanted to be a functioning working member of the administration not a ceremonial occasional officer it became clear that she was not interested in patronage for herself but in accomplishing something for her people eventually as might have been predicted anna hedgeman resigned from the wagner administration her life of authentic concern shows her to have been a pioneer in the present civil_rights demonstrations which have now forever established that negroes will no longer be appeased by promises platitudes and nominal recognition it was anna hedgeman who years ago had foreseen before almost anyone else either black or white the gravity of the estrangement between negroes and whites in american society especially in the urban north one afternoon she said to me very few negroes and white people are in real communication with each other those of us who can and do speak honestly as you and i do must keep in touch and help others to learn the quality of communication necessary if the races are to be reconciled this will be very hard and will become more difficult as the crisis deepens but that just makes it all the more important that we keep in touch i remember not long ago spending hours on the telephone receiving calls in turn from some of the negro leaders in the civil_rights struggle and then from some of the white church leaders who had somewhat belatedly and somewhat suddenly become committed to direct action in the struggle the calls were distressing because they showed how radical the estrangement of the races is even perchance especially in the churches there were two sorts of calls on the occasion that i recollect one kind came from white ecclesiastical officers who reported that the churches had decided to enter into direct action in support of the civil_rights of negroes but they wanted to know whether this or that negro was the one with whom to discuss the matter the other kind of call came from negroes who having received inquiries from the white ecclesiastics wanted to know if they should bother to meet with them because they were not really sure that those who had called them could be trusted and they wanted to know if i trusted the white people who had been involved in such overtures this is not only proof of how wide the alienation between the races has becomeit is not even widely known who to begin to try to talk withbut it is also evidence of how fragile and inadequate the avenues of tolerance and humanism are for serious and candid communication between the races i remember also this is another type of example being invited more than two years ago to lecture at columbia law school on the racial crisis in the city especially as it pertained to politics i spoke before an audience of bright young white law students they listened to the lecture i thought in a rather sullen way the burden of the lecture is the burden of this chapter of my bookthat one who becomes somehow immersed in some of the visceral and brutal realities of the racial crisis cannot escape a premonition of chaos and imminent disaster what i had to report that night was later to become the substance of an article race religion and revenge published by the christian century in their issue of february   pages  to  gave the speech and said i trust what as nearly as  could figure out as a white man was and is the truth about the relations between races in the northern cities when i finished there were a lot of comments from the law students they fell roughly into two categories the first alleged that i had been too harsh and pessimistic about the relations between the races in america and these assertions were documented by the experiences of some of the students themselves such as the fact that several of them had been exposed to negroes in new yorktaxi drivers and waiters and the likeand had been treated by them in these situations with civility and courtesy after further discussion it soon became apparent to the students that the casual contacts they had experienced with taxi drivers elevator operators waiters and so on did not constitute significant nor even honest and honorable communication with negroes in the city so that line of attack on my paper was abandoned the line which took its place was much more revealing they said in effect well the trouble with you stringfellow is that you have lived so long among them that you have begun to think like they do their objection finally as far as i could comprehend it was that i by living and working those years in harlem had somehow ceased to  be a white man or at least had lost the capacity and authority to speak as a white manthrough i suppose overexposure to negroes if that be the case let it be all this time i had thought that there is something unique about being a human being something which transcends all of our human differences and diversities whether of race or age or class or profession or sex or wealth or whatever and if it must come to pass in the agonizing tensions and fears which characterize the racial crisis that any white man regards meor any one of a number of other white menas traitors to our race m and heritage then let that be it can only prove how deep and pathetic the estrangement of the races has become in this society so fond of boasting of its democracy and regard for humanity the estrangement is almost complete the proof of that is in the socalled white liberals of the north as much as or perhaps more than in the white segregationists of the south for these white northerners in the professions of liberalism toward the negroes suffer from a mentality which still assumes that white men retain the initiative in the racial crisis and that white men have and should continue to have the prerogative of determining the pace of the negros emancipation and the terms of his reception into full citizenship what do the negroes want they ask not discerning that this very question embodies the essence of white supremacy even though perhaps it be a more subtle and more genteel white supremacy than that characteristic of the irrational and crude segregationists of the deep south that questionwhat do the negroes wantpresupposes that what the negroes want is for the whites to give as if in this society the whites retain some right to dispense to the negroes or to anybody else what is theirs by birthright and citizenship and in truth by their common humanity white men have no authoritylegally or morallyto rule upon any demands of negroes white men have only to acknowledge and honor at last the same civil and human rights for negroes that they treasure for themselves yet the condescension among northern whites is still conspicuous and one might add obnoxious it is in its own fashion much more embittering and provocative much more incitive and diehard than the rabid traditional and sometimes pathological racism of the south it not only assumes that whites hold the initiative in the resolution of the racial crisis which is a fantasy since the initiative has now conclusively passed into the hands of the negroes as the past few years attest but it also still treats participation by white citizens in the civil_rights struggle as a good causeas a cause that ought to be supported by people of principle and conscience just as aid to refugees might also be supported with time and money or just as the work of the united nations might be upheld with words and occasional actions the only thing is that this is no good cause not at least in the sense that refugee assistance or apologetics for the united nations may be the negro revolution is no ordinary charity to which enlightened whites should give their donations and their names the negro revolution is rather an authentic revolution in which the whole prevailing social order of the nation is being overturned in the face of three hundred years of slavery segregation discrimination and de facto racism throughout the country every important institution in the public life of the nation education employment unions churches entertainment housing politics commerce investment welfare transportation public accommodationsis immediately affected by this revolution and this revolution will not spend its course until every such institution surrenders to its objectives the only real question is the means by which the inevitable integration of american public life will take place peaceably or violently realistically or obstinately today or tomorrow this is no good cause in the conventional sense of the term and to treat it as suchas so many northern liberals still dois in itself condescending and stupid how then should white people especially those in the north treat this issue first of all they must surrender their prerogative of decision first of all they must face the fact that the real decisions determining how the racial crisis will be resolved are for the negroes to make first of all they must give up the idea that they have and should continue indefinitely to have the prerogatives of white supremacy first white people must die to that mentality by suffering the hostility and rejection of negroes and by risking their lives and the future of this society in the hands of the negroes that is the preface to reconciliation between black men and white men
