would you want your w  daughter to marry  one  what kind of a question is that and why do you keep asking lately we have noticed that your daughters name crops up in every conversation concerning the rights of negroes last year approximately   marriages were reported in the u s of this number some   were negroes no statistics are available as to how many of the latter married into your race one reason might be that many of the ones you fear as a soninlaw were actually as white as your daughter one thing is certain it is obvious that none of them married your daughter either because your daughter wouldnt have one or one wouldnt have your daughter so whats your gripe now if the negro is the inferior creature you accuse him of being then your worries are over and your question goes begging surely your daughter must have a sense of smell therefore her nose should support your thesis that the negro stinks if the negros cranial capacity is a year throwback to the neanderthal man as you contend the only reason your daughter would accept such a creature as her lifes mate would be that she is equally deficient if that is the case then you should give your blessings to such a union even you will agree it would be better for her to be married to one than to snatch flies in an institution now because you are my brother and i use the term advisedly perhaps i can help you find comfort in your attempt to preserve the  sanctity and virtue of your race and progeny your daughter need not marry one if you follow a few guide lines i shall present them gratuitously an examination of the total marriage population of our country reveals that statistics are in your comer if one could determine the number of marriages involving negroes only and negroes and whites the percentage of interracial marriages would seem insignificant it would likewise be to your advantage to lower this percentage still further by raising your fair daughter on a farm data on hand reveals that intermarriage rates are higher in urban areas than in rural areas of the  states it would do well for you to live in one of the  states having statutes that make interracial marriages a crime this is true of all southern states and in all but five of the nonsouthern states west of the mississippi but only in indiana among the northern states east of the mississippi not only is intermarriage prohibited in mississippi but this state has a criminal statute for punishing anyone for publishing printing or circulating any literature in favor of or urging interracial marriage or social equality  it appears then that of all the states in the union the land of the sweet magnolias would ideally serve as the remover of all your fears indeed in this state in spite of the entrance of james meredith into ole miss your daughter might grow up to be acclaimed as several others have been before her miss america no pun intended  before you decide to move it is only fair to warn you that there are some states and cities that you must avoid at all cost stay clear of new york chicago detroit and boston interracial marriages in these areas rose to a notorious high of  per cent during the past  years if you are honest in protecting your daughter from this abominable statistic go south old man go south with apologies to horace greeley some northern states however may be entered with relative safety in fact back home in indiana no matter how much one might be in love with your daughter or how much your daughter might be in love with one no justice of the peace judge or clergyman can legally perform such a ceremony any person who forges racial strains together in the unholy chains of matrimony is subject to a fine imprisonment or both a study of interracial marriages raises another point you should consider the possibility of your daughter marrying a negro is raised somewhat if she has been previously married particularly if she has been married more than twice to a gentlemen of her own ethnic background it appears then that the best contribution you can make in conserving your racial stock is to make sure that her first marriage is for real by all means if she is predisposed to get rid of her first mate find her a man any man as long as his face is white lets face factseach time she gets a divorce she is moving in the direction of your nightmare another safeguard at your disposal is for you to become a millionaire the daughters of rich men will think twice before risking being disinherited  it becomes most necessary at this point to protect her from your own history in the field of race relations she must never learn that you yourself are a firm believer in segregation in the streets and integration between the sheets consequently your argument to keep the race pure is suspect the late william e b du bois once expressed it thusly the rape which you gentlemen have inflicted on helpless black women in defiance of your own laws is written on the foreheads of two million mulattoes and written in ineffable blood of course we recognize that this is not viewed by you as a breach of morals what has been true for the white gander obviously must be avoided by the black gander but doesnt it strike you as unfair that black geese in the past were forced to bear mixed geese it would be interesting to know what your daughter would think if she realized that a few of the black boys toward whom she now throws flirtatious glances are actually her blood brothers here is where i join you in fearing her marrying one such a marriage would be incestuous wouldnt you agree now i hope this doesnt shake you but what is needed today is an effort to remove the restrictive laws barring intermarriage from the statutes let me reassure you the reason is not what you are presently thinking it is not so much that we desire access to your daughter as much as we insist on access to dignity we refuse to believe that we are an inferior people in spite of your daughter you see we must do away with the statutes for the honor of our own daughters as it stands now my daughter has no recourse to law to protect her from your exploitation in fact she must bear your illegitimate child while i cannot even use my shotgun to give my grandson a name your daughter is surrounded by protective instruments ranging from fines shotguns imprisonment under law and lord help us lynching outside of the law now i must be fair the birth of illegitimate children as a result of mixed alliances has decreased radically in the past decade several factors brought this about in the antebellum days where slavemasters had unrestricted access to their slaves such children were numerous after emancipation the negro was cemented in a caste system by laws and codes of en forced segregation currently the negros increasing interest in his own racial pride discourages promiscuity between races to these factors can be added an almost universal knowledge of the use of contraceptives in his book the american dilemma gunnar myrdal made an acute observation in the negros drive for civil_rights much of the opposition derived from the white mans reluctance to allow his daughter to view the entire prospective in fact myrdal ranked  the white mans arguments for segregation in the following order  intermarriage  social intercourse such as dancing and bathing etc  segregated facilities schools churches  political disenfranchisement  equal job opportunities and housing the negros rank order in his argument for civil_rights is exactly inverse to that of the white mans in reading the racists fears in reverse order then his daughter is found at the bottom of the list now please we are not suggesting that we are disrespectful of your kin we only regret that she is not as important to us as she is to you indeed were sorry but miss anne does not fall into the category of our present needs even if she did since so many of us are unemployed we could not support her in the manner to which she has been accustomed when civil_rights issues are raised in congress senators from the south rise up to filibuster whatever other argument they might present they are actually rising in defense of your daughter it would do well for them to remember that the negros interest does not incline toward your progeny perhaps a letter from you to them reminding them of this fact might shorten their debate whereas more time may be given to such matters as cutting your taxes now i must admit many of us have misled you negro leaders have been continually asked what their viewpoints are on intermarriage most of their answers have been vague neither condoning nor condemning forget it you see most of their thinking is in the area of organizing demonstrations marches on washington sitins picketing etc they have no time to be thinking of the future welfare of your daughter so they havent given it much thought to give serious thought to your daughters nuptial potentials would drain them of the intellectual stamina so sorely needed by the negro masses some of them will even agree with you and say such marriages are unwise even so dont be misled such an answer does not mean they are admitting to negro inferiority what they are saying in essence is that they recognize the infantile emotions you display on the subject you may rest assured that these answers are given as contributions to your own mental health finally if your daughter can break through the maze of your maniacal fears and the negros disinterest if she can bridge the gaps outlined in this discourse more power to her if she dares to cast her lot with her sisters in the  per cent and if she risks bearing children to the trash heaps of denial as promised by your prejudice feel proud indeed give her your blessing few fathers can boast of daughters with such rare intestinal fortitude 
about your childs iq what you should know
testing has been one of the boons to modern education that has aided the teacher in aiding the child but like many a blessing when handled improperly can become a curse in the hands of the unskilled or uninformed the information regarding a childs ability or lack of ability can become damaging rather than helpful exactly what is an iq or intelligence quotient technically it is the ratio between the chronological and mental age if a child has a mental age of eight years  months and a chronological age of  years  months his iq is  a figure derived from dividing the first figure by the second this child is considered slightly above average if the reverse were true that is if his mental age is  while his chronological age is  the resultant quotient is  and he is considered slow a score of   is average from  is very bright above that is considered genius however the parent must keep in mind that these are approximations and guides to potentiality rather than hardandfast guarantees when a fond parent presents herself at a guidance office and demands to know her childs iq she is elated when she is told that he has a  rating she automatically envisions honors piled upon her offsprings head not listening as the advisor tells her that the testing indicates a high potential which the child will have to work to fulfill it may also mean the child works faster or can absorb faster than others but without the proper study attitudes and habits her child may be like the hare in the aesops fable surprisingly surpassed by some plodding tortoise unwittingly she may pass on attitudes to the child that cause him to sit back and wait for good things to come to him or she may cause him to develop a superiority complex that makes him a burden rather than an addition to a classroom intellectual snobs have not been an unknown quantity even in second grade there are some rare youngsters who can take this kind of information for what its worth as one remarked now that i have my genius license where do i go from here conversely the parent whose child is average may be very disappointed as though normalcy was something rather disgraceful the average child may produce far more than average results so much depending upon personality and drive it is a combination of factors that makes the individual what he is as a contributor to our society and we must not fall into  the trap of categorizing a youngster through a series of tests feeling that we can mathematically predict his future so far testing measures mainly literate skills and except for a few new tests on the market does not even attempt to measure creative ability a child may write beautiful prose that is badly misspelled and devoid of commas and will score far below the child who knows mechanics yet any publisher can tell you that proofreaders are not a rare commodity while good writers are oftentimes the youngster who does well on the older standard tests can absorb facts and reevaluate them this does not mean he can tear apart accepted reasoning and create anything new thomas edison probably would have scored low on standard testing he was a pragmatist who had little use for accepted theory performing feats that bookbright and literate scientists assured him were theoretically impossible he often remarked that when he needed certain types of brains he bought them by the dozen it was because of this that he appreciated charles steinmetz who had a unique combination of creative and absorbed brilliance einstein too achieved eminence because he brought new ideas to mathematics and physics ripping away theory that had existed since newton it was the freshness of his conceptual vision that opened the fantastic new worlds of nuclear science with his lack of interest and absentmindedness we can only speculate on the testing results he would have achieved the english teacher often smiles wryly as she admits to herself that jack london never attended high school that oneill flunked playwriting at harvard that jack kerouac writes runon sentences fracturing almost every standard grammatical rule it is true that we live in a world where a high scholastic rating insures a college degree which is an almost automatic entree into the upper economic echelonsbut we will find men and women at the top who did not get there by the high iq highway school administrators do not want to pass on statistical information rashly because they are so aware of the danger of tagging a child as average slow or superior in many schools even teachers can not have such information unless a child has become a problem because even among teachers there can be the one who says oh johnny only has a  iq he couldnt get a  in english id better lower the mark johnny may have a  iq but he may have overaverage language ability perhaps there is a nonlanguage factor in his skills that lowered his general average peter on the other hand may have a  iq and not do as well in english as johnny because conversely the nonlanguage factors raised his average or perhaps even though both language and  nonlanguage abilities are high peter is not an avid student and only does well what he can do easily one figure that betokens iq can not tell the whole story because of the complexity of the human element the results of any one test can only give one facet of the complete picture and the results of any one test appraised alone can not be taken as conclusive it may only be taken as one indication of the direction in which the evaluation is going the most important factors in an achievement test improperly called an iq test are the separate scores of the childin language and nonlanguage areas and in separate subject fields it is most important for the parent to become cognizant of the childs positive abilities and conversely to become aware of his weaknesses so that aid may be offered through further diagnostic and remedial testing rare indeed is the child who needs no help or guidance the very bright sometimes lack humility or are socially immature the average child sometimes needs a buildup of his confidence and a retraining in basic skills a slow child may need most of all patience and understanding and appreciation for the good qualities he has above all the parent must keep in mind that testing is a guide and an aid not an end in itself that will provide a child with an automatic passport to intellectual greatness
the negroes greatest gift to american society
there used to be a number of pamphlets and documentary films expounding on the theme americaa great melting pot for foreign peoples inevitably there would be a section devoted to the contributions of the various minority groups that emigrated here the germans would be cited for their brewing talents the jews for their scientists and financiers the italians for their operas the irish for their politicians and the negroes for their contributions to labor and to music these groups were always shown as living together in peace and productivity making america great strong and democratic as i looked at america from a more mature viewpoint it became patently clear to me that the united states was not a great melting pot i was particularly impressed with this fact after spending some time in new york new york had always been used as an example of this concept with its teeming millions of many national origins it was in new york that i discovered what was in fact a composite of many different pots of nationality groupings the vision of german and jew living side by side with negro and italian neighbors was for the most part just not true each of these ethnic entities had its own area its own little pot which was not too receptive to members of another immigrant group trespassing on the area they regarded as their own just as my thinking on the melting pot concept had to change as the facts of life were realistically shown to me so too did my estimation of the nesro contribution to america it is true that the ne it is true that the negro did supply much of the labor on which the early economic wealth of the united states was based cotton might not have become king in such a mighty fashion were it not for the forced efforts of the negro it is true that the negro has provided america with its only original and indigenous art form if we exclude that produced by the savages who were here before the first explorers these however are not the true measure of the contribution of the negro to america upon reading lerone bennetts before the mayflower the reader is indeed impressed with the many other areas in which the negro contributed his role in the revolutionary and civil wars was considerable and perhaps even vital certainly it was pervasive and helped to mould america and americans impressive as the contributions already mentioned may be they fall short of what historians will record as the most significant gift given to america by its black sometimes unwanted often mistreated citizens history shows that a civilization remains strong and vigorous as long as there is an energy a movement within it to keep it from becoming complacent selfsatisfied and selfrighteous this energy from within brings about a reevaluation by the citizens reevaluation brings about action action keeps the society alive alert and viable  american society is organized on certain wellknown democratic precepts inscribed in the constitution the bill of rights and the declaration of independence if we allow these concepts to become invalid or weakened we are setting the stage for the dissolution of our society as set forth by these documents we are preparing the prologue for tyranny by a few and an abuse of power and authority by the demogogues who will inevitably follow the desertion of these concepts as a guide for the conduct of american policies it is at this point that the american negro vaults into prominence and is in a position to make his most important contribution to his country it is now up to the negro to see that these principles are kept alive and in force it is his supreme duty to himself and to america to press forward his peaceful democratic struggle for complete and absolute application of these principles recently in talking with a young man from finland i mentioned that i was very impressed with the concern so many overseas visitors displayed over the civil_rights issue he smiled and explained to me that it is true many such visitors are concerned genuinely over the plight of the negro but there are other considerations involved as well in the present international struggle between east and west america is pictured as the bastion of liberty liberality and democracy under the intense pressure of to days political affairs there is only one alternative to democracy and that is dictatorship if the united states fails to uphold the democratic way of life in its full sense then she invites dictatorship not only for herself but for the other nations who look to her for inspiration and guidance for their infant or tottering democracies the finnish visitor further pointed out that in effect this has happened in the united states already in the south where democratic principles have been suspended we already have dictatorial conduct in certain areas the country has been able to survive as a democracy despite this because democratic principles have prevailed elsewhere in varying degrees but if america fails in upholding the law with regard to her black citizens just because they are black then she opens the door for intemperates and bigots to take over if she refuses to honor the law impartially immediately and impassionately america effects a mandate for such people to move from the back door to the parlor this would allow the american society to be irretrievably undermined so that other political concepts would be free to dominate domestic and international policies this axiom has been proven very dramatically in both national and international politics haile selassie came before the league of nations in the s to ask that something be done to halt italianaggression against the law and the sovereignty of ethiopia the league of nations did nothing to correct this blatant breach of international law the emperor of ethiopia predicted at the time that the suspension of the rule of law with regard to his small and seemingly insignificant country would be the prelude toand encouragement offurther such suspensions and that those who chose to do nothing would themselves be affected someday it did not take long for his prophecy to come true five years later the entire world was involved in a war that had its roots in the overrunning of smaller nations by larger nations eventually the great powers found themselves facing a menace they had cowardly helped to create during the last year men have been killed buildings bombed children slaughtered and maimed and none of the responsible people have been effectively prosecuted none of the guilty parties have had to pay anything but token retribution for their crimes is it any wonder that a somewhat crazed fanatic seeing others so far above the law seeing the working of the law suspended in civil right issues should feel free to assassinate the president of the united states after all were not the chief justice of the supreme court and the united states representatives to the united nations spat upon and violated in that same city were not the offenders involved allowed to remain beyond the reach of the law and unpunished regardless of what his own personal motives were for killing the president is it not reasonable to assume that such a warped mind might reason that there was justification in shooting what was to some the symbol of liberal thinking internationalism and civil_rights without having to pay the consequences the chief justice of the supreme court recently said that if the bill of rights were now before the congress it would not pass this is not a very encouraging prospect twenty years ago if someone had made that statement in seriousness he would have been ushered off for psychiatric observation twenty years ago the bill of rights was taken for granted by the lawmakersbut not today why one reason is that the negro civil_rights movement has made all americans stop and think long and deep about the basic democratic tenets of their country further negroes have given these tenets a broader definition and meaning what used to be read as applying to white americans the negro is now insisting be read for all americans negroes are insisting on the literal meaning of the words contained in the countrys most hallowed documents in the course of bringing the civil_rights issue before the tribunals before the nation before the world negroes have dramatically put america on trial before  the world they have forced the government of the united states officially to acknowledge their struggle and the principles behind it in addition negroes have forced whites to stand up and be counted with regard to the basic philosophy of democracy they have forced fellow negroes to carry out their democratic duty and obligations in almost every case this has been done with remarkable dignity and restraint this is even more impressive when viewed in the light of the pressures from extremists on both sides who would have it done less peacefully and less lawfully in sounding the cry for equal rights under the law the negro has made americans go deep into themselves regarding their belief in democracy and their feelings about it democracy is being evaluated on a scale and scope unknown before to mankind men everywhere are being called upon in effect to practice a philosophy they have professed to embrace intellectually it is now no longer possible to hide behind the old adage dont do as i do do as i say men everywhere are no longer able to be merely intellectual liberals they must be practical liberals as well and manifest their beliefs in actions the very foundations of american society are being challenged if america successfully meets the challenge then democracy will reach a height of perfection never before known to man it is my conviction that the negro will continue to fight for his cause i also feel that he will meet with continued resistance of the most violent and also of the most subtle varieties but the cause has irrevocably been put into motion a final and permanent solution will have to merge if the negro and america are successful in the civil_rights issue then historians will say that negroes in their struggle made the united states into the greatest practicing democracy of all time if the efforts for equality fail then the constitution the bill of rights and the declaration of independence will merely stand as historic evidence of the gross and tragic hypocrisy either way the negro will have contributed crucially to americas achievement of ultimate greatness to her moral demise
general butlers fugitive slave war
in may of  when brigadier general benjamin f butler of the massachusetts volunteer militia was promoted to the rank of major general u s volunteers and placed in command of the troops at fortress monroe on old point comfort virginia the authorities in washington had not decided what to do about the fugitive slaves who sought refuge with the unions armed forces thus he was left like other army and navy officers in the field or on blockade duty to behave himself as he thought best in this matter at this time the war was emphatically not being waged for the purpose of abolishing slavery and many union officers flatly refused to allow any negroes at all to come within their lines or on board their ships while others permitted southerners who claimed they owned slaves or called themselves agents for slaveholders to search for and seize alleged fugitives some officers even accepted color alone as prima facie evidence of bondage with the result that at least a few free negroes were delivered to claimants under a process more summary than anything provided by the fugitive slave law of  a day or two after butler reached fortress monroe he sent about half of the first vermont regiment commanded by colonel john w phelps on a reconnaissance toward the village of hampton virginia near the place where in  a dutch brig landed the twenty negars as john rolph of jamestown called them who were the first slaves in the british colonies in north america for some reason the negroes in the vicinity of hampton gained an impression that fugitive slaves were apt to be well received at fortress monroe perhaps the fact that phelps was an oldtime abolitionist accounts for the feeling of the colored populace in the vicinity in any case three negroes decided  to test the matter taking advantage of the confusion caused by the vermont troops invasion they escaped and made their way to fortress monroe interrogated separately by butler during the morning of may   the three fugitives all told the same story they were slaves owned by colonel c k mallory of the th virginia militia and their master intended to send them to florida where they were to be employed in the construction of some coastal fortifications butler decided to confiscate them because as he put it in his autobiography property of whatever nature used or capable of being used for warlike purposes and especially when being so used may be captured and held either on sea or on shore as property contraband of war early the following day butler was informed that a confederate officer bearing a flag of truce desired an interview with him the confederate believed as he wrote to butler some  years later that he carried the first flag of truce used in the civil war when buder and the confederate officer met the latter identified himself as major john b carey of the virginia militia in civilian life the principal of an academy in hampton and remarked that he and the general had last seen each other as fellow delegates to the charleston and baltimore democratic party conventions of  at the first of which butler had voted  times for the nomination of senator jefferson davis of mississippi as the partys presidential candidate carey first asked and butler sidestepped several questions about the principles upon which the general expected to conduct the war in the neighborhood of hampton then never dreaming of anything but ready acquiescence carey requested the return of mallorys three slaves on being told that they had been seized as contraband of war carey spoke feelingly of the fugitive slave law and of butlers obligations under the federal constitution butler replied that the fugitive slave law enacted by the united states congress could not be invoked by a foreign state which virginia claimed to be and that she must consider it among the infelicities of her position if to some extent he took her at her word mallorys three slaves said that if they were not sent back others would understand that they were among friends and more would come the next day actually two days passed before eight more male negroes reached fortress monroe they were followed  hours later by a group of fortyseven persons of both sex and of all ages from three months to  years thereafter negroes flocked to the freedom fort in such numbers that butler soon found that at current prices he had  worth of slaves on his hands at this point he wrote to his superiors in washington asking for definite instructions by which to guide himself in future having been a lawyer in civilian life he was fully satisfied that he could legally confiscate ablebodied slaves and since they were of great value in the enemys hands it seemed to him to be the part of wisdom to deprive their masters of their services therefore he said that he intended to employ such persons as he could use he already had the men working as laborers or as officers servants the women as laundresses seamstresses etc and to issue proper food for the support of all    charging against their services the expense of care and sustenance for the nonlaborers keeping a strict account  of the services as well as of the expenditures having the worth of the services and the cost of expenditures determined by a board of survey hereafter to be detailed but he asked as a political question and a question of humanity can  receive the services of a father and mother and not take the children after president lincoln and the cabinet had carefully considered butlers letter the secretary of war carefully answered it without really answering any of the questions it contained butler was told that his actions to date were approved he was directed neither to interfere with slavery nor to return fugitive slaves to their alleged masters he was instructed to continue to employ escaped slaves in the services for which they were best suited keeping account of the value of their services and the cost of their maintenance and he was informed that the matter of their final disposition would be reserved for future determination the publication of butlers letter and the secretarys reply led to a widespread discussion of what general winfield scott laughingly called general butlers fugitive slave law and to the immediate adoption of the term contraband as a synonym for an escaped slave most northerners agreed with butler that southerners could not logically argue against his acceptance of their oftenrepeated claim that slaves were property just like any other kind of cattle and approved heartily of his action edward l pierce an abolitionist who found butlers conduct praiseworthy wrote in the atlantic monthly november  there is often great virtue in such technical phrases as contraband of war in shaping public opinion they commend practical action to a class of minds  which would be repelled by formulas of a broader and nobler import the venerable gentleman who wears gold spectacles and reads a conservative daily prefers confiscation to emancipation he is reluctant to have slaves declared contraband his whole nature rising in indignation  when henry ward beecher preaches in a sermon that a thing ought to be done because it is a duty  he yields gracefully when butler issues an order commanding it to be done because it is a military necessity butlers technical phrase also commended a course of practical action to a number of men in positions to make their influence felt who were not repelled by broad formulas in august of  less than six weeks after the thirtyseventh congress convened in special session its republican members mustered the votes necessary to secure the passage in both houses of a measure which legalized the confiscation of slaves employed in or upon any fort navyyard dock armory ship entrenchment or in any military service whatsoever against the government and lawful authority of the united states a year later during its first regular session the same congress passed another act the sixth section of which provided that within  days after a proclamation to be issued by the president the property of all persons in armed rebellion against the united states should be liable to seizure and that any or all slaves of such persons escaping    and taking refuge within the lines of the army all slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them and coming under the control of the government of the united states and allslaves of such persons found on or being within any place    occupied by the forces of the united states shall be deemed captives of war and shall be forever free of their servitude and not again held as slaves in accordance with this law president lincoln issued a proclamation dated july   warning all persons within the contemplation of the law to return to their proper allegiance to the united states on pain of the forfeitures and seizures provided by its sixth section although it has been largely disregarded by historians the truth is that to quote from carlos martyns biography of wendell phillips butler had practically freed thousands of slaves before lincoln even dreamed of emancipation and that congressional action based upon butlers contraband theory freed thousands more before the emancipation proclamation was issued
civil war hero
one of the boldest deeds of the civil war and one that required a u great deal of nerve and a  a  good judgment for its e execution was performed by robert smalls a pilot of the confedero ate steamer planter in charleston south carolina harbor in  smalls was born in beaufort south carolina the son of robert and lydia smalls and a slave of the mckee family he was kindly treated by his master and allowed to acquire a limited education in  smalls moved with his master to charleston and became successively a hotel waiter a hack driver and a rigger in  he married his first wife hannah who died in  in  the confederate authorities pressed him into service and made him a member of the crew of the planter a dispatch and transportation steamer doing service in charleston harbor when fort sumter was attacked he and his family saw with sorrow the lowering of the american flag the high pressure widewheel steamer the planter was a light draught vessel drawing only five feet when heavily laden and was very useful to the confederacy in playing around the harbor and among the islands near charleston her officers were white however the crew was black consisting of the smalls brothers robert and john a gradine an assistant engineer william morrison a sailor and a few others for general work on monday evening may   the planter was lying at her wharf her officers were ashore and smalls had been given instructions to see that everything was in readiness for a cruise the following day they were carrying a valuable cargo however smalls had other plans for the cargo smalls did not betray his thoughts by his behavior and when the officers left the vessel he appeared to be his usual respectful attentive efficient and obedient self after eight oclock the wives and children of robert and john smalls came on board as they had sometimes visited the vessel nothing was thought of this circumstance by the wharf guard sometime later a colored man from the steamer etowah joined the crew smalls had been contemplating this move for some time he had heard that colored men were being enlisted in the united states service at beaufort and that general hunter was foreshadowing the freeing of the slaves giving kindly treatment to all contraband refugees he had seen from the pilothouse the blockading vessels and had thought of a plan to turn over the planter with her valuable cargo to the union forces the brave men knew that their fate would be death in event of failure and they decided that they would not be captured alive but go down with the ship if the offshore batteries discovered them they also decided to use the steamers guns to repel pursuit and attack if necessary after midnight the fires were raised and pressure made ready and early in the morning robert smalls gave orders to cast off to guard against a suspicion of anything being amiss he backed slowly from the wharf blew the signal whistles and seemed in no great hurry to get away smalls proceeded down the harbor as if headed toward fort sumter and about four oclock the boat passed the frowning fortress saluting it with loud signals and then the steam pressure was increased her appearance was duly reported but as her plying around the harbor was most commonplace she was not molested and the heavy guns that easily could have sunk her remained silent passing the lower batteries again without danger the happy crew jubilantly rigged a white flag and steered straight toward the union ships they were still in great danger this time from the union guns union forces not knowing of their escape and on the lookout to sink at sight torpedo boats and rebel rams might blow them out of the water before discovering their peaceful flag an eyewitness of the planters arrival a member of the onwards crew and a war correspondent gave a good account of the landing just as no  port gun was being elevated someone cried out i see something that looks like a white flag and truly enough there was something flying on the steamer that would have been white by application of soap and water as she neared us we looked in vain for the face of a white man when they discovered that we would not fire on them there was a rush of contrabands out on her deck some dancing some singing whistling jumping and others stood looking toward fort sumter and muttering all sorts of maledictions against it and de heart of the souf generally as the steamer came near and under the stern of the onward one of the colored men stepped forward and taking off his hat shouted good morning sir and further stated ive brought you some of the old united states guns sir  that were for fort sumter sir and all the others around him set up a yell    and the antics and capers cut could only be done by slaves who by a bold and successful stroke had gained their freedomrunning a steamer out from a large city and passing the battlements of pinckney moultrie and sumter as soon as the steamer came alongside captain nichols of the onward went on board of the planter and was joyously received    the boats flag was hauled up amidst rejoicing congress was not unmindful of the daring and valuable services of robert smalls and his men and a special act was passed providing that half of the value of the captured steamer and its cargo be invested in united states bonds and the interest be paid annually to smalls group or their heirs this daring exploit gave robert smalls national fame he was made a pilot in the united states navy and his knowledge of the charleston harbor and its fortifications was of great service to the federal

during reconstruction was inevitable he was good natured intelligent fluent and selfpossessed his moderate views and kindness toward the family of his former slave master made him to the whites the least objectionable of the freedmen with political aspirations the fact that he was the pet of their liberators led the freedmen to believe that he was the smartest colored man in south carolina his

lets picket our pockets not the schools
i am a negro mother living in an allnegro r community we have  our own mayor schools fire department police department waste collection transportation and businesses there is room for improvement but it is a nice place to live many negroes left here for the march on washington last august the march was called a peaceful demonstration the crowd was tremendousand so was the expense lack of money prevented many from participating it was considered the right thing to do since then riots abound everywhere in some instances murder has occurred our children are fighting rebelling against authority school rooms are empty politicians are using race as a subject to exploit their platforms organizations are picketing other organizations a different type of march is going on among many of our people they are marching for food consider the money that was spent for the march on washington picture just one dollar for each negro in attendance how about a dollar for every negro in america once a month envision schools factories homes and businesses created by negroes to me a boycott of schools prevents education it confuses the young it frightens me my children may be hurt or killed how can people march against injustice and still demonstrate peace forcing a change in laws does not enforce a change in people god gave us a world to live in he left a book of instruction telling us how to live in it peaceful demonstrations begin with ourselves let us picket our pockets and start a riot by providing for our own needs let us not become absorbed into another race instead we can keep our own traditionsteach them to our children with pride we can boycott ignorance there is money for marches for bondsmen for lawyers and leadership the same powerful leadership can serve to guide us toward providing for our own needs let others envy our independence not our militant attitudes
what keeps good workers from working
it isnt enough for one man to be able and eager to work and for another man to want workers gaps in information communication and transportation  some of our police and our charitable practices are right now keeping wouldbe employees from meeting employers in our cities the city of indianapolis is an example since indianapolis is centrally located drawing its income from both industry and agriculture and with jobseekers coming or passing through from all parts of the united states the situation observed during the past year and a half by a group of ministers social workers and retired business people may be of interest to others our observation post was the hall of a small downtown church peoples temple which in the spring of  ran out of funds for the free noon meal it had served every day for two years so the congregation appealed to outsiders for financial help as a basis for moneyraising a statistical survey was made with the persons served being asked name age address health how long in town last steady job how far in school and how they had been getting along racially the percentages of negroes and whites were almost the same as in the general populationbut we noted that most of the negroes were staying with relatives or friends and not travelling about nearly so much as the white men one explanation was that negroes encounter more difficulties on the road harassment by police and discrimination at many missions the theory that negroes take care of their own seemed to be borne out by the way residents of quite nice homes let unemployed men stay rent free as well as instances where the clear downandout literally shared their last crust with a buddy however negro employers and negro police seemed to take care of their own by bearing down pretty hard on themaccording to reports from individuals we got to know rather well later in the course of our survey men standing in line proffered advice why dont you let us use the phone free to call former employers this made senseso an extension phone was put in the hall with volunteers sitting by it three hours each day to prevent long distance calls being charged and thus our employment desk was born by letting the men use the phone by advertising for odd jobs and by the volunteers bringing the help wanted ads each day quite a few jobs were foundmostly temporary but at least  seemed permanent do you need a helping hand asked a flyer that churches of several denominations distributed to their congregations and carpentry painting wallwashing housecleaning yardwork were listed as types of help these hands that could be reached at the peoples temple had to offer but as phone calls came in and as we analyzed the want ads it became apparent that the hands themselves must have help to get to the available jobs they needed appropriate clothing to work at certain jobs such as a clean shirt for a waiter or baker they needed information which sometimes took several phone calls to acquire as to where to sell blood for quick cash where to get chest xrays for a food handlers permit and where to get medical treatment andor convalescent care in order to become employable if hes interested why doesnt he come apply instead of telephoning office girls sometimes snapped when we inquired about job listings but how come out here without carfare if a man walked five or ten milesand many factories restaurants carwash places where at least that far from downtownhow energetic would he be if he landed the job and if he arrived to find the job takenor that his skin was the wrong shadehow able to answer some other ad would he be walking wears out shoes which none of the missions can ac quire in proportion to the need being out in the rain or snow with no facilities for pressing a suit makes it hard to fulfill the must be neat requisite in many ads and walking when a person is hungry and tired wears down resistance so its easy to catch cold or succumb to other of the many germs encountered in missions or cheap roominghouses and yet many persons who work downtown near the park where tired men sometimes sit often complain those lazy bums ought to be jobhunting and police entertain themselves by urging the men to move oneven arresting quite sober and innocous but shabbily dressed sitters for loitering how does a man hunt jobs when hes broke state employment has a department called spot labor where jobs requiring no outstanding skill are sometimes to be had manpower inc gets calls from employers then sublets men to work manpower collecting the wage and paying the man a percentage according to the men manpower can be counted on to pay the agreed upon priceand it advances carfare and lunch money the men also appreciate the bin where you can leave your bundle when youve no place to stay but many men resent working at a job that pays  or more per hour then receiving only  or  the executive whom i talked with at manpower refused to tell me just what percentage of a mans pay they took so i had to depend on the men themselves for the above figures id rather stand on the curb said a union man who can work only at certain times due to acute asthma on the curb i often get jobs paying as much in two days as manpower will pay in a week many of the men find the curb a good place to get jobsbut the police disapprove of this the curb is a stretch of about two  blocks on alabama street just north of the citycounty building and police station where employers and employees have met for at least  years but some passersby are said to have complained about so many men in old clothes loafing along there so break it up or ill call the wagon shout certain cops causing jobseekers to scatter out or move to another block then return later and in the fall of  a gettough policy was instituted whereby  men at one time were thrown into jail for jobhunting at this spot this particular group was released because a minister interceded for them but nobody knows how many others were picked up later peoples temple has a small supply of emergency food to give to distressed families and one such family was brought there by a worker from the court who asked the minister to provide for them while the father is in jail for jobhunting on the corner as a taxpayer i resent having to support men in jail when their sole crime is jobseeking they could be fed and bedded just as well in a missionor for a small sum with friendsand there would not be the stigma of arrest the association with the vicious and the diseased the inability to keep job appointments four times i made appointments for men to work at jobs for which they were well qualified then learned they were arrested the night before for a vague charge of disorderly or loitering or drunkenness he must have done something pretty bad to get five days plus a  fine i said to the judge pro tern whom i went to in behalf of one of these workmen  oh no said the judge hed have had a bigger sentence than that if hed fought or created a disturbance i dont have the record here but he probably fell down on the street or didnt move along as fast as the officer wanted later i appealed to another judge for clemency for another man who had lost two days work by being in jail but who could start earning that afternoon if the judge would release him but look at that long record this judge exclaimed and he sentenced the man to  days plus  fine not because what he had done was so bad he fell down on the street and the cop said he was drunk but five witnesses told me he didnt do a thing and i being called to the scene smelled no liquor on him the sentence was on his past record thats good criminology maintained the regular judge of this court a judge pro tern made the sentence i have studied criminology myself at the university of wisconsin i have worked in a psychiatric clinic and even in a state prison as counsellorthis isnt what i was taught but lest my teachings be out of date i checked with a psychiatrist and with the head of the butler university sociology department but most lawyers get almost no psychology or criminology in their training a lawyer friend told me they dont understand human nature so again i as a taxpayer had to support this man while he served his sentence and laid out his fine then i and a psychiatric social worker and two ministers had to spend days trying to help the man recover from the injustice the discouragement the loss of many of his clothes and of course this makes just one more entry on his record which another judge may hold against him if he is picked up for jobhunting on the corner also while serving his undeserved term at the penal farm he lost the clientele of satisfied employers that his excellent windowwashing floorwaxing and housecleaning had gradually built up women in need of help hired other men who were available if a worker is good why unemployed in our survey and during our subsequent experiments with jobfinding three reasons stood out   some men had newly arrived in town had no references and no leads as to where to hunt jobs they had come because of layoffs in the mines and mills of the east coast or the factories of detroit or because new methods or too many members in the farmers family reduced need for them on the farm  some had held what sounded like fairly good jobsbut the plant moved away or they put in new machinery and laid off  men back in the s there were similar layoffs but then there was hope of being called back when worked picked up today new methods and new machinery are making men obsolete vocational counselling and retraining are needed here  some had left or been firedthen found their age if over  a barrier to getting a new job others had suffered illness or accident forcing them to seek a new type of work a painter who had lost half his foot cant stand on laddersbut he has built up such a following of pleased employers through the peoples temple oddjob desk that he now gets his calls direct where he rents a room a roofer had made good money and enjoyed the prestige of this high callingbut on passing  he found he could no longer stand heights i referred him to a cleanup and maintenance job where he proved the workin est guy i ever saw according to the employer but frustration loneliness in this stfange town and the physical and financial comedown he had taken bothered him so that he got drunk every payday then was a day late reporting for work an intensive study of this mans needs was neededbut we knew of no clinic where he could be served two men had had surgery which did not interfere with their particular skills of metal working but which did prejudice insurance doctors ive even offered to work free awhile just to prove i can work better and work cheaper than anybody else but they wont try me said the onelegged man so when last heard from he was on relief
what to do from our brief and amateurish experience we see a need for information facilities information as to where certain types of labor are neededeven when apples beans tomatoes will be ready to be picked the state employment office suggests that sometimes the man with the skill and the man with the job register at different employment agencies  it would be more efficient if all cleared at a central place information as to what equipment or training a man must have should be available so a man need not waste a long tripand there should be facilities for supplying carfare small loans for lunch suitable clothing even though this will result in some losses because not all unemployed are saintsthere is need for better communication a free phone for answering want ads or calling past employers proved practical but a messagereceiving service should be set up the only service we discovered is that offered by a negro bartender mr ben ross of the panama tavern in indianapolis hotels and restaurants call him when they need extra waiters he locates men he knows and if necessary advances carfare or money to get a shirt washed it reflects ? oddly on americas puritan past though that only a tavern should offer such service in fact many men said the only places a tired man can rest or warm himself is a tavernthen he is apt to get arrested if he accepts an offered drink communication should include help in dialing and in talking with potential employers we found many men who asked us to dial for them but when we did this then passed them the receiver they failed to get necessary data about where to apply when whom to ask for and what bus to take also many unsold themselves i am glad to say two community centers flanner house and fletcher place now plan job clinics where the technics of effective applying for jobs how to take aptitude tests and merit examinations will be discussed we need an uptodate philosophy about unemployment the nowork noeat ruling of john smith shouldnt apply when there is no work to be had all the missions in indianapolis practice a threenights a month or even a threenights in  days limit to the time a man can remain free this is partly to give newcomers a chance since there arent enough beds available to meet the need but it is partly a holdover from the idea that men need a shove to go out and find work but as professor alan keithlucas of the university of north carolina says in his book the church and social work a man cannot be vigorous if we underfeed him nor secure in his independence if we keep him insecure constant moving not only keeps men upset and nervous they lose clothes and job opportunities from having no place to get calls the saddest part of the unemployment picture though is the loneliness the feeling of being outside looking innot really part of the human race on learning that one unemployed mans family had a food grant of  for four persons for a week i called the municipal dog pound to see how this compared with their perdogperday food budget it was less but you see explained the pound superintendent if we let these dogs get all rundown and starved looking their owners would raise a fuss the biggest need of the unemployed in most of our cities is for somebody to raise a fuss in their behalf
the black troika
the  triad of negro organizations prominent in our racial struggle might be likened to an unbalanced troika bearing the hopes the aspirations and the destiny of the entire race a timeworn troika pulled by three blind horses each unswervingly sure in his own mind of his ability to bear the load and equally as sure of the rate of speed the rhythm of action most suitable for the long run ahead discord holds the guiding reins this is not to say that the horses have not each performed his duty on the contrary and despite their unrhythmic gallop each has labored gallantly in pursuit of the general goal but as should have been foreseen the path has narrowed now and a trio of units is no longer feasible having very efficiently covered the wide path of civil and social rights and equal opportunity in the economy it is time now that the cumbersome troika gave way to a single horseman nor should the horseman be a passivist a moderate or an extremist but a combination of the three he should be passive to the extent of unashamedly admitting our peoples many shortcomings moderate to the extent of exacting the very best from our people and raceminded to the extent of inculcating in even the younger of our people that we are determined to bridge the intellectual and economic gap which separates us and our white countrymen he should in the final analysis be a realist for the ensuing run is down a long and narrow path bordered on either side by distortions of lifes deeper meanings we are of a different race than our countrymen and no demonstrations no protestations no legislations can alter this basic difference until our race recognizes itself as being such and discards the foolish concept that because it is a living breathing indispensable segment of the american scene it must be indelibly identified in every social activity with its white  counterpart    until then our every undertaking will end in confusion and neurosis will become a way of life though it might very well be a subconscious motivation this issue of an independent or a dependent identity has ever been an obstacle to the negros progress as it is now a cleavage in our aspirations competition is the foundation upon which this nation was built if then the passive demonstrators the militant organizations the inflexible black muslims and the angry young elocutionists have been instrumental in securing the guarantee of equal opportunities in the fields of education and employment let us bend ourselves to the task of preparing our people so that they might compete against whites with some hope of success it would appear that the gist of every utterance every outward action every printed phrase accredited to our articulate leaders deals with the white mans indebtedness to the negro better would it be if we were to cease heaping anguish upon our race by lamenting over what the white man owes us and lessen the races present frustrations by preparing our people to liquidate the debt we owe ourselves indeed the white man does owe the negro something but what does he owe him the privilege of sleeping in a whiteowned hotel and enjoying its cafeteria facilities and bath the freedom to isolate himself from his own race by purchasing a home in an allwhite neighborhood the consolation of interracial intimacies without fear of reprisals what meagre compensations and what does the negro possess after he has collected these overdue debts yes we passivists may cry that the white man owes us something we moderates may negotiate for insignificant concessions and we black muslims may worship at the shrine of a divided nation but the greatest debtthe ability to perceive and the soul to admit that our final hopes lies in a competitive coexistence with the white racewe owe to ourselves we recoil from preparing ourselves for the job ahead saying the preparation itself is a tremendous job good let our dedication be supertremendous and how do we go about performing this feat by uniting ourselves and our efforts toward one general end a life of competitive interdependence with the white race by daring by looking beyond the day the next week month and year we must sow now a harvest we should not expect to reap before the next decade though the right to do so certainly should be ours it is not necessary that we squander our earnings on the white races gaudy enticements nor is it necessary that we pretend an intimacy of association which doesnt exist we must not attempt to evade the very real fact that the negro american and the white american if engaged in fair and earnest competition would change the face of this nations social structure faster and with less mental anguish than could any number of demonstrations legislation or protestations as little as it is generally realized the majority of negroes are spoiling for a fight admittedly the odds have been and are still against them but with expectations of more opportunities and greater heights being made accessible to them they need only a strong hand on the reins to direct their progress do we have in our race such a man the future social progress of our race demands one
americas first negro poet
the  names of many re nowned poets are wovj  en into the past of this  great country such  names as longfellow emerson whittier riley and dickinson are easily brought to mind the work of these writers retains a certain popularity today and they continue to be widely read that these writers were preceded by others is logical thinking yet very few readers are aware that one of americas first published poets was a negro our nations cultural foundation was aided and enhanced through the efforts of this remarkable man and it is well that out of the archives of the past new light has fallen on his identity for many years controversy raged on this subject as the distinction was thought to belong to phillis wheatley a young negro slave of boston massachusetts historians in recent years have acknowledged another aspirant to the title namely jupiter hammon research has proven that mr hammon wrote and published several prose articles and had at least one poem published before phillis wheatley arrived in america thus his status as americas first negro poet is duly established what do we know of the early history of this illustrious man unfortunately our knowledge is extremely limited yet there are some basic facts which have been preserved for us evidence gives  as the year of jupiter hammons birth though nothing is known of his birthplace it may have been africa the west indies or remote possibility america history tells us that he and his mother were purchased as slaves by henry lloyd a wealthy settler of lloyds neck long island a community now more familiarly known as oyster bay obviously jupiter hammon was a young child at the time of this transaction after the death of henry lloyd jupiter was inherited by mr lloyds son joseph later he came into the possession of john lloyd jr joseph lloyds grandson where he remained to the end of his days early mention is made of jupiter hammon in the records of henry lloyd mr lloyd wrote to a physician asking required treatment of one slave jupiter by name about ten years of age who apparently had developed a rheumatic disorder from this and the written word of hammon himself we learn that he was most kindly treated and accorded unusual privileges by his successive masters there can be little doubt the noble character of this family had considerable influence on jupiter hammon as he grew to manhood even in youth he appeared to have great authority over his people and they often called on him for advice it is also apparent that mr hammons talent was recognized at an early age considered a valuable and trustworthy servant the lloyd family took a deep interest in fostering his literary efforts their encouragement was rewarded when his first commendable verse an evening thought was published in  the original copy of this verse is in the collection of the new york historical society this poem conforming with all of mr hammons work is of a highly religious nature following the british armies occupation of long island jupiter hammon together with the lloyd family was forced to flee across long island sound where they took refuge in hartford connecticut however the majestic spirit of this man remained undaunted by circumstances in hartford he was warmly received by his own people and many of the white race early in  hudson  goodwin publishers of hartford brought out mr hammons work of poetry and prose a winter piece which was followed by an essay on the ten virgins the original of this manuscript is in the possession of the connecticut historical society shortly after this publication jupiter returned to long island with the lloyd family where he continued to write and give counsel historians readily concede that jupiter hammon was a guiding force as a preacher and leader among his people he was highly esteemed and his exhortations bore fruit as evidenced by the reception given his prose work an address to the negroes which reached three editions the influence of this treatise traveled far beyond its initial environment as daniel humphreys of philadelphia issued the third edition in  presumably after the death of mr hammon filled with religious zeal strong in the faith of the lord spiritual convictions poured from his eager pen no attempt was made to alter the directness in approach or content of his work however some minor errors in spelling stood in need of correction by his publishers it is with unfeigned regret we learn that much of this work has been lost although little is known of the man in life far less is known of him in death historical records have placed the date somewhere between  and  during this period it was customary to set aside a corner of the fields owned by the gentry as a burial place for faithful slaves in some obscure location possibly on the grounds still retained by descendants of the lloyd family lies the final resting place of jupiter hammon surely this valiant crusader is justly deserving of the approbation long overdue americas first negro poet

i nothing ike macklin felt this he felt as if the only thing left for him now was the comfort and rest of death he felt as if he were stepping into another world a black suffocating world that closed in on him as soon as he clambered from the back of that pickup truck that brought him from his job his natural scowl deepened as he turned from the corner and the paved avenue and started the trudge down the sandy rutted street to his home he veered from his path to avoid stepping on a something which lay sprawled in drunken somnolence halfin halfout of an alley its dirty ragged garments its very pores reeking with sweat filth and whiskey he moved down past the waisthigh weeds past rubys the moonshiners past the sounds and smells of people who had hit bottom or had been born on bottom and were now wallowing and rottening in the excrements of their own helplessness and humiliation in spite of the cutting wind he carried a frayed leather jacket loosely in the crook of a heavily muscled arm that did a peculiar jerk every time he swung it in its tight downandup arc by the time he came to the twin sycamores the only trees on the blockwhich masked the front of his frame house the same old humiliation and anger began stirring through his very soul hed had no drinks  but he suddenly felt very drunk and mad as he stood in front of the house that seemed to lean to one side the soft gray sand cuddled around his thick heavy brogans from the one street light at the far end of the block he could see the trash now scattered and copious over the deeply rutted road that was scarcely wider than a path all of the houses seemed to lean on each other for support as if the very strength had gone from them in their old age they all looked alike all alike down to the last sagging porch and tarred roof all hideous headstones in a giant races graveyard he turned to the one that was his and stumbled up onto the warped porch and for this he paid twelve dollars a week he kicked savagely at the rockerless rocking chair sent it crashing across the porch slamming into the bannister which held various cans filled with the dry sand and miraculously growing flowers he swayed momentarily before the door his stocky body bracing itself and stared hard at the graying wood which had already assumed the lost helpless color of everything in the neighborhood he burst into the tworoom house and saw his wife sitting before the open hearth her hands dangling between her legs a cigaret hanging loosely between two fingers the lights were off and the red glare made the brown of her face glow hell whatcha doin setting here  in the dark he growled defensively falling into the pattern of every day of his life the arguments senseless unprovoked providing some outlet of emotion for a shamed man she turned stood up a tall thin woman and the sight of her hurt him her breasts had lost their resiliency and now sagged flatly against her ribs her body once firm suppliant the body of a woman was now hard and angular like a mans god this is the same woman i married almost fourteen years ago shes almost dead he thought she stepped to him and dutifully kissed him on his cheek her lips were warm and ike grabbed her and held her tightly against him a sudden shock wave of humiliation shaking him delia macklin melted to the unexpected surge and wiped away the tear she felt against her cheek it was not hers she stared at her husband when he finally jerked away his back to her broad and straight ike ike what is it she reached for him almost touching him but her hand stopped inches from his back and she stood still a thin sweater draped over her shoulders looking at him she didnt press him she knew it wouldnt do any good she didnt ask him again she just waited goddam he cursed savagely flinging his jacket onto the bed that commanded half the space in the room he stood in front of the fire his hands shoved into the pockets of his khaki trousers how old are you dee you know how old i is she snapped then almost as an afterthought she added quietly thirtytwo we been married most foahteen years right she nodded to his back what we got in foahteen years dee what we got he turned to her his face his hands every muscle asking the question why we got artie and this this here she stopped her hand poised in midair ill tell you what we got nothing not a damn thing dee there aint a thing in this house thats ourn not a thing but the boy this houseit aint nothing i worked today like i been working every day for forty dollars a week an i help mr foss build them houses real houses dee with real paint not calsimine paint that smells and sticks to you if you touch it an tiled bathrooms with hot and cold water an lectric stoves an air conditioning with the yard set out for grass to grow an a walkway an an a driveway    delia    the name came out slowly drawnout sounding like a cry from a tortured spirit im so sicka this im sicka buildin white folks houses an then comin home to this he sagged back until the edge of the bed hit his thighs and he sat down he fumbled for a cigaret his black face twisted with a pain he could not name he took a deep drag and drove the smoke out with a violent ffffftttttt you know how much ruby makes a week baby he asked and saw his wifes body stiffen and her eyes grow cold still standing she said flatly i dont care how much he makes aint no shine coming in this house ike spoke on as if he didnt hear her i seem im pay off the collector last week las friday he paid that man over a thousan dollars just for a weeks supply of shine an he kept over five hundred for hisself five hundred a week dee we cud move outta this bottom and git a house somewheres worth somethin we we aint bringing no shine in no house of mine i aint gonna have my boy coming up with shine stinking up the house i told you that and i mean it ike i dont care if we never have a thing we can still have our self respect i cant eat selfrespect barked ike ike looked at her standing rock hard in the gloom of the fire and he sucked deep on his cigaret and snapped it into the pine flame the boy sleep he asked his voice now calm and quiet delia nodded j f but the boy was not asleep in the darkness of the frame house with the sound of the november wind knifing through the branches of the leafless sycamores artie lay just beneath the lip of the window sill his heart now pounding with excitement as he licked his dry lips and listened to the voices in the other room grow quiet almost to a whisper he wrapped the clean ragged nightshirt around him and listened to the sounds that filtered through to him from the house next door mr rubys house he had heard the same sounds much of his  years the loud garrulous guffaw of a man who told a halfheard joke and then the amazingly clear soft whimpering sounds of the woman the woman who occupied the room not  feet from his across the alley the strange mysterious woman who frightened him with her tobaccostained teeth who was now locked in some contortionist embrace with some man sweating despite the cold grinding in the dark dark now yes but he had seen when that room was not darkened and the shade was not all the way down he had seen the men going through the same actions with the woman in her faded pink underthings sipping the clear harmless looking liquid then going together animallike with blind hungry caresses closed eyes and open mouths and at the age of  he knew every muscle of the woman each curve hollow valley all were familiar to him he could close his eyes and see the heavy pendulant  breasts and he could see the curling pubic hair on her body somehow in some strange way he did not understand she birthed a strange new excitement in him she seemed to awaken some horrible part of him that frightened him the sudden sharp cry of his mother startled him and he jumped guiltily under the blanket and pulled it over his head he heard his mother plead no ike no but it was not like pleading when they were fighting when his father was blind drunk raging it was a different kind of plea the sound of which was completely new to him he heard them moving around now and he listened carefully through the paperthin walls curled tightly in a ball warming himself he heard his mother repeat the no and then it was quiet and soon it was quiet from next door and though he waited for those sounds again it was as it often was during the middle of the week there was no more sound he tucked his head under the blankets and fell asleep  sh artie had waited for friday all week friday was the night that things began to happen when he saw and heard everything immediately after his frugal supper he washed and retired to his room carefully closing the door which couldnt be locked anyway behind him he sat in the darkness next to the open window and listened to the exciting sounds pour across the narrow alleyspace between the two houses he could see in the room now and the woman was seated on the bed her body papersack brown in the harsh light her back to him a housecoat draped over her nakedness the steady driving sounds of a jazz record pushed at him and he could hear the horn talking to him wringing from him an innate pounding a sleeping other life that awoke twisting and rocking to the steady thumping of the steady rhythm he heard it and was not aware he heard it he heard the sounds distantly the sharp crack as of a tree branch snapping in the wind and then a crash of weeds then he saw the man bounding into the alley crouched low hugging the protection of the house and he heard the loud curses and the screams and the man was at his window tossing something big and heavy through the paneless window and running hard down the alley to the planked back fence and he was over it quick shadowlike then came the sharp flat crack of the gunone two three timesand he heard the bullets slap wickedly into the fence and then the other man fat short and white ran past cursing and screaming he drew back from the window the satchel at his feet and he heard the noises of people yelling and screaming in confusion and then his mother ran into the room and kicked the satchel under his bed he stared at her wideeyed but then remembered the dark running form and he knew he had seen that stocky build before he had seen it crouched in that same piston run when they had played football together it was his father then his mother held him held him close as she had not done in many years and her voice was a voice of pain a voice lost a voice he had not heard since that time granny died it was soft almost not a voice at all and it was crooning the old song of despair and suffering and anguish that had no name it was a song they were born singing a song that was sung to them when they died a song they knew all of their lives it had no words it had no special tune but when he heard it he knew it and his mother was singing it to him now as people slowly filled the alley outside and he heard the staccato sentences you see im the cops call the cops who was it lawd lawd that crazy sonofabitch and cold fear hit him for the first time in his life it was worse than hunger even because he had learned how to beat hunger he knew that he could swallow his own spit and cut the knifing pains he could drink water he could go to the city market with the others and steal fruit but this was something new this made him want to scream to cry to run but his mother was there comforting and she rubbed his head and held him  phi later trembling both of them stood on the porch and watched the police car next door milling negroes moved back and forth over the sandy ground crushing the futile attempt of a garden in mr rubys front yard he saw the policeman big and fleshy even in the dark talking to the short fat man who had fired the shots in spite of his sweater he trembled he heard the flat drawl you protect you somebodys got nerve enough to steal from a shiner and im supposed to catch him for you harfff i wisht i knew who it was id plumb near shake his hand the officer turned still laughing and climbed into the patrol car with the other officer and the car moved off the fat man cursed climbed into his shiny cadillac and churned the street as he sped off his mother held him close he wanted to ask her something anything but he saw the fear and anxiety on her face and kept quiet then from around the corner he saw the familiar squat blockhard figure of his father walking casually his arm hitching in that familiar swing of his the leather jacket on the crook of his arm he strolled slowly and artie held his breath as his father came abreast of the scattering crowd walked slowly around it waving to mr ruby who waved back his father came up the steps  put his arms around his wife and they all moved into the house where is it ike asked as soon as the door was closed i aint touched it its still in the boys room under the bed ike but he was gone then he was back a jackknife in his hand look dee he said looking at her i didnt steal from no black man ruby got his he got his befoah he even turned this over to him this aint nothing but the money them white folks been stealin from them poor bastards next door silverpure sweat glistened from his black brow but he had to lick his lips to moisten them when he kneeled on the floor forced the lock and spilled the paper out on the floor art had never seen so much money in all his life he listened as his father counted laboriously it seemed like a long time then ike whistled leven thousand threehundred dollars lord i didnt know it was going to be this much dee theres leven thousand dollars here he stood up wiping his hands on his trousers moved over to delia and held her by the shoulders we ggo buy that house he said but we aint go buy it now and when we do we aint go git it with no cash for the next month or so we aint even got this money we go sit on it we aint go buy nothin then we go move out out someplace where this boy kin go to a good school learn somethin sides how to shoot dice make somethin outten hisself dee this was for him not us we aint old but hes what we got to live for ike held her and artie looked at them both still not understanding his father had stolen stealing was wrong a sin but his mother didnt say anything she just sat there her face immobile placid but her body rigid and ike moved from her knelt down and shoved the bills back into the case he pushed the satchel under the bedarties bed and reached into his pocket and took out a pile of crumpled bills he extracted a single gave her the rest i got to go over i been havin a drink ever friday for three years and i cant change nothin i think i need this drink too cant change nothin she nodded imperceptively as he pulled on his jacket ike kissed her on the head and stepped out the door when he walked outside delia seemed to sag in the chair to artie she seemed a very old woman old and haggard and beaten not so much by time and work and worry but by something even greater something that lay heavy over the entire house and street like some suffocating cloud he moved to her side and as he moved he saw her long brown fingers working nervously on the crumbled bulge of bills feverishly twisting and the tear that started down her face looked like silver ice sliding down a craggy mountain he watched her on his knees watched her cry silently her mouth open looking into the center of the blazing pine fire and not knowing why he began crying too it was not so much that his mother was crying but because he felt that out of the sin and crime of robbery something strange and new and wonderful was going to happen it was because he knew his father and he knew he meant what he said and in spite of everything the lying the stealing and the fearinghe was proud of his father proud of being his son sitting there in the glow of the fire that cracked every now and then sitting there in the glow of a fire on a winter night next to his fathers wife his mother  in three weeks they were moving and delia sat next to the driver of the dray with a tightly tied shoebox in her lap holding it with the same tenacity as a small child holds a coin the old furniture filled the truck and ike stood in the door of the house with artie his thick arm about the boys shoulder looking into the gray bleak emptiness of the frame shack its floors scrubbed white shone from front to back the windowsthe ones still in were gleaming nothingnesses ike hawked deep in his chest and spat violently in the middle of the front room and the thick phlegm lay there quivering seemingly a part of all the filth and humiliation of ikes life and it belonged there ike slammed the door and he and artie climbed into the back of the dray
it was always with v shyness half respect f and half naked fear that barney approached women even now as he stood in the dim hallway at the top of the stairs it was only with the grimmest effort that he could keep himself from squirming a little under the cruel gaze of r cs niece whose daring eyes seemed ready at any moment to laugh rc cleared his throat wanda he said at last tentatively as though baying a small but dangerous animal or should i say miss oneal convinced this was clever rc glanced sideways at his young companion and vinked miss oneal he continued more confidently im certainly surprised to find you at home at such an hour still she said nothing merely continued to stare in a vaguely mocking way from behind the halfopened door can   can we come in rc requested the confidence beginning to break he too was usually struck dumb in the presence of his niece though he hated to show it he was a big graying awkward man who seemed ill at ease in even the most informal situation now he stood clumsily in the doorway his arms hanging down silly she exclaimed in a sudden shrill voice why didnt you say so of course you can come in she stepped aside finally to allow them passage rc ventured forth and grabbing nervously at barneys shoulder led him into the untidy little room it was airless and close scattered about the tiny floor were at least a dozen phonograph records articles of clothing hung immodestly from the bedposts and along the windowsill the spotty walls were cluttered with photographs of male movie stars clipped from magazines the young girl clad in a blouse and a pair of shorts closed the door behind them and returned to the bed where she lay on her back gazing with just the faintest amusement at the two men there was an uncomfortable pause wanda her uncle said uneasily wanda this is our new boarder his name is barnes that is mr barnes mr barnes he said turning to barney this is my niece wanda r c made a vague gesture with his hands then repaired to a far corner of the room where he sat down well how do you do mr barnes his niece said with rather exaggerated enthusiasm and without leaving the bed she extended her hand awkwardly barney leaned forward and felt the warm moisture of her small fingers it was as close to her as he had been all day he had yearned to meet her ever since that morning when their eyes had met briefly on the stairway she clung to his hand longer it seemed than necessary then released it adding im glad somebody finally took that dreadful room theyve been trying for monthsto peddle it off i mean oh dont get me wrong theres nothing wrong with it exactly but youre the first person to    she laughed suddenly shifting her body sensually on the bed she tried to control the gushing sound but succeeded only in making halfstifled little sniggles through her nose after a long vhile she regained her breath dont mind me she managed to add im silly r c from his seat in the corner slapped loudly against his knee shes a mess that girl he said i swear i cant keep up with her no more maybe you try too hard she said quickly maybe he stammered i dont try hard enough maybe you cant she replied tiredly not looking at her uncle r c sat silent ignoring the insult he clasped his big hands together and looked about the room for something else to talk about finding nothing he nervously left his seat and ambled clumsily across the room at the door he turned and said well folks i got things to do you two get acquainted he smiled suddenly and added but dont get caught he winked at them and turned suddenly and left the room an awkward hulk of a man stumbling noisily to another part of the house wanda grinned mischievously at her guest hes a card she said there was another pause but what about you mr er    whatsyourname she almost mimicked the words as if to assure him she really disdained such perfunctory utterances how long you gonna be around i dunno said barney speaking for the first time as long as they can put up with me your family    he grinned nervously as though having said something amusing he wished she wouldnt stare so dont worry about that we get some real nuts around here drunkards all kinds you seem kinda nice though without any transition she leaped abruptly from the bed and with a quick little movement snatched up a record from the pile on the floor you dance mr er     you can call me barney okay you dance barney not very well he replied what are you a preacher or something no what are you then barney hesitated fighting for courage well nothing exactly but i want to be a writer really she exclaimed genuinely surprised what do you want to write about the music had begun to play she had set the volume much too high and the little room nearly shook with the twang of an electric  guitar and something that sounded like a females voice or a childs uttering something about love lots of things he said feeling very foolish like impressions i get sometimes and feelings its hard to describe sort of like    she was no longer listening say she exclaimed in a brand new voice you didnt even tell me what your first name was its herman thats cute mines wanda wanda oneal i guess my uncle told you who knows maybe well get along all right but dont pay any attention to him hes silly realizing he did not in fact intend to dance she returned and sat on the edge of the bed and began snapping her fingers to the music her bare legs also moved slightly in rhythm you look awful young to be living alone she said dont you have any folks im twentytwo he said quickly my folks live very far from here how long you been in washington couple of days got a job yet this is a hell of a place to get a job sissie never found one thats a friend of mine or used to be anyway she finally went back home she paused a moment and seemed to reflect i met her at school she continued you didnt take me for the college type did you well im not i put it down after a semester 
she seemed to study his face carefully then reached inside her blouse and brought out a wrinkled pack of cigarets lighting one it seemed to barney with a kind of studied poise it was a drag she continued to me anyway for others its all right i guess what about you yeah i went for a while its okay i suppose barney reflected a moment plenty of girls he added smiling silly she shrieked youre silly what    what did you say you wrote about well    never mind i can guess girls barney squirmed again trying to reply and she laughed again as suddenly as before for heavens sake relax and say something most boys i know say too much but you    youre kind of different her eyes were staring again barney lowered his head observing his feet he clasped his hands together then unclasped them he bit furiously at his lip and scratched his nose but still she stared anyway she said at length as if deciding something maybe well get along all right that is if you like music she gestured with her hand sweeping over the records that were scattered across the floor and stacked along the wall all these are mine even more  because some are downstairs wait ill get them barney squirmed uncomfortably oh dont bother he said rising from his chair relax she shouted and giggled once more just relax mr    herman barnes ill only be a minute and tonight if you want to well go out you can meet some of the kids i know just as suddenly she bounded from the bed and disappeared through the halfopened door seconds later barney heard the quick dribble of her footsteps on the stairway left alone his mind began to wander he wondered what they were like her friends what did they talk about what did they do that had made her the way she was she wasnt much to look at unless you took away the lipstick and powder and the arched eyebrows that gave her narrow face an unpleasantly quizzical expression if you took away all that she was rather attractive like someone he had imagined once but couldnt remember when or where and how really appealing she was how appealing in spite of the powder and rouge yes appealing indeed and more than once he had felt the urge to take her by the shoulder and brush the falseness away tenderly brush away the falseness and look upon her as she really was but how foolish he must seem how utterly ridiculous and beside the point and how absurdly he had answered when asked about his work it was like a desecration of writing itself like an apology he could perhaps have said more he could have tried to describe to her that private world inside him he could have attempted to put into words for instance the memories of his midwestthat flat open midwest where wheat fields stretched like a yellow ocean on each side of an asphalt highway he could have told her of steel mills that rose dark and sooty amid flaming cities and elevated roadways stretching over chicago where every morning and every night great trucks thundered out of the endless plains and into the skylines of flaming cities but how tiresome it was at other times how hopelessly personal and beside the point not exactly the most amusing conversation piece especially in the company of such a glittering young lady so wanda was her name wanda oneal how old could she be twenty perhaps not perhaps not even twenty she had asked if he were a preacher was he that way did he seem so to her nobody had ever said that before maybe he was sort of stuffy by her standards anyway barney lit a cigaret and began puffing reflectively his mind drifted across the hallway where his clothes and manuscripts were stuffed haphazardly in the two suitcases all those manuscripts all  those hundreds of thousands of words often lately he had regarded them with something like shame did they really say very much the lofty concerns that were a part of his mind seemed rather ridiculous lately and he could not help but wonder how they would fare before the eyes of wanda preacher indeed maybe she would understand though maybe he could communicate them to her they had seemed so terribly important then when their fever first seized him and thus it was mainly that he left home as with his hero thomas wolfe it was a kind of quest a wonderfully intense and gallant quest only now he wasnt sure anymore just what the quest was of and the very idea of a quest seemed somehow provincial somehow square anyway he was having a rollicking time on the road and when the money ran out hed simply have to find himself a job but what about wanda what was she all about behind that raucous fagade what did she read think feel what did she really look for in a man maybe they could sit together in some quiet place maybe then she would reveal herself and speak to him with these thoughts barney let himself sink into the soft armchair and felt the happiness well in his chest and thought to himself with a certain regret how long it had been since hed felt so excited about life wake up she shouted at the doorway catching him by surprise she proceeded to the center of the room where she dumped the huge pile of dusty records on the floor most of these are fortyfives she said all my seventyeights got broken here choose what you like but hurry up because its getting late all the good places close at midnight barney gzed languidly from his chair behind her through the window the little park halfshrouded in the dusk seemed to actually beckon on each side of the broken walkway the grass grew high and weedy in places sprouting up between cracks in the pavement it was a rare place he had been thinking old and tragic with overhanging trees and deep shadows the scene in its dusky brooding sadness caused a sudden lump to form in barneys throat and for a moment he was tempted to reach out and touch her hand instead he merely cleared his throat and said lets just sit here for a while if you dont mind she seemed to study the top of his head just sit she exclaimed incredulously i only sit when im in the bathroom and once more the piercing laughter bounced off the walls youre crazy he said youre cute she said kind of different though she giggled suddenly what did you say you wrote about nothing i mean skip it lets talk about you me she almost shouted the incredulity returned to her eyes now youve really lost your senses theres nothing about me to talk about i dont believe that barney answered gazing a bit too intensely into her faintly laughing eyes i cant believe it youre just pretending i know you are and you    youre just silly she answered you talk so silly she seemed to relax settling her small body more comfortably against the wall and half turning her head to stare at him with such an intensity that barney felt the insides of his stomach turn over and over and the cold sweat trickle from his armpits and run icily down his naked skin who knows she said musingly maybe youre gonna be fun after all a little anyway whatll you be doing till you find a job barney fought for courage the irrelevance of her conversation her bold eyes were succeeding despite his rapture in making him unbearably nervous and unsure look for one i guess he stammered she laughed shrilly dont be crazy i mean when youre not doing that i dunno he answered why we could go around together you and i andyou knowbe friends kind of you could even come in and listen to records if you wanted to if im not here just open the door and walk in barney sighed thankfully won dering if now she would talk what kind of music do you like he asked she reflected seriously oh any kind fast kind mostly the kind i suppose that sends me the farthest how about you all kinds said barney cursing the words silly she shrieked and laughed again a kind of sudden impetuous mindless giggle that stopped as suddenly as it had begun be serious now she continued regaining her breath you couldnt possibly like all kinds you either like jazz or rockandroll or classics or something well jazz he replied letting his eyes scan the shadowy treetops outdoors ghostlike in the darkness and thinking how absurd the very notion of syncopation in such a setting in the midst of such noble sadness and how equally ridiculous the sound of cellos in still a second scene a second hour and how odd it was that the world was so many strange and beautiful things all at once at least youre honest she went on in the shrill inflectionless voice i had a girl friend once who took in the classics you know played them all the time or so youd think like youd be talking to her on the phone and there would be beethoven or one of those clowns in the background very highbrow i wouldnt be a bit surprised if she didnt put him on purposely whenever she called you  up the snob barney tried to laugh but his sadness was too great and after a short pause he awkwardly groped inside his shirt pocket for another cigaret he inhaled deeply letting the smoke pour from his nostrils in jerky little spurts im different she continued lowering her eyes im honest about what  like i listen to all kinds like what for instance asked barney controlling his voice well like    the platters and    fats domino you know good strong negro music even little richard i play him when im feeling wild hes crazy youre crazy answered barney it was the second time he had said so how he cursed himself how he yearned to talk to her but seriously he ventured why do you call beethovens music highbrow because it is she replied irritably anyway how should i know all thats over my head barney studied her sadly her proud mocking eyes slender neck how he wanted to stroke that neck gently instead he continued awkwardly do you read much oh a little for instance there was an uncomfortable pause while she fingered nervously at her bracelet for instance why do you ask so many silly questions she said finally vexedly barney lowered his eyes youre a funny sort she continued i bet you read a lot still he averted his gaze feeling vaguely ashamed and not knowing quite why he continued looking at his feet and the pattern they made spread vlike on the floor his arms long and awkward hung comically between his legs no not so much he replied anyway not nearly as much as i used to i bet you do she pursued tauntingly then laughing suddenly added i bet you read    shakespeare barney blushed no i dont then why do you talk like that like what the way you do she replied reproachfully she sat cruelly studying him her eyes shrewd and calculating squirming under the gaze barney swallowed back what would have been a kind of scream and let his mind flee it was often that he did so in a kind of urgent escape from the menacing present into the realm of theory or that other more private world he was fond of visiting there they were the two of them side by side in the little park and the whisper far away of a fairyhaunted fountain it was a most personal vision one the others could not see following it he had tackled the entire world typewriter in hand like don quixote come back what a quest it was to have been the smell of the spring breeze and the vision of faraway cities and now the quest was ending for there was nothing to be found dumbly almost despairingly he raised his hand and closed it carefully over her small delicate wrist youre crazy she said by way of reply youre the one whos crazy he insisted suddenly emboldened and staring desperately into her eyes you know i believe you really are she removed her hand eyeing him with vague suspicion cant you see it he continued the uselessness of it the crime her gaze relaxed what on earth are you talking about all im asking barney pleaded his voice cracking is that you try    just for a moment to be serious i am trying she said irritably but youre so funny barney sat silent tasting the words he threw the cigarette to the floor squashing it with his foot his chin quivered funny how he said in a way that you like she reflected yeah sort of but first ive got to hear you  recite poetry then laughing very loudly she grabbed his ear and twisted it vigorously lets go she commanded we may be missing something barney remained motionless where are you taking me he asked dont expect much its sort of a dump then why go he said we could stay here or sit in the park boom boom she replied beginning a slow almost imperceptible wiggle of her hips you know bongos dance floor lets go wait barney protested unable anymore to hide his desperation just a little longer please we havent even had a chance to talk silly she shrieked too much talk talk talk talk lets live then still shaking her hips she began snapping her fingers to the silent beat barney watched with horror as her face underwent an almost complete transfiguration the eyes staring dumbly like hideously empty sockets the teeth clenched as in a kind of epileptic seizure after a long while she looked again at him and the laughter returned to her eyes youre so funny she said why dont you learn to dance i cant said barney why not look at me now she was undulating her shoulders and again the terrifying grimace not so bad huh not so bad barney said at the point of tears but you know    id much rather just sit here and watch you thats why i wanted to stay you know so i could go on just watching you  silly she cried out again a vague coquetry lighting her eyes and thats what i wanted to talk about barney continued desperately how i could watch you and never get tired cha cha cha she chanted and how wonderful it would be he went on if we could get to know each other you know like really know each other but in a much different    sexy she chimed cutting him off the shrill voice seeming to grow louder filled the entire room and barney was about to speak again when her perfume seemed to engulf him and she was kissing him passionately on the mouth satisfied now she said pulling herself away with a deliberate almost comical seductivity barney regained his breath the scent of her perfume hung heavily in the air her breasts seemed to swell and part of her hair had come undone her smell was everywhere a moist thick sensual presence that blotted out the entire room the world had lost its music and there was only her her odor her breathing barney lifted his arms and placed them heavily around her narrow waist pressing his fingers roughly into the moist sticky skin satisfied the word echoed teasingly no he said replying to her question i didnt think you would be she whispered drawing herself coyly away
a visit with muhammad
it was a rare fall day in chicago it was  the kind of saturday mornin one wishes he were on the lakefront watching the weekend skippers ready their slim craft for a day of sailing i decided to walk the nine or ten blocks from the university of chicago quadrangle to the bluetrimmed mansion at  woodlawn i did not know any of the students i met along the way old grads like me are always peering hopefully here and there as if they really expected to see someone they used to know some miracle of reincarnation yet even the old professors die off or maybe by progressive moultings they achieve some academic nirvana anyway the new ones who take their places dont look like the ones you used to know but there is consolation in the fact that at least the good grey gothic does not change it is reassuring to know that there underneath the ivy the granite is the same pretentiousness is a word ordinarily associated with mansions if a mansion is not pretentious it may as well be called a house i had walked past the room house on woodlawn before i realized i was even near it somehow it seemed to escape pretentiousness and i had passed it without really seeing it perhaps i was lost in my silent soliloquy on gothic and old grads perhaps it was because there are many mansions on this quiet street their original owners have fled the alwaysthreatening hovering advance guard of the stifled black ghetto had moved in long ago and settled down in decorous serenity north west and south of the great university the ghetto crowds in upon the famous midway where the university coeds sun themselves to sleep while reading aristotle and james joyce i had passed the address i was seeking but even as i did so the awareness of my oversight was signaled into my consciousness it was the blue and white trim on the multigabled old houseso inconsonant with the studied dignity of the neighboring housesthat halted me and sent me retracing my steps to the concrete driveway i had passed without seeing a moment before the number on the gate was  it was the residence of elijah muhammad messenger to the mystical nation of islam in the  wilderness of north america prophet to a confident empire of militant black muslims who may bow toward mecca in prayer but whose every other genuflection is toward chicago the prophets mansion sits rather near the street and entrance is by way of a portico extending out over the narrow driveway there was no sign of life anywhere about the grounds as i mounted the concrete steps and rang the bell presently the heavy door swung inward and a woman in a white uniform confronted me yes i have an appointment with mr muhammad i gave her my card yes she said ag in the interrogative was spent there was no emotional content in her voice whatever the messenger is expecting you i followed the woman into a small foyer and waited for her to tell muhammad that i had come i had been there before once during my early research on the black muslim movement i had had dinner with the prophet and had spent the entire evening listening to his explication of black islam as he had learned it from farad in the s a year or so later in another marathon session i had filled a small notebook with data on the messengers interpretation of history the respective roles proper to black men and white men in social and political relations and the eschatological promise inherent in the manifest destiny of the black nation he hoped to unite under the starandcrescent i remembered that there had been a comparative quality of cogency to these heterodox arguments that never seemed to come through in the addresses i had heard muhammad deliver in the various muslim temples about the country i awaited the prophets appearance with some apprehension the book i had written on the black muslim movement displeased some of his ministers very greatly and they had not been reticent about their displeasure a delegation of the faithful had called on me in atlanta to discuss the book and at least one irate muslim minister expressed the desire to burn them as fast as they came off the press too i had received some uncomplimentary letters one or two of which were thick enough to require my paying extra postage in order to get at the insults inside that some of the faithful would be unhappy about my treatment of the movement and certain of its leaders was not unexpected since the black muslims like most of the religiously devout themselves offer no pretensions about objectivity it would be naive to expect them to be clamorous in their applause over an objective analysis of their doctrines or activities nor was it altogether surprising that some of the protesting letters came from people who said they were not muslims but who because they do not like white people read the book with myopic impairments as i waited in the little foyer i could sense muhammads approach even though the sound of his footsteps was stillborn in the thick grey carpeting suddenly he was in the rooman electric sort of presenceand i was trying to assess the confusion i felt at what seemed an intuitive response to it welcome professor the muslim leader held out a lean brown hand as if to underscore his greeting i offered my hand in return while searching his face for some clue as to whether the reception was perfunctory there was no clue his eyes were steady and his handshake was firm he did not smile but then i could not remember having ever seen muhammad smile if in fact he does smile on occasion that is not the image by which he is remembered i followed the muslim leader into a large dining room where two young muslims were seated facing each other near one end of the table they arose at the approach of the prophet and remained standing until he had taken his seat at the head of the table i knew them both john x muhammads secretary and james x minister of the chicago mosque while they were standing i greeted each of them in turn secretary john assalaam alaikum minister james assalaam alaikum we shook hands and sat down the muslims had been drinking coffee and at a signal from muhammad the woman who had answered the door appeared and placed a cup of the steaming black brew in front of me it is muhammads custom to teach his ministers in a kind of informal briefing session each saturday morning these are not strategy sessions designed to accomplish some immediate tangible goals although such conferences are frequent the messengers saturday morning lectures are inculcatory their end is the progressive displacement of christian ie the white mans values with with a neofaradian interpretation of black islam as i joined the circle the messenger was addressing himself to the natural heritage of the black man and the superficiality of the white mans sense of moral responsibility it is the white man who disturbs the peace of the world he was saying the teachings of the white christian divide the natural unity of peoples they have put asians against asians africans against africans brothers against brothers all over the world throughout their civilized history this is the secret of their power the congenital blindness of the negro in america is demonstrated in his expectation that the white man will ever give him justice the white man is incapable of justice except to his own kind by nature he is incapable by nature he is a devil in trusting him  we close our eyes to knowledge in loving him we ally ourselves with evil the white man is incapable of loving anyone who is not white it is time for us to go for self the white mans rule is ended the future belongs to the black people of the world the future is here if we can wake our people who have been duped by the white mans promises to set them free and make them equal i tried momentarily to bare my reason to this potent hypodermic to see if i could get the lift i have seen transport thousands in the muslim mosques in the black ghettos of america across the damaskcovered tables in an immaculate grey suit and a powderblue bow tie secretary john x was writing i could not see his eyes for he did not look up but i knew that he had missed no word uttered by his master i had been told that john had a college degree and i thought how incongruous seemed his role of amanuensis to the semiliterate messenger of allah john x the black baruch i said to myself and at that very moment as if he too were thinking of another prophet and another scribe  years before muhammad was pronouncing doom for all the enemies of black islam jeremiah to proclaimbaruch to write it down elijah muhammad  secretary john and now his remarks were addressed to me you intellectual people should pay good attention the white man wants to call you by your slave name now those who refuse to give up the mark of the beast must die with the beast the white devils want to set you against your own people but they will murder you if you forget that you are black give up the white mans name learn to love your own people i shuddered a little i had always thought my own name euphonius suppose i gave myself a private challenge following the black muslim custom of discarding european surnamesbadges of slavery the muslims call themi had to be known as eric x the rest of my life and my son would be eric x and my wife and daughter would become mere cross marks on my income tax returns so many xs could be confusing on the same side of the table with myself minister james sat enraptured he was seated nearest muhammad but his whole body was tense as he strained to capture and memorize every word that fell from the prophets lips occasionally he uttered an ejaculation thats right but the fixed smile never left his face his whole posture was one of unrelieved expectancy i thought about the old old lady with the gruff voice who used to sit on the edge of the front pew and talk back to the preacher in the revival meetings when i was a kid in alabama a long time ago raymond sharrieff came in muhammad paused while we exchanged greetings sharrieff is muhammads soninlaw he is also supreme captain of the fruit of islam foi the secret protective arm of the muslim movement sharrieff sat down next to john directly across the table from me the woman brought more coffee and the messenger resumed his teaching    if the average black preacher would study the history of christianity he wouldnt believe in it or teach it to his people the white man will not call you brother there is no brotherhood in his religion the prophet then went on to tell about his experience in the holy city of mecca and in the other islamic lands where he has traveled it is a beautiful and touching thing to get among your own people and see the love that exists the white man cannot love you by nature he cannot love you but you must love each other and protect your own kind the white man will take care of himself the chimes sounded and the woman who had brought the coffee went to answer the door a moment later malcolm_x strode into the room every muslim came to his feet to greet the tall minister from new yorks mosque no  muhammad embraced him in muslim fashion kissing him gently on each cheek assalam alaikum wah alaikum salaam assalam alaikum wah alaikum salaameach of the brothers greeted the smiling malcolmbut muhammad would hardly let him go how is the baby the prophet asked referring to malcolms infant daughter who interestingly enough is named attila the hun when did you leave new york there was genuine affection here between these two not unlike the affection between a father and a son who has done well for the family name one could sense that the little drama being acted here was real for the chief actors were for a time completely oblivious of all else who were in the room i had never doubted malcolms absolute loyalty to muhammad but now i made a mental note muhammad has never doubted it either there was a broad grin on his face as he waved malcolm to a seat at the long table it was the first time i had seen muhammad smile the teaching resumed but now two were writing for the ubiquitous malcolm_x would be quoting his master in halfdozen cities within as many days mr muhammad teaches us     we cant make a future for twenty million black people by lying around the employment office we have to go for self    we forget overnight what the white man did to us    mr muhammad was speaking in less than  hours a bomb would explode in a negro church in birmingham alabama where the right of black citizens to enjoy the fruits of democracy was still being contested in blood and invective four little negro girls guilty of no crime worse than trying to worship the god the white man taught them to love and believe in would be murdered by monday morning there would be more black muslims and fewer negro christians in america
who are its members
ace relations in america are relations between ruling elites issues are resolved boundaries are marked off favors are granted and pleas are denied by men of substance and power on both sides of the racial line negroes and whites in america gunnar myrdal observed deal with each other like two foreign countries through the medium of plenipotentiaries what is also true and more to the point is that negroes and whites deal with each other through the medium of competing power structures like two foreign countries like hostile and suspicious strangers negroes and whites negotiate treaties and truces through separate but not quite equal power blocs the white power structure has been endlessly annotated and analyzed but little or no attention has been given to the
negro power structure as a group of selfconcious moulders and shapers of racial policy the importance of the negro power structure can hardly be overemphasized it is in fact a parallel government which fills the vacuum that exists between negro citizens and the state plenipotentiaries of this shadow governmentwhich we shall call the black establishmenthave negotiated with the league of nations and addressed formal notes to the united nations during world war ii the naacpthe offensive arm of the establishmentnegotiated with the government of england and addressed formal letters to sir winston churchill in times of crisisand it has always been a time of crisis for the negro black men ask not what their country can do for them but what the black establishment can do for them the black establishment oddly enough is not allblack it is a group of negroes and whites who command the power lines in the negro community the executive secretaries the board chairmen often white the presidents often white and board members of protest and improvement associations the bishops of negro denominations and the pastors of the largest and most influential churches the two are not necessarily synonymous the editors and publishers of major negro newspapers and periodicals the leading educators business and professional men the key members of this group from the standpoint of racial policy are the executive officers and boards of directors of the protest and improvement associations it helps enormously if a new departure in the negro community is sanctioned by these structures of power on the other hand it is difficult though not impossible to carry new ground if the black establishment says no although the power and influence of the establishment ranges over the whole theater of negro life the focal points are concentrated in five cities washington atlanta and nashville are important as centers of ideas programs and recruits new york and chicago on the other hand are control centers the importance of being a new yorker is dramatized by the board of one protest organization eighteen of the twentythree national board members come from new york city and environs what are the prerequisites for membership in the group money helps but many moneyed men are not members and many members are not moneyed men as in the white world control of a major institutiona protest group a major business or a churchis extremely important for our purposes then an establishment member and we are concerned here only with the national establishment is a person who holds a key office president executive vice president secretary treasurer board chairman or board membership in a major educational business defense or improvement association these men and women are the decision makers in the negro community but there are men who decide for the decision makers elites in other words within the elite a member of the inner core of power holds an independent base of power and membership on the governing boards of one or more key national institutions how does one recognize an establishment man by the boards he acquires here is a power profile of channing heggie tobias one of the least known and most powerful negroes in recent history note particularly the signs of establishment grace membership on governing boards channing h tobias  social worker educator national decision maker student secretary international commission of ymcas  senior secretary for colored work of ymcas of usa  director phelpsstokes fund  member president trumans civil_rights committee  alternate delegate united nations  member governing boards board of directors or board of trustees of following organizations and institutions naacp chairman marshall field foundation jessie smith noyes foundation liberia company hampton institute howard university paine college palmer memorial institute national council of churches of christ in usa commercial state bank and trust company of new york the important thing to note in this power profile is what sociologists call the accumulation of advantages an unnecessarily obscure phrase for the admirably simple biblical rule to them that hath more will be given what this means in terms of national negro power is that influence in one sphere can be transferred to influence in another sphere prominent educators and bishops for example often serve on the boards of directors of major business and protest and defense organizations and powerful businessmen in turn often serve on the boards of trustees of educational and philanthropic organizations contrary to the generally accepted opinion power does not inhere in individuals without access to institutionalized power individuals are powerless in both the negro and white community the popular error  is to confuse prominence or wealth with power these things as we have shown are convertible into power over racial policy but they are j not in themselves instrumentalities of national power some politicians for example hold local power but are not usually members of the national establishment nor are politicians as politicians adam powell jr excepted fertile in raising and disposing of large issues bearing on national racial policy one makes a great leap into an understanding of the establishment if one perceives why adam clayton powell sr was admitted to the establishment while his son adam with greater fame and greater local power was excluded powell the elder sat for many many years on establishment boards the son has not yet occupied a seat in the inner sanctum relevant here are questions of style and temperament as well as availability powell has over the years complained bitterly of establishment snubs and he has discovered repeatedly that establishment games are played by establishment rules what precisely are establishment rules why for example is a richmond physician and a new york city judge more influential in shaping national racial policy than say congressman william l dawson or congressman adam clayton powell jr the core answer is that the physician and the judge are members of the littleknown inner core of establishment power both are among the ten men and one woman who were on the naacp board in  and who were still listed twenty years later in  more importantly both men were members of the executive committee of the board in  the new york judge though little known nationally has ranged over the whole arena of establishment power he was a founder and incorporator of the naacp legal defense and educational fund and he is a former member of the executive committee of the urban league board through the physician and the judge we come to the heart of the matter continuous service in establishment circles board members in every organization come and go the names that turn up year after year are important they indicate centers of power and influence more importantly they point to the hierarchies within the hierarchy the governing boards of establishment organizations change periodically but the surface changes hide a steel core of continuity there is as professor n p tillman jr pointed out in a study of the naacp an inner core of men who hold board seats for years and then dying hand over the torch to another core in a study of the  persons elected to the board through  professor tillman focused on the nuclei of active minorities which dominated the board in the two periods  and  he concluded between  and  the nucleus appears to have consisted of john milholland d  walter sachs  joel spingarn arthur spingarn william e walling john h holmes mary ovington oswald villard and w e b du bois    all but the first carried over into the second period both as board members and general officers thus providing continuity of personnel and policy in the second period they were joined by others predominantly negro  namely louis wright charles toney allan chalmers alfred lewis channing tobias theodore spaulding and perhaps robert weaver meanwhile some of the holdovers died or resigned among whom only du bois was forced out in  for the good of the association  what emerges from all this is the power of establishment boards and the relative weakness of men whatever their local power or influence who do not participate in the informal giveandtake that precedes decision and the formal voting that ratifies it the only exceptions to this are the individuals who can make their weight felt without formal entree into the board rooms before a white administrator was named to head an establishment agency the appointment was cleared by long distance calls to a handful of men across the country but this exception proves the rule the men who received long distance calls were not asked to vote on the appointment the board had already voted they were asked to close ranks behind an establishment fait accompli we return then to the major premise men remote from the board rooms do not vote and men who do not vote in the small groups where one vote makes a difference do not generally count this is not to say that national boards are the final arbiters of racial policy the ruling boards of the establishment are free to decide policy within certain limits prescribed by other institutions within the family of power in the negro world of vast importance in this connection are negro educational institutions negro educators have always exerted tremendous influence on racial policy the nature of this influence was dramatized by the sitins which led to the expulsion of hundreds of students and the firing of scores of teachers the family of power includes not only negro organizations but white organizations racial policy is subtly shaped and diluted by the expectations priorities and fears of liberal labor religious and minority groups from this white liberal nexus the establishment seeks allies and donations the most talented of these allies have definite ideas about the goals and the direction of negro policy and it is not always possible to accept the donations without accepting the donors program among the leading organizations in this shadow cabinet of the shadow cabinet are the uawcio and other liberal unions the americal civil liberties union the american jewish committee and the american jewish congress the race relations departments under various names of the ywca ymca the national council of churches the roman catholic church and the american friends service committee another layer of hidden power on the fringes of the establishment centers in philanthropic organizations and their representatives the rosenwald foundation the american missionary association of the congregationalist church the rockefeller foundation and the harmon fund have played huge roles in shaping and braking negro policy of crucial importance in the context of current power realities are the taconic foundation and the phelpsstokes fund these organizations and their representatives are part of the formal and informal network of power surrounding the core organizations of the establishment some of these groups send white delegates to the establishment some groom specially selected negroes who represent them in the inner councils of power white delegates to the establishment should not be confused with bona fide members of the estabhhment certain positions in the establishment are apparently reserved for white men the naacp the national urban league and the naacp legal defense fund have never had a negro president or a negro treasurer nor for that matter have many other negro institutions of power final control chairman of the board and financial control treasurer and chairman of the financial and investment committees of negro colleges are generally vested in white hands one eastern investment banker for instance is chairman of the board of one negro college president and treasurer of the board of another and a member of the investment and executive committee of a third although this trustee holds enormous power in the negro world his name seldom if ever appears in a negro newspaper analysis of white power in the black world is complicated by primogenital relationships no negro family for example has exerted greater influence on negro policy than the baldwins the rosenwalds or the spingarns william h baldwin the elder was a close and influential advisor of booker t washington his wife ruth standish baldwin was a founder of the national urban league lester granger said she did more than any other person to shape the basic philosophy of the urban league since that time there has always been a baldwin on the urban league board the spingarns have made a great contribution to negro welfare and they have held power positions commensurate with their contributions dr joel e spingarn an erudite professor of english served as treasurer and chairman of the board of the naacp before assuming the presidency which he held from  to his death in  he was succeeded as president by his brother arthur   and as a board member by his widow amy the spingarns are to the naacp what the baldwins are to the urban league in other words there has always been a spingarn on the naacp board in fact for almost fifty years there have been two spingarns of the naacp board arthur spingarn the current naacp president was chairman of the legal committee for more than  years he was also a founder incorporator and first president of the naacp legal defense fund  other white men in black_power in the year of the revolution were allan knight chalmers   professor congregational minister author president of the naacp legal defense fund former

university board of overseers stephen gill spottswood   ame zion bishop washington d c chairman of board of directors of naacp how much influence whites exert on negro policymakers has long been a matter of bitter debate no one doubts however that white influence is important in negro decisionmaking ralph j bunche among others has sharply criticized the role of white men in negro affairs in a  memorandum prepared for the myrdal study bunche said white men exercised a great deal of control over the selection of negro leaders and scholars he went on to criticize the whole philosophy of interracial liberalism white members of interracial organizations he wrote usuall fix the measure of value of the organization deciding not merely the question of how much to ask for but also how to ask and indeed whether the negro should ask at all similar attacks have come from carter woodson w e b du bois e franklin frazier and others all echoed in varying degrees the charge of jessie o thomas who said once that interracial cooperation often ends up with negroes cooing and white people operating bunche in particular was scathing in the  memorandum in his criticism of interracial liberalism too often bunche said in a criticism often repeated in the sixties negro board members receive their cues from white board members in general he concluded concern for the opinion of white supporters and allies is a powerful factor in keeping negro organizations respectable establishment arbiters denied these criticisms in the forties and they deny them today in their support it should be said that some whites in the establishment are more militant than some negroes jack greenberg for example is one of the more militant members of the legal wing other examples could be cited a former national urban league board member who championed a more militant urban league policy at a time when some though not all negro board members were opposed and yet when all this is said the fact remains that most white members of the establishment are moderate whites as a group have served as a brake rather than as an accelerator of the freedom movement it would be a mistake however to blame white liberals and moderates for establishment style the establishment in its present form is an invention of two radically different men booker t washington and w e b du bois and it betrays the tensions of this extraordinary miscegenation between conservatism and militancy in the first decades of the twentieth century booker t washington established an entente between moderate negroes and the better element of whites in this same period du bois established a similar entente between militant negroes and liberal whites after washingtons death these divergent forces met at joel spingarns country home in dutchess county new york and decided in so many words that booker t washington and w e b du bois were both right and that all roads leading to the goal were equally honorable this of course was no decision at all and du bois perceiving this  years later left the establishment with a blast at the ruling group the basic problem in laffaire du bois was not program but style to understand establishment style we must hold to contradictory ideas at the center of our minds the establishment is both militant and conservative its pronouncements in other words are militant but its actions are cautious and conciliatory what distinguishes the negro power structure above all is its reluctance to act this powerful group whose tentacles extend into every area of negro life rarely raises new issues fepc nonviolence sitins mass demonstrations dontbuywhereyoucantwork came from without through the years the dominant voices in the negro power structure have been voices of caution and compromise through the years the manipulators of the structure have been men too timid and too cautious to initiate and direct action the establishments word protest is a mask for inaction the deepest strain in establishment protest is sterile and socially irrelevant endless debate polite petitions the sending of telegrams and letters the whole ritual of mimeograph machines and typewriters all this has been a substitute for hard analysis and risky action the word risk this separates the establishment and its perennial critics the radicals the establishment has never been willing to take serious risks it has never been willing to jeopardize place position and institutions in adventures for freedom as a result there has hovered over all establishment activities a faint smell of gamesmanship of pretense and posturing and evasions of reality it was this i think that led myrdal and bunche to write two of the most mournful sentences in the whole history of leadership analysis  bunche    leadership itself is a form of escape  myrdal the negro hates the negro role in american society and the negro leader who acts out this role in public life becomes the symbol of what the negro hates there are endless stories on the game aspect of establishment leadership the best one i think used to bring down the house on the old vaudeville circuit a negro comedian mimicking a big negro leader would begin the following sentence in a stentorian voice and gradually lower his voice until at the end it was a bare whisper what we colored folks have got to do is to rise up and strike down these here damned white folks since the establishment of the establishment negro leadership has been under constant attack no serious student of the negro ethos has failed to note what drake and cayton called the ritual condemnation of negro leadership day in and day out from barber shop bar and beauty shop the cry arises negro leadershipthe people who run things i e the negro establishmentis no good a great deal of this constant and sometimes petty criticism stems from the social distance between the leadership and the masses students of power say that a people always get the kind of leadership they deserve but the reverse is also true leaders in the long run get the kind of followers they deserve the main bone of contention between the establishment and its critics revolves around the cumbersome wordmasses garvey in the twenties bunche in the forties a philip randolph in the forties e franklin frazier in the fifties and rebellious students in the sixties have contended that the establishment is a conspiracy in contempt of the masses however that may be it is certain that the establishment has never solved what du bois called gingerly the inner problem of contact with their own lower classes bunche went further and said in the forties that the negro elite knows little if any more about the negro in the mass than does the average white man the question at issue however is not knowledge but use the establishment has never organized the masses for social contention down through the years the negro power structure has been more active in accommodating the masses to misery than in organizing them for an attack on the forces responsible for the misery establishment statements point to a deep fear of direct intervention on the part of the masses the fear is not altogether unreasonable and it is not a fear of the establishment alone some of the new organizations trembling on the verge of risky action have shrunk back shuddering from the abyss into which they had just peered behind all the words and all the slogans is a terrible reality millions on millions of men and women with deep fears and resentments and needs fears and resentments and needs it should be noted that cannot be met by the appointment of a negro federal judge or the filing of a court suit no one knows really what will happen if this force is loosed for the lower strata of the negro working class does not belong to any organization not even despite current propaganda the church how bitter are these men and women how far are they willing to go if they are set in motion can they be controlled many men not all of them members of the establishment have asked themselves these questions and have decided in good conscience that they would rather not know the answers the establishment says officially that the negro masses cannot be organized that they are utterly apathetic and demoralized what this means unofficially is that it is impossible to organize the masses around a responsible respectable moderate programaround the establishments program in short in essence the establishments program is a program of agency relation of carefully selected agents acting for the masses in the courts and other theaters of power the central weak ness of this programand establishment men are too brilliant not to know itis that men cannot be freed by agentswhite or black the everrecurring cry of the negro power structure and some of the new organizations have taken it up is deal with us or the radicals will take over this is a curious confession of programmatic and ideological poverty the statement as a statement of leadership tells much about the relationships between the masses and the men who claim to be their leaders over the years negro men of power have built up considerable good will with the white power structure they have access to the state house and the white house and the sources of white money and this access enables them to get small favors for the people they say they are leading radicals surprisingly enough admit the existence of this good will but they contend that power and prestige are capital and like capital must be invested and risked occasionally if it is to bring a proper return at issue here are deep questions of power ethics power works the same way everywhere and men respond to power in the same way everywhere outs for example tend to be radical ins tend to be conservative the same rule applies to organizations experience suggests that reform organizations cannot stand too much success the more a reform organization wins the more money it collects the more staffers it acquires the more conservative it generally becomes establishment in style can best be understood in a comparison with radical out style radicals seek a showdown the establishment seeks an accommodation the establishment says it is necessary to reduce racial tensions radicals say it is necessary to raise them to the highest pitch to create what bayard rustin a leading philosopher of the freedom movement calls creative social confusion radicals denounce white people the establishment appeals to their sense of fair play radicals call for a revolt the establishment calls for a conference radicals appeal to the masses the establishment appeals to the better people radicals march the establishment confers radicals demonstrate the establishment negotiates radicals demand the establishment resolves radicals are radicals in the latin sense of root the establishment is conservativemilitantly so although the establishment resists new ideas it contains many bold and some radicalmen to say that the group is moribund and reactionary is to simplify a complicated process reactionaries have always been members of the establishment but so have progressives atlanta life insurance company for example sponsored many forwardlooking developments in atlanta supreme life financed and carried to the supreme court through earl b dickerson a key restrictive covenant case  prominent members of the inner core have supported none causes and some like dickerson thurgood marshall ralph bunche and w h hastie have made laudable efforts to move the structure in the direction of the dominant social challenge the negro masses men who see a simple blackwhite dichotomy between the establishment and radicals would do well to ponder the actions of emen during world war ii dickerson and hastie resigned important government positions as protests against discrimination radical representatives of labor protested but did not resign other independent establishment men include two powerful editors who continued to print news about paul robeson in the fifties equally independent was an insurance executive who disavowed the ideas of the elder du bois but refused to disavow the manat a time when many radicals were running for cover but here as elsewhere rank has its privileges and here as elsewhere the exceptions prove the rule what matters in the establishment is not the individual but the group as a structure of power as a selfconscious determiner of negro policy the establishment moves slowly views all new ideas and departures with suspicion if not hostility like men of power everywhere establishmentarians are victims of their fears and phobias they would rather see things not happen than to see them happen they are in short hamlets who prefer to bear those ills they have than to fly to others they know not of and yet like hamlet they can be goaded into action one of the most important decisions in the history of american negroes the midforties decision to attack segregation per se in the courts was made by a handful of emen in a manhattan hotel room among the decisionmakers were the late walter white thurgood marshall and w h hastie the decision made by these men and others was later ratified by a larger group that the establishment was able to initiate and carry this radical new departure until then the dominant issue in negro life was separatebutequal facilities despite strong opposition from men in local power structures indicates the power and the potential of the group although members sometimes meet behind closed doors and make large decisions affecting the lives and livelihoods of the negro masses the establishment is not a conspiracy most decisions in fact are unconscious extensions of establishment style decisions that crystallize and take shape without vote or indeed an articulated proposal members of the establishment are by and large men who look out on life from the same vantage point as managers of men andor material and as holders of real estate and stocks and bonds establishment men are moulded by the same forces and respond to events with the same style like their contemporaries in the white world like men of place and power and property everywhere they tend to fear men and issues that rock the boat establishment policy is not entirely a matter of common temperament since the armenia conference of a negro unity conference called by a white man joel spingarnthe negro power structure has been a selfconscious group composed of men of weight who make decisions with other men of weight in mind and more men in the inner circle know each other see each other socially play bridge and poker together and decide affairs of state and money over martinis and scotch when the late president kennedy invited negro leaders to the white house for the emancipation centennial celebration negro guestsfrom north south east and westgreeted each other with the warmth of longlost cousins as indeed many of them were an administrative official dimly recognizing the implications of all this said with consternation and surprice why these people all know each other the establishment is linked not only by formal and informal ties but also by common backgrounds most members of the current establishment are lineal and according to their critics spiritual descendants of house slaves and the free negro elite not a few sprang from the black puritan class which placed a high premium on respectability responsibility and the middleclass values of thrift sobriety and steadiness almost all of them were marked for ill or good by strong men and women who desperately almost fanatically dedicated themselves to proving to themselves and to othersthat they were not negroes a common educational background also links the power structure a significantly large percentage of toplevel leadership has come from ivy league colleges many more however came from a handful of negro colleges which form a subivy league league howard university for example has served as a kind of postgraduate school for harvard postgraduates the number of negro leaders who studied or taught at howard bunche hastie thurgood marshall charles e thompson james nabrit carl murphy is impressive from these men came some of the establishments best thinkingpro and con the successful legal campaign was mapped at howard the pioneer thinking on nonviolence came largely from howard mordecai johnson james farmer howard thurman w s nelson and the thinking for several beyondtheestablishment organizations the national negro congress the negro sanderin was hammered out there atlanta and nashville have been equally important as establishment nurseries the southern branch of the ivy league consists of atlanta university james weldon johnson walter white virginia union eugene kinckle jones lincoln thurgood marshall morehouse martin_luther_king jr james nabrit jr mordecai johnson and fisk w e b du bois j finley wilson charles wesley the black puritan background the tutelage of white puritans in new south missionary schools and new england universities the proving of self and race against the standards of white power the postgraduate training in and around howard fisk morehouse and the leadership factories of chicago new york and washington this was the common womb from which came men imbued with a stern sense of duty responsibility men driven and set apart tragically separated from their white peers who patronized them and the negro masses whom they patronized this background plus du bois ideology of the talented tenth sent forth leaders with a rather aristocratic and not altogether realistic concept of noblesse obligemen who felt they were responsible for the masses and discharged that responsibility at a safe distance there was a mark on the brow of such men by the mark they recognized each other and excluded interlopers in their time and in their place they made important contributions it was not their fault really that they were products of their time and their place it was not their faultor was it reallythat they learned caution with duty that they learned to value order and respectability in the same places that taught them the desirability and the inevitability of social change they were on the whole a remarkable lot though not revolutionaries themselves they tilled the ground and prepared the way for the bitter harvest for many years the elite of family education property and yes color was in part an interlocked directorate composed of several large families tied together by marriage and a larger group who stood in candicacy for powerand marriage there are indications that the establishment is losing some of its caste and color flavor despite ingroup mating and a certain snobbishness based on status and color the establishment has always been open to talent backed by money andor organization and if possible respectability within recent years new members have entered the group by marriage and accomplishment the bumper crop of new doctors and professional men with status and money has also changed the contours of the establishment more important still is the expanding middleclass which makes it difficult to tell without a scoreboard where the establishment ends and the commons begin even more important as a factor in the waning influence of the establishment is the revolt of the masses asa philip randolph opened a pandoras box of mass participation when he called laborers and maids to the barricades in the forties there is considerable evidence that the establishment was scandalized but since the process was unstoppable the establishment wisely joined the movement and pushed it forward the postwar world which called off all bets has shaken the establishment to its foundation having fought off one challenge in the garvey movement of the twenties the establishment found itself face to face with another massbased black nationalist movement the nation of islam in this same period there was a complete revolution in mass communication a revolution that bewildered the establishment and almost isolated it in the void stepped john h johnson an inventive chicagoan who rose to the top ranks of the coalition establishment with a new kind of journalism there were other changes the shifting of the center of gravity from new york to atlanta in the wake of the montgomery boycott and the sitins and the emergence of the negro student as a social force the net result of these changes was a new correlation of forces in which a few ragged students could make decisions and carry them out without the advice and consent of the establishment in faraway new york then in the sixties the establishment was called upon to face a long suppressed issue the growing chasm between it and the masses urban renewal more than any other issue made the negro power structure face the fact that what is good for the negro real estate broker or the negro millionaire is not necessarily good for the negro laborer or the maid on relief a variety of issues in every big city issues revolving around poverty and middleclassness or the lack of it has called into question the good faith if not the good sense of the establishment it would be a mistake to conclude from all this that the establishment is dead far from it with the resiliency that has marked it for more than fifty years the group has grafted the new onto the old new men with new power have been accepted by the curiabut the curia has so far failed to ask itself the ancient questions about new wine and old bottles these questions are pushing the new men of power in quite a different direction a new establishment has sprung up around the core groups of the southern christian leadership conference the student nonviolent   coordinating committee the congress of racial equality and the negro american labor league the new organizations are tapping new sources of negro and white expressiveness radicals pacifists intellectuals rebels nonconformists negro and whiteare finding niches in the new organizations among the persons who have served on the governing boards of the new organizations are harry belafonte sncc ella baker sncc rev c k steele sncc and core advisory committee howard thurman core advisory committee james baldwin core advisory committee and l d reddick slcc historian interestingly though the new men of power are weaving yet another interlocking directorate rev fred shuttles worth the president of the alabama conference of human rights is secretary of the sncc king himself and many of his aides and supporters flit in and out of core the fellowship of reconciliation and other organizations king is even fashioning a separate legal organization the ghandi societya move that has greatly disturbed the old establishment an analysis of the governing boards of the old and new organizations reveals two different layers of support with few exceptions members of the old organizations are not members of the governing or advisory boards of the new organizations among the interesting exceptions are james b carey allan knight chalmbers earl b dickerson a philip randolph ira de a reid walter reuther hobson reynolds jackie robinson and bishop w j walls the establishment exists today as an uneasy coalition of old patriarchs new men of power and rebels but it still wields force as an independent power in the negro world its continuing power and influence were evident in the march on washington where establishment men moderated and mitigated explosive forces and militant men the establishment still lives but it operates in a different climate establishment men grew up in a world where simple people acquiesced in the decisions of their betters now suddenly all that has changed policy is made now in the full glare of kleig lights with intellectuals students and a comedian dick gregory looking over the policymakers shoulders having survived marcus garvey in the twenties black lenins in the thirties and asa philip randolph in the forties the establishment is waiting now for the next turn of the wheel the only thing wrong with this calculation is that the name of the game has changed the young students and behind them the young black nationalists are playing for keeps when a game or historical process reaches that point as french conservatives and american tories discovered establishment men who refuse to bet lose all the time almost everyone knows that the white power structure is threatened by the negro revolution what is not noted often enough is that negro men of power are also on trial not for the decisions they made but for the decisions they did not make not for the battles they lost but for the battles they did not fight
