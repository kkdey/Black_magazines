booker t wash hd  ington was the first  f and only american s  who made the long t  journey from slave cabin to the hall of fame the nearest approach to this marvelous achievement was made by abraham lincoln who rose from railsplitter to the presidency of the united states but the comparison fades before the fact that lincoln was white and booker t washington was a negro with its disadvantages that are beyond human computation whereas lincoln had all the advantages that go with being white in a white mans civilization where a mere white skin is the password to the best that the nation can offer washington had to make his fight up from slavery with his hands tied behind him it is no wonder then that the rise of booker t washington to fame has become one of the social wonders of the modern world and that the world proclaims his greatness and renown redounds to the credit of mankind and is one of historys grandest adornments the coming of booker t washington booker t washington therefore becomes not only one of the greatest negroes but one of the most remarkable men of history that he found his way from that slave cabin to the hall of fame occasions no surprise to students of history for such universal recognition followed as naturally and logically as the night follows day booker t washington stands out in fullest stature when silhouetted against the times when he arrived on the scenethe closing decades of the nineteenth century those dark and turbulent days of reconstruction had not completely passed and slaverys hangover was rife in the land the south was still huffed over losing its war of rebellion and negroes were feeling in full force the wrath of the souths disappointment and grievance over its loss the south mounted what may be definitely called a fivepoint attack in a cold war on the negro freedmen the first assault was on the negros humanity whether or not the negro is human was once a burning question which this writer remembers quite vividly as a lad i remember reading a book by one writer named carroll who wrote a book entitled the negro a beast or the image of god but the negros general advancement and social behaviour soon relegated the specious argument about the negros humanity which was conceded even by the most venomous enemies of the negros advance the next assault was on the negros industry it was argued that the negro could never survive in competition with the white man and that he would soon fade before the withering pressure of a life in competition with the industrious and resourceful white man but the  negros general economic advancement shown by his accumulation of property and his fine beginnings in almost every field of human endeavor soon ended the specious argument about the possibility of negro extermination through his lack of industry the negro was not only surviving but grandly next came the assault on the races vitality it was argued that whereas the negro physically survived under slavery because the white man forced upon him habits of survival under freedom he would finally perish for lack of health discipline in those days white life insurance companies refused negroes as unprofitable insurance risks this gave the negro insurance companies just the opening they needed one white actuary named dublin widely publicized the idea of the negro as a too risky insurance risk the north carolina mutual life insurance company and the atlanta life insurance company and others by their phenomenal growth proved the untruth of the allegation against the negros vitality the campaigns that the white companies are putting on for negro risks today are added proof that the poor vitality argument against the negro has lost its force then came the assault on the negros morality this was an argument to the effect that negroes could not control themselves sexually and were rapists by nature and hence a grave danger to the white mans society this argument has long since been dissipated by such findings as reuter in his american race problem and by the history of sex crimes in the nation the final assault was made on the negros mentality and the mental tests incident to world war i gave just the excuse prejudiced whites craved to prove that the negro lacked mental equality with the whites and was thereby disqualified for full citizenship in this country but when the mental tests showed that northern negroes showed to better advantage than southern whites all the wind was taken out of the sails of the fivefold attack on the negro in a cold war that is still going on booker t washington came on the scene to face this social psychology of the white south then there arose such towering negrophobes as ben tillman of south carolina who was the first to throw the negro question full force into politics he so played upon race prejudice that he an almost unlettered white man became governor of south carolina and went on to the senate of the united states with no political platform other than keep the negro down it was so easy that georgia soon had its hoke smith and tom watson mississippi soon had its vardaman and bilbo alabama had its heflin and soon every southern state had a vestpocket edition of ben tillman tillmanism still flourishes in the south in this situation the negro found himself impoverished untrained and inadequately led except by its ministry that was unequal to the tremendous task that lay ahead booker t washington in this trying and critical hour not only arrived on the scene but he arrived a man with a plan he reasoned that having done the souths hard labor for hundreds of years the negros foot was in the door and all he had to do was to keep pushing he argued that the negros labor was his only commodity and if this could be sold to advantage the negro could gradually rise by his own efforts he came preaching a gospel of industrial education and the dignity of labor it was true that dr w e b du bois and john mitchell and monroe trotter and frederick douglass were urging negroes to contend for their rights but the sign of the times pointed to the conclusion that ere the white man conceded the negros claims for full citizenship there would be a long lapse of years there would be a long and arduous struggle subsequent events have proved the correctness of washingtons conclusion after a hundred years we are still a long way from the promised land negroes in general were quick to grasp washingtons idea but under the aegis of the arguments of douglass and dubois they were soon confused and with the apparent lack of coordination of leadership it was easier to sell negroes on positions than to sell them on the matter of jobs the negroes who fought washington based their fight on the exposition speech he made in atlanta when he said in things economic the races in the south could be as one as the fist but in things social they could be as separate as the fingers this statement by a man beset by a prejudiced south led by at times vicious white leaderpoliticians turned the wolves loose on washington yet when we review his atlanta speech in retrospect what else could he have said at the time for him to have taken the position that martin_luther_king jr is taking now and saying what negroes on every corner are saying would have meant annihilation for the negro race moreover since washington uttered the atlanta speech negroes living in the white mans south have done just what he said could be done in things economic negroes and whites of the south have lived side by side and in things social they have been as separate as the fingers the truth of washingtons statement has been lived before the eyes of the world moreover there are indications that in spite of minor gains here and there and in spite of some momentous court decisions there is little or no evidence that negroes and whites of the south will not still continue to live as one as the fist in things economic and as separate as fingers on the hand in things social  of course the negro race would have it different most of us are nowists but are dealing with principalities and powers that have sworn unto death that neverism is the word if there is any leader who can hasten matters his work is cut out for him but conconcluded washingtonand wisely the negro cannot do without eating and wearing until this whole matter is settled eating is a nowist matter and what faced the negro in washingtons day faces the negro in our great today the negro must fight but he must have something to eat in the meantime and so when washington arrived he was a man with a plan what was his planto take the foothold negroes had in the economic life of the nation through his primacy in the manual arts and exploit it to the utmost to sell the use of proficient hands until we qualify ourselves to sell the product of our brains to make the very most of opportunities in the manual arts until we gather strength and prepare ourselves for positions of our liking there is nothing disgraceful about using jobs as stepping stones to positions economic security and assurance must precede full citizenship in this country and not follow this is one of those stern facts of economic life booker t washingtons doctrine rejected according to the teachings and doctrine of booker t washingtonjust suppose he could have sold his idea to the negro race through its leaders the negro cooks would be the owners of our great eating places and establishments our bricklayers and carpenters would be our great contractors now our launderers would have charge of the great laundry industry instead of quarreling and fighting for the jobs that are becoming fewer and fewer by reason of competition and automation we would now be commanding those jobs but washingtons doctrine and his plan were utterly rejected hampton and tuskegee could not supply the great need for training such as they offered but what is even more tragictheir graduates did not spread the doctrines and popularize it at first little tuskegees and little hamptons sprung up all over the south but those who taught industrial education did not themselves believe in it and so could not enthuse their students about its possibilities even our great schools at tuskegee and hampton are today for all practical purposes schools of liberal arts those who rejected and spurned washingtons doctrine of industrial education were under moral compulsion to bring an alternate program just as washington had a plan for his day we need for our present day a man with a plan we have before us a gigantic task to win first class citizenship but in spite of our cry now there are multiplying evidences that we are nin for a long struggle and we must eat in the meantime dr du bois and monroe trotter and john mitchell all gainsaid and disparaged washington they had fine arguments but no alternate plan negro leadership has utterly rejected washingtons plan of using the manual arts and occupations as means of gaining positions but nobody seems to be coming up with a plan to feed the negro while he fights the fight the negro is now putting up deserves a leadership with a plan we cannot reach our goal merely by producing a race of fighters though fighters we must have but we also need a plan to feed these fighters    even fighters must be fed one of the glories of washington is that he not only had a plan but it was a positive plan and a practical plan a plan in a time of great crisis and great need today the employment situation is becoming so serious that the government is becoming concerned and is about to pour millions of dollars into training and retraining for the jobs that are and will be available it is seriously to be wondered whether our educators and other leaders who have completely rejected the washington plan will sell the negro race the opportunity inherent in the current efforts to train and retrain for jobs that will be scarcer as competition and automation press like a vise upon the working population today we are fighting against segregation although most of our economic success is of the segregated varietyour professionals our insurance companies our publications our undertakers and barbers and beauty culturists all live by segregation our thousands and thousands of teachers today are faring finely salarywise in our segregated schools desegregation without integration will not relieve the necessity of our leaning hard upon the fruits of segregation in spite of segregation the negro has advanced but we need a plan we have rejected washingtons negro educators what is your economic plan for the masses although the negro race through its leaders and especially its educators has utterly rejected washingtons plan to date has offered no alternate plan to succour the race in its economic life washington made the great mistake too often made by the prophets preaching to the people a gospel of what they need instead of what they want and so booker t washington was stoned even as the prophets of old were stoned but when we consider what booker washington had to show for his teachings and doctrinesa tuskeegeeand what his critics have to show washington thus stands out in bold relief like the towering alps snowcapped and majestic booker t knew in his early times that in the last analysis who has the dollar is a far more powerful question than who is going to marry whose daughter and so he had a plan by which negroes could command the dollar it still is true that he who would get the dollar must put his heart into his work as well as his hands it is still true that beginning at the bottom is the surest way to reach the top washington was our great leader in the darker days of segregation martin_luther_king jr is proving himself a great leader in these anxious days of desegregation of sorts who will bring forward a leadership for the days of integration that lie far into the uncertain future many a great football game has been lost by a fumble negro leadership fearfully fumbled the opportunity that washingtons philosophy and doctrine pointed out to a struggling race we are wondering seriously whether our fumble can be recovered and the day saved by a reformed leadership that will not reject the man and the plan that led somewhere the problems that confront us in these troubled times together with our lack of a constructive plan of solution are a vindication of the life and teachings of booker t washington who looked over the shoulders of three generations

the dictionary gives various definitions for £ this particular essence history identifies those w ho possessed it the bible reveals from whence it came the song that begins lift every voice and sing portrays it violent death often takes he who displays itmedgar evers he conveyed it many more died but the essence lives on and on the freedom march in washington expressed it in a feeling rather than a sight or a sound i have a dream said reverend king and tears sprang to many eyes for he spoke from his heart and his speech had the essence and when i read his speech i felt this essence i think most american negroes who read or heard it did for this essence is at the very core of our existence it binds all our lives together and in it we are one the chains of slavery could not squeeze it from us the noose could not bring it to an end the countless whips may have drawn blood from the flesh but they could not draw the essence from within thus it was passed down to us through the centuries not from hand to hand but rather from heart to heart it is within us among us and around us it is part of our heritage we call it soul to us soul is a part of many things have you heard of soul food or soul music in a recent interview as reported by an international magazine mary lou williams the pianist said this i am praying through my fingers when i play i get that good soul sound and i try to touch peoples spirits she did not elaborate but her statement raises a questionwhat is this soul that she captures in her music it is the same essence that medgar evers conveyed moreover a recent issue of jet magazine reported that solomon burke the singer had been dubbed the king of rock n soul an interpretation of that title is beyond the scope of this article however why is the term rock n soul used in place of the more familiar rock n roll to what does this soul refer it refers to the same essence that was expressed by the freedom march in addition the society editor of jet informed us that the dinner served at a special event consisted entirely of soul food the specific menu for the dinner need not particularly concern us what we are concerned with is this question what was the soul that pervaded the food it was the same essence that per vaded reverend kings speech what is it that has spanned the centuries that can bridge the gap between such different styles of music as those of mary lou williams and solomon burke what is it that was shared by thousands during a mass marchthat reached out and touched them when they heard a speechthat is used to describe such opposites as food and music what is the essence that we call soul it is not the moral or religious soul of any single man not the lone one possessed by you or me it is part of yet apart from the individual soul it is a togetherness a oneness a sum even more than a feeling soul is an affinity rather than a word a look mostly a spiritual sharing in the blending of all that was that is and is to come soul is that which tells the story of many lives in a single prayer one that began perhaps in the slavehold of a ship a prayer that implores the light of freedom to shine to pierce the darkness in mens minds so that well all be free to us this prayer gave a sense of humility and from that humility came soul a james meredith who faces hostile crowds a freedom rider who emerges from a burning bus a pregnant woman who spends days in a dark dank cellthese people transcend fear or bravery they have soulthe essence that embraces happiness and exalts sadness that tempers bravery and lessens fear it justifies dying relieves living and lends significance to life and death in his book black like me john h griffin tells of the time he went to an unidentified smalltown bus station in the south i bought a ticket to montgomery and went to sit outside on the curb where other negro passengers gathered many negroes walked through the streets their glances were kind and communicative as though all of us shared a common secret the impression that he received was correct their glances were kind and communicative because the common secret that they shared was soul for soul is living in sympathy with one another having an empathy for each other and sharing in all the things that we have felt and that we feel soul encompasses facing forward with high hopes and looking backward at the sorrows joys trials toil and tears it involves looking back across the bodies of our dead ancestors back across their shallow nameless graves to the nights when they sat and sang in the face of terror to the nights they hung bloody heads and prayed those songs and those prayers are still among us though they may be different in melody and word so if a strange song or prayer brings sudden tears to our eyes we are not surprised we know that this is soul and if we could hear the ancient voices speaking from the nameless graves they would tell us of the thousands who died from lack of bread they would tell us of the foodless days and cold hungry nights they would tell us that they sat and cried as they watched their children starve and die then they would tell us of the times when there were only certain foods to eat greens from the fields the belly of a sow the bread made from cornmeal or flour they would tell us that those foods once helped them cheat the hands of death that they nourished those who began the struggle that we have vowed to carry on so it is not strange that certain foods touch on memories of those who lived before for we are reminded of all the foods that they had and didnt have this too is soul soul is the common denominator the great identifier the path of synonymity from the crib to the grave from the gutter to the throne rising above love neutralizing hate moving outside of riches or poverty it forges a link between the princes and paupers the bourgeoisie and bums soul combines strength and a feeling of helplessness faith and a feeling of hopelessness an awareness of living and suffering a love for loving an urge for laughing and the need to cry soul is to each of us what it is unto itselfa reflection of lifes miseries and a mirror for its joys we have caught that reflection we have looked into that mirror such is soul the essence we feel

free parents so he never knew the condition of servitude he left north carolina when a young man revels moved to indiana while quite young and attended the quaker seminary in union county a while later he moved to darke county ohio and attended the seminary there when he had completed this period of education he went to baltimore maryland he was ordained in the african methodist episcopal

large school for freedmen he helped to recruit a negro regiment in st louis in  he went to mississippi and joined the federal army as chaplain of a negro regiment at the same time he helped the freedmens bureau to extend protection to negro troops chaplain revels crossed over from vicksburg to jackson to establish schools and churches bushwhackers almost captured him but he was warned by friends and managed to escape in  he left the army and went to louisville and then to leavenworth kansas to preach in  he settled at natchez mississippi where he combined preaching with participation in politics the first republican convention ever held in mississippi met at jackson september   about a third of its members were exslaves revels had been elected as alderman of natchez in  he was elected to the state senate in  at this time revels had received no particular attention from the reconstruction republicans but when the state legislature of mississippi convened in january  preacher revels was called on to open the session with a prayer his prayer was impressive and did much to lead to his election as united states senator the minister had entered politics reluctantly because he feared his participation would cause racial friction he was careful to never prostitute the pulpit to partisan purposes as some were accused of doing mississippi had no representative in the united states senate after jefferson davis resigned at the beginning of the civil war when mississippi reentered the union in  revels was elected as a compromise candidate  the memphis daily avalanche of january   had this to say about the first negro to serve in the united states senate seven cities contended for the honor of homers birth how many will struggle for revels is yet a question a week ago  people had never heard his name or if heard it was only to be forgotten now it will be the subject of  leaders and when revels reaches washington the reporters of all the great journals will interview him happy revels he is of popular manners and speaks with great ease fluency and generally in good taste in his intercourse with all classes he conducts himself with decorousness that has won him the regard of all his neighbors at home and of the members of the mississippi senate of which he is now a member revels did not go to washington to serve a full fouryear term it was an unexpired term to last from february   to march   when senator revels arrived in washington some members of the mississippi delegation held a party president u s grant and his cabinet members were present grant received revels with much kindness and told him he hoped he would be admitted to the senate without difficulty it was reported that even the radicals of the republican party didnt want a negro in congress when revels credentials were presented to the senate on february  one senator james nye rejoiced in a speech that a negro was replacing jefferson davis this set off a debate that lasted all day and revels was not confirmed on that day the debate resumed on february  and lasted all day without a decision senator simon cameron made a speech in which he reminded the senate of what he had said in  when jefferson davis left washington the radicals wanted to seat revels in davis old seat for the spectacular effect it would create senator ross of kansas occupied jeff davis old seat no  he would not give it up and revels was forced to take no  on the opposite side of the row a vote of  to  was cast in his favor on february  and revels became the first negro to be seated in the u s senate the newspapers and the negro ministers in washington announced that senator revels would give his first speech in the senate on march  the gallery of the senate was packed a writer for the philadelphia press said never since the birth of the republic has such an audience been assembled under one single roof it embraced the greatest and the least american citizens the occasion of revels speech was the readmission of georgia into the union in referring to his race he managed to get in a word for civil liberties  they appeal to you and to me to see that they receive that protection which alone will enable them to pursue their daily avocations and enjoy the liberties of citizenship on the same footing with their white neighbors and friends sir i repeat the fact that the colored race saved the noble women of new england and the middle states many men of whom they lean today for security and safety many of my race representatives of these men on the battlefield sleep in countless graves of the south if those quiet resting places of our honored dead could speak today what a mighty voice like to the rushing of a mighty wind would come up from those sepulchral homes could we resist the eloquent pleadings of their appeal ah sir i think that this question of immediate and ample protection for the loyal people of georgia would lose its technicalities and we would cease to hesitate in our provisions for their instant relief senator revels didnt receive any more attention until the summer of  at this time he appointed a negro to west point the negro cadet failed to pass and was soon dropped the nation pronounced it a very foolish and cruel thing as far as the boy and his family were concerned and a very injudicious thing as far as the colored race is concerned the first negro senator introduced two or three minor bills which failed to pass on february   he gave his last speech in the senate it concerned the mixed schools in the district of columbia he favored the proposal of mixed schools at the conclusion of his speech he said the white race has no better friend than i i am true to my own race   but at the same time i would not have anything done which would harm the white race revels term came to a close on march   he did not run for reelection alcorn college for negroes was established in mississippi and revels became its first president he was appointed by governor alcorn who had replaced him in the u s senate in june  revels went to new orleans to edit the southwestern advocate an organ of the general conference of his church revels then served a second term as president of alcorn college after this he returned to religious work and made his home at holly springs mississippi he became district superintendent of his church and died while attending a church conference at aberdeen mississippi the date was january   thus ended the career of the first negro to serve in the united states senate
our children must not be castoffs
my job is that of a teacher i am proud of it devoted to it and fully aware of my responsibilities that is why i am here tonight i apologize for the screen which shields me from your view however without its protection i might lose my job yet the screen does allow my words to reach your ears for this i am grateful to begin with like you i am a product of the society that stands on trial here tonight when i was just a toddler unaware of real human conflicts my mother often said these words to meover and over in a determined voice when you are old enough to go to school we are going to leave this place well go where you can get a good education we lived in the heart of the rural south then where educational facilities for negroes were lacking she kept her promise and we leftheading northward to the land of opportunity we know that teachers should be constantly at war against one common enemyignorance but what do we teach the truth part of it or only the truth as we see it in any discussion of the socalled negro problem the truth is often grossly mistreated usually ignorance is the rootor very close to the rootof this problem as a result the mere mention of the word negro sends minds of all colors scurrying for protective cover nobody wants to discuss it especially squeamish are the whites who created it they have preconceived ideas these ideas were passed down from generation to generation because of this fact they accept without questioning all the ideas that are inherited thus a monster image of the negro has been skillfully built in the minds of white america likewise uncle tom negroes eager to assimilate into the white mans culture adopt readily his values as to beauty standards and cultural patterns lost is the sophisticated negros identity with anything negroid or dark in hue very briefly let me review some very disturbing byproducts of deftly applied ignorance  any member of the white race is basically superior to any member of the darker races regardless of age or natural ability  the negro in general is not to be regarded as a human beinghe is thought of only as chattel and is to be exploited whenever possible under pressure a few doles can be handed out to pacify him for the moment  the negro is only one step removed from the lower animals  for this reason he has extra long or large body parts  the negro has a peculiar offensive odor  his intelligence level is and is destined to be lower than that of other racial or ethnic groupsparticularly the white group  the negro has no culture he is really uncivilized and can never be fused into a civilized urbane white society  the negro is basically lazy slovenly and happy go lucky he is satisfied with his lot in life he does not want any socalled freedom  he is a poor workerin job situationsand is utterly undependable if his job becomes easier as to physical demands it is then declared to be a white job he is fired  the negro can succeed only in matters requiring physical or entertainment ability this fact accounts for the monopoly of the sports and amusement fields  if a negro is interested in integration he is interested primarily because he desires intermarriage personal wishes of equal job opportunities housing and education are not understood  by white americans havent we all heard these statements the fact that these beliefs contribute to the neverending circle of frustration despair and general confusion felt by the average negro is not even considered by the whites tensionreleasing activities such as rock and roll music or other diversions are frowned upon by whites as being symbolic of the animal nature of the negro thus the white man can justify smugly that he has the right to  relegate the negro to his place for everyones good such then is the social climate as we switch to a negro school in a negro neighborhood fortyeight negro youngsters push and shove each other into line as they hear the clanging of the shift bell if this class is in a changing neighborhood they are often exposed to perplexed hostile white teachers who neither understand their problems and resultant actions nor attempt to the students  are yelled at compared to stupid animals and generally impressed with the fact that they are two to three years below grade levela fact that they are already aware of they are scolded and told to act like civilized people they are told that they cannot write neither can they read the strange symbols in the book if they are lucky they can look at the pictures of the little white blondehaired children playing with their pets in the backyard of course the house is white surrounded by the lilywhite picket fence a first grade teacher in a southside chicago school reading dick and jane with the class asked who lives in the white house on the hill one little boy finally stood up scratched his head and said the white people do this is the white world and it is strangefar removed from his dark world his color is his curse he sees this fact very clearly as his father returns home at night to tell of his failures in trying to get a job that day that is if his father has not already become discouraged and left the home he all too often feels that adc aid to dependent children is the answer that will provide food and shoes for his needy family thus he disappears so that his family will be provided for and he can laugh or drink his troubles awaywith less overpowering responsibility and more opportunity for success is it any wonder that the student leaves school one way or the other as soon as possible truancy dropouts and general delinquency reign supreme in these hotbeds well then how can a teacher teach this class of negro children often rebellious to any form of authority she begins with the pledge to the flaglistening to the chant one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all fervently she labors to develop the concept that equal and adequate services of the public schools are available to all the children of all the people yet she knows that lettie the fifteen year old girl in the sixth seat in the first row has no idea of what shes saying her iq according to test scores is  but she is sitting in a regular classroom with  other seventh graders the division that could best meet her needs is overcrowded at her school the fact that she has a violent temper and fighting tendencies simply prompts school officials to graduate her from grammar school as quickly as possible where is lettie now what is she doing there are hundreds of letties in regular classrooms throughout the negro sections of the city some have iqs in the s but they still are lost in the rushed crowded schedule of the overcrowded shift situations the iqs of these children are taken as irrevocable fact when educators pounce upon their scores yet studies have proven that they are more often than not completely unreliable consider the example of a negro child attempting to take an iq test she is asked to put a mark on a pail however she marks everything but a pail because she sees only a bucket a pair of scissors and a ball the word pail is not in the childs experiential vocabulary therefore she will not mark the pail and her test results will be correspondingly lowered it has been proven also that the person administering the test plays a vital role in the test results if negro children are being tested by a white tester iq results are considerably lower than those in a control group of children tested by a negro tester libraries are full of data supporting all statements made here tonight but ignorance again wins out when american citizens are either unaware of these facts or are too biased in their thinking to investigate the question arises are all negro children underprivileged and housed in crowded cramped conditions no they are not yet as recently as four months ago statistics were obtained stating that of the  children on double shift sessions in chicago classrooms some  of those children were negro youngsters the coincidence is too striking what do you think well over a thousand children have passed through my classroom door and each one had some unique problem generally in the crowded situation i had neither the time nor energy to devote to really helping those children solve the problems that were blocking their learning opportunities as a result some children that i formerly taught are today parents of illegitimate children seriously mentally disturbed dope addicts prostitutes and at least one that i can recall is dead because of his unfavorable environment when i have  children in a class there just isnt time to listen all i have time for is maintaining order some of the evils of overcrowded school conditions in negro neighborhoods are so remote and removed from the average white persons thinking that he cannot begin to understand the problem  little or no school supplies are available for overcrowded classrooms extra fancy supplies such as yarn string scotch tape scissors for every child crayolas or other basic necessities are simply a joke when they are requested  one set of books per subject is assigned to each desk despite the fact that two children must share them on a doubleshift basis more not fewer books are needed by these handicapped children they are not available what happened may i ask to the negro parents tax dollar why doesnt his child have books school supplies the extras that make learning fun not drudgery in most double shift schools there is not enough time even for a regular recess gym periods are cut in halfmost normal schools have two gym periods a week but most double shift classes have only one the children are cramped and confined without regular exercise and you know what this does to learning often schools that are on shift have had the library converted to a regular classroom yet these are the students who need libraries most who can answer these questions we have the most talented educator in the country at our disposal so we have been so forcibly told does he choose to give our negro parents any answers does he know does he care he certainly has had opportunity enough for on numerous occasionstoo numerous to list tonightsupt benjamin c willis has been asked to give chicago taxpayers a true picture of the school situation has he shown the courtesy to do so no why should we negro and white alike be burdened more with increased taxes when more than enough empty classrooms already exist in this city to take our children off double shift we do not need new schools we need to fill the ones that we already have attention white america we are not interested in marrying your daughters all we want are equal opportunities at job training and other benefits we want adequate housing for our familieshousing that we can afford then we will not have to double up in order to pay your rents we can pay reasonable rents save our money and buy homes for our familiesas you have been able to do dr willis it is your responsibility as our superintendent to see that all children are given equal opportunity for learning despite race creed or national origin it has been said dr willis that you harbor the same idea that some of your white brothers sharethat those children meaning ours should be treated as castoffs in a society that demands only the best those children dr willis are children and grandchildren of negroes whose talents have been grossly neglected and wasted have you wondered why there are so many dropouts among negro

so youve decided to  o ¥ take the happy gamr ble you and the neygu p gro man or woman whom you love feel that in spite of the probable rough going ahead life would be much harder to bear if you didnt marry now that youve made the big decision you want to know what to plan for and what to expect the first item on your program will be to check and see whether or not your state allows interracial marriage nineteen states prohibit it they are alabama arkansas florida georgia louisiana mississippi north carolina south carolina tennessee texas virginia delaware indiana kentucky maryland missouri wyoming oklahoma and west virginia if you live in a state which has a law forbidding your marriage you have two courses of action open to you either move to a state where there is no such law or make an attempt to marry then if stopped take the case to the courts of your state in an attempt to have the law changed these laws are archaic since so many states have dropped their antimiscegenation laws recently perhaps your state is just waiting for a case such as yours to test their law then they could dispense with it on legal precedent of course if you live in the deep south they may be reluctant to do so just yet one important thing to remember is not to settle for a commonlaw alliance for then your marriage will have an inferior status and your children might not be your lawful heirs after you have decided the state in which you will be married and the one in which you will live note if you leave your home state briefly to be married elsewhere and return after the ceremony the state could prosecute you for trying to evade its law your next concern will be the choice of a dwelling will you rent for awhile or can you afford the down payment on a house the houses which carry the lowest down payment are tract houses and if you like them you can quickly have one to call your own more and more tract houses are opening to people of all ethnic groups and government financed houses cannot legally practice discrimination if you dont like tracts perhaps you would like to live in an apartment until you have children good apartments in the right price range are sometimes hard to find when you need one one way is to advertise in the paper most read by the economic or intellectual group in which you belong state all the nice things about yourself and say that you will give a breakage deposit if required another way is to place a card on the advertising boards of your local markets say plainly that you are a mixed couple and then the right people can call you those who live in certain areas of the country where there are laws against discrimination in housing have an advantage but it is up to them to take a firm stand and not back down new york city has such a law and so does california with its unruh ate and the much publicized rumford act however in many areas of the country people are forming committees to peacefully gain open occupancy this is true in riverside california then too in chicago the old town gardens and marina city are examples of places open to all who can qualify with the rise of labor unions employers have been less able to fire their workers for personal reasons if you or the person you are to marry feel that your job has been taken from you because of your association together see your union representative or go to one of your local civil_rights protective groups if you are working on a job handling government contracts this is illegal in any case do your work well so your employer will not want to find an excuse to dismiss you you may have heard that mixed couples lose all of their friends when they marry this isnt true for you wont lose any real friends you may even gain more than you had before as interested people will seek your company unless you live in an area where bigotry is so strong that people are too frightened to be friendly if your family treats you in a mean way or disowns you treat them kindly and with understanding time will mellow them especially when they see your children they will be likely to reown you they will be somewhat ashamed of their hasty judgment and will use many different ways in trying to make it up to you be prepared for questions of all kinds some of them quite personal people are curious and if they can overcome their shyness enough to speak up they will try to find out just how a mixed marriage works try not to be offended but give them an honest answer you dont know but what they are contemplating doing the same thing when people stare at you on the street it is not necessarily out of hostility remember that a good number of people have been taught that mixed marriage cant exist in the united states so it is something of a jolt for them to see a mixed couple negroes stare as much as whites so just assume that people want to look at you if one or both of you still attends high school wait until you graduate to marry this is hard to do sometimes as emotions are hard to control particularly the strong emotions that mixed couples feel for each other your parents may not allow you to date openly but dont sneak out to see each other as difficult as it may be try to finish school so that you will be able to get good jobs after that if your parents still forbid your courtship tell them that you dont intend to defy them but that you honestly feel that you are doing the right thing your new inlaws and other negro relatives by marriage might not care for you very much at first but they are likely to be much more friendly to you than your caucasians relatives will be to your mate just give them time to know you remembering that they are often bitter about the treatment which they have received in the past from whites love and understanding will be your main weapons if you keep your personal life above reproach they will be quick to see that there is no angle to your marriage but love for the one whom you marry dont worry about whether or not to have children have all you can afford they will be interesting and probably beautiful enough to win first prize in the local baby contest if they know that their parents love each other and love them they cannot help but be well adjusted and happy they will be able to make friendsand enemieson their own too as other negro children such children of mixed couples as roy campanella philippa schuyler and andre watts have made a high mark in the united states this is the most important thing to remember dont leave god out of your lives attend church every week and kneel and pray together every day thank god for each other and always be grateful to him for keeping prejudice from preventing your marriage do things together after all you have defied longstanding customs to be together take part in all the activities that you have time for plan trips to the zoo and the beach go to concerts and to museums enjoy each others company if you are a white woman learn how to press hair you may have a daughter who needs it you will find that negro women are often sensitive to having members of the other race around while they are doing their hair once they dont mind you know youve been accepted as one of the gang try to keep your home as much of a refuge from the outside world as possible your mate will be contending with the frustrations which will continue to beset negroes until we help our country to free itself of prejudice use a thousand ways to show you care by the fact of your marriage you will have helped atone for the terrible way in which the whites have treated negroes over the years you will be showing that if the united states is actually the melting pot of the world then every ethnic group has the right to melt soon youll feel like and be an honorary negro knowing how to read expresisons and sensing where discrimination is practiced finally when the ubiquitous bigot asks the classic question about whether or not you would want your daughter to marry one you can reply friend my daughter is a negro so if you are certain that you have made the right choice get married the rest of your life will show you how right you were
a matter of fellowship
during a softball game a lessthantenyearold boy called to me from the sidelines hey mister you look like johnny jones are you his father no im not i am warren marr and im from new york how do you do mr marr i am carl smith and im from rocky mount are you enjoying your visit here yes yes i am i almost stuttered into additional conversation for i was not prepared for this kind of assurance and maturity from a negro boy in bricks n c i would not have been prepared for this kind of exchange from any boy of  or younger carl was one of  youngsters all under the age of  who were sharing the experience of a twoweek summer camp at franklinton center located in the miniature town of bricks in the rural tobacco country of northern north carolina he was one of a group who were having their play period and who had divided into two softball teams for a lively game without immediate adult supervision carls turn at bat came v excuse me mr marr he said returning to the game and driving a twobagger down center field when the inning broke the boys agreed to pose for a picture quickly they arranged themselves in rows and assumed postures associated in their minds with professional ballplayers the effect was good and i told them that they handled themselves better than many adults under similar circumstances thats a polaroid  isnt it mister someone asked yes how do youknow do you have one no but ive seen them on ed sullivans show can we see the picture come out another asked sure i said as i squeezed the shutter release come on i began to count aloud one two  a chorus picked up the count and carried it on the basis of the rhythm i had initiated to ten then quiet heads moved in close to watch the back of the camera being opened for the extraction of the finished snapshot hey thats good can you make pictures for us i wont have enough film for the work i have to do if i make a picture for each of you i must get photographs of the buildings and the work in the community to take back to my office ill take one photo which i will give the group of you if that will help how will all of you share one picture thats easy a boy said well take it to miss martin and she can put it on the bulletin board who will take it to her let joe be in charge hes the oldest later in the day in the auditorium of fellowship hall the pure vigorous voices of  boys blended in fourpart harmony rehearsals were under way for a closing program and again i was impressed with the decorum of the boys and their respect for discipline there was no fidgeting and no whispered conversations only wholehearted participation the song ended and a tall brown face rose from the group to announce the next feature eight boys walked alertly to the front to sing as an octet then came a demonstration of the virginia reel performed with near perfection a display of acrobatics revealed surprising agility and muscular control twelve boys participated in a military marching drill more songs what you have achieved with these children is completely unbelievable i said to marjorie martin you must have worked with them endlessly im only here for a short period during the summer the redhaired freckled instructor said i am a schoolteacher and can be here only on my vacation time william judson king president of franklinton center interrupted this is the second and younger group of children who have been here this summer there were  girls from  to  in the first group of this annual pta camp they come from all parts of north carolina the way young people respond to miss martin defies description we wish we could afford to have her as a permanent member of our staff the reference to limited funds almost went unnoticed with his positive outlook mr king was only stating a condition he has to work with he was not bemoaning an obvious and im sure heartbreaking limitation this impression occurred again when on a tour of the establishment he said here is the dining hall it seats  since we can sleep  people comfortably it becomes a trick of mathematics to feed that many everything about mr king is positiveeasy unassuming unpretentious but positive as he moves at a seemingly relaxed pace  about his wellkept campus he observes everything and acts immediately    that man cutting the lawn is at a point where he should switch to the bigger power mower she wont start the man says president judson king squats behind the machine and makes some adjustments with a screwdriver the machine starts  in hospitality hall the dormitory the venetian blinds are closed so the rays of the sun are deflected downward the sun will fade our furniture he says as he reverses the slant of the blinds this is the same man whose foresight has helped the farmers of his own and adjacent counties to have their first contact with the industrial world a corporation was formed with stock offered to the negro farmers at two dollars a share some of the farmers wives made weekly trips to kings strictly utilitarian office to pay for a share of stock at the rate of  cents a visit mind you i cant issue you a stock certificate which costs  cents to produce until you have purchased ten shares he would say the women didnt mind they and their husbands in a relatively short time accumulated  then they looked for a small industrial plant to buy they found one in a neighboring town and their joint investment is now paying  per cent we wont identify the business its management is still white the machine operators are negro as far as we were able to learn the town in which the business is located is unaware that it is now negroowned president king finds great satisfaction in the knowledge that some of his people have diversified their financial interests in addition negroes handling the machinery are gaining a technical knowledge and experience they would not have been able to acquire otherwise they can use this new knowledge to particular advantage if they should move into the industrial cities as many do nearly every highschool graduate leaves the area within a year of his commencement exercises it is a good beginning it is impossible to assess the influence judson king exerts in north carolina as head of franklinton center and neighboring tillery he perpetuates and extends the tradition of the organization which founded both these centers that tradition was at its best when the american missionary association went into the south on the heels of the union armies setting up schools for negro freedmen and any whites who would attend more than  schools had their beginnings this way franklinton center as it exists today is the result of the merger of two separate institutionsbricks school and franklinton center in franklinton at the end of the th century bricks worked with negro share croppers teaching them to read and write and to improve their agricultural methods later it became a junior college when the school was discontinued the future was uncertain then came the merger efforts to make the new franklinton a conference center were tenuous meanwhile the buildings had fallen into disrepair when one building burned and several others were razed their gaping foundations became dumping groundsunsightly health hazards the vast grounds became overgrown with brush judson king has nearly rebuilt franklinton since he cameand not without excitement as he began to eliminate an old foundation a dragline brought up  snakes poisonous moccasins as franklinton has regained its stature its  acres have diminished former tenant farmers of the area who once studied at bricks have been sold parcels of land adequate for economically sound farming with the continued cooperation of the center the new landowning families have become successful farmers meanwhile various groups and organizations are using the center for their conferences in addition to the camp mentioned before there have been joint churchmens meetings ministers institutes laymens fellowship meetings the american friends meetings international study caravans conferences on better life for farm families and numerous other conventions less than a score of miles northwest of franklinton is the sprawling community of tillery named for its former white owner when the federal government was selling off the rehabilitation project to negro tenants several local landlords wanted the crossroads site of a community center for business purposes the ama purchased it to preserve it for the use of the tillery community today the tillery community center is operated under the auspices of franklinton center and serves as headquarters for the tillery improvement association which stresses farm home and community improvement one day last august nearly  peoplenegro farmers and their familiescrowded into the little auditorium for their fifth annual picnic meeting with the theme farming in the space age they planned for the year ahead and for the years after that during the formal part of the meeting several white farmequipment representatives sat in the audience they had accepted the invitation of tillery to display their equipment on ground space rented at the ridiculously low figure of  these men have learned that the tillery farmers will buy equipment only from firms that participate in this annual picnic it is estimated that the gross value of equipment purchased from the  exhibitors has reached the sum of  that amount of money becomes  staggering with the realization that  years ago most of the farmers were cultivating small plots with muledrawn plows perhaps the most successful farmer under the tillery influence is a man who has  acres of rented land in tobacco com soy beans and cotton his crops are typical of the area so is his forward outlook there is a great amount of cooperation among these farmers as they enjoyed their annual outing the only sour notes were their expressions of disgust about the impenetrable minds and dragging feet of a few of their neighborsneighbors whose refusal to accept change delays the progress of all among these tillery farmers president king shared openshirted comfort conversations between him and the farmers were handled in an offhand manner that bespoke camaraderie king is the director of the tillery center and the local representative of the american missionary association but aside from the prestige of this post he was present at the outing as the most respected person of the community his affability influence and apparently endless knowledge have helped these farmers grow the president of franklinton and tillery is continuously thinking in terms of progress for the negroes in his area he is dedicated to a more effective franklinton both of these concerns have been helped because king has had the courage among other things to hold interracial meetings on his groundsmeetings in which effective communication between negro and white has been initiated franklinton center is dedicated to the service of more than  churches of the united church fellowship in north carolina and virginia and to the service of the church universal its work with farmers of the area makes it a practical laboratory with tangible results for the involvement of churches in problems of town and country adjustment it is a living demonstration of the effective application of religion and of religious institutions to the problems of everyday living the influence of franklinton is extensive from time to time farm experts from other areas come in to observe visiting when i was there was dr shaker hammad of the agricultural faculty of the university of alexandria egypt despite its present influence it is apparent that financial limitations inhibit the program how can the center implement its desire to take voter education into the various communities how can young people do research when there is an inadequate library and no set of encyclopedias how can the very poor of the area be helped with clothing problems when few gifts of usable clothing are shipped to the center how can there even be the certainty that franklinton will aave water when the deepwell pump is  years old and wheeling about  feet deep the well has never run dry and there have been many times when neighboring farmers have had to come to franklinton for water when their wells ran dry the original rosenwald schoolhouse needs repair and hospitality hall could use a new roof an adequate dining room will cost  yet as i drove past the college of another denomination a short distance from franklinton i knew wry humor franklintons need for a dining hall is urgent but at the neighboring school bricklayers were erecting a decorative serpentine fencestrictly a luxury itemfor which a benefactor had donated  franklinton offers every possible opportunity for meaningful fellowship president king says in this growth toward white and negro fellowship in christ the breaking of legal restraints the removing of personal and social impediments and all the other activities which breach the walls of partition are but necessary preliminary steps and as noble as all these things are the church cannot afford to be satisfied with them nothing less than full fellowship in the body of christ can be our goal

breakers ahead
as the wheel turns life becomes progressively more complex and meaningful survival national and personal seems more and more like one long gantlet betweet scylla and charybdis at least this is true for many people tension and anxiety are so much a part of our daily lives that we accept them as normal conditions of existence yet their toll in the disintegration of personality and related problems must be very high indeed recently i heard a woman express her gratification at being able to get through  it was an awful year she said so many problems so many tragedies  was indeed a fateful year for americans and for most of the people of the world for us it was a year burdened with the kind of events which illustrate the corporate personality of a whole people divulge their national character and reveal their strengths and weaknesses there is no need to catalogue the burden of events with which the year just past was invested for they were of a sort that involved almost every american personally or at least vicariously take the mine disaster in pennsylvania for examplea tragedy which reminded us so poignantly that a mans life is not his alope it belongs at least in part to his family and his friends and even to the larger society even among the most lowly and the most deprived life is a value with which men are loathe to part no matter how poor they are no matter what they do for a living no matter how utterly wretched their existence men want to live for themselves and for those they love and cherish men want to live because tomorrow the reversal may come tomorrow the weight of the centuries may be lifted from their shoulders and some new atlas may be chosen by the fates to bear the burdens of the world for a time and society of course has a stake in the preservation of individual lives although we sometimes behave as if the contrary were true there was the tragedy of unemployment in harlem and west virginia the viet nam incident in far off indochina the murder of the innocents in birmingham all america watched the pageant of the great march of protest on the capital city of the united states there was the dallas incidenta brutal tale in which a man marked for greatness and an uncontested place in history was shot down like a common thief in the most fantastic tragicomedy of modern times while a brave heroic woman showed the world that the dignity of courage need not be subsumed by grief looking back januslike we must concede that  was a year of hatred and violence of murder and fear and invective but interstitially it was also a year of heroism and courage and hope few were sorry to see the old year close all of us are apprehensive about the portents of  one aspect of the heritage of the american people has been an individualism which has produced on the one hand a rugged independence and a hallowed determination to avoid interference with whatever is not of primary personal concern to the individual because we have until fairly recent times enjoyed a certain isolation from the rest of the world that has functioned to insulate us from most of the worlds problems the occasion for personal involvement in the personal struggles of  people elsewhere in the world has not been forcefully presented because america is itself a giant country with plenty of space and elbow room for all we have not been required to take notice of our neighbors this same philosophy of laissez faire has operated at home to produce for most of us an obliviousness of the problems and accomplishments of any outside the primary groups to which we belong as a consequence we have maintained our own privacy and permitted a like privacy to others at the expense of an appalling ignorance of the very factors which threaten the values we cherish so much while the most influential americans have commuted to the suburbs with averted eyes poverty and disease hatred and hostility have filled the vacuums they never permitted themselves to see furthermore because we have so frequently abdicated responsibility to irresponsible people we have as frequently reaped a harvest of incredibly bad government the primary intent of which is to maintain the status quo ie the ignorance and impotence of the responsible in order that the selfaggrandizement of the irresponsible may proceed unhampered the irony of it all is that the most inept rulers always rule in the name of the people while the people themselves are modestly silent and far above it all it is time for the responsible men of this country to take an intelligent appraisal of what is happening in america for if we do not it is inevitable that our most important values will be lost by default ours is a society experiencing the most rapid rate of change in its fundamental values of any society anywhere at any time in history some of this change is good some of it needs to be evaluated some of it is disfunctional to our national purpose and to our survival as a free and independent society our principal danger lies in the fact that in the turbulence of the social flux some changes are imperceptible and go undetected until they are accomplished facts another danger is that in learning to live with modern technology we have become so acclimated to change as to accept it at face value in most areas of our lives we have accepted the dictum that you cant turn back the clock as if all change were progress and as if we have nothing to say about what changes we shall have and what changes we shall avoid we behave as if the world were a huge mechanism already wound and rolling when we got on and we are powerless to deflect it from its course of aimlessness and guide it in the direction of more creative realities it is probably true that none of us can stop the world and get off but each of us can play a decisive part in determining where it is going  is going to be a crucial year in the fate of the world and the people of the united states if we are to be participants in the drama of our lives rather than mere objects to be manipulated and shoved here and there by the patterns of events then we must concern ourselves seriously about some of the issues which are before us as individuals citizens and sustainers of the national purpose which embodies the american self image i do not intend to attempt an exhaustive analysis of what is wrong with america nor is such a critique indicated but perhaps it may still be profitable to talk about some of the problems with which we are certain to be confronted they are not problems which we can solve as individuals but in thinking about them and talking about them we help to create a climate more nearly conducive to a realistic expression of the will of the people the category of possibilities is broad but i have selected four areas which i believe will illustrate the gravity of conditions now playing an important part in the shaping of our lives and the circumstances under which we live  technology philosophers have argued that the only persistent thing in life the only thing that does not change is change itself the world is forever in the process of change people change institutions change patterns of behavior change so there is nothing very new in the idea of change or the experience of it what is new to contemporary americans and to most of the rest of the world is the rate of changethe speed with which familiar institutions accepted ideas and hardened patterns of behavior are passing out of existence to be replaced by new and unfamiliar entities history becomes increasingly irrelevant as a guide for solving the problems we must face today and tomorrow for example what can we learn from napoleon or clausewitz or pershing or even eisenhower and macarthur about the war we seem to feel we have to fight tomorrow or the day after history used to teach that war was a political instrument that wars could be fought and won peace restored and existing international arrangements altered to the profit and glory of the victor how archaic is this lesson in  what can we learn from the political presuppositions of the th century or even of the thirties and forties of the present century we can learn something to be sure from the fundamentals but the specifics of twenty years ago have receded into the realm of the irrelevant today the destiny of america is irrevocably linked to the destiny of every nation in the world because the people of india and a thousand other unnamed communities of asia and africa and south america are dying of hunger we are uneasy with our swollen granaries and rotting potatoes because the people in the congo or in viet nam or in the negev desert or on the island of cypress want to fight each other our farflung armies and probing naval units are restless colonialism and racial oppression in south africa and angola makes us anxious and concerned we are not an island unto ourselves for better or for worse for as long as we can tell and as far as we can see into the future we are indissolubly linked to the mainland of human historyto all nations all races all religions their accomplishments are our own their problems of survival are our problems of survivalclearly even now and even more decisively in the future this is the era of the machine this is the era in which we find ourselves confronted with two infinitiesthe infinity of space and the infinity of nuclear war the chief instrument by which we propose to probe both of these infinities is the machine hence technology has come to bear upon our lives in so many ways and with such force as to give it preeminence among the problems with which responsible americans will have to deal in  and the succeeding years if any  of all of the scientists who ever lived are living today and they are creating for us a world which threatens to exceed our present political moral and economic capacities i do not believe with the determinists that technology is a force with a life of its own directing the destinies of its creators men do not have to go where technology directs them they do not have to do whatever technology suggests that it is possible to do the imperatives of technology can be resisted but are they it is common knowledge that technology has long since taken over the arms race we build bigger and better bombs for no other reason than that it is technologically possible to do so for years we have had a decisive overkill capacity today we have  times the nuclear might needed to annihilate completely any potential aggressor in any quarter of the world it is not for political advantage or national security that we continue to install bigger and more fearsome weapon systems it is because an escalating technology tells us it is possible to do but technology says nothing about the moral implications of our weapon systems or what we plan to do with them we are in danger of becoming prisoners of the very machines we have created to insure our freedom and survivalor at least to be certain that no one else is free or survives in fail safe that disturbing novel dealing with our automated defense system and the possibility of accidental war the authors describe our helplessness to prevent an unprovoked nuclear attack against a potential enemy once a signal has been fed into the machinery by the most unlikely accidentor by technological miscalculation in his book kill and overkill ralph lapp tells about a recent accident in which an american bomber dropped a thermonuclear device on north carolina the device had six foolproof safety locks on it to prevent accidental detonation according to the strategic air command none of these six safety locks could possibly be triggered by accident when the device was examined after being hurled to the earth five of the foolproof safety switches had been triggered but the problem of thermonuclear technology does not confine itself to accidental war it is a problem that searches out our fundamental values technology is a tool an instrument under proper control and direction its function is to serve man not to dominate him it is a means the search for the one best way in the pursuit of efficiency we are in danger of making technology an end in itselfthe prime value of american life along with the blessings of increased efficiency technology has also given us scandalous surpluses of foods mountainous scrapheaps of obsolete machinery and an everincreasing population of unemployed and unemployable men and women we shall have to concern ourselves with the problems of technology and quickly while there is yet time we need human engineering to cope with the increasing problems created by our technologists at a time when we are in need of all the brains we can get we may yet find it expedient to welcome back the socalled eggheads we have so perfunctorily dismissed from time to time  economics a second problem is that of our economic order it is in part related to the problem of technology as i have indicated we now have the capacity to produce all of the goods and services needed by americans but not all americans have what they need of what we can produce one fifth of all americans live at or below the level of poverty there are areas in this country which are quite as undeveloped as any in asia or africa the need and the poverty the abject misery saddling the slums of affluent america tell a familiar tale of the inequities of the distribution of wealth in this democratic society fifty million americans do not have enough to eat they are in addition undereducated underemployed and confined to the ghetto if we do not move to rectify these conditions we must inevitably reap the consequences in crime and delinquency the lowering of health standards wasted manpower hostility and social revolution einstein previewed our economic predicament shortly before his death when he declared that the individual has become more conscious than ever of his dependence on society but he views this dependence not as a positive asset nor as a protective force but rather as a threat to his natural rights and to his economic existence we shall have to come to terms with the probability that millions of todays unemployed will never again enjoy sustained employment it is not a question of whether or not they want to work these are human rejects the victims of the technological revolution now in progress we are more fortunate than some countries w h ferry writing in a recent issue of cross currents says that in india for example as many as  million indians are unemployed if mr nehrus third five year plan succeeds ferry writes it will produce another  million jobs but an additional  million people will by then be waiting for them the problem of an escalating technology is not so acute in america yet but we will have a population of  million six years from now and the percentage of the permanently unemployed will go up rather than down many americans can be retrained to take their places in the new automated society but many are too old and many do not have the basic education prerequisite to retraining for gainful employment in the space age but these americans have a right to continue to live and with dignity we have a corresponding duty to share with them the benefits of the wondrous technology which has wrested from them the emancipating dignity of work they are the victims of the historical flux if this most advanced of all societies has kept them uneducated unskilled and unemployable for whatever reason or if it has not in times past provided realistic incentives for their development and improvement then ultimately this society must share with them the profits accruing to the birthright of full citizenship they have had no chance to enjoy in a world where people are starving for food no less than for the simple recognition of their humanity and in a society where the imbalance of wealth between those who have and those who suffer from not having is extreme the rationale for such a system becomes less discernible and traditional attitudes about the sacredness and the inviolability of the capitalistic enterprise suffer the gravest erosion the welfare state is not a reasonable alternative for the welfare state destroys the soul while trying to salvage what is left of the body yet a sharply increased sense of responsibilitysocial responsibility which looking beyond the profit motive can see the people brought to distress through instrumentalities they neither recognize nor understand is imperative we may no longer shut out the uncomfortable realities of hunger and crime and destitution by the simple device of averting the eyes or closing the mind for they obtrude into consciousness with a persistence that accepts no further delay  international peace the experts list at least five kinds of accidents which could plunge the united states into nuclear war any hour of any day first a miscalculations or misinterpretation of an act by either the united states or russia both the russians and we have tripwire forces set to unlease retaliatory missiles before an attack is experienced if it appears that the other side has mounted an attack secondly the accidental detonation of a nuclear device such as almost happened in north carolina is automatically detected by monitoring devices on both sides but there is no way to tell whether the device was set off accidentally if we think it was not an accident we may attack if the russians think we think it was not an accident they may attack in order to get in the first strike if we think the russians think that we think it was not an accident we may attack so as to strike first and so it goes thirdly we could go to war unintentionally over a military incident that got out of hand such as the holdup of one of our convoys on the autobahn into west germany or the escalation of a local situation like viet nam or cuba or even panama fourth the madman theory of accidental war is viable while the key personnel controlling our weapons systems are carefully screened even the most stable men have been known to break under the tensions associated with such dreadful responsibilities suppose lee harvey oswald had been flying one of the nucleararmed patrol bombers we keep constantly in the sky near the borders of russia or skipper of one of the many polarisbearing submarines we have probing the oceans of the world a fifth type of accidental war may result from technological causes the failure of a machine to correctly assess a given situation and make the right response these are ways in which war may come by accident they do not take into consideration the constant presence of political frictions which could produce war by design all things considered we walk constantly on the edge of the abyss there is no moment of our lives in which we have a reasonable assurance that it will be succeeded by another the anxieties concomitant to such a state of continuing tension and uncertainty is robbing our lives of depth and meaning as we come to accept the inevitability of destruction we generate a value system consistent with this fact of existence while we wish to live in peace psychologically we are perpetually involved in war and we tend to live and express our lives as if life itself were vanity a monstrous joke perpetrated upon a people doomed to die we need a respite from the tension and anxieties of war our psychological orientation needs to be for peace fortunately the era of the big two standing eyeball to eyeball with pushbuttons in hand seems to be declining general u thant secretary of the united nations believes that there are certain unmistakable trends toward new alignments in the world setup there have been fluctuations and vicissitudes in the fortunes of the big powers he says my feeling is that in the seventies if there are seventies the world will witness four big powers the united states of america europe russia and china such a happenstance will signal the decline of russia and the united states to a position among equalsa rebalancing of power which if it does not make peace altogether impossible will at least obviate the standoff between the russians and ourselves our respective peoples the russians and americans deserve a respite from the neurosisproducing anxieties that have so long characterized our relationship as the military sponsors of east versus west our president has made it clear to the soviets that we have no wish to bury anybody and that we ourselves do not intend to be buried perhaps now in  we can get on with the matter of disengagement  internal peace the most crucial and sensitive problem confronting us today is internal peace the internal peace of this country is predicated upon our ability to reasonably control the violent rightwing extremism which is mushrooming in many of our towns and cities and to equitably resolve the racial issue which threatens to become universal throughout the fifty states at points these two social diseases come together in one foul malignancy but for the most part they represent separate infections which we shall have to fight and fight hard the rightwing extremists like the ku klux klan the white citizens councils the john birch society the socalled christian crusades and others of their ilk are all of a piece led by a handful of sinister expreachers sick retired generals befuddled candymakers and discredited politicians and followed for the most part by weakminded men frustrated housewives and little old ladies in tennis shoes their techniques are slanderous and undemocratic their stockintrade is hatred and suspicion the ends they pursue are diabolical and their danger to america is incalculable they are the kind of people who did the screaming and clawing and cursing at little rock and new orleans who were serpentine enough to dare to spit on a man like adlai stevenson in dallas and who created the climate of hatred and lawlessness that made the assassination of our president a routine expectation the racial situation in this country is not encouraging while some breakthroughs are registered here and there the fundamental patterns of this racist society have changed but little during  there were  protest demonstrations in the south alone  demonstrators were arrested there were thirtyfive bombings and ten people died under circumstances relating to racial protest the savagery we saw in birmingham was a distressing illustration of the bestial hatred characterizing the opposition to social change change is inevitable hatred or no hatred blood or no blood nowhere in the world are intelligent men and women willing any longer to accept subjection to anybody on the flimsy and irrational premise that skin color makes some people better than others the very idea is preposterous and the people who believe it are either ignorant sick or both it is past time for an enlightened america to discard these antiquatedegotistical undemocratic patterns of thinking and get on with the business of making the full range of the common values of citizenship available to all our people in the minds of twenty million determined negro americans discrimination is dead they have sought in every peaceful and reasonable way to communicate this idea to the bigots who keep the country in turmoil by setting themselves up as the racial arbiters of the public conscience but only concerned americans can make america truly democratic and only responsible americans can bring justice and order to this unjust and disordered society let america make haste it is considerably later than we think it has been said that the condition of the american negro is todays bitterest joke about freedom and justice well negroes stopped laughing a long time ago or hasnt anybody noticed
monday will be better
miss banks was a faj twit miliar sight five morn y £ ings a week to those living in the older section of town reflecting grand old houses with magnificent lawns sitting snobbishly back from the streets parents could set their clocks and hurry slowmoving children by the time they saw the little gray haired woman walking briskly to the lakewood high school three blocks away during the early spring and fall miss banks always wore a white sweater thrown over her shoulders no matter how warm the weather while carrying a bulging briefcase like a symbol guardedly by her side when the weather became cold and undeterminable miss banks would get out the old black ford of questionable age and drive slowly and too carefully down the streets hunched stiffly over the wheel in her somber black coat and shapeless hat this september morning if there had been those hurrying children or attuning their morning chores to miss banks passing they would have noticed she was ten minutes late and that her usual friendly face was set in a thoughtful mold looking neither right nor left to greet and return a warm smile for the first time in twenty years on the first day of school miss banks had a headache for one long week the ache had persisted in a dull monotonous form causing her to go mechanically through the normal routines of domesticity but on several occasions she had forgotten to feed the cat now as she moved along the streets the tense nervous feeling that had distressed her increased as she neared the school and saw them small groups of people milling around the sidewalk curiously watching the front entrance to the school the women some with metal curlers still entwined in their hair stood with small sleepyeyed children hanging to their cotton housedresses the men were separated into mengroups arms folded khaki baseball caps pulled low over stony leather faces a photographer was busy taking pictures stopping long enough to interrogate the figures standing like a small weaponless army the town police car was parked conspicuously along the street and to miss banks the one sign of normalcy was the orange school bus gliding to a stop when she appeared many turned recognized her as one who had taught them and now their children but they did not speak parts of their mutterings broke against her like muted clipped thunder the niggers come yet its a shame they got schools of their own why want to go to ours why indeed miss banks thought as she purposefully quickened her steps trying to avoid the multitude of gazes she knew or felt were following her no questions please she had no answersonly to her this was the most frightening and confusing time in her life never had she believed something like this would happen to affect her the town and the occupation which she had enjoyed all these years the morningclear and bright loomed large and ominous before her a witchs jeweled stone in her path at this moment she wished she was descending instead of climbing the steps to the sprawling brick schoolthe pride of the town when she entered the familiar odors of chalk sawdust cooking foods and pungent scents that were there last year and would be there years after she had gone assailed her she hurried down the hall to her room miss vladosk of courre was a tall blonde nicelooking girl who taught civics and algebra and had just been there one year goodmorning miss banks paused to smile at the young woman ohyoure late miss vladosk said looking curiously at miss banks to see whether some strange malady had caused this unusual occurrence theyre already in she went on in a whisper gesturing a little excitedly behind her dr robinson thought because of the crowd they should come in the side door now miss banks saw the colored girl sitting alone at the desk this meant the boy assigned her homeroom class was waiting toothere in her room ive been talking to her she heard miss vladosk go on her fathers a minister she seems to be a bright girla little shybut thats understandable yesof course miss banks felt a foreign dampness mist her forehead she extracted a kleenex from her purse dabbing lightly at the moistness its so warm for september the first day of school and i guess im not ready to be back in harness perhaps its time for an old tired woman like me to retire she smiled a tiny smile i think ill get a glass of water would you  watch my room until i get back the teachers lounge was thankfully empty and quickly she poured a glass of water from the refrigerator this she halfdrank ending by dumping the contents down the sink a bell sounded pealing shrilly in the room the first bell she had to get back she couldnt delay any longer he was seated directly in front of her desk he was large for his age and the ninth grade seat looked built for a lilliputian he was quite dark and his features swollen stiff black hair closely molded his head like a cap he wore a yellow sport shirt carefully creased brown slacks and polished shoes that looked new the hands gripping the notebook were large and strong looking the lined veins showing a tautness against the skin he reminded her of a painting she had seen of an african prince hanging in the museum she went back to her desk closed her purse in the drawer and did not look at him but at the memo from the principals office about books and supplies then she took out the paper to read the list of names belonging to her homeroom class given at fridays preschool teachers meeting you are james p johnson jr she asked still not looking at him yes maam his voice too was strong and thankfully before anymore could be or had to be said the second bell sounded like a cloudburst familiar students surged in a noisy stream through the halls and into the classroom ohhh look what we got smoky the bear chocolate drop miss banks heard them the muffled whispers which were not muffled at all experience told her she should say something pleasetone your voices down they came in filling up all the seats behind james p johnson until the last ones had to slump noisily in front behind and lastly beside him the third bell sounded school had taken in somehow she managed to get through the morning but each time she looked up there he was a big black splotch marring her view to her it was a little indecent this fly surrounded by milk she tried looking over him to the side of him but neither worked he was still there and then it occurred to her that she could do what she had always done with the masses of them by looking directly at him she found this worked best for then she did not see him at all at lunchtime she went to the cafeteria the colored were already there noticeably seated at a table by themselves four boys and three girls neatly dressed faces shining eating quietly carefully as if they had been cautioned to eat like that james p johnson joined them and now there were eight a representative group arent they miss vladosk sid sliding the tray beside miss banks i hear they were carefully screened by that negro organization miss banks tasted the soup which to her had the same flavor all these years mondayssoup meat loaf peas and milk but she had tea she brought her own bags and they had the hot water ready for her when she passed through the negro organization  think im going to enjoy this new experience miss vladosk said smiling i can learn from them and they from meperhaps learn from them what was there to learn from them miss banks thought wasnt that why they were here to learn from us suddenly there was a loud crash a tray had been dropped one of the colored girls bolted upright dress soaked with the hot soup there was a split deathly silence then riotous confusion peppered with the clanging noises of silverware and laughter splayed with boisterous catcalls miss vladosk was there before anyone it was the girl in her room the ministers daughter quickly she handed the girl napkins talking quietly to her as she did while she scanned without seeming to each face closest by miss banks watched her lead the girl out of the room the others at the one distinctive table continued to eat faces expressionless vaguely trying to disconnect the moment she wondered if they liked what they were eating later miss vladosk came to her door and the two of them stood outside talking in low tones we managed to get most of the soup off her dress miss vladosk said shaking her head enough for her to stay the remainder of the day dr robinson was adamant about that an accident miss banks murmured someones careless loud giggles from her room caused miss banks to stop and turn her students looked serene busily writing their assignment all but james p johnson who was looking slowly about him carefully searching each bent face his mouth was bruised in a straight line and his huge body showed signs of harsh rapid breathing an ugly blue stain trickled down and splotched the middle of his broad back inking the yellow shirt in an ugly zigzagging blotch bob miss vladosk whispered i saw that bob waller bob waller popular captain of the football team and son of layton waller president of the board miss banks squeezed her hands together nervously why after all these years did she have to be thrown into something like this the whole idea was ridiculous to  begin with you cant make people like what they dont want to like ive got to get back miss vladosk said miss banks sighed with unrestrained relief with miss vladosk gone she did not have to wring and twist with questions and possible threats she could simply ignore it as something she had not seen but she could not ignore james p johnsons face a mixture of bewilderment pain and anger if he were white he would have turned red with fury only he wasnt white he was black how can you tell if a black boy is angry when he cant turn red tuesday and the classes were the same little mounting incidents a sprawled leg a name dropped pushing deliberate avoidance the days following were alike until a month was over october came and the headache still persisted she found herself sleeping less at night forgetting to put the cat out moving around her house like a somnambulist the family doctor had given her some pills to quiet her nerves but even these she forgot to take finally with resigned defeat she decided to ask dr robinson to transfer her to another school the next semester it would hurt to leave lakewood where she knew everyone felt a part even of the pale green walls in her room leaving the students whom she followed with a maternal interest through life but why dr robinson asked seated behind the large desk in his office he was a thin slight man with penetrating blue eyes behind rimless glasses i need a change she said sitting tensely in the straight back chair pushing the mountainous papers and books aside he leaned intently towards her a changea change he murmured questioningly you know this is unusual miss banks you have been with us for years he paused keen eyes focusing steadily on her then softly is it because of the colored student she felt a flushness stealing over and warming her face in this period of transition were all experiencing the pains of adjustment but things never stay as they are and it is up to us educatorsmore than anybody to see that the change is steered carefully through intelligent guidance you arent the only one having difficulties the other teachers are going through what you are miss banks but they are accepting it as a challengenot as something to fear or run away from hewellhe rather frightens me she said looking away frightens youhow i dont know i cant explain her small white hands flailed the air like fluttering wings hes got two eyes two arms and two legs like everybody else hasnt he the wings fell and folded in her lap distilled lightly together she saw where the day was crisscrossed by the venetian blinds and thought barred like his mind he didnt understand he wasnt born and raised in this town like she had been her parents and parents before had helped to shape and build and make real the things the young ones and newcomers were now enjoyingthe library museum community house he didnt know or sense about the town and the people and the way it had always been tell me miss banks do you know anything about negroes what an odd question of course she knew about negroes who doesnt they lived in this town didnt they they lived across the tracks and she saw them downtown on the streets and working in the stores cleaning the floors and washing windows you must remember miss banks i was born only fifteen miles away from this town my town is similar to this town he said gently but nothing growing stays the same no nothing stays the same except the blacknessa gauntlet the albatross around the white mans neck as her father used to say i want you to please reconsider your request think through your problem many of the difficulties you and the other teachers are encountering can be smoothed out with patience and understanding  he stood up smiling down at her please dont hesitate to come in to talk anytime after school like youth deputized miss banks thought wryly miss vladosk stopped by her room how are you making out the older woman looked up from the pile of papers she was preparing to take home all right well miss vladosk began briskly after that soup business i gave all my civics classes a damned goodif i say so myselflecture on citizenship then to top that i assigned them a research paper to write on the subject an excellent idea why hadnt she thought of that tomorrow in her american history classes she would skip to the chapter on the united states a melting pot of nations it would be a start but by the next morning she decided they should finish the unit on the rise of political parties instead that afternoon as she listened to the students in her english section recite she thought i must call on him sometime hes been here two months and i havent called on him for a single recitation the time abruptly presented itself when unexpectedly his hand raised to finish the first verse from thoreaus poem love no other hand indicated the answer was known and because of that there was nothing else for her to do but say james p johnson she was  astonished by how easily the name came out the class was unusually quiet a movement unheard a breath unknown in anticipation of a wrong answer amazement or surprise that he could even speak she did not know he stood up tall and stalwart as a black warrior slowly he began to recite in a rich sonorous tone  let such pure hate still underprop our love that we may be each others conscience and have our sympathy from thence  she was not surprised that he was correct his papers were neat and accurate handed in on time more so than the others who had hundreds of social excuses when he finished she said quietly thank you looking down as she did she knew his gaze had not left her face always the eyes were like hot black beacon lights since the bizarre ink incident they seemed to haunt her deliberately focusing never wavering never shifting once when she felt them an uncontrollable urge to look up assailed her and when she did she glimpsed the hurt and confusion shining out novemberthe erratic football month to miss banksthe time when the school was in a fever to win the most important game of the season the homecoming game held on thanksgiving day the boys would practice all hours homeroom periods study periods after school and between classes she added quippishly if they could soldiers training for the great battle but this she was now resigned amending it by concluding extracurricular activities are too a part the month of november did bring cheer to miss banks this was the time when the class collected cans of food to make up holiday baskets for the needy and sick each class donated a basket to a family on a list which only the teacher knew the list was comprised mostly of colored and miss vladosk called it a time when guilty whites assuaged their consciences she scanned the sheet given her by the principal ordinarily she would simply check the next name on the list and send it on but when her eyes ran hurriedly down the page she recognized it immediately james p johnson sr pine street no house number simply pine street she knew the address from her registration book fantastic almost ordained this would be where the basket went a silent gift from the class for the first time in a long while she bebegan to feel enthusiastic about something she would see that the basket would be a very nice one onean ample one fit for a negro family unexpectedly she felt the urge to smile at james p johnson but when she looked up he wasnt there then she remembered friday afternoon he practiced for something or other the last hour of school ohyes football he too was engrossed in the battle of brawn she wished him here to see her smile lightened by her plans the burden did not seem so heavy now miss banks the class had been dismissed for the day james p johnson stood over her desk a black mass looking intently down at her my report card yesyes she said impatiently having just given them out i got two cs in both my classes under youamerican history and english so carefully she closed her books and neatly stacked papers in her briefcase what about it ive been making as and bs on my papers the other courses i got all as and bs your grades kept me off the honor roll anger flushed through her how dare him him she fumbled with the zipper to her bag keeping her eyes down james the word was so quiet and controlled that at first she wondered if she had spoken it at all you have been doing nicely however classroom recitation counts and when she did look up he was gone there was nothing where he had been and all she could think was he moves very quickly very silently for one so large as the days moved one into another miss banks found herself be comine more excited about the basket the collecting of cans almost became an obsession with her each day she reminded the class and like a miser she watched with a deadly concern the daily accumulation each student who brought in a donation received a free ticket to the schools friday movie by thursday when she gave the list a final check there were only two names left not contributing james p johnson and bob waller that bob so forgetful he could afford to bring in a hundred cans that afternoon just as school was dismissed bob waller came to her desk the room was noisy with students wrapped like happy eskimos bounding for the cold blustering day miss banks i almost forgot he said plunking two large cans on her desk these are james and mine a tiny chattering group leaving the room turned for a quick moment as one looking at them james yes mam you know how he leaves before anybody else he left it in his desk guess he forgot to give it to you she stared at the cans both peaches expensive brands and alike i see thank you bob slowly she scratched out their names bob waller and james p johnson as the days wore on there was a difference in the room she could  sense itthere was a difference they went through their routines recited handed in assignments conducted homeroom activities but there was something present not there before in their stiff overpoliteness attentiveness and not meeting of eyes and there was a difference with james p johnson more of the boys were talking to him now eating lunch with him being goodnaturedly friendly absently she turned away from the class and gazed out the window the day was bright and sunny but the air was cold and peculiarly she felt a little let down the annual thanksgiving day football game set the tones for the holiday season there was an ebullient expectancy in the air filling it with gaiety she told miss vladosk she would try to attend the game but to her of the most importance was getting the basket to the johnsons this one she intended to deliver herself instead of asking one of the men teachers early that morning she halfdragged and halfcarried the heavy basket to her car propping it in the trunk she drove slowly through town and across the tracks to where the colored lived only when she reached there she found herself getting lost in the tangled maze of dusty roads before she finally discovered pine street which looked exactly like dunbar avenue and jackie robinson boulevard sighing in desperation she pulled the car over to the curb and stopped a woman in a shabby black coat shuffled down the street slightly lopsided from the filled brown greasy bag she carried miss banks leaned cautiously over to the passengers side and called where do the johnsons live frowning the woman eased the bag to the pavement as if relieved that this one instant would excusably give her a rest johnsons which johnsons theres william johnsons a little ways down the street and the thomas johnsons over the james p johnsons ohthem johnsons bout a block down little white house direcly on the corner thank you the house wasnt too different from the others except the shutters had been painted recently and a sears stormdoor added she parked the car and got out to open the trunk grunting with effort she lifted the basket with both hands careful not to brush it against her tweed coat and started up the walk setting the burden down she rang the doorbell after an interminable time and no answer she knocked loudly thinking the bell was out of order the door finally opened and a woman asked yes quickly miss banks dragged the groceries past the woman into the house there she breathed looking up now to smile the woman was tall and dark and towered over her like a sharp angular peak there was no doubt this was james mother the same thick features only the lines were stronger and the dark eyes watching her were like depthless pools im miss banks james teach  er the womans eyes did not waver nor did she seem to breathe she was like an impassive statue compressed in brown mud when she did not speak miss banks continued hurriedly breaking the pronounced silence are you his mother yes well miss banks suddenly felt out of breath either from carrying the basket or the moment her gaze quickly scanned the room giving her time to free herself from the unbearable tension the living room served too as a dining room with an old horsehair sofa covered with a clean bedspread to preserve or hide it two overstuffed chairs and a round table ladened with james p johnsons school books she remembered the basket rushingly she explained but the more she talked a heavy curtain veiled the womans eyes like a babbling brook suddenly run dry miss banks stopped realizing she had said all she could until there was no more the room was soundlessthe basket strong between them the woman did not look at the basket only her then she spoke quietly hurriedly in a husky slurred tone my sons tolt me bout you miss banks oh and we dont need no basket not need the basket why how ridiculous the houseeven though it was neat and clean spoke of need but your name was on the list the woman drew herself up in a proud thoughtful line fo months my husbands been out of work they put us on welfare hes a good workera meckanic fo fifteen years he worked at browns garage not missin a day

school when night comes and we tired we look at our son  at that there table with his books and we aint tired no mo miss banks looked at the faded blue wall paper the books piled neatly on the table and back at the woman when she spoke her voice did not sound like hers at all wherewhere is james dont you know slowly she shook her head no she started to say should i no you wouldnt he tolt me how you look at him as if hes dirt how you said nothin when the ink was spilt on his shirt that it took me twodayswash to buy please her eyes searched the womans face pleading you must understand its hard for us toome how you think its been fo us miss banks the power of the woman overcame her she felt helplessweak unable to form the words which needed forming and there was still the question of the basket then suddenly the door swung open accompanied by bellowing whoops bob waller and three other boys she recognized came in carrying james p johnson like a king high on their shoulders he had to bend his head to keep from touching the door sill mrs johnsonwe won bob called triumphantly it was tied  and james broke the tie by scoring a touchdown altogether now fellows another yelled

of james p johnson im mighty proud of my son miss banks when his daddie gets home hell be proud too now james you help miss banks carry that there basket to her car miss banks saw him look down at the basket seeing it for the first time recognizing knowing he looked at his mother and the moment was long and deep and silent you can take it now james his mother said moving her eyes over and above

player i didnt do it all miss banks were a team she wanted to say more but there was nothing more to say she reached out and touched his hand it was warm and brown and firm ill see you monday yes mam hey james a boy called impatiently from the house com she drove off watching him in the mirror still standing there in the fast deepening twilight a motionless scarred figure and she knew monday would be better

in  richard wright   y just back from a fling  with communism cio  turned his attention once more t o the american scene and produced his powerful novel of social protest native son polished and poignant native son immediately became an archetype of literate negro expression in this country and the social protest novel seemed forever wedded to the expression of negro experience risking oversimplification at this point i think it fair to say that the part which the negro subsequently played in two international wars his tremendous migration into the more politically and economically sensitive cities and the succeeding supreme court decisions all tended to emancipate him from the burden of proving his legal and emotional rights to exist as an american in this country the protest genre still continued of course but now a greater scope came into the novel the novelist now began to examine himself as a man and an american as well as a negro and relatedly he began to examine america itself from a more assured and detached pointed of view and not from the emotional position of achingly desiring membership in it and finally he began to feel so much a part of itand so free to critically examine itthat he began to make major suggestions as to how to change the american society as a wholeand for its own betterment overlooking such negro novelists as frank yerby and john henry clarkemen who have either sought to renounce their negro identity by escaping into the purgatory of writing popular pseudohistorical romances or who have sought to transfer their search for identity to the foreign shores of th or th century africawe will concern ourselves here with the two major figures of contemporary negro fiction in america ralph ellison and james baldwin ralph ellison born in oklahoma city in  has written only one novel yet invisible man published in  and winner of the national book award for fiction of that year remains so exceptional a novel in its own rightand so monumental a breakthrough in subject matter and expression for the negro novelthat it alone has assured mr ellisons inclusion in the chronology of negro prose fiction invisible man then is a bildungsroman the search for both personal identity and social place by a young unnamed narrator at the same time because it is written by this narrator from a later perspective the novel features both removed exposition and involved narrative developing from this complex structure then we find a negro novel that achieves a new and exciting stature yet in order to see what is so new here perhaps we ought first look at what approaches the old traditionally the negro protest novel concerned itself with defending the negro from the stereotypes held by the white man and then with attacking the white man for this and any other sins or hypocri sies the writer could lay his hands on understandably enough invisible man does not wholly neglect this motif thus there is early in the novel one scene quite reminiscent of this naturalistic protest in it we learn of one jim trueblood a negro dirt farmer who has been guilty of incest with his eldest daughter the sin itself is treated environmentally the nights were cold husband wife and daughter all had to sleep together for warmth trueblood found himself in the midst of a racial dream in which a white man of the town symbolically says they just nigguhs leave em do it and the sin is committed why the daughter slept between husband and wife is never explained nor is it even examined and this i think is significant for it shows that this kind of environmental naturalism is not of great interest to ellison guilt and fault are not at issue here what concerns him more is how the fact of sin affects husband and wife family and negro community family and white community almost immediately we learn the results trueblood has been slugged in the head by an axe the angry extension of his wifes angry arm he understands and accepts this because it is the result of a personal involvement in the fact by his wife at the same time he does not understand the other two reactions principally because they do not represent any recognition of him as a distinct person thus on the one hand the negroes of the town reject him completely and offer to pay his way out of the area for good to them he is merely a disgusting embodiment of the immoral and stereotyped past whose stigma they labor day by day to wash off on the other hand it is the white community which comes to truebloods aid and though their actions are more humanitarian their motives are certainly baser for whites have a morbid curiosity about sex mr ellison seems to imply and it is to hear trueblood describe his sin in all its concreteness that the townspeople offer him jobs and the white state university sends recording interviewers in this world then only the axe at the end of his wifes arm is understandable to the common negro however what is of importance in invisible man is not only how irony rather than pathos plays through this naturalistic scene nor even how that irony is aimed at black and white alike but rather it is important to note the scarcity of such whiteoppressor negrovictim scenes for what is more fundamentally new in invisible man is a certain ironic detachment from the whole naturalistic question altogether and the substitution instead of a concern with white american society on its own terms and in a speaking voice favored by its own white critics such a newly ironic and detached position allows ellison to talk lightlyif pointedlyabout a grotesque widemouthed nigger piggybank with an enormous grin and large black outstretched hand as a piece of early americana just as it allows him to go a little deeper with this tone and quote an insane middle class negro who when laughed at by his fellow inmates for trying to change blood into money retorts i did too    i discovered it and john d rockefeller stole the formula from me further ellisons removed position of criticism permits him to dispose of wit altogether and with poignant sympathy quote an old foreman in a modern paint factory as he attempts to cling to an individual pride in the face of automation by asserting that we are the machines inside the machine but perhaps the best example of this new negro interest in american societyand this new position for discussing itis the southern small town night club scene of chapter one where the narrator is a boy of perhaps holden caulfields age led into the main ballroom he suddenly finds himself in the presence of a tall blond white woman dancing naked before the lustfully transfixed townfathers what the young narrator sees then is almost exactly what his salinger counterpart would have seen he notes a certain merchant who followed her hungrily his lips loose and drooling    and each time the blonde swayed her undulating hips he ran his hand through the thin hair of his head and with his arms upheld like  an intoxicated panda wound his belly in a slow and obscene grind this fascination is rampant among the local businessmen and the scene closes with a wild chase of the woman which ends with her being tossed around as college boys at a hazing it was mad the narrator tells us yet beyond this above the womans red fixedsmiling lips the narrator can see the terror and disgust in her eyes almost like my own terror and that which i saw in some of the other boys it is then a scene of general degradation handled in the mixed tones of disgust wit and compassion and this tone with its application to what becomes essentially a nonracial scene is reason enough for proclaiming invisible man a new novel at the same time it is equally true that ellisons most damaging  examination of contemporary commercial america is not made in the vacuum setting of a private allwhite nightclub at all but is instead made in the morning sunlight of the market placeespecially the negro marketplace thus he notes in his wanderings how a whole truckload of defective paint is shipped to a government project with the full approval of the dispatching foreman and more poignantly he describes in antic detail the insane negro inmates of the golden day tavern noting that many of the men had been doctors lawyers teachers civil service workers    who were supposed to be members of the professions toward which at variious times i vaguely aspired myself and he notes too the terribly mechanical way that a white philanthropist talks about helping the young narrator enter the american business world you are my fate young man    your school that has been my lifes work not my banking or my researches but my firsthand organizing or human life  you are important because if you fail i have failed by one individual one defective cog the white world then is essentially a mechanical cage which tries to fit the negro to its commercial ends should he seek to rise above his coglike stature here his world becomes the personal and social chaos of the golden day and its inmates however there are roles for the negro to play within the cage roles of adventure insight and subtlety that are open to him if he will only accept the fact of the cage and work within its confinements and it is the harsh and frank description of these roles which forms another first for invisible man there are in fact five roles open to the negro who recognizes and accepts the cage around him to begin with there is the passive dedicated hating as put forth by the narrators dying grandfather overcome em with yesses undermine em with grins agree em to death and destruction in short let em swaller you till they vomit or bust wide open equally violentthough much more boldly sois the life of the criminal which brings a certain power to a negros sense of identity thus looking at the office wall at his first job interview the narrator notes that the wall was hung with three portraits of dignified old gentlemen in winged collars who looked down from their frames with an assurance and arrogance that i had never seen in any except white men and a few bad razorscarred negroes a third role available to the enterprising and realistic negro is more expansive and spirited in its conception for it is not confined by a passive burning intensity nor is it recklessly defiant in its criminality it is simply amoral thus the ubiquitous rinehart in harlem isall at the same time and with no sense of conflictrine the calculating numbers runner rine the reckless gambler rine the briber rine the romantic lover of dozens and finally rine the reverend pastor of a holy way station which features a neon sign for its narthex and electric guitar for its choir for rinehart the world abounds with possibilities and he is equal to every one of them but perhaps the most devastating revelation of roles is the one portrayed by dr bledsoe the president of a small negro college calling the narrator into his office after the narrator has driven a white trustee to the trueblood shack dr bledsoe angrily asks for an explanation the narrator replies innocently enough that the trustee had ordered him to go ordered you    he ordered you dammit white folks are always giving orders its a habit with them why didnt you make an excuse    my god boy youre black and living in the southdid you forget how to lie lie sir lie to him lie to a trustee sir me he shook his head with a kind of anguish and me thinking id picked a boy with brain    didnt you   but i was only trying to please him   please him and here you are a junior in college why the dumbest black bastard in the cotton patch knows that the only way to please a white man is to tell him a lie what kind of education are you getting around here who really told you to take him out there he did sir dont lie to me i swear sir no one told me nigger this isnt the time to lie im no white man tell me the truth these then are the four basic possibilities within the cage at the same time though the narrator and mr ellisonhave found a fifth that of descriptive novelist with a certain pride in his inherited past i am not ashamed of my grandparents for having been slaves he tells us i am only ashamed of myself for having at one time been ashamed a proud enjoyment of describing and utilizing the past then marks the texture and meaning of invisible man for ellison himself his own negro identity is as much the expression of the novel as it is the subject of it thus the rhythm and shout of the holy roller revival the rhetoric of the political demagogue the ca dence of the hucksters pitch these are the sounds which form the vital background and meaning of the novel and the negros fifth role the enjoyment of negro rhythm and the fun of its sound the honest identity to be found in folk tale and slang as when the narrator summarizes the meaning of his negro high school education by envisioning himself receiving a diploma that reads simply to whom it may concern keep this niggerboy running these are the fruits of ellisons acceptance of his past and the tools with which he can fashion a role in society to transcend and utilize the cage which otherwise binds him he is still an invisible man to be sure but he is now able like louis armstrong to make poetry out of being invisible in  this marked a great new height for negro american fiction when we come to james baldwin now we come to a novelist who is an essayist also and this presents a problem for while this paper l primarily interested in discussion of the negro novel to overlook completely mr baldwins essays articles and interviews is to overlook the fact of his didactic and explanatory novelistic style for like the great majority of negro writers he is an author writing very much out of his experience with a mind intent on a message thus his essays and articles  can be very pertinent comments on his novels let us briefly take his three novels in chronological order now to see just what experiences baldwin generally draws upon and what sort of message he elicits from them the difference between invisible man and baldwins first novel go tell it on the mountain is that the invisible man as narrator is constantly wandering among social and political forces in the negros life while johns search in go tell it is one within the personal family the biblical set thine house in order is both haunting echo and essential theme here for go tell it is the semiautobiographical story of a young boy growing up as a negro in harlem under a father who is bitter against the world for its tyrannies yet equally tyrannical within his own household in his struggle with the night and pain and suffering then john chooses personal religious answers rather than social or political ones he becomes converted to jesus not to ellisons brotherhood or the naacp the answer is religious because the problem is seen in such personal terms yet actually the basic problem is the social one of a negro in a white world as well as the personal one of father and son and the point is that baldwin is asking his negro characters to set their house in order before they go out to eradicate the larger social evils of the world it is further interesting to note here i think that baldwin levels the same personal charge at the white liberal in america when he notes in a may  mademoisselle interview that they the liberals make no connection between what they do in nightclubs and what they say in print no connection between the ruin of their children and their public pronouncements clearly then this is a fundamental message for mr baldwin as both novelist and essayist just as the personal realm is the fundamental setting for his later two novels as well thus this same personal motif underlines and confines the movement and interests of his second novel giovannis room a story concerned with a uniqueto say the leastromantic triangle involving the choice between hetero and homo sexual love by an american expatriate in paris the point here is to notice just how personal and isolated this little drama is made by the novelist giovanni one side of the triangle is ostensibly a waiter yet we see him in the cafe only twice and neither time does his work impinge on his or ourconsciousness david is the american living on money from home and is so free of responsibilities and outside interests that when he finally decides to love  giovanni he is able to sit in giovannis room all day and play housewife and finally hella the second side of the triangle is a traveling womanoff to spain on unknown funds like a hemingway heroine in order to decide if she loves david thus this is a very romantic left bank vacuum in which these characters cogitate and love in another country baldwins last novel to date we are similarly immersed in a small groupthis time of new yorkers and their search for love both hetero and homo in the free setting of greenwich village and we find ourselves once more dealing with an economical dramatic structure confined to three pairs of lovers it is like a large family really especially since the characters are all so much alike and spend so little time outside the loving home of the novels message thus we find again that the central characters in the novel are as noticeably unemployed and uninterested in the world around them as was the case in giovannis room we see the musician rufus far more in bed and at parties than we do on the bandstand likewise vivaldo is a writer whom we never see write and never even overhear think about writing he does have a typewriter we learn but that seems to be only a prop for him to sit behind and muse on intimate problems this same vacuum effect is equally true of all the other characters as well just as the fact that  they all tend to think alike further serves to isolate the group as a whole a somewhat closer look at another country now is in order i think since it is a novel as strictly about love within a family as the first two novels but is one which also emphasizes an interracial element thus the critical dramatic question in the novel is seen in vivaldos question to eric hows one to get through it all how can you live if you cant love and how can you live if you do and the general answer comes when eric decides that he wished he could rescue her    and make her life less hard but it was only love which could accomplish the miracle of making a life bearableonly love    but more important than the general question and general answer here is that the specific answer to this question is ida a vivacious harlem girl whose final marriageofsorts to vivaldo provides the novel with its only happy union and saves vivaldo from the chaos as eric sees it of those lovers who are not needed by the ones whom they need yet salvation from personal chaos is not all that ida brings for she is also a social symbol as well as a personal character thus despite his general personal motif in the novel baldwin does give us an overall social message his thesis then briefly stated runs something like this american today is essentially a dying corrupted society hence the question for the negro is do i really want to be integrated into a burning house or as baldwin more pointedly puts it in his essay down at the cross i am far from convinced that being released from the african witch doctor was worth while if i am now    expected to become dependent on the american psychiatrist thus the negroin the figure of idais now intellectually free of the dominance of the white american mind and its values the only thing white people have that black people need or should want baldwin says in the same essay is powerand no one holds power forever at the same time the negro is still an american physically by accident of history and emotionally as well he feels himself very much an american now because the laws of the land and the temper of the people are making him so hence baldwins tone in i accuse my country and my countrymen and also because he has within his past and present the warmth and stamina to supply the redeeming virtue for this american society personal christian love on the one hand this is a love which produces truth and which thereby takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within and on the other hand it is the compassion in the negro to wait while the white world is adjusting to this truth thus baldwin writes to his nephew in my dungeon shook please try to remember that what they believe as well as what they do and cause you to endure does not testify to your inferiority but to their inhumanity and fear    there is no reason for you to try to become like white people and there is no basis whatever for their impertinent assumption that they must accept you the really terrible thing old buddy is that you must accept them and i mean that very seriously you must accept them and accept with love for these innocent people have no other hope they are in effect still trapped in a history which they do not understand and until they understand it they cannot be released from it ? this understanding of love then and the position from which it is offered to american society mark baldwins basic contributions to americanand negro american literature for if ellison emancipated the protesting negro novel by his honest expression of the possibilities within the cage and attempted as well to transcend the cage altogether by his tone of wit and compassionate scorn baldwin has completely turned the cage around and has pictured the white world as trapped within its past history and its present preconceptions thus the cage is on the other foot as it were and the negro is now on the outside looking in only he is looking in with a greater compassion and sensitivity that the white man ever looked in with thus not only is the negro emancipated from his cage but he has attained the even greater staturemoral and religiousof being the free man concerned about the horrible lostness of the prisoner at his most noble then the negro is americas compassionate saviour bringing love to a cold dying society and at his worst he is a caustic critic sarcastically visiting the sick and shut in this is a reversal indeedand marks the highest stage of freedom and assurance the modern negro novel has yet attained
in volume  of index to court cases of cal£ laway county on  page  for the october  term is plaintiff the state of defendant celia a slave file no  and in the closely written pages of file no  there lies a story of violence passion and tragedy it is a story of aged lust of youthful ravishment of blighted birth of jealous betrayal of frenzied destruction of retribution delayed but when it came conclusive and of death on the gallows for a nineteen year old girl whose execution was postponed until after she gave birth to the child of the man whom she had slain and whose body she had caused to be consumed by fire the background of this tragic action was human slavery which had endured in this country for nearly two hundred and fifty years but which was in  nearing its legal although not actual close as an institution it had long been under attack because of it unbearable tensions had developed and the nation would soon be cleft in twain in callaway county there were approximately  negro slaves and  free negroes as compared to a white population of some  the fear of a negro insurrection while probably groundless was then a haunting everpresent fear and led to acts of cruelty and oppression which were unnatural and perverted this story properly begins with celia a negro slave girl who in  was about fourteen years of age and who was living presumably with her slave parents in audrain county missouri at that time she was purchased by robert n  a callaway county farmer who was then some seventy years of age and a grandfather he was a large landowner appears to have been welloff financially was of good standing in his community and was an active churchman with him lived his married daughter virginia w  her husband and their two children and an unmarried daughter mary his wife had been deceased since july  his two married sons lived in the neighborhood almost immediately after purchasing celia robert n apparently began to have carnal relations with her on this point colonel jefferson f jones  testified at her trial in  cant say positively whether celia said that deceased had forced her on the way home from audrain county have heard that he did but do not know with certainty whether she told me so    regarding the relationship between master and slave in the years following the return to callaway county colonel jones continued she said the old man had sexual intercourse with her her second child was his celia lived with her children in a cabin about sixty steps from the home of her master some four hundred yards farther on was the family burying ground where negroes and whites were interred near together as was the general custom with celia from time to time and surreptitiously there also lived the young negro man george for whom celia evidently had a strong affection george bitterly resented the periodic intrusions of the white master on this point colonel jones testified she said that george had told her that he would have nothing more to do with her if she did not quit the old man this she evidently greatly wanted to do and finally didat the price of her life we come now to the day and to the night of june   celia for some months had been pregnant and perhaps as a result of her pregnancy ill according to virginia w  celia had been sick took sick in february had been sick ever since had been unable to work since february william powells testimony threw additional light on the relationship of celia and her master she said she threatened that she would hurt him if he did not quit forcing her while she was sick i do not know what her condition was as to health had heard she was sick do not know that she was pregnant judge from her appearance that she was she said she did not intend to kill him virginia w further testified i saw my father in the evening june  about twilight reading at a window we all went to bed leaving him in the room he slept in the room he was reading in on the following morning robert n was missing from his home the search instituted by his family was joined by neighbors concerning it virginia w stated record pagewilliam powell further deposed after looking about him i asked his negro boy where he thought he was he stated that he did not believe it was worthwhile to hunt for him anywhere except close around the house for he had reasons to believe he was not far off from the statements of george i believed he had been destroyed in the negro cabin with this information by george the final destruction of celia was assured powell who appears to have been a vigorous crude callous sharpminded individual further testified
a passionate plea for civil_rights 
it is true that prejudice exists in the minds and  hearts of men it canej not be eradicated by  aw but j firmy be y lieve a sense of fairness and good will also exists in the minds and hearts of men side by side with the prejudice a sense of fairness and good will which shows itself so often in acts of charity and kindness towards others this noble characteristic wants to come out  it wants to and often does win out against the prejudice law expressing as it does the moral conscience of the community can help it come out in every person so in the end the prejudice will be dissolved this bill has deep moral implications for the individual and his society for this reason we have seen in recent months an unparalleled show of support for the bill by the religious leadership of america    when religious leaders call on us to urge passage of this bill they are not mixing religion and politics this is not a political issue it is a moral issue to be resolved through political means religious leaders can preach they can advise they can lead movements of social action but there comes a point when persuasion must be backed up by law to be effective in the field of civil_rights that point has been reached mr president others have discussed the specific provisions of this bill with more skill than i possess the constitutionality of the bill has been affirmed by the most eminent lawyers in the land but there are some points in each of the major sections i would like to stress the purpose of title i the voting section is to accomplish the aims of the voting rights sections of the civil_rights bills of  and  had congress known then the weaknesses in those sections i believe these provisions would have been added at that time we learn by experience the civil_rights division of the department of justice under the outstanding leadership of burke marshall has labored for three years to do the job assigned it by the prior legislation its small squadron of attorneys have worked long and hard but every possible legal barrier has been thrown in its path to win after protracted litigation the right to vote in an election held a year ago is no victory the right to vote in federal elections must be enforceable at the time of the election to have any meaning the barriers to the right to vote were taken down in my state over  years ago the difference between our social and economic groups have been settled peacefully at the ballot box the way they should be in a democracy it is argued that title vii can only make jobs for negroes by taking them away from whites the same accusation was thrown at the irish in massachusetts in the s the argument is groundless in america because it assumes a stagnant economy we have always had a dynamic jobcreating economy the new income spent  by new job holders has created more demand and more jobs in a great upward movement of growth and prosperity mr president this is not a force bill there are no fines or criminal penalties on the contrary the bill abounds with reasonableness with conciliation with voluntary procedures with a moderate approach towards its goals the public accommodations section covers only those types of establishments where discrimination works the severest hardship even these types are exempt if they are small enough so that their integration would disturb the owner in his private life the voting section covers only federal elections it uses the procedures of the courts it creates not special privileges but only tries to prevent irreparable injury the education section creates no new rights the department of justice would be able to sue only to enforce what the constitution already requires the federal program section is equally moderate funds could only be denied to programs where discrimination is practiced other funds could not be affected the procedures under this section must conform to the standard of due process of notice and hearing of the administrative procedures act and the employment section is equally mild companies would have adequate time to comply with its requirements the fair employment commission has no sanctions of its own but must look to the courts for enforcement of its orders    in short the bill emphasizes not new rights but remedies of existing rights not coercion but voluntary compliance not the heavy hand of the federal government but the evenhanded justice of the courts of law with provisions as mild as these it can truly be said that even in passing this bill we are still relying primarily on the decency and the tolerance and the conscience of the american people to secure these rights for negro citizens in conclusion mr president there are some personal reasons why i am so interested in passage of this bill as a young man i want to see an america where everyone can make his contribution where a man will be measured not by the color of his skin but by the content of his character as one who has a special concern with the emerging nations of africa and latin america i have seen what discrimination at home does to us in those countries i want to see america respected there and finally i remember the words of president johnson last november th no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor president kennedys memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil_rights bill for which he fought so long my brother was the first president of the united states to state publicly that segregation was morally wrong his heart and his soul are in this bill if his life and death had a meaning it was that we should not hate but love one another we should use our powers not to create conditions of oppression that lead to violence but conditions of freedom that lead to peace it is in that spirit that i hope the senate will pass this bill
