theres too much hypocrisy on civil_rights
i think the time has come for some plain £ speaking on the prob lem of civil_rights words have a way of losing their fundamental meaning through overuse for instance the words freedom democracy and security lose the strength of meaning with repetition and so we find that when people speak of civil_rights they seem to be saying it in a rather casual way one gets that sort of feeling when listening to some of these heated discussions on civil_rightsthat too many of the people dont quite mean what they say or dont quite know what they mean they have carried from their early school years an acceptance that civil_rights is a basic right of all the people they regard civil_rights which is another word for human rights as something that they are of course for and that every decent person must be forand there can be no question about their position on it unfortunately this ready acceptance all too often blows sky high when some of these same people become involved in a civil_rights matter in a personal way at such a time they come face to face with the problem of what amounts to a separation of attitudes on the one side is the right of privacy and all the many privileges that go with it such as the choice of company choice of club choice of friends and whatever social categories with which one elects to associate but on the other side is the attitude they are obligated to practice outside their homes and clubs here their freedom is subject to the other peoples rights and public policy here rights to free action must be accommodated to the rights and freedoms of othersand anyone who would refuse to go along with that commitment is going against the current of american present day thought and action again our rights of privacy and the privileges of free social choices we may enjoy in our homes are inviolateand there we can do and say as we please but when we are out in public and deal in such areas as public  transportation public parks public schools hospitals housing and such our rights are limited to where they do not infringe on the rights of others regardless of the color of their skin or what neighborhoods they come from in the eyes of the law and under our system there are no levels or degrees of privilege the protection of the dignity and freedom of one man is as sacred as that of the next man if we are to enjoy all the benefits of equality there can be no special publicly privileged class or any discriminations there are those among us who are still afflicted with the prejudices and primitive hostilities of a bygone age which transcend their other good intentions and good qualities for example whom one eats with or where is a personal choice whom one invites to his home or private club that is a social matter and it is of no concern to the community but when it comes to public places and facilities involving the health education and economic opportunities of all the people thats something else again there is no room here for prejudice bigotry or special pleading and no unfair discrimination personal likes or local hostilities should bar any citizen and that means every citizen regardless from obtaining an education seeking any job he is capable of holding and being entitled to a decent place in which to live and to bring up his family in considering the broad question of civil_rights some of us tend to confuse our likes and dislikes with what is right and wrongand as a matter of fact in our public behavior toward our fellow citizens as well as to mankind everywhere it is necessary to understand and practice to do what is right and not what we happen to like or not to like too often the things we either like or dislike turn out to be wrong so what we must understand is that we are dealing with the differences of right and wrong and what amounts to the difference between fair treatment or mistreatment of our fellow man as james m barrie expressed it the secret of happiness is not doing what one likes but in liking what one has to do from the early beginnings of our history we as a nation have been dedicated to the belief that all men are created equal and that differences of race color religion or national origin should not be cause to deny anyone equality of treatment and equality of opportunity this nation has been from its very beginning a haven for the oppressed of other landsand surely we cannot tolerate oppression in our own land we have managed to produce a highly successful and stable society under our system of government in preserving a free and open society to help maintain that way of life we need to balance our personal liberties with group authority for practical purposes we operate generally under a majority rule procedure but we learn from past history that majority rule if unrestrained could lead to tyranny and oppression the founding fathers understood this very well they made sure this would not happen when they provided for the protection of the dignity and liberty of the individual by attaching a bill of rights to the constitution this made it a matter of the basic organic law of this nation that all would enjoy freedom of worship freedom of peaceful assembly and equal participation in the choice of government on all levels the question naturally arises as to why we are continuing to experience resistance from some quarters in putting into full working practice these rights which we have been duty bound to do for over one hundred years perhaps one of the answers is that under our thin coat of company manners we are preoccupied with selfishness in other words we are still living by a double standard there are in every community the social snobs the economically overprivileged the selfserving political bigots to whom human rights are revolutionary subversive words these are people with special problemsand we understand them for they regard themselves above the crowd but i find it difficult to understand some of those able and intelligent men who speak for those southern states in a manner truly representative of those statesand surely not of these times if their hard unyielding position on the civil_rights bill is the customary delaying action and yet another contest to defer the inevitable i think these men are badly mistaken and are hurting the nation where it is most damaging i would hope that they would choose instead to cooperate with the inevitable and hasten the day when as a united nations we can pursue many other urgent tasks which need to be dealt with for the security of the nation we have had all the sectionalism and needless local rivalries we can stand we have enormous tasks ahead of us to meet threats from without without having to weaken our position by senseless divisions among ourselves we are flanked by two gigantic powers one on each side of us communist russia and red china they are driven by a fanatical zeal to impose their archaic system on the rest of the world they are determined to destroy us if we fail to resolve the issues of civil_rights between states and the federal government we shall surely be extending the new tyrannies a helping hand we are faced with many complex internal problems which will tax our courage and intelligence for many years to come one of these serious problems has been developing in our industrial centers where chronic unemployment is rapidly reaching a critical stage due to the growth of automationthe machine age another crisis is developing on our farms where mechanization is  resulting in a great new productivity and an ever diminishing farm force these men on the farm added to the men in the factories who are being displaced by machines should not be dismissed as unfortunate casualties of the industrial age and abandoned to a life of tragic idleness for which they were in no way responsible i know of no area of public concern that requires more urgent attention than the need to find new ways and areas into which to channel these millions of unemployed where they can be restored to usefulness and productivity where they can retain their dignities as gainfully employed members of our society then there is the as yet unsolved problem of how we are going to meet our responsibility for guarding and protecting the publics health this has been put off too longmostly for no good reason we should be concerned with the problems of health as they affect the lives of all of our people the life and health of each of us must be regarded as equally important to all of us there continues to be a serious maldistribution of doctors nurses technicians and facilities in all fields of medical care every industrial nation in the world has seen to it that this need which could not be left to discretion and control of privately organized medicine had to be supported by a nationally sponsored program yet in this country regarded as the most advanced of nations we are being held back from adopting a program of general welfare by the faulty logic of organized pressure groups which make no more sense than the arguments advanced by those who would deny all citizens their civil_rights these are no longer partisan political problemsthese go beyond political debate the time for that has long passed we have put off action far too long it is over sixteen years since i proposed to deal with the problem of civil_rights during my presidency at the time i directed the military to abolish segregation and proposed to the congress to enact a civil_rights program we have been trying to advance that cause step by step but it has been painfully slow i hope that we can now proceed to put into effect the comprehensive program now before the congressso that w we can get on with the many other urgent tasks before us we have had too much talkit is time for action 
the negro americas abstract man
until a few years ago a favorite game of mine went something like this id make a mental listing of all the generalizations american white people were known to entertain about negroes then proceed in my every contact with them to behave just the opposite at first glance this would seem old hat for a large number of american negroes already act out this role and its necessity has remained one of the real tragedies in their daytoday relationships with whites but my game was subtler more confounding i would take the reverse stereotypes and in turn reverse them without somehow returning to the starting place thus where many negroes were supposed to be officious and over dressed i strove to be relaxed and casual or where i was expected to covet things like automobiles i made it quite clear my values lay elsewhere the reward for this absurd behavior was of course to watch in delight while the white mans carefully constructed universe crumbled beneath him a spectacle i still find extremely gratifying and compelling there was however still another more urgent motive the desire to somehow convince my fellow american that i was in the final analysis just a human being not a victim or a moral or a clause in the constitutionbut a plain old natural phenomenon like him and this is where it ultimately failed me this little game of mine i was a private in the army a friendship developed with a fellow soldier from boston and the matter of his whiteness and my negroness couldnt have seemed more remote for our relationship was based on a sound enough premise a likeness of background and temperament then one day the training ended and the discussion as army discussions will fell to the matter of womenin this case the female population of the little white community near the installation it was then that i made an amazing discovery that in the mental world of this intelligent perceptive and socially conscious young person i existed in a fantastic manner one as strange and eerie as all the re gions of the mind on the one hand in our relationship was my immediate self a kindred spirit with whom he talked and drank and damned the army while on the other hand was the negro i stood for something different altogether something vast impersonal and ultimately terrifying and to be dealt with independently it was then i discovered what every american negro must eventually discover and try to accept that defy the stereotypes though i may confound to my hearts content all his neat generalizations nothing i really said or did or thought of myself could ever begin to destroy that carefully designed pattern of thought that appears so vital to the american white man in his view of the negroa view that has become less a representation of the real world than a myth a symbol an abstraction and which is at the very root of what we call the race problem for we are of course ducking the real issue if we deny that the only possible reality of this persisting question is its existence in the minds of the majority population thus nothing will be solved so long as we persist in employing the abraham lincoln approach in place of the more realistic more painful freudian frame of reference but history has nonetheless assigned statesmanship to the task and a great deal of the negros rage i think springs from his dim awareness that this is a deliberate scapegoat and it no more represents the real confrontation between himself and american race prejudice than the imposition of social reform as a cure for paranoia for the th century american negro obviously is less a man than an idea to his countrymen he is firstly the negro and only secondly the physician the socialist the bastard or simply mr jones should he write a book of win a nobel peace prize or climb a flagpole in his undergarments it is invariably noted that a negro has done these things somehow not an american somehow not a man it is this abstraction moveover which renders him so easily a victim to injustice and atrocity that he is somehow not a fleshandblood human presence like bill jones next door but a vast impersonal lifeless abstraction and even his countrymens acts of good faith are thereby suspect offered as they invariably are on the basis of justice freedom or one of the other noble principles which testify so plainly so offensively to the impersonal manner in which he addresses himself to the negro it is this abstract approach i think which is the basis of james baldwins reference to the white mans impertinent assumption that he must accept you an assumption that dodges altogether the all too obvious fact that it is he not you who is in need of salvation this assumption be it noted is far from conscious so that when an american says he believes in the intrinsic equality of the races more often than not he is telling the truthso far as his conscious faculties tell him it is true but cast away the abstractions allow one of those intrinsically equal beings of his own accord to behave as such allow one to say establish a more than casual relationship with a white female a perfectly natural phenomenon even negroes often forget between animals of like species and opposite sex or to aspire to goals outside his reservation to exercise his intrinsic right to live where he chooses seek the neighbors friends inlaws of his own sovereign choice allow one to even exhibit a little more than middling intelligence sensibility valor insofar as these exist outside his own restricted category of the universe outside the abstractions in short allow one to behave in any way as though he too believed in his intrinsic equality and had determined to arrange his life accordinglyand something quite remarkable takes place within his countryman something that defies all his rationalities something as old as the civilization of europe let us cite a few examples of this abstract approach and how conveniently it masks the real confrontation between negroes and whites there is for example the case of congressional representative adam clayton powell whose petulant words they never forgave me for leaving the plantation stirred up such indignation a few years ago irrelevant was the outraged replyand irrelevant they most apparently were as a defense of the charge at hand some infraction or other of the code by which congressmen supposedly behave yet not ultimately irrelevant the fact is that of the some  americans who make up our national house of representatives powell has remained by far the most intimidated and harassed and relevant or irrelevant his complaint invoked a basic truth about the attitude of nearly all american whites to just about all american negroes an attitude held over from the feudal days of our country when their universe was quite differently constructed so that even today it is one thing for a negro to become a congressman and address himself to the affairs of this country as though they were in some measure his affairs too but quite another thing for that same negro to claim a committee chairmanship and to marry a caucasian and    and  but powell is the happy exception here for the most tragic effect of all of the abstract approach and its resulting ghetto has been its awful stain on the negros own psychology how he looks at the universe and his place in it while still a soldier i happened to be passing a weekend in st louis the local negro ywca had been conducting weekly dances for servicemen in the area and a companion and i had planned to attend as we often did during our excursions to the city this time  however we were informed the program was discontinued and advised to try the downtown y which had a similar recreation now you would have to have been born a negro in america and reared in a ghetto to have attended segregated schools churches social clubs to have planned your entire future your marriage your job where you intended to live all in accordance with the fact that you were indeed a negro in order to understand the genuine mental crisis this prospect caused my companion as far as he was concerned this boy out of a northern ghetto the evening was overfor the downtown branch was white and we who were not white did not really belong there and there ultimately is the productthe final grotesque product of one of the most sustained and unrelenting systems of racial quarantine in the history of western civilization and all the more merciless for its good faith for its smiling american camaraderie and goodfellowship a situation that renders frustrating even mental protest one so carefully cloaked in abstractions the victim often loses sight of what it really implies about his utmost being as it turned out he happened to be right my prudent friend for no sooner had i arrived and completed the first dance than i was approached very respectfully by a gentleeyed middleaged woman whom i took to be the hostess and given a remarkable offer if for some reason i was not having a good time she would be only too glad to refund my moneyfifty cents in this case of course i assured her i was having a tremendous time and appreciated her concern what i then asked was the cause for this concern this was obviously unexpected and for a split second i think she was compelled to look squarely at the situation well she said at length recovering as it were her frame of reference to be perfectly frank its    difficult for the girls to dance with you    before the implication of this could sink in she quickly began the old spiel about tradition and attitudes and eventual understanding and the other cloaks behind which such white people hide the remarkable distress of their inner lives and there followed that smile that nervous distraught american smile that every reasonably sensitive negro has felt in his deepest entrails to be the most rending insult of them all you understand dont you she beamed appealing oddly to my reason but what was i really to understandthat i was a kind of subhumanthat i was somehow a shameful natural phenomenon whose very presence in human traffic heralds disaster this i was unready to understand moreover this is not at all what i was called upon to understand by regarding me fundamentally as an issue and not a kindred human being she was quite unable to see the appalling reality of her offer she was not humiliating a fellow human being an american soldier in uniform she was upholding moderation in the mixing of the races and in that regard her conscience was completely untouched this incident is important not only because of its ghastly testimony of the nations foremost spiritual sicknessand one which ultimately will defy any ratiocinative solutionbut because it indicates how subtly its real face has been hidden behind issues behind abstractions the antagonist be it noted was no ruffian who is much more easily dealt with but one of those christianly matronly types one often finds around ywcas and other institutions of good work the kind that raises such a sincere fuss over racial atrocities in the south the kind even to perhaps actively protest some particularly odious injustice yet who herself was able in all good faith to inflict an atrocity every bit as inhuman in its own way as a mississippi lynching not all such insults are so obvious some are less immediately felt yet ultimately just as destructive as one of those glaring we reserve the right  notices that so impersonally rob the american negro of his human legacy and place him in a special category of the species as a newspaper reporter in washington d c i was assigned one day to cover a hearing by the house unamerican activities committee subpoenaed were a dozen or so u s students and young adults including paul robeson jr son of the negro concert singer who defected to europe the group had been accused of antiamerican demonstrations at the russiansponsored  world youth festival in vienna and included the usual array of bearded youths and ponytailed coeds actor yul brynner happened to be in the audience and the entire assembly as is often the case at hu ac sessions was rather a gay festive theater gathering to these merry young people robeson contrasted sharply a sober mannerly youth in plain suit and tie his protest was very different from theirs less theoretical more immediate we talked several minutes before the hearing with robeson and his counsel explaining the details of their case suddenly the lawyer glanced at me and asked of course youre from the afroamerican a more conventional phrasing might have been what newspaper do you represent or something but no offense was taken at least not by me beneath his calm reserved exterior the youthful and sensitive robeson had recognized it for what it was another case of the american need to classify to categorize of the sort that perhaps had sent him off to vienna in the first place and falling so carelessly from the lips of the very person assigned to defend his protest a lawyer of no small reputation locally as a champion of negro causes robesons resentment was infectious and so as to make at least a middling comeback i rejoined of course youre from the aclu american civil liberties union childishness perhaps but maybe not consider such assumptions multiplied a thousand times dominating the negros every encounter with whitesreflecting a vigilant awareness not only of the obvious differences of appearance often of dialect etc but some kind of cosmic difference decreeing that the negro journalist is really less a journalist than a negro journalist or that an american leader who happens to be a negro is necessarily a negro leader and so on in short decreeing that the negro is fundamentally an abstraction and only secondarily a man hollywood has helped sustain and therefore contributed to this national illusion by keeping the negro an abstraction at first glance it would almost seem contrived remembering that one out of ten americans is a negro it is difficult to otherwise explain his almost complete absence from any account of american life outside of those which involve him in the abstract as an issue or as a shadowy servant there is of course no conscious contrivance this is simply the only manner in which the negro impresses himself on the average american not that he would consciously make the exclusion it simply would never occur to the ordinary casting director to launch a film in which the protagonist or the villain or any minor character just happened to be a negro in the sense that the bank teller just happened to be bald or the private detective just happened to be wearing a checkered overcoat it simply would never occur to him that any negro had a thing at all to do with life in america other than slavery oppression intermarriage passing or one of the other insulting abstractions with which he identifies nonwhites in general and negroes in particular of course it might be argued that hollywood didnt create the world least of all america that in american life the negro does by and large pose some problem or other either of his own making or the white mans that he is not just an american just a man yet this argument when really examined reflects still another of the limitless assumptions with which the american white man addresses himself to the negro does it raise the question for instance as to whether the negro considers himself anything beyond or below an american a man i personally know many negroes who qualify as americans to an almost alarming degree who are just as freeenterprising and castrohating as the most provincial midlander who share the national pride fears and myths with every bit as much fervor as any daughter of the american revolution and yet they are not really americans for they in no way exist as such in the minds of their countrymen a feature of the current emancipation commemoration has been the vogue among orators to cite the all too obvious fact of the negros continued enslavement but only the sharpest insights most notably james baldwins have pointed to the far more pertinent factthat negroes are enslaved in turn by slaves the american white man is bound to a system at best pragmatic even in its heyday and which now lives on as a useless and imbecillic relic grotesquely dictating his psychology with the same inevitability it did in  as for the intervening century it goes without saying that had normal developments taken place there would be no negro problem in the first place for the perfectly logical reason that there would be no negro except in the purely biological sense the normal cultural giveandtake would have swallowed up the negro into the mainstream of american life in exactly the same manner the absence of such barricades has liquidated the italian and to a lesser degree the jew and even the prospect of a negro attaining the presidency itself would raise as few eyebrows as say the election of a descendent of irishmen the late john f kennedy the difference of course has been the extraordinary antiamalgamation theory and its lingering influence on the white mans psychologyan influence that compels him to look at his fellow citizen not as the fleshandblood phenomenon that he is but as a huge lifeless and menacing abstraction to be dealt with accordingly now of course this system has not been entirely destructive isolated from mainstream values the american negro has been spared many of the more notorious characteristics of the th century american white man including what has been coined as the cult of conformity and its attendant mediocrity of outlook and poverty of soul they have remained indeed part of that great nonwestern world which from all visible indications is about to resume its proud chapters in history the american negro denied the decadence of prevailing manners barred from the appalling comforts of the suburbs has retained a kind of equilibrium a kind of easy serene skepticism born of healthy privation and lack of powers illusions nor can one who has grown up in the ghetto fail to appreciate its own peculiar lorenot just jazz and good times but a kind of realistic and very nonamerican way of reckoning with this terrifying world these things speak well for the ghetto but they in no way justify it for quite apart from its poverty and consequent crime and moral laxity is the harsh psychological effect of the ghetto on a people who realize that for some unexplained reason they are forced to live their the  entire lives in quarantineor in a special category of their countrymens mind commenting on the soulless nature of unsleeping history as apart from the human souls who nonetheless make that history the late aldous huxley has made this point when such institutions are left to their insomnia when they are permitted to function according to the laws of their own being subordinating individual insight to collective tradition they become madnot like an individual lunatic but with a solemn traditional and systematic madness that is at once majestic and ludicrous grotesque and terrifying and who can fail to see the wide chasm between institutionalized american racial attitudes and the insight of the average individual american who nonetheless contributes to and sustains that institution every waking hour of his life the real tragedy of course is not mississippi or any isolated area or event in the whole of the system isolations which really provide only convenient scapegoats by which the system can escape the menace of selfreckoning the real tragedy is that  million civilized vigorous and apparently talented people are being lost to historysimply because their country is terrified to look at them and find out who they really are
chinn is one of jr the footnotes of his  tory a lovely phantom  who has eluded all but l fc fc w  a the professional historian a beautiful skeleton rattling around in the closets of political greatness in the era of andrew jackson she was as important as the scandalous peggy eaton but today her name exists only in a few musty old county records and in the longforgotten accounts of the election of  who was she who was this lady who was talked about behind the closed doors of washingtons female society who was ignored publicly as though she did not exist and yet was directly the cause of the collapse of the political career of one of the countrys outstanding liberals julia chinn was the common law wife of richard mentor johnson vicepresident of the united states during the first administration of martin van buren julia chinn was the second lady of the land in the period preceding the war between the states and a negro many southerners of this period had relationships with their female slaves many raised backyard families but these relationships were always pseudoclandestine their white wives were always obligingly blind to their husbands extramarital activity not so richard mentor johnson he could not marry julia legally but he took his obligations to his wife and two children seriously and treated them with every courtesy and consideration he was proud enough of his daughters to try to introduce them to washington society to use his influence to gain them acceptance in the ballrooms and banquet halls of the socially illustrous what a stir he must have created one account tells of how he was refused permission to seat his daughters on the reviewing stand where he had been invited as guest orator the girls waited in the carriage while he spoke as soon as he had finished his speech he strode from the platform and drove off angrily with them ignoring the rest of the program and the festivities held in his honor how naive is the historian who writes that richard mentor johnson never married and then proceeds to give an account of how he deeded to his children money and property and slaves legend has it that richard johnson had fallen in love with a poor seamstress and had been refused permission by his mother to marry the girl because of her lowly position in a fit of pique he took on the arrangement with julia a lovely slave who had been raised by his own mother whatever his motivation he accepted the alliance with solemn devotion was he a great man the people of kentucky would have responded with a violent negative his socalled doctrine of amalgamation exemplified by his own marital arrangements offended them to their peculiarly chivalrous senses he would have been more of a gentleman if he had sold his family on the slave block as many of them did to the westerners he was a great herothe slayer of the indian warrior tecumseh at the battle of thames during the war of  severely wounded in this battle he carried scars for the rest of his life in spite of his reputation as an indian warrior it was he who had the compassion to organize some of the first indian schools even acting as a superintendent of one of them to the downtrodden eastern debtors he was a virtual savior advocating measures to aid them and to abolish debtors prisons he was devoted to the underdog as one colleague remarked the people loved him because he loved them first  his views on many subjects including that of women in society was that of the most liberal of thinkers today he was an anachronisma misplaced progressive a contemporary and friend of andrew jackson he expressed ideas that might have been regarded as extreme today many questioned his relationship with julia chinn and speculated that it might have resulted from his failure with other women this is highly unlikely since he was handsome desirable exciting a white woman friend commented on his pleasant geniality and his strong masculinity a big man sturdy and capable he was looked on with favor by many washington ladies but he preferred julia his sweet and cherished mulatto wife as mistress of the great brick house at blue creek records show that there was a certain glamor in his careless dress the scarlet vest he always affected the cane the slight limp the steady smile his love of literature was wellknown and he spoke clearly in a language full of powerful metaphor the speech of a man who admired fine words and fine expression a writer of sorts his compositions were used as texts for the children of virginia he was also commissioned to record the history of battles and campaigns in which he took part he inherited a love of music from his mother and he had more than a passing knowledge of many instruments his greatest pleasure was to sit by the fire and listen to julia as she played on the pianoforte both the sight and the sounds were lovely his marital position was accepted by his colleagues in fact it apparently was of little importance to anyone andrew jackson had had his own troubles but won out despite charges of adultery that had been leveled at him and his wife rachel jackson had died brokenhearted still shunned by washingtons ladies jackson the widower president had become the defender of peggy eaton the lady who had scandalized society as a divorcee and by marrying the man who was supposedly the cause of the divorce the fact that her new husband was the secretary of war did not give her an automatic entry into the homes of other officials president jackson believing in peggys innocence and still rankling over the past insults to his rachel tried to force her down the throats of the wives of the other cabinet officials he chose as the champion and ambassador of his cause richard mentor johnson feeling that he had the right touch to handle this delicate situation the fact that johnsons own affairs were an affront to the mores of washington society seemed to have been overlooked at least they were overlooked until the election of  it was then that the opposition felt they could gain political advantage by publicizing the story of johnson and julia and their two daughters imogene and adeline johnson had never denied his relationship to the two girls he had in fact reared them carefully hiring a white tutor who remarked frequently of the girls beauty and gentility he also remarked that as a stranger he would never have suspected that they were the children of a colored woman johnson could easily have fabricated a story and passed them off as white their education was vastly superior to the females of that day in accordance with their fathers standards julia was part of johnsons property inheritance from his father his mother a kindly talented woman had raised the slavegirl in her own genteel manner teaching her all the things that made her admirably suited to be mistress of blue creek she even managed the choctaw academy in johnsons absence she corresponded with him frequently giving him reports as to details in running the plantation and the school and he responded with suggestions and orders he sent the girls gifts and encouraged them to mind their lessons and learn both girls later married white men and their father deeded them each an estate adeline received blue creek and imogene land to the north it was natural perhaps for the southern states to object to johnsons candidacy for vicepresident in  the newspapers of virginia screamed against his nomination saying that the negroes would  have an esther at the throne to speak for them most of the other arguments were less polite however so great was johnsons popularity that he was chosen despite his domestic arrangements the election was a tie and went to the senate to be resolved there he was elected by a large majority his southern colleagues found that their loyalty to their party superceded their moral convictions most of them were not distressed by his relationship to a negro and a slave in fact many of them had the same sort of relationship their complaint was his lack of willingness to hide his indiscretions in the meantime during the period of the campaign julia was stricken with cholera in one of the great epidemics that swept the country and died shortly afterward johnson also lost his elder daughter he was extremely lonely and his whole life began to change stories of his degeneracy began to filter back to washington an old man physically unkempt living in a house he had let go to a shambles he had taken to himself a nineteenyear old negro girl after her there were others his public appearances became disgraceful he was slovenly his speech was disjointed vague desperate his oncekeen grasp of affairs was gone and only a fuzzy muddled mind remained his oncegreat appeal as the slayer of tecumseh was overshadowed by the great hurrah for the legendary general harrison the most promising liberal of the s was the hasbeen of the s the democratic party saw no profit in defending his action and as the second van buren campaign began johnson was dumped as candidate for the vicepresidency his whole career had ended with julias death what was her real role in his life she had been raised by his mother undoubtedly had many of his mothers mannerisms and ideas was it possible that she was his discipline a sort of reincarnation of jennie johnsons beliefs and standards did she set the pattern by which he lived and which disintegrated when she died there can only be speculation over her place in his life because records are so sketchy however while she lived johnson led a wellordered life attending to all the details of his many personal interests and to his political responsibilities with great expertness his skill and political value were great enough to allow his colleagues to tolerate his offenses against their standards but without julia he was only the remnants of a man who had missed greatness julia chinn is and perhaps will always remain only one of the interesting shadows that lurk in the pages of history
the jim crow christ
the pastor said he would rather see us afterward in his study we said wed wait we had plenty of time when we were alone with him he sat silent and then sighed and said what you say is true only too true but if i invited negroes to come to our church youd have to beg them to come said harry the crazy irishman they dont go for that halfhearted invitation stuff were here to ask you to beg them to come a look of quick pain passed across the pastors face as if his toe had been stepped on and then he began again if negroes came to our church our white members would fall away from what said harry the crazy irishman from their antichristianityour church said the pastor ignoring harry the crazy irishman would be empty except said harry for the least of them and for christ my church would be empty said the pastor you have got to understand my position what is your position said the crazy irishman are you running a box office or a house of god you have got to understand my position said the pastor still ignoring harry a minister can not be too far ahead of his congregation are you the shepherd of the flock or one of the sheep said harry the pastor by this time appeared to be inured to harrys impudence of course i agree with you gentlemen he said with emphasis on the gentlemen that the segregation of our colored brethren is deplorable we didnt say it was deplorable said harry we said it was antichristian deplorable said the pastor and this time there was a note of firmness in his voice that suggested that the crazy irishman was beginning to get to him but we have got to face the fact that the church can not get too far ahead of society if it is going to remain effective i now wait a minute said harry ill pass that one about the church remaining effective but a minute ago you said the minister cant be too far ahead of his coni gregation and now youre saying the church cant get too far ahead of society which do you mean both said the pastor sharply the rest of us all glanced at each other the pastor had been caught off guard and had answered harry directly somebody had to shut harry up or hed ruin us but hed ruin the pastor first none of us said anything how far ahead of the jews was moses when they built the golden calf how far ahead of the disciples was jesus when he went the route and they all ran out on him it was harry the crazy irishman of course the pastor was getting mad im not here to discuss theological questions he said well we are said harry but maybe were in the wrong place maybe we should have gone to the pub and talked to the publican that was too much for the pastor he turned on harry and said young man a little christian humility wouldnt hurt you a little christianity would hurt you said the crazy irishman and thats why you wont practice it harry got up clapped his hat on his head and went out the rest of us sat there as red as the pastor he pulled his frock coat together as if he was going to button it and straightened himself up in his chair that took time enough for his face to fade from red to white you will have to excuse me gentlemen he said but i have a meeting i want you to know that you are always welcome here and that i am always at your service that after all is my humble function here and i want you to know also that i approve heartily of your ideals if not of your methods you know gentlemen and now he began to spread out in his chair again as if we were settling down for a long talk these things are complicated complicated he shook his head obviously regretting that though what he said was true he had to say it these things take time two thousand years is long enough it was the voice of the crazy irishman coming through the first floor window from the sidewalk this time the pastor looked as if hed been stabbed in the back and harrys voice as a matter of fact had come from behind him goodday gentlemen goodday harry was dancing around outside im sorry if i spoiled your teteatete boys he said if it hadnt been for me you might have got a cup of tea out of it but you wouldnt have got anything else and you know it what did we get out of it this way said somebody ill tell you what we got out of it said the crazy irishman we let him know that we know that he isnt a christian isnt that enough for one day i sympathized with the parson myself he has a big family a big house a big car and a big congregation he doesnt do any actual harm and i know he does a lot of good in a quiet way hed even  stood up a time or two on the race issuewhich is more than you can say for most of them the only place he cant stand up is in his own church well thats a terrible way for a man to have to live but we all live like that more or less we dont want to be crucified and it seems as if the only way to avoid being crucified is to crucify that parson doesnt want to be like christany more than you or i dohe just wants to sound like christ hes got to liveor at least he thinks he doesand he isnt fit for anything else than preaching hes a oneskill man just like you and me if he lost his job hed be in a tough fix we havent got any more right to condemn him than he has to condemn us wait a minute i dont know about that he undertook to preach the gospel of jesus christ and he isnt doing it that sounds worse to me than not listening to it which is bad enough as between the jim crow pastor and the jim crow churchgoerneither of them christiansi suppose the one that undertakes to preach the gospel to the other is the more damnable the only extenuating circumstance i suppose is that the pastor didnt know what he was undertaking when he undertook it the ministry is so strictly a trade in our time that the poor devil probably flipped a coin to decide between dentistry and preaching and preaching won be ye perfect as your father in heaven is perfect ill bet nobody ever bothered to tell him when he was young that if he wasnt willing to be perfect he should go into dentistry you never hear any of them any more trying ot justify their crucifixion of christ the way they used to especially in the south saying that cains sin was marrying a negro woman or that the negroes are the children of ham who was cursed by noah and condemned to father a progeny of servants and i suppose that its something gained to get them to stop perverting scripture but it cant be much in gods sight we are made of one blood all nations of men we are all one in christ jesus we are all members one of anotherthey cant ignore scriptures like that not while god is around christ died to save all men and there is no distinction of persons or races in holy writ there was the darkskinned king at the epiphany the man of ethiopia when philip baptized in acts and the ethiopian counsellor who persuaded the king to let him deliver jeremiah from prison if these three men were negroesi cant find any others in scripture and im not sure these three were they were among the most glorious of christians they were among the elect racism and christianity dont mix a man can run a jim crow restaurant or a jim crow college and be nothing worse than an ene
my of democracy but the man who runs a jim crow church is an enemy of christ and theres no getting around it his business and his only business is to bear witness to christ if the christian church isnt christian it ought to go out of business and if it werent for bingo book reviews and box suppersnone of which has anything to do with christs witnessit would have been out of business long ago and there is nothing the negro can do about it except pray to god who has hardened the hearts of the jim crow pastors and the jim crow churchgoers to soften them the negro christian who wants to save the christian church cant save it by forcing his way into it if god has willed its destruction it will be destroyed and there is no reason for the negro to be sorry for himself he is not deprived of the kingdom of god which is of course within him he is deprived only of the opportunity to associate with unrepentant sinners and to be contaminated by them if the negro is going to be sorry for anybody he should be sorry for the jim crow pastor who has to crucify christ in order to hold on to his job and the negro should be sorriest of all for the jim crow churchgoer who hasnt got the excuse of having to hold on to his job but is free whenever he wills his own salvation to walk out of the jim crow church and never reenter it
if my parents hadnt supposed ghosts to be a melodrama about   a haunted house my introduction to ibsen would have been much delayed but on my thirteenth birthday at the brighton beach theatre i saw my first professional production of a playthe ibsen classic starring alla nazimova then and there began my love for theatre and my deep interest in ibsen and his work it was pirandello who said after shakespeare without hesitation i put ibsen first so do i fourteen years after my exposure to ghosts in english and fortified with norwegianenglish dictionaries and grammars i decided to plough through ibsen in the original language all the way from catalina to when we dead awaken the battle was long exhausting and rewarding a twomonth european vacation in  allowed two weeks for norway landing in bergen norways second largest city i took one sweeping look at those mountains that surround the city breathed the sharp clean air saw the beautiful harbor alive with boats and stayed the whole two months in the land of the midnight sun armed with a letter of introduction to mr and mrs tancred ibsen given to me by one of my former teachers at the american theatre wing mr romney brent i arrived in oslo several weeks later tancreds father was the son of henrik ibsen and his mother was the daughter of bjornstjerne bjornson hows that for lineage tancreds wife lillebil ibsen is one of norways leading actresses the ibsens gracious and charming introduced me to many of norways leading actors and directors i remember meeting ellen isefiaer and congratulating her for her outstanding production of look homeward angel little did i guess that miss isefiaer would direct me in othello six years later at den nationale scene norways oldest theatre when the vacation ended i returned home to new york bringing with me a great love for norway and its people and a determination to learn to speak norwegian as well as i could read it actually my  vacation had been much more than that for in the summer of  bjarne andersen artistic administrator of den nationale scene in bergen invited me to play othello there during the spring of  happily i was playing the role at the great lakes shakespeare festival and in my spare time had worked on mem orizing it in norwegian when during one performance i noticed a strange expression in iagos laurence luckenbill eyes and heard mutterings in the audience i realized suddenly that i had transposed the norwegian text with shakespeares original the next day i cabled herr andersen my acceptance of his offer to my ears norwegian is somewhere between english and german what it lacks in vocabulary it more than makes up for in the intricacy of its phrasing and inflection tonefall at the beginning of the run playing othello in norwegian was like shifting gears i was sometimes tempted to think in english while playing in norwegian and that would have been disastrous because my norwegian tonefall would have as a result gone straight out of the window but as the run went on playing in norwegian seemed quite natural and i actually wondered what it would be like to play othello in english again othello at den nationale scene the national stage was the most wonderful experience of my life under ellen isefiaers inspired direction the production was swift clear and exciting lasting two hours and fortyfive minutes with one long intermission after iagos i am your own forever jeg er for alltid deres per fjelds set was simple yet evocative three arches and three platforms of varying heights all mounted on a revolve which allowed great freedom in choice of playing areas pers colorful rich costumes and his wonderfully imaginative light plot worked like a charm we ran for two months playing every night including sundays to packed houses i shall never forget those warm receptions the norwegians may stem from the vikings but their enthusiasm is anything but polar i shall never forget per theodor haugens superb iago anne gullestads beautiful desdemona heartrendingly moving in her last scene and astrid schwabs warm beautifully spoken emilia i shall never forget our last performance after which bjarne andersen unveiled a bronze bust of me as othello which was placed at the top of one of the staircases in the foyer of the theatre just across from a bust of henrik ibsen woweeee even though norway is a small country in terms of its population a little over three and a half million people the theatre is and has for a long time been in the mainstream of norways cultural life the beautiful theatre buildings themselves radiate permanence and importance when you enter them every visit to the theatre is an occasion for the norwegian he is proud of his theatre most norwegian theatres are subsidized by both the national and municipal governments for example nationaltheatret and det norske teatret in oslo den nationale scene in bergen and the trondelag teater in trondheim are subsidized the government has no artistic say in the doings of the theatre but it does encourage the theatre to pay its own way as much as possible for example a theatre can receive a larger sum in subsidy from the government if it has played to  per cent or more of capacity during a season the actor signs as a rule a twoyear contract at one of these theatres which can be cancelled at the end of that time by either the actor or the teatersjef artistic administrator who has sovereign sway over the artistic side of the theatrecasting choice of plays etc it is not too much to say that once a norwegian actor has made his mark at a theatre he doesnt have to worry about where his next job is coming from small wonder that i found the norwegian actor less tense about his outlook on his lifes work than the average american actor i was struck too by the versatility of the norwegian actorand versatile hed better be because even the greatest hit cannot run consecutively for more than three or four months the population of oslo for example is a little over half a million this means that a new production must be ready to take over every two months most of the time however the norwegian theatre plays in repertory per theodor haugen rehearsed a radio play from  to  am then rehearsed iago from  to  pm and then at  played bill in kiss me kateall on the same day the average production is rehearsed for two monthsfour hours a day  am to  pm according to the rules of norwegian actors equity mention must certainly be made here of the riksteatret which tours professional productions all over norway even bringing theatre to towns and villages with only three or four hundred inhabitants and norway remember is a very long country flip it over and it would reach all the way to sicily the ibsen tradition is of course woven into the fabric of norwegian theater productions of his plays are heatedly discussed long after they have closed the norwegian actor measures his talents against the characters of ibsen much as we measure ours against the creations of shakespeare the heartwarming affection of the norwegian people must leave its mark on any man and bring with it the desire to reciprocate in kind to show them that we too know and love our theatre and have a heritage perhaps one day a company of norwegian actors will come to new york and play ibsen for us in their own language we would understand it i am sure meanwhile this actor is especially grateful to den nationale scene and to our own state department which made my travel possible
mississippis freest man
s not the prettiest town in the ij mississippi delta eso  d pecially in the autumn icom glare of a long drouth with dirty cotton curls from a bumper crop edging the curbs and gutters like dust still the streets are wide and the green and gracious trees sometimes nearly meet across them and among neighborhoods of drab little houses and new modern ones there are occasional old columned places whimsical victorian houses and gardens and lawns redolent of spacious antebellum white living tended by dear and deferential darkies downtown several wide streets crossed by second and third streets is undistinguished with a movie theater cafes office buildings glasswindowed shops and the redandgold woolworths but pleasant with amiable and softspoken people who nod and smile at strangers still there is a mildly prosperous white sheen of business uptodate facades and bright new fashions including spots of mink here and there in the stores so going east on issaquena street crossing third and moving under the viaduct to the negro section one finds the dingy secret ramshackle look of darktown marked and immediate here live  negroes more than half of clarksdales total population of  there is a block of dusty crowded darkwindowed buildings which seem grown togethersecondhand clothing stores used furniture marts blindfaced cafes and one comparatively gleaming drug store with bright glass and chrome front and a sterile and immaculate array of new wares inside fourth street the hub of negro downtown crosses this poor and squalid block with another succession of hidden offices cafes and the fourth street drug store the fourth street drug store its windows halffilled with drug advertisements sundries and posters proclaiming vote for freedom and aaron henry for governor is crammed with a fountain jammed center shelves and two other counters lining the big room behind them is a narrow office space the width of the store walled with drug supplies and cut off by another breasthigh counter in the drug store it was dim crowded and closelooking like the rest of the street but when aaron henry looked up from the counter of his office smiled and spoke in quick cordiality the place expanded brightened and hummed with life his smooth nearly black face round and gently receding under a wide nose and mouth opened with the sweet eager look of a man who likes everybody who will let him and his vivid voice rose in welp come owner of the drug store mississippi president of the national association for the advancement of colored people and candidate for governor of mississippi henry who is fortyone years old looked to me like the freest fellow id seen in a long hot dustplagued journey through mississippi and after we had talked for an hour i figured he is the freest man in mississippi notwithstanding his rigid segregation house and store bombings and shootings threats law suits jail sentences and other white persecutions indeed his white neighbors have done everything that mississippians can do to a nonviolent negro revolutionary trying to lead his people to the ballot except kill him they might have done that henry has heard last june when medgar evers mississippi field secretary for the naacp was shot in the back and killed i heard it was a flip of the coin decided whether it would be medgar or me he said with a shrug i was in texas making a speech anyway we totted up the attacks on the henry family in the last two years trying to record every intimidation damage and threat since his leadership in the statewide negro drive but he couldnt remember every one and the repeated terrors became tedious his home a pleasant and comfortable frame house in a grassy neighborhood a mile or so beyond the fourth street district has been shot at three or four times bricks and homemade bombs have broken his store windows half a dozen times he pointed up to a rectangular hole in the ceiling as yet unrepaired since the last bomb attack when he was meeting with friends in the back of the store shortly after the first such evidences of white displeasure over henrys interest in negro voting his insurance policies were cancelled after a long saturday at the store our busiest dayin march a year ago henry left for a meeting with freedomstruggling friends at a funeral parlor and then went home we ate dinner he recalled and turned on the hit parade rebecca his young daughter and i were dancing and fooling around and then i undressed to get some rest before i started out again noelle mrs henry lay on the bed beside me and rebecca came back and said daddy somebodys flashing lights around the front and i said its nothing baby dont pay any attention to it i didnt want her to get scared then she came in and said somebody was at the door and noelle went and came back to the bedroom and said ben collins the chief of police wanted me i put on a robe and went to the front and he said he had to take me in i asked him what for and he said he didnt know so he followed me to the bedroom and stood there while i dressed he took me to headquarters and i still didnt find out the charge then he drove me to bolivar county and locked me up and next morning i was hit with this morals charge i was supposed to have picked up this white boy a hitchhiker on the highway and asked him to get me a white woman when he said he couldnt then they said i made advances to him i tell you i really blew my top collins and dave pearson the coahoma county solicitor were there i said along with some cussin language collins you cooked this up they just took my cussin and didnt say a word shortly however chief collins and pearson sued henry for libel not apparently for his explosive epithets but for saying they had framed him pearson got a  judgment and collins a  one neither has made any effort to collect but collins has approached henry to let him insure his life a proposition which he rejected can you imagine henry asked his high forehead wrinkled in wonderment the gall my life wouldnt be worth two cents henry was convicted of the morals charge on the word of a transient teenage white boy despite testimony of witnesses who were with henry on the afternoon he was alleged to have picked up the hitchhiker then the state court of appeals reversed the verdict a few days later the court of appeals reversed its own judgment after henry says pressure from state politicians the case is now on appeal to the u s supreme court henry recovered from his shock and disgust at the charge and convictions wtih the resilient tolerance and unfaltering fight which seem to sustain him in his leadership and with a perspective which convinces him that every pain and loss in the struggle advances the negro cause a philosophical stoicism with a broad streak of humor has inured all three of the henrys to the daily telephone calls with threats of death obscene insults and such fanciful falsehoods as that of a man who told rebecca your daddys dead and down at the funeral home little rebecca with equal spirit sasses and scoffs at the callers mrs henry amuses herself by quoting scripture to the anonymous enemies or promising to pray for them one wonders if all of white clarksdale approves and supports the savagery of police and vigilante attacks on the henrys and their colleagues we havent got one white friend in clarksdale henry said in brief and bigeyed sorrow but then as if he were obliged to remember white fears and difficulties to save himself from rage and despair he shrugged and explained that is no white man who can come out publicly they got their problems it aint easyyou know businesses jobs families pressures of course theres hal brownstein of the seed company works for the city park commission he makes sure the negroes have some balls to play with and horseshoes to throw a nice fella the paternalistic kind of thing a lot of em come by here one at a time and tell me quietly theyre sorry theyre ashamed and express sympathy but nobody can lift a hand or speak out for us the carr boy who threw a bomb in my house came by and told me he was ashamed and asked me to forgive him if i could he said he didnt know the boy he was driving had a bomb for my house the boy had told him he wanted to collect some money from me young carr said when the boy threw the molotov cocktail there wasnt anything he could do but drive him off i said sure i forgive you no hard feelings henry seemed disturbed like a man with a fresh wound that throbs through his efforts to ignore it at the recent killing of ernest gells and the unanimous indifference of the white community the police take credit for the shooting gellsa boy twentyone not in the freedom struggle never had an arrest or any recordgot in an argument about a banana at the fair deal grocery store a white mans store in the negro section as i understand it the white man broke for his gun and gells ran out of the store the grocer began shooting and the police took up the chase and shot at him too the boy had several holes in him anyway he died they tell the fantastic tale that gells had a rifle pointing it at the grocer can you figure a colored boy going to a white grocer for a banana with a rifle on him anyway we filed fifteen or twenty affidavits from witnesses on what happened and sent copies to  local businessmen we didnt hear a word from a one of em henrys most recent encounter with the clarksdale law was on the occasion of an august march of eightysix negroes including boys and girls as young as fourteen on the city hall a demonstration against the entire system of segregation which reflects itself in continued abuse of the negro population police ordered them to disperse which they did not and all were arrested for parading without a permit henry got nine days and was put to tipping garbage a chore he assumed with his customary humor and ebullience to the wry laughter of freedomfighting negroes over the deep south and his clarksdale constituents and presumably to the gratification of ruling whites the henrys seem quite unafraid rebecca a golden brown blackeyed little girl rolypoly like many twelveyearolds dimples as the henrys laugh at the grisly telephone calls mrs henry a gravemannered young woman with a rare and pretty smile did get nerv ous when medgar evers was killed up until then i would just laugh she recalled i had thought of it that way as just insults and some attacks but not much danger and i wasnt necessarily scared but after medgar was killed one woman kept calling and telling me my husband would be next so she extracted from aaron the promise that he would never go out alone after dark armed friends now take turns guarding their house at night henry talked thoughtfully to me of his life his awakening to his passion for freedom and equality and his faith in the negro movement i was born right here in coahoma county on a farm we worked hard as childrenhoeing planting and picking and going to school it was happy childhood lots of outdoors and hard work and we didnt know about anything else my first heartbreak about this race thing came when i was six years old my best friend was a little white boy i played with constantly we were inseparable and i loved him with all my heart his family lived near us and we visited back and forth and they tell me our mothers would leave us at each others houses as babies and that sometimes my mother would nurse him and sometimes his mother would nurse me well when time came to go to school they told me we couldnt go together that was just how it was he had to go to a white school and i had to go to the negro school i cried and cried and i reckon he did too i think i didnt realize the negro thing but just that wed be separated but as soon as school was out hed run right to my house and we spent all the rest of the time together hes out in california now and we keep in touch christmas cards and that kind of thing henry remembers the inspiration of a high school teacher who talked of negro rights democracy and american equality shed give us books to read like richard wrights black boy and persuaded the senior class to join the naacp his interest in history in high school and college also illumined the negro situation for him and fired him with a resolve for justice and liberation he spent two years in the army in world war ii in california and the south pacific after his service he met this chick here at a methodist vacation bible school program a slender quiet girl the color of dark honey and she really got me they were married after he finished xavier university in new orleans with a degree in pharmacy and returned home to open a drug business with a friend later he started his own business which became a rendezvous for colored youngsters and a headquarters for the clarksdale freedom movement at xavier he was awakened  and stimulated by his scientific studies more history some sociology philosophy and literature and particularly by the friendship of a nun whom the students called sister bill some of the negroes hadnt had the preparation for college work he recalled and shed take us on to tutor us and fill us in so we could keep up whenever we got in any trouble academic or any other kind we could count on sister bill going to bat for us and if we couldnt pay for lessons it didnt matter shed keep on working with us a zestful methodist and a leader of haven methodist church henry is chairman of its social concerns group and his study and programs in this methodist effort also have sharpened his commitment and sped his crusade for freedom he believes in god with easy convictionoh surebut not in the sense of a pipeline up there not that kind of stuff wistfully but also in a tone of affirmation as if to remind himself that good things may be possible again he remembers easy days in clarksdale before the  supreme court decision a time of fond and free friendship with whites a deep south anomaly now destroyed in white fear and oppression for former negro friends sure we associated he said wed get together at each others homes sometimes we even took the kids and visited back and forth but not any more during the recent gubernatorial campaign in which democratic candidate paul b johnson vowed to k o kennedy and preserve white domination against federal interference and republican candidate rubel phillips repudiated past liberalism and as loudly defied negro aspirations and federal law the negro freedom ballot campaign conceived by a federation of the civil_rights organizations in mississippi advanced aaron henry for governor and reverend edwin king a young white methodist chaplain and dean of students at negro tougaloo college near jackson for lieutenantgovernor the night i heard henry speak to  negroes and a sprinkling of whites at jackson amid the harsh noise of the white campaigns and against the dark backdrop of statewide negro persecution he sounded like an insouciant sort of saint a massive bellvoiced old brown minister reverend r l smith introduced henry with some highminded remarks of his own we are not fighting alone and will not win alone we dont hate anybody we try to love everybody we hate the lies and doubledealing that are going on against us we are grateful for every decent man white or black and thank god for a few nativeborn mississippians who are with us it is a new day in mississippi for here is a nativeborn white american reverend edwin king who says he wants freedom for all  there is something great in aaron henrya man willing to walk out and take a stand for you and me who served time on the chain gang and that didnt stop him the kind of man who made america great mississippi needs such a governor she wont be ashamed of who wont stand in the door but who stands at the door and beckons all men to come in henry dark dapper and smiling rose and hailed the intimidations and difficulties the reverend king has sufferedwhich are in fact considerable including jail and abuse in jackson for demonstrating with negroes he also praised robert moses his campaign manager a young new york negro now nearly three years in mississippi working for voter registration and head of the council of federated organizations national and local civil_rights groups joined in the struggle to vote moses a victim of many beatings and jailings himself is henry said fool enough or brave enough or whatever you want to call it to run this campaign and the way he works me he must have been my granddaddys slave driver on june th henry continued swiftly and solemnly one of the best friends i ever had had his life snuffed out by a coward who waited in the bushes and shot him in the back he fell his full six feet two inches and he carried us exactly six feet and two inches down the road to freedom we will never have to replace or gain again that six feet and two inches because medgar evers carried us that far with his life weve worked hard to secure the rights were now applying for candidate henry said because for generations we worked all year for nothing today we want our payment when the white businessmen say negroes dont pay taxes well if theyd pay us the overall wage due us theyd live forever tax free henry spoke emotionally of our terrific love for this country of ours and pointed out that black people in africa secured their freedom by driving the white people out when we secure the freedom which is ours he promised to applause our white brothers and sisters will be right here with us with emphasis and applause he declared the freedom vote is a vote for the right to vote  and a political reform by which you can make a senator javits of senator eastland he espoused the cause of love for white and black brothers and sisters and said we have no prejudice against white people because theyre white we cant get to firstclass citizenship by such secondclass means    we cannot live in yesterday we forgive the white men for their past we want equality and freedom for all of us upstairs after the meeting a dozen youngsters clapped danced and sang freedom songs laughing the black boys began the old spiritual im gonna sit at the welcome table bye and bye and concluded with the mississippi version vm gonna marry barnetts daughter bye and bye man one boy bent over in mirth his daughter she bout thirtyeight years old in meetings throughout his campaign henry pointed out that in a close race the  to  negro votes could decide the election the negro freedom ballot campaign plan was for registered negroes to write in henry and king on the official state ballots thus voiding them under mississippi law once we withdraw our votes henry explained and the man who loses figures that if wed voted for him hed have won then the next time hell do something to get those votes of ours henrys big appeal however was for the freedom vote a straw ballot of  to  which would show the country and the state that mississippi negroes will vote if they let us of mississippis  persons  are negro with a sixty per cent majority in the delta if we get a civil_rights bill with protection for voting we can change this whole state henry fervently predicts weve had more than fifty mass meetings around the state over this thing yes ive had a ball i enjoy campaigning and the crowds and enthusiasm weve got this organization now from districts right on down to city blocks we know every negro voter thats registered and all the campaign workers and well keep our eyes on the  election now and this campaign is aimed at a lot of uncommitted congressmen people from north and south dakota utah other states up there without any negroes if we show them what were up against and that this dixiecrat crowd doesnt represent mississippi then we may get their votes on the civil_rights bill if we get set back on the civil_rights billhenry looked worriedi dont know therell be a reaction therell be more of the black muslim psychology infiltrating and we cant defend against it no we dont have any black muslims now he laughed freedom in mississippi sure i believe in it henry declared with earnest emphasis we can turn this state upside down and really have us a place to live in and be proud ofa place for everybody jobs education equality freedom and politicians who represent all the people that we wont be ashamed of the white folks will be free too i think well be through this thing sooni give it four or five years will they get me he mused undismayed as if he had considered the question many times and come to terms with it well i find if you keep on standing up to em they arent as rough on you i feel like things have eased up a little for me but if you take a stand and then let em cow you down they got you sure i might die you got to be prepared for that but i figure medgars death advanced us twenty years in negro support and white reaction it was one of the biggest shocks the state of mississippi ever had why they couldnt even have a parade in jackson until medgars death and then  or  negroes walked in that memorial procession what few concessions weve got in jackson his death brought about if i get killedso everything contributes said henry a man of faith and freedom the november freedom vote with ballot boxes on the plantations in town and country churches in poolrooms and votemobiles pulled some  mock votes from disenfranchised negroes many of them henry jubilantly noted from black cottonpickers heretofore scared even to write their names down three weeks of campaigning also gave us an organization so we got our hands on every registered voter and nearly every negro who wants to vote here clearly is a formidable group of politically potent citizens awaiting their liberation and negro mississippians and furtive white liberals figure it gave them henry an engaging politician of highminded promise for 
soul brothers emancipation proclamation
 four score and like f y twentyone years ago £ the bearded white father moved in on  the happenings with a new pact hung up in human dignity and cut out on the pattern that all soul brothers and soul sisters drop off the balls and chains now we are caught up in a great big hassle testing whether our group like the ofay group should have a right to latch on to some justice and freedom we have won victories to that effect like in the law courts we have got eyes to throw out the laurels for those who went to their last lay down pad blowing the horn for integration its crazy man crazy that were on this kick but in an offbeat sense we cant make out we cant clue in we cant even talk up this jazz the freedom fighters with us and down under who slaved here have sounded off  too nice for us to ever add our say the segregationists are not hip to this bit and they dont dig this talk we talk but like its for us the freedom bound to grab up the horn and keep on blowing like its rather for us to keep jamming the sounds and beating the rhythms which those longgone rights leaders gigged and wailed that from these wayout characters we jump up to the cause for which they went and blew their gaskets that we here riff the tune that these crucified soul brothers shall not have got wasted in vain that this nation under equality shall ever more be swinging and that a jazzy new group of freedom fighters of the members by the members and for the members shall not cut out from the scene

the barbershop was t warm enough to make carlyle bedlow sleepy and smelled of fragrant shaving soap a fat man sat in the great chair his stomach swelling beneath the striped cloth standing behind him

back a short lightskinned negro opened the door and leaned in hello garland he did not close the door and cold wind blasted in around him say man how you doing you after the boy there all right he continued to work hardly looking at the head in front of him he could cut hair blindfolded the short man nodded and closed the door behind him he removed his coat put his gloves carefully into a pocket sat down and stretched only then did he take off his hat his hair was straight and black he did not seem to need a haircut i read in the amsterdam how mister cool and his white sweetie finally got shackled yes sir we just talking about that garland reached behind him touched a switch and from an aluminum box lather billowed into his palm aint that just like a negro and like a white bitch too the fat man added dont trim the sideburns just around the ears ill trim the sideburns myself garland nodded man i seen the same thing happen a thousand times a negro making more money than a white man starting to act foolish like a white man even though he should know better i guess it aint really that negros fault all his life he been poor and a nobody garland put the lather behind the fat mans ears so as soon as he gets some money its bound to mess up his mind dont touch the sideburns garland the fat man shifted un  der the striped sheet yeah i think you right and them white bitches is waiting to ambush him the short man folded his thin arms across his chest well dont all a colored mans problems begin with mister charlie and miss mary mostly when miss mary wants to make time with her nigger chauffer or handyman and mister charlie finds out about it he dont blame miss mary for it thats sure the fat man leaned forward garland stopped shaving reflecting mostly when you find some white woman being nice to you nicer than she ought to be then watch out he started to shave behind the fat mans ears them white women know where its at the short man nodded yeah but i cant see why no colored mand want to marry no white chick on purpose like mister cool did not when theres so many fine spade chicks around garland agreed i like my wornen the way i like my coffee hot strong and black the fat man jerked his head i guess he thinks he taking a step up now he thinks he better than all the other boots standing on the comer hes got himself a white recording contract with a big white company and a booking at a fine white nightclub and a white cadillac and an apartment on park avenue painted all white and a white bitch too why man he almost white himself    except for one thing he still a nigger they all laughed uproariously slapping their thighs it seemed much colder with his hair cut short his neck shaved clean carlyle trudged flatfooted planting his feet firmly so as not to slip up the middle of the carless street through the shadows cast by the snowclogged trees he wished he could go home take off his wet shoes listen to records and read the paper that each night his father carried home tucked under his arm he knew too that the later it got the angrier his father would be his father liked to eat as soon as he came home besides his father would want him or his little brother to clear their own driveway and carlyle had not asked to take the shovel he decided then walking along the rutted street he would not waste his time with small jobs he would look for a long snowbanked walk of a house set way back from the street this is what he finally found down a solitary sidestreet lit faintly by a single streetlamp at the middle of the block the house set back on a short hill that surely in the spring and summer would be a thick lawn perhaps bordered with flowers snow clung to the empty blackened branches of a hedge concealing a grotesque iron fence the house too was grotesque painted gray its gables hung with daggerlike icicles he hesitated a moment looking up at the house there did not seem to be any light burning and he did not want to wade twenty or thirty teet through shindeep snow to find no one at home going further on up the sidewalk he found a lighted window down the side near the back and he returned to the gate and started up the drifted walk the porch was wood and clunked hollow when he stamped the snow from his feet he climbed the steps gingerly and peered at the names on the doorbell if there was a mans name he still might not find workwomen living alone or old couples more usually needed someone to clean snow there was a womans nameelizabeth reubenand a mans too but his which was typed had been recently crossed out with a thick smeared angry pencil slash carlyle rang the bell no longer walking his feet got cold very quickly and when after what seemed a long while the door openedand then only a crack he was hopping from one foot to the other yes what is it he could see  a nose and one eye could hear a womans voice miz reuben he slurred the miss or missus so as not to insult her either way yes would you like to have your walk shoveled he moved closer and spoke to the nose and eye there was a pause while she looked him over up and down and inspected the shovel he held in his hand no im sorry i dont think so well uh    there was nothing else to say he thanked her and turned away wait it sounded almost like a scream and then softer young man wait he turned back and found the door swung wide the nose and eye had grown to a small plumpish white woman of about forty in a pale blue wool dress she was not exactly what he would have called pretty but she was by no means a hag she was just uninteresting looking her hair was a dull brown combed into a style that did her no good her eyes were flat and gray like cardboard on second thought young man i think it would be nice to have my walk cleaned off im expecting some visitors and it will make it easier for them  to find me she smiled at him but come inside you must be frozen solid walking around in all this snow and cold thats all right maam ill start right away he took a step back and lifted his shovel you do as i say and come in the house this very moment she was still smiling but there was enough of a mothers tone in her voice to make him walk past her through the door which she closed behind him rest your coat and shovel there and follow me im taking you into the kitchen to put something warm into your stomach he did as she ordered and walked her down the hall lit by a lowwatt bulb in a yellowing shade the first thing he noticed was that the kitchen smelled of leaking gas there was a huge pile of rags and bits of cloth on the table in the center of the room there were more rags on the window sill and stuffed at the bottom of the back door she saw him looking at them its an old house it gets very drafty she smiled nervously wringing her hands now are you old enough to drink coffee or would you rather have hot chocolate he had remained on his feet she bustled to the table and swept the rags onto the floor with her arm sit down please he did now what would you rather have hot chocolate please hot chocolate good thats better for you she headed toward the stove almost running it was big and oldfashioned with a shelf for salt and pepper above theburners whats your name dear carlyle maam carlyle bedlow carlyle did you know you were named after a famous man no maam i was just named after my father his names she was laughing shrilly unhappily he had said something funny but did not know what it was it made him uneasy what dear you started to say something i interrupted you nothing maam he was wondering now what he had said and why she was being so nice giving him hot chocolate maybe she was giving him the hot chocolate so she could talk to him about things he did not understand and laugh at his ignorance it was just like the men in the barbershop said most of a colored mans trouble began with white people they were always laughing and making fun of negroes    do you like your hot chocolate sweet carlyle i can put some sugar in it for you behind her voice he could hear the milk sizzling around the edges of the saucepan could hear the gas feeding the flame yes maam i like it sweet the milk sizzled louder still as she poured it across the hot sides into his cup she brought it and sat across from him on the edge of her chair waiting for him to taste it he did so and found it good with his minds eye he followed it down his throat and into his stomach is it good her gray eyes darted across his face yes maam she smiled and seemed pleased that puzzled him if she had him in to laugh at him why was she so anxious to get him warm why did she want him to like the hot chocolate there had to be some other reason but just then the chocolate was too good to think about it he took a big swallow well now lets get down to business ive never had to hire anybody to do this before i used to do it myself when i was younger and    then    there was a man here whod do it for me    but hes not here anymore she trailed off caught herself how much do you usually get for a stoop and walk that long she smiled at him again it was a fleeting smile which warmed the corners of her mouth and left her eyes sad ive been very nice to you i should think youd charge me less than usual so that was it she wanted him to do her walk for practically nothing white people were always trying to cheat negroes he had heard his father say that cursing the jews in harlem he just stared at her hating her she waited an instant for him to answer then started to figure out loud well lets see thats a long walk and theres the sidewalk and the stoop and the steps and its very cold and i probably cant get anyone else    its a question of too little supply and a great deal  of demand she was talking above him again id say id be getting off well if i gave you five dollars she stopped and looked across at him helplessly does that sound fair i really dont know he continued to stare but now because he could hardly believe what she said at the most he would have charged only three dollars and had expected her to offer one she filled in the silence yes five that sounds right he finished his chocolate with a gulp but maam i wouldnta charged you but three really three that doesnt sound like enough she bolted from the table and advanced on him well ill give you the extra two for being honest perhaps you can come back and do something else for me she swooped on him hugged and kissed him the kiss left a wet cold spot on his cheek he lurched away surprised knocking the cup and saucer from the table the saucer broke in two the cup bounced rolled lopsided and crazy under the table no maam he jumped to his feet im sorry maam thats all right its all right im sorthats all right about the saucer she scrambled to her knees and began to pick up the pieces and the cup once she had them in her lap she sat staring away at nothing shaking her head now he knew for certain what she was up to he remembered what garland had said when you find some white woman being nicer than she ought to be then watch out she wanted to make time with him he started from the kitchen maybe he could leave before it was too late wait young man she stood up ill pay you now and you wont have to come inside when youre through she pushed by him and hurried down the shadowy hallway he followed her as before but kept his distance her purse was hanging on a peg on the coatrack next to his own jacket she took them both down handed him his jacket averting her eyes and fumbled in her purse produced a wallet unzipped it pulled out a bill and handed it to him but its a five maam he could not understand why she wanted to pay him that much now that he was not going to make time with her she looked at him for the first time her eyes wet i told you id pay you five didnt i yes maam all right do a good job and remember dont come back yes maam you let yourself out she started to the back of the house even before he had finished buttoning his jacket by the time he opened the door she was far down the hall and as he closed it behind him and stepped into the dark twinkling cold he could hear her in the kitchen she was tearing rags the next evening the white woman was in the newspaper a boy trying to deliver a package had found her in the gasfilled kitchen slumped over a table piled high with rags carlyles father who saw it first mentioned it at dinner had a suicide a couple blocks from here he told who and where carlyle sat staring at his plate his father went on white folks man if they had to be colored for a day theyd all kill theyselves we wouldnt have no race problem then white folks dont know what hard life is whats wrong junior she was a nice lady his parents and his little brother looked at him you know her junior his mother put down her fork she was a nice lady mama i shovelled her walk yesterday she give me five dollars oh junior his mother sighed five dollars his father leaned forward crazy huh have some respect his mother turned on his father angrily carlyle looked at his mother are white people all bad theres some good ones aint there mama of course junior his mother smiled what made you think sure there is junior his father was smiling too the dead ones is good
a black poet in europe
beyond the time and space of this small cafe in paris there lies a world which threatens to steal my manhood that is why i am in paris at this hour while i speak my roots ache inside of me through my day and throughout nightfall i walk the streets of paris alone among throngs of chattering people i glimpse faces of others who need paris as much as i do we have gathered and gathered our tender pieces of flesh and come down and away from that intoler able paramount of a homeland dying from things symbols and sorrow we have descended to paris to her warm sun to this cafe from which i write you discovering on some illfated hour the valley of death spread out before us burning our eyes recalling our dreams painting our faces black again sending newer and blanker dark hours we are sitting on rue de saint germain i have counted my francs carefully we wait for the sun to fall it is the flaming height of paris golden hour the paid for moment of a lovely womensummer her cycle all paris is bright and clear we wipe dry our faces and smell the seine the winding streets appear rust brown and dry brownness is everywhere we are the blackbrown jewels found here loved and feared forgetful about what the case was so very very long ago only the healthy looking prostitutes and men from africas loins appear contented in the evening when we have tasted our fill in loneliness we shall drift back to our rooms strip laugh broadmouthed at the heat think of home our separate harlems of fun rejoice at our good fortune then sleep and hope to dream of places dark men and women poverty race hatred sweet waters our mothers humming intermittent spirituals a white man enters a door we dream heavy this man is our father killed and love singing his way through our lives an emasculated shadow pleased to be alive we shall grow to love him in our hate he is our father and our blood fathers are without genuine sons a short hour passes we arise and walk several miles the nerve center of paris is human life human possibility begins anew for us and this is the difference between a walk at home and a walk here anything can happen in europe at home you return to bare the bareness of empty closets and cheaply papered walls long bright cars outside kitchen smells of greens and blackeyed peas here then you are or want to be here is paris dreamed of your previous life blacked out no blackness here no nigger no postfreudian words to examine you and the burden of your sorrow becomes furiously free only the loss of a passport dare destroy you now we are still sitting on the rue de saint germain i have counted my francs carefully for the second time there is enough left for a round of vin i find difficult to pronounce i am still waiting for the sun to fall soon my guest will begin to drift away in paris one buys drinks for friends and strangers alike my hotel is located three blocks away for a few dollars a day i survive its aura of lunacy high school french has no meaning here only the language separates our souls it dawned upon me before leaving america that a language problem would exist and in many places throughout europe i would be alone i rather fancied the idea considered it a part of my roundtrip ticket as a tourist and potential expatriate the rules did not apply to me i thought in the new and exciting labyrinthines of the olde world i would be no more the stranger than in the last europeans prefer presliced bread to no bread at all but they can survive especially in paris on no bread at all bread served hot or cold round square oblong diced in america we failed to incorporate into the charter of european tradition we politely stole a concern for ingredients bread is bread man is alone we dare not mix our religion and historical experience with food nor anything else our faith is built into things god help us in europe especially in small villages bread is a way of life in america i had a number and size some few friends some bad ones some hard times i never supposed that europes mystique would descend upon me like an all cleansing angel and deliver me from paying my dues or experiencing my fate at the foot of her cross admitted i was naive one reads a thousand prospectuses before embarking i went one step farther and researched quite extensivelyeven to the point of reading literature exclusively written by men of color who came same as i looking for solidarity or any of the tools of communication that americas inhumanity fails to offer the black man nailed to her wall i hungered for bread  the sun finally falls and i write quickly the gargon comes to add a franc to my check for it is past six oclock and the price of vin goes up incidentally have you tasted american bread lately the one bad odor in paris smells of money the rat race exists there tenfold paris is hell when hunger sets in the streets talk back to you children run through the alleys of your childhood mercy like existence precedes essence a first trip abroad can be termed hot or cold but always and always the king is dead you are free the strange thing about paris is that people do emerge from places one does not ordinarily expect people to emerge from they fall out of the woodwork africans africans i look about me now count them by fives we are located at the first table so to speak evening has arrived you can tell it by car horns grunts and groans by extra gargons quickly snapping on vests the lack of children in the streets above all the steady downpour of americans there are richlooking americans poorlooking ones like me more of them than any others the french are not unaware of us the poor ones we are all rich to them true to their hollywood legend there is no protestant face or jewish face or catholic face or negroid face the faces are parisian until you find out better i understand now and only as of this moment why proust and gide and longlost oscar wilde peered into paris limpid blue eyes only to find white pearls from limbo henry miller found real bread how can one hope to explain paris there is a point of demarcation that is all one could possibly hope to do with mere words with a camera she comes alive even then her pores tighten up we must come we must taste of her or remain unborn to our desires i am writing you all sorts of gewgaw which de gaulle knows you dont need to hear my intention was to fulfill a promise i made to you some time ago and to let you know that your poetry follows me as i go marching happily along was that a song i have a copy of annie allen with me at times she has been my manumission baldwin had bessie smith i have annie richard had mississippi the gargon cleans my table for the third time several au revoirs have been exchanged the others fled i am destined to pay an extra franc because this letter makes my day meaningful this evening much later on i look forward to hearing gordon heath sing you may remember him from broadway some years ago he runs a small club with just enough room for artistry with a voice worth much more cash in the states if things were not the way they are tonight promises to be my first early trip on other occasions i arrived too late or much too full of apathy a franc is worth twenty cents and the french have a way of not letting you forget what you are worth without their precious currency i enter my third month in europe and my last  in francs i am thinking now of what i shall really think in the future about this longdreamedof trip it germinated in high school followed me like the hound of heaven through college not once have i asked myself how i really got here my salary and budget certainly didnt pull it off certainly both helped but most of the credit lies with that savage resource of guts that only a black boy in america gets a chance to use if at all admitted other minorities have a time of it also but a lot less conspicuous they see us we have learned how to live invisibly yes guts and nothing else but guts o father who are in guts mighty is thou name give us more guts guts for our souls guts for our dreams deliver our tarnished guts from weaker guts and give us enough guts to remake an old world or at least give us enough guts to influence the new one acoming hemingway had nada eliot old sweeney guts for us i stray again forgive me the gargon comes once more slightly irritated deux vins one for me and another to keep the table private do you really want to know what i think about europe have your gifted powers diagnosed my case well let me put it to you another way i dare not ask europa what she thinks about me anyhow to whom would i direct my question certainly not a fellow white american who doesnt know me at home never a european they know too many white lies about us now the ugly americans really prove true to form some negro gis are still requested to show their tails o tis true when i was in the united states army long before my private war  i was stationed in georgia i remember my first day offpost proud of my uniform wanting to be noticed because in my pockets i had several white certificates telling me that i had completed without injury or disgrace boot training i knew something about the southland id been there before never like then a man just a guy in uniform without any serious qualms no racial bugaboos cluttered my mind i felt neither northern or biggity black nor white needless i suppose to say to you at least i returned a whimpering naked dehumanized speck of a man ralph ellisons theory of invisibility is one thing aloneness is another nobody really saw me too many soldiers in town little to do with color just too many damn soldiers in town we knew the price of southern coffee we could not buy but we assumed tea was in order color is often times an excuse used to accept defeat quite pleasantly how many black men do you suppose threw the towel in before the verdict reached an impartial jury i became indifferent like any  good black soldier would do under similar circumstances during peace time where was the war i dont suppose there was enough misery for us in the world i cant forget that night a strange sense of similarity confronts me now too many of us wear our uniforms in europe they strip us bare and see our souls made of things cars toasters credit cards cheap taste and a profound ignorance of life and liberty far exceeding our wealth i am back in georgia    now miller called paris a whore the native son called it salvation i can never call it home i have come to europe to see myself and one quick look is adequate one sees what the camera catches there can be no other freedom a private hell closed for me paris is dead i continue to live and grow paris is dead i arrived one hundred years too late in your poetry blackness rises above mere words we fools we cut our poems out of air in europe particularly in paris we move alone not by choice rather because of consciousness we are aware here the streets move with you her beauty startles you you who had never known what it meant to love a building a piece of stone a painting you who tried to be born loved but failed paris is dead paris is beautiful europe is free im too late  in little rock the people bear babes and comb and part their hair parisians stare for hours at things made from clay and paint brick and papr greece lives on this side of the world people plant their souls in things things which have lasted through all the warweary shamed days things which are bound to rise again and again as long as the victims of compulsion and blood choose to survive emerson spoke the truth things rule us in america the parallels in human history bear our sufferings out europe refutes them and offers us her blueveined ancient body upon promise of freedom baldwin has said the road to paris leads home robert frost retorts home is where you go when theres no place else to go whats freedom a taste of bread i still sit quietly on saint germain boulevard memory is born in us perhaps it becomes us after our brief pause upon this massive universe i am quickly losing control of my good thoughts whats good a new age is being bom here i sit uneasy in the role of poet guilty of living the black life hiding my face losing out not even our best poems answer a black mans willing defeat i think of home her unpredictable shores and booker t lincoln washington jones riding the crest of her waves my thoughts conceptualize a bevy of nocturnal and wasted years i think of black men and women who gave up sold out for a home a car an easier role to play what about today how many shall we allow to survive when does the man become a man at what point does his woman shake off the sterile curse of imitation and materialism when does she fight for her children and fortify her man against our own torrent of ignorance and poverty shall we ever taste bread pasternak said gregariousness is the refuge of mediocrity i hate poetry tonight alas i hate poets and ash wednesday belongs to another world fools mere words cannot save us we need another buddha in little rock the people sing sunday hymns like anything with lemon tea and lorna doones for me europe has failed many others like myself shall cross langstons big sea come ashore wet find the road back home some i suppose shall succeed wherever we wander whenever we go as artist boy woman or manthe dream we have of america we take along only our return can return the dream of which we are ourselves the prophet has written the wicked flee when no man pursueth i dare not stay too many things are undone so i look homeward my angel is black we must survive our children must know the truth we must attempt to reach them paris is dead i return home after a long funeral hungry and in need of bread it was miller who called it the prime symbol of life and i am unaware that bread is not enough weve cooked in far too many kitchens to suppose that a panacea lies in flour what brings me home is the will to live beyond my countrys expectation of me and so the story goes on the poems bum flames i read from your little book everyday and i destroy my blues its good to be free temporarily my letter is full of holes please close them up with sympathy and blame those vacuums on my youth ignorance and new born freedom
in  at the height of the climactic year of the negro revolution the worlds attention was focused for the first time in history on an insignificant little town in maryland called cambridge several times the nation waited nervously caught up in a terrible tension for the city hung perilously on a thread of violence which like a lighted fuse connected to a series of vast ammunition dumps threatened to racial holocausts across the ignite land and at the center of the holdingas it werethe tension lighted match stood a tall angular handsome woman who looked like anybodys sinewy sister but who in effect was the centennial symbol of the emancipated negro woman and it was she who refusing to be mesmerized by logicalsounding platitudes put cambridge in the spotlight by insisting that freedom is not a commodity like a beef roast to be parceled out in pounds and ounces or sold at auction to bidders but a right granted all americans by god and the u s constitution now and forevermore for refusing to sell her birthright and that of ultimately all the people of cambridge and of this nationfor half a loaf of freedom gloria richardson won the enmity of racists and their numerous editorialists everywhere but she also won the everlasting gratitude of all those with vision enough to know that freedom cannot be compromised now a year after cambridge was first catapulted into the world limelight it is relatively quiet and comparatively peaceful there but all the people who in any way were touched by their towns moment of history know that neither the town nor any of them can ever be the same again the negroes however poor or deprived walk a little taller and considerably straighter knowing that they are men and women and that they now have power as well as dignity the whites whether rich or poor racist or otherwise understandperhaps for the first timethat cambridge is not alone their town that they must share its problems its responsibilities and its glories with all those people on the other side of race street in time of course only the archivists will remember gloria richardson those who come after her who reap the rewards of her labors will accept as their just due and rightly sotheir participation in the total life of their community such is the way of things and in sliding into a kind of obscurity gloria richardson will be taking her honored place in a long and illustrious line of negro women who have served their race and their nation above and beyond the call of duty indeed she is only one of a group of valiant leaders who in just the past decade have brought added lustre and importance to the deservedly vaunted image of the negro woman her sistersinstruggle include daisy bates the arkansas lady who led the nine little rock children through the long bitter violent seige at the high school where hate defied even the national guard but eventually surrendered to courage and the business ends of bayonets rosa parks a mild little seamstress with a motherly mien who made up her mind one morning that she was either a woman like any other or else she was nothing at all and when told to move to the rear of a montgomery alabama bus chose to put up her stakes and because of her decision launched the old capitol of the confederacy on its long slow painful journey toward becoming a decent place in which to live diane nash bevel a beautiful broth of a girl who understood as so few like her have ever understood before or are likely to understand again that every single human being in this country who calls himself a negro from insurance magnate to porter from almost white to blackest black is threatened and diminished by any act or law or ruse which arbitrarily withholds from any man any part of his rights as a citizen and as a man and who wrapped her beauty in sackcloth and plunged openeyed into the heart of the racial storm braving the fire hoses and the snarling dogs and filthy jails from nashville to jackson so that the oppressed might know that they are not forgotten and thatto borrow a wellworn phraseall they have to lose are their chains it has been said that revolution or indeed any great conflict breeds men with the necessary dimensions for leadership and the negro revolution is no exception to the ranks of the old guard leadershiproy wilkins james farmer a philip randolph whitney young jrhave been added the fine minds and special abilities of relative newcomers like martin_luther_king jr wyatt t walker james forman robert moses and john lewis they are free in the sense that they are unafraid in the sense that they know what they are doing and are confident that one fine day the nation that now resists their efforts to help it realize its own dearest dreams will have grown enough in maturity to be grateful this is indeed a new kind of negro man he arrived at this place over a rugged tortuous route beset with every conceivable danger and along the way he had only one ally one helpmate without whom he would have perished this friend this lover this savior was his woman somehowthrough a strength of character and endurance which seem in restrospect more than human she managed to endow him against all odds in spite of a culture which deliberately demeaned him with a sense of selfrespect and dignity because of her the greatgrandsons of men who were owned by other men and who were never intended to share with their owners the joys and responsibilities of normal family life stand now as paragons of manhood these bright young men of surpassing charity who possess hope and faith in truly admirable measure have brought real meaning to an old and abused concept the concept of love to their country now and to the world they offer examples of how men of all faiths and colors and races may live together in peace and with honor they nobly carry the torch borne so long and so well by their women and why is the negro woman  different how did she get to be that way why has her influence on negro men been so great and so farreaching why has her role been so crucial in the struggle for equality the answers to these questions lie in american historyin those chapters few historians dare write so damning and revealing are they of dark and secret places in the american psyche dr e franklin frazier the late author of the definitive book on the negro family helped to explain the negro womans role during the period of slavery the biological tie between the negro mother and her offspring was the only human relationship among the slaves that could not be disregarded altogether he wrote after emancipation when the whole social fabric of life crumbled and the very economic basis of negro existence was destroyed it was the negro woman often alone with her children but always aiding her husband when there was one who made the survival of the negro possible even when the negro men began to assert themselves for a brief period in politics but more especially in the negros independent church organizations and lodges the negro woman became the main support of the institutional life of the negro during the years of strife and struggle of negroes for rights as citizens or even to be treated as mere human beings when negro men were lynched and not permitted to play the nor mal masculine role in an american culture the negro woman achieved a position of dominance and dignity in the lexicon of southern folklore negro branch a popular proposition holds that only white men and negro women have ever been free the freedom of the white man of course was absolute the freedom of the negro woman on the other hand was interpreted in terms of her special role in the societyas a kind of omnipresent guardiangoddess both servant and mistress wetnurse and concubine possessor of a unique power born of an intimacy as terrible as it was tender the white woman mother of her race dwelled in the cloudy sphere of myth imprisoned by the proposition that she was pure while the negro man the black lurking shadow of conscience became the eternal enemy the living breathing hotblooded threat to the regions delicately constructed house of mirrors and to the white mans mastery of his own soul the white mans ascendancy in his own fantasy demanded the degradation of the black man and so it was it was left to the woman of this degraded man to rise to those heights forbidden him and this she did knowing in her great wisdom that the sons of her loins inevitably must rise with her however late or scarred she rose she became mary church terrell the stately district of columbia schoolmarm who at the turn of this century showed a whole generation of embattled young people how to carry the struggle against racial bigotry she was mary mcleod bethune v homely little carolina waif whe built a college to train the souths despairing youth and went on to serve the nation in its greatest hour of need as advisor to the wartime president and she is pauli murray yale university law school professor lorraine hansberry playwright jeanne l noble city college of new york counselor and constance baker motley naacp attorney having long carried the beacon for her disadvantaged man the negro woman serves beside him now that he stands firm and tall on his own feet she is there on the picket lines doing battle in the pta forums and prodding reluctant boards of education in the dangerous rural areas of mississippi and georgia she is there leading the way to the polls and serving time in the jails for her pains and on another front she is awakening a welcoming world to her beauty broadening the scope and meaning of the word the whole american society today stands at the borders of a new frontier in human relationships and it has only to step over to regain for the world a new hope and a new vision if it happens that the american society can bring itself to make this move it will owe much of the rich rewards it finds to the courage and determination of the negro woman

south when religious members of the slave community absented themselves from the sinful activities of the more secularly inclined however just as the jordan had changed in the minds of a great many negroes to something immediate and material so these rent parties were no longer sinful but vulgar or at least wasteful i can see my grandfather now making such a pronouncement instead of the fabled existential happy carefree negroes there were now some black people who were interested in what was around them and how to get to it the people who wanted the white mans god had made these same separations in the old societyi am bound for the promised landbut they had long been losing ground in the new cities negroes appeared whose promised land was where they were now if only they could save a little money send the kids to school get a decent place to live    the further movement into america and this movement this growing feeling that developed among negroes was led and fattened by a growing black middle class the migration north was of course the main reason for the rise of a black middle class in america since there was in the north that space that the increasing subtlety of the paternalistic society allowed there was greater room for progress but even in the slave society there had been the beginnings of a privileged class of negroes the house servants were extended privileges that were never enjoyed by the majority of field niggers the house nigger not only assimilated massas ideas and attitudes at a more rapid rate but his children were sometimes allowed to learn trades and become artisans and craftsmen these artisans and craftsmen made up the bulk of the  black freedmen at the beginning of the civil warthese house servants as i have mentioned were the first to accept the masters religion and were the first black ministers and proselytizers for the new god the christian church in slave times represented not only a limited way into america but as it came to be the center of most of the slaves limited social activities it also produced a new ruling class among the slaves the officials of the church the church officials the house servants and the freedmen were the beginnings of the black middle class which represented and represents not only an economic condition but as is true with any stratum of any society a definite way of looking at the society in which it exists the black middle class from its inception possibly ten seconds after the first africans were herded off the boat has formed almost exclusively around the proposition that it is better not to be black in a country where being black is a liability all the main roads into america have always been fashioned by the members of the black middle class not as products of a separate culture but as vague featureless americans i pointed out earlier why negroes in north america were able to adopt the customs and habits of the masters so much more quickly than their brothers throughout the rest of the americas but still another factor was that from the very beginning of afroamerican culture in north america there have always been negroes who thought that the best way for the black man to survive was to cease being black first it was the stench of africa these aspirant americans wanted to erase then the early history of the negro in america the african gods were thrown into disrepute first and that was easy since they were banned by the whites anyway as always the masses of black men adapted rather than completely assimilated appropriated rather than traded one god or one culture for another the freedmans bureau published none of the secular songs of the negro but only the religious songs and then those that were quite readily recognizable as pickups from pale white protestant hymns it was the growing black middle class who believed that the best way to survive in america would be to disappear completely leaving no trace at all that there had ever been an africa or a slavery or even finally a black man this was the only way they thought to be citizens for the creoles and mulattoes of the south this was easier there was a quickly discernible difference between themselves and their darker brother since it was the closeness of their fathers and mothers to the masters that had produced them in the first place many of the freedmen were mulattoes and many of the mulatto freedmen and gens de couleur even had black slaves themselves but the darker members of the fledgling bourgeoisie had to work out their salvations under much more difficult circumstances the real black bourgeoisie was always lashed irrevocably to the burden of color hence the hopelessness and futility of erasing all connections to the black society when it was always impossible to erase the most significant connection of all many freedmen had moved north even during slavery they made up the majority of the northern black middle class even after the emancipation the movement north brought not only the impoverished masses but also many members of the middle class some because they thought to make an even deeper entry into america some like the church people because they had to follow their flocks or they would be out of luck whole churches moved north and the first thing many of the poor negroes did when they reached that promised land was to pool their meager resources and set up their church again and get their preacher a good place to live the storefront church was a northern phenomenon simply because in the cities these country people found it was impossible to just buy some wood and build a church as they had done in the south and many churches such as the one my parents went to progressed as their members moved up the economic ladder in the industrial north from storefront or apartment to huge albeit quixotic structures the middleclass churches were always pushing for the complete assimilation of the negro into white america middleclass baptist and methodist churches strove with all their might to do away with any of the black appropriations of christianity that rural southern negroes had affected a white christianity was after all the reason for existence of these churches and their directors always kept this in their minds many churches split once they moved north because of conflicts that arose among the members as to whether they wanted the church black or white many of the new emigrants had to set up churches of their own because they were not welcome in the black middleclass churches of the north in the s in beaver falls pennsylvania where my grandfather and his flock moved from alabama they had to build their own the tabernacle baptist church when they found that they were unwelcome in the established black baptist church because they were southerners the black residents of beaver falls wanted nothing to do with the south and its terrible memories of slavery they would cut off their own people to have a go at america the morality of the black middle class was not completely the result of a spontaneous reaction to white america it was also carefully nurtured and cultivated by certain elements of white america behind a great many manifestations of the temperament of the black middle class sits the carefully washed wisdom of the early protestant missionaries who not only founded the black christian churches but also quite consciously instilled the postrenaissance religious dogmas into their new black congregations the educational  philanthropies were also attended and shaped in their beginnings by these same missionary elements who sought to show the savage heathens how through thrift prayer and work they might somehow enter into the kingdom of heaven even though it might be through the back door the paradox and perhaps the crudest psychological and cultural imposition of all was the inculcation of this puritan ethos on a people whose most elegant traditions were the complete antithesis of it of course the poor and the unlettered were the last to respond to this gift but the strivers after america the neophytes of the black middle class responded as quickly as they could in effect the way to puritan protestant heaven only existed for the black man who could pretend he was also a protestant and a puritan when the supernatural goal of the society black and white yielded to the more practical positivistic ideals of industrialized twentiethcentury america salvation belonged to those who realized that the worth of man was his ability to make money the black middle class responded to this call as it would to any call that would insure it respectability and prestige and their concomitant privilege but religious or positivist the adjustment necessary for the black man to enter completely into a white american society was a complete disavowal that he or his part of the culture had ever been anything else but american the cruel penalty for this kind of situation is the sociocultural temperament of america today where the very things that have served to erect a distinctive culture on this continent are most feared and misunderstood by the majority of americans  but the fact was that by the time of the move north and precipitated in part because of it the oppression the negro knew america capable ofhis indestructible bond with this countryand the space and light he saw it capable of producing sat dictating the narrow path most negroes could travel on their way toward citizenship for negroes the oppression was an historical imperative informing each response they could make to whatever situation the society proposed but their everwidening knowledge of the country and its most profound emotional characteristics made any withdrawal impossible even the poorer negro had moved to the point where he thought perhaps he might one day live in this country as a person of certain economic capability with almost complete disregard of the color of his skin this is a brilliant yet desperately conceived hypothesis but its validity has yet to be demonstrated however the moralreligious tradition of the black middle class is a weird mixture of cultural opportunism and fear it is a tradition that is capable of reducing any human conceit or natural dignity to the barest form of social outrage it is uncomfortably symbolic that there were some negroes absent from the rent and barbecue parties just as it is analogous of the social microcosm that at twelve oclock in the old tin type hall in new orleans around the turn of the century when the ball was getting right the more respectable negroes who did attend went home then bolden played a number called dont go a way nobody and the dancing got rough when the orchestra settled down to the slow blues the music was mean and dirty as tin type roared full blast it was not only the creoles purely political made social response to a negro music but the feeling of the black people themselves that there were things much more important than the natural expression of a vital culture in the north before the migration that hurled all the deepest blacks of southern negro culture into america at large the northern negroes had to a great extent secured themselves a leaky boat of security from these reminders of the slave culture most of the negro population in new york then around  had either been born there or had been in the city so long they were fully acclimated they were trying to forget the traditions of the south they were trying to emulate the whites you couldnt deliver a package to a negros front door you had to go down to the cellar door and negroes dressed to go to work they changed into work clothes when they got there you usually werent allowed to play blues and boogie woogie in the average negro middleclass home that music supposedly suggested a low element and the big bands with the violins flutes piccolos didnt play them either one of the funniest and most cruelly absurd situations to develop because of the growth and influence of a definable black middle class in america is the case of black swan records black swan was founded and run by a negro harry pace during the early twenties it was the first negroowned record company in the country and it quickly grew into a moneymaker its success based to a large extent on the popularity of its star performer a young girl named ethel waters black swan also recorded numerous other blues performers and advertised its products as the only genuine colored record others are only passing for colored a wild turnabout but many negroes especially those in business brought pressure on pace to change his position since they thought that the job of a negro recording company would be to show how dignified negroes really were    and of course blues were not dignified pace tried to use all kinds of other material that was not strictly blues for this reason ethel waters with her torchy pop style was a godsend but the popularity of the company waned because the audience to which the records were largely aimed did not care as much about the dignity of its musical tastes as the negro business com munity finally black swan was sold to paramount a white company which had no qualms about recording the rougher less dignified blues performers the space the city provided grew quickly vertical the idea of society or at least divisions within a social milieu grew more common among negroes the earlier mulattofreedmanhouse servantfield servant division that became so fixed within the slave society was of course broken down but the new strata forming within the free black societies proved to be equally as rigid the new society based its divisions almost completely upon acquisition reflecting and reacting to the changed psyche of twentiethcentury america in the black society the change was effected almost exclusively by the mass movement north and the openness of the new industrial culture the older stricter divisions of black society based on certain mythological characteristics of colorcaste and the importance of less menial positions within the slave culture were broken down because many field niggers and money men darkskinned africanlooking negroes could go into mr fords factories and make  a day just like a white man the white societys need for negro laborers and the resulting scramble into the great northern cities smeared the caste lines of an older black society and began to form a sprawling bourgeoisie based on the pay checkan almost exact duplication of the way in which the earlier caste system of white america was debased but the white society still had some semblance of casteits first families intact although frequently as heads or captains of industry negroes could not become captains of industry and could never have belonged to any first families except perhaps as family retainers so it was the professional mendoctors lawyers ministerswho were the heads of the new black society and these people wanted more than anything in life to become citizens they were not ever satisfied with being freedmen or former slaves they wanted no connection with that stain on americas past and what is more they wanted the right which they thought they could earn by moving sufficiently away from the blacker culture to look on that stain as objectively as possible when they had to and to refer to it from the safety of the basitions of the white middle class they did not even want to be accepted as themselves they wanted any self which the mainstream dictated and the mainstream always dictated and this black middle class in turn tried always to dictate that self or this image of a whiter negro to the poorer blacker negroes the effects of these attempts by the black middle class to whiten the black culture of this country are central to my further discussions on the sociological significance of the changes in negro music but i think it might be useful here to consider also the effects this whitening had in other cultural areas i think it is not fantastic to say that only in music has there been any significant negro contribution to a formal american culture for the most part most of the other contributions made by black americans in the areas of painting drama and literature have been essentially undistinguished the reasons for this tragic void are easy to understand if one realizes one important idea about the existence of any black culture in this country the only negroes who found themselves in a position to pursue some art especially the art of literature have been members of the negro middle class only negro music because perhaps it drew its strength and beauty out of the depths of the black mans soul and because to a large extent its traditions could be carried on by the lowest classes of negroes has been able to survive the constant and willful dilutions of the black middle class and the persistent calls to oblivion made by the mainstream of the society of course that mainstream wrought very definite and very constant changes upon the form of the american negros music but the emotional significance and vitality at its core remain to this day unaltered it was the one vector out of african culture impossible to eradicate it signified the existence of an afroamerican and the existence of an afroamerican culture and in the evolution of form in negro music it is possible to see not only the evolution of the negro as a cultural and social element of american culture but also the evolution of that culture itself the coon shout proposed one version of the american negro and of america bessie smith proposed another swing and bebop as i shall attempt to point out propose still another but the point is that both these versions are accurate and informed with a legitimacy of emotional concern nowhere available in say what is called negro literature the reason is as terrifying as it is simple the middleclass black man whether he wanted to be a writer or a painter or a doctor developed an emotional allegiance to the middleclass middlebrow culture of america that obscured or actually made hideous any influence or psychological awareness that seemed to come from outside what was generally acceptable to a middleclass white man especially if those influences were identifiable as coming from the most despised group in the country the black middle class wanted no subculture nothing that could connect them with the poor black man or the slave literature for most negro writers for instance was always an example of culture in the narrow sense of cultivation or sophistication in an individual within their own group the negro artist because of his middleclass background carried an artificial social   burden as the best and most intelligent of negroes and usually entered into the serious arts to exhibit his social gracesas a method or means of displaying his participation in the serious aspects of western culture to be a writer was to be cultivated in the stunted bourgeois sense of the word it was also to be a quality black man not merely an ordinary nigger early negro novelists such as charles chesnutt otis shackleford sutton griggs even though he was more militant pauline hopkins produced works that were potboilers for the growing negro middle class the books were also full of the same prejudices and conceits that could be found in the novels of their models the white middle class the contempt for the lowerclassed negroes found in these novels by black novelists is amazing and quite blatant and as robert a bone points out it must be understood at once that the early negro novelists believed substantially in the myth of anglosaxon superiority pauline hopkins writes surely the negro race must be productive of some valuable specimens if only from the infusion which amalgamation with a superior race must eventually bring  chesnutts and griggss heroes were usually refined afroamericans as bone shows further in several of the early novels there is a stock situation in which a refined afroamerican is forced to share a jim crow car with dirty boister ous and drunken negroes the idea of the separation the strata had developed within the group the thin division of field hand from house servant had widened and the legacy of the house servant was given voice constantly in the work of the early negro writers as bone says when all the sound and fury of these novels has evaporated what remains is an appeal for an alliance between the better class of colored people and the quality white folks  and an amen could be heard to that sentiment throughout the rising black churches of the north of course the negro novelist ceased to be so blatantly patronizing and disparaging of most negroes when the social climate in the country itself became more liberal no longer would a member of the negro middle class be idiotic enough to write as shackleford once did in his novel lilliam simmons she could understand why jim crow cars and all other forms of segregation in the south were necessary but she could not feel that it was fair to treat all colored people alike because all were not alike by the twenties spurred again by the movement of negroes to the north and the change that had made of a basically agricultural country an industrial giant thereby transforming the core of the negro population from farm workers into a kind of urban proletariat a great change also took place among negro artists and intellectuals even though they were still fundamentally the products of the negro middle class and still maintained rather firmly many emotional and intellectual ties with it the negro novelists of the twenties at least began to realize that the earlier attitudes of the black middle class were the most agonizing remnants of the slave mentality it was now that the middle class demanded through its spokesmen the novelists and the more intrepid educators at least equality it was the beginning of what was called the negro renaissance and the emergence of what alain locke called the new negro but if now the more cultivated members of the black middle class began to realize that the old stance of whiter negroes could not effect an entrance into the mainstream of american society these writers in fact rebelled against the entire concept of a slavish disparagement of the negro by negroes as a prerequisite for such privilege this rebellion still took form within the confines of the american middleclass mind even if those confines had been somewhat broadened by the internationalism imposed upon the country by world war i even the term new negro for all its optimistic and rebellious sound still assumes that it is a different kind of negro who is asking for equality not old rastus the slave there is still for all the race pride and race consciousness that these spokesmen for the negro renaissance claimed the smell of the dry rot of the middleclass negro mind  the idea that somehow negroes must deserve equality the spirit of this renaissance was divided as an emotional entity into three separate and easily identifiable reactions corresponding to the cultural stratum of the particular negroes who had to interpret it the rising middle classspawned intelligentsia invented the term new negro and the idea of the negro renaissance to convey to the white world that there had been a change of tactics as to how to climb onto the bandwagon of mainstream american life the point here is that this was to be conveyed to white america it was another conscious reaction to that white america and another adaptation of the middleclass negros selfconscious performance for his ever appreciative white audience there was a loud sudden but understandably strained appreciation for things black by this intelligentsia the harlem school of writers attempted to glorify the lives of the black masses but only succeeded in making their lives seem exotic as literary themes it produced a generation and a tradition of lafcadio hearns the reproduction of a black america as real as the white america these writers seemed to sense as the norm was never realized a white man carl van vechten mechanized and finally straitjacketed a good part of the negro renaissance when he wrote the novel nigger heaven which many negro writers have never ceased to imitate  for poorer negroes as i have mentioned before marcus garveys back to africa movement represented the renewed sense of race pride the concept of the new negro represented for the middleclass intelligentsia garvey thought and persuaded a great body of the negro masses that equality could never be achieved in the united states and the negro should seek to embrace his older truer african traditions and eventually set up an independent black state in africa although garvey ultimately failed his call to mother africa inspired thousands of negroes though of course the middle class would have nothing to do with him not only because it did not want to be associated with a movement that involved the poorer negro but also because any mention of africa only conjured up frightening visions of undigested tarzan movies the middle class reacted to the growing nationalism among poorer negroes and the intelligentsia by adopting a milder kind of nationalism themselves and even though most were startled at first by the kind of radicalism that the niagara movement which led to the eventual establishment of the naacp and people like w e b dubois represented they did begin to protest in earnest about jim crow and the brotherhood of man they eventually took over such organizations as the naacp aided by the dependence of such organizations on the philanthropies of white liberals and molded them to their own purposes but from the beginning when the black middle class began to realign itself toward an american from which they could ask equality instead of privilege they had oriented themselves as wouldbe citizens rather than freedmen or exslaves and this is the fundamental difference perhaps even the single line of demarcation separating the black middle class from the rest of the negroes living in the united states the middle class accepts the space the openness and or liberalism of twentiethcentury america as the essential factor of its existence in this country as citizens but when the recognized barriers to such citizenship are reached when all their claims to equality with the rest of america on the one hand and superiority on the other to their own black brothers seem a useless and not wholly idealistic delusion because in the end they are still regarded by this society as only negroes they are content with the name secondclass citizens this at least shows them with a foot in the door if somehow still having to battle to get the rest of themselves in always in behind the calm facade of white middleclass america for the black intelligentsia the term secondclass citizen was a meaningless hoax and the poorer negro never even considered the idea of citizenship as something that could be extended in this country to a person with a black skin the poor negro always remembered himself as an exslave and used this as the basis of any dealing with the mainstream of american society the middleclass black man bases his whole existence on the hopeless hypothesis that no one is supposed to remember that for almost three centuries there was slavery in america that the white man was the master and the black man the slave this knowledge however is at the root of the legitimate black culture of this country it is this knowledge with its attendant muses of selfdivision selfhatred stoicism and finally quixotic optimism that informs the most meaningful of afroamerican music my burdens so heavy i cant hardly see seems like everybody is down on me an thats all right i dont worry oh there will be a better day the most expressive negro music of any given period will be an exact reflection of what the negro himself is it will be a portrait of the negro in america at that particular time who he thinks he is what he thinks america or the world to be given the circumstances prejudices and delights of that particular america negro music and negro life in america were always the result of a reaction to and an adaptation of whatever american negroes were given or could secure for themselves the idea of ever becoming americans in the complete social sense of that word would never have been understood by negro slaves even after the emancipation such a concept would have seemed like an unamusing fantasy to most negroes since many times the very term america must have meant for them a place they dont want you america for negroes was always divided into black and white master and slave and as such could not simply be called america and so there have been since slavery two americas a white america and a black america both responsible to and for the other one oppressed the other the oppressor but an even more profound difference between these two americas has been their awareness of each other or the degree to which the one america is aware of the other the white america has never had more than a cursory knowledge of black america even during the days of the negro renaissance as i have pointed out the knowledge of black america obtained by white america for all the talk to the contrary was never more than superficial but the black american has always had to know what was on the white mans mind even if as a slave he had no full knowledge of what america really was the negros adaptation to american life has been based since the emancipation on his growing knowledge of america and his increasing acquaintance with the workings of the white mans mind the negro american had always sought to adapt himself to the  other america and to exist as a casual product of this adaptation but this central concept of afroamerican culture was discarded by the middle class after the move north and the sophistication that that provided it was assimilation the middle class desired not only to disappear within the confines of a completely white america but to erase forever any aspect of a black america that had ever existed the separation i spoke of between the freedman and the citizen is basic to any understanding of the evolution of black america from a relatively homogenous social cultural and geographical unit existing strictly apart from white america negroes became a group of diverse americans forming a psychological chain that begins with a complete awareness of and dependence on what is now called a folk culture and moves to a completely antithetical extreme to those negroes who are completely dependent upon the culture of mainstream america it is a psychological chain much like a spectrum that begins at deepest black and moves easily into american gray there was a period of transition however when for the majority of negroes the chain did not stretch completely into gray america but the separation the cleavage within black america was beginning to be quite apparent the beginning of this cleavage within black america was demonstrated in microcosm in new orleans even before the mass exodus of negroes northward new orleans with its coexisting complex of social cultural and racial influences predated the modern postworldwari northern city in many ways french spanish english african and caribbean cultures existed simultaneously within new orleans and all were thriving within what could be called the black society there was already the extreme cleavage i have mentioned based for the most part on socioethnic considerations most easily verified by color the creoles gens de couleur and mulattoes existed both socially and economically as the more generalized black middle class was to do in later years they encouraged the separation between themselves and their darker usually poorer halfbrothers and they emphasized this separation as formally as they could by trying to emulate as much as possible the white french culture of new orleans the downtown people acquired most of the european instrumental techniques and disparaged the vocal blues style that raged uptown in the black belt but the repressive segregation laws passed at the turn of the century forced the light people into closer social and economic relationships with the blacker culture and it was the connections engendered by this forced merger that produced a primitive jazz the black rhythmic and vocal tradition was translated into an instrumental music which utilized some of the formal techniques of european dance and march music later the merging of the southern blues tradition with the musical traditions of the northern negro produced an instrumental music similar in intent to the early jazz of new orleans and when the instrumental innovators themselves began to be heard in the north the music jazz had already developed further aided by the architectonic and technical ideas of ragtime into a more completely autonomous music the important idea here though is that the first jazzmen were from both sides of the fences from the darker blues tradition and a certain fixed sociocultural and most of the time economic stratum and also from the white creole tradition and its worship of what were certainly the ideals of a francoamerican middle class also the negroes who hired the blues men into their dance and society bands in the north were ofttimes byproducts of the desire of negroes to set up a black middle class so were many of the musicians who were influenced by the dirty way of playing this meant that as jazz developed after the early twenties in this country it could only be a music that would reflect the sociocultural continuum that had developed within negro america from blackest black to whitest white the jazz player could come from any part of that sociocultural spectrum but if he were to play a really moving kind of jazz he had to reflect almost all of the musical spectrum or at least combine sufficiently the older autonomous blues tradition with the musical traditions of the creoles or the ragtime orchestras of the north and thus jazz could not help but reflect the entire black society such a thing as a middleclass blues singer is almost unheard of it is it seems to me even a contradiction of terms jazz as it emerged and as it developed was based on this new widening of afroamerican culture in the best of jazz the freedmancitizen conflict is most nearly resolved because it makes use of that middle ground the space that exists as the result of any cleavage where both emotional penchants can exist as ideas of perhaps undetermined validity and not necessarily as ways of life first there was after the emancipation an america then there was a north and after world war i even places and sets of ideas that were not american that was in one sense as far as the blues would go as a completely autonomous music the blues as a fully integrated american experience was what was called classic blues publicly as american performers the great lady blues singers of the twenties brought blues to a social and cultural significance that it never has had before or since the jazz people took over from there blues in its most significant form again returned underground into the house parties and black cabarets that existed in the new black communities of the north with all  the wild unamerican abandon which was supposed to typify the premiddleclass negro society without the jazz players blues would have existed as an american music ie considered as such by the mainstream only during the time of the classic singers before their time and after it autonomous blues was the product of a subculture given the necessary social involvement with american culture negroes themselves would have drifted away from blues since it no longer was an exact reflection of their lives in america for the developing black middle class it was simply the mark of cain and just another facet of negroness which they wished to be rid of but jazz even with its weight of blues could make itself available as an emotional expression to the changing psyche of the modern negro just as in less expressive ways it made itself available to the modern american white man during the twenties when jazz was first beginning to be heard in the north and in whatever diverse presentations throughout america it was still in a period of transition the older blues people were still coming into the northern cities the classic singers were at their peaks and the newer city blues was also developing as the expression of a new subculture as well as the spontaneous piano music boogie woogie or the eastern stride piano style that was concomitant with it but the jazz players were also coming into these towns and a whole new generation of negroes was born into this transitional culturethe first generation with a preponderance of citizens rather than exslaves these were the people who had to decide what was to be done with blues and what weight it would have in their lives at the same time there were still a great many negroes who had known slavery personally or knew it as the emotional idea on which any experience of america had to be based all these negroes existed as black america the extremes were the rentparty people at the one end of black society and the various levels of parvenu middle class at the other jazz represented perhaps the link connecting the two if they were to be connected the verticality of the city began to create two separate secularities and the blues had to be divided among them if it was going to survive at all
