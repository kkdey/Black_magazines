would you want your w daughter to marry one what kind of a question is that and why do you keep asking lately we have noticed that your daughters name crops up in every conversation concerning the rights of negroes last year approximately marriages were reported in the u s of this number some were negroes no statistics are available as to how many of the latter married into your race one reason might be that many of the ones you fear as a soninlaw were actually as white as your daughter one thing is certain it is obvious that none of them married your daughter either because your daughter wouldnt have one or one wouldnt have your daughter so whats your gripe now if the negro is the inferior creature you accuse him of being then your worries are over and your question goes begging surely your daughter must have a sense of smell therefore her nose should support your thesis that the negro stinks if the negros cranial capacity is a year throwback to the neanderthal man as you contend the only reason your daughter would accept such a creature as her lifes mate would be that she is equally deficient if that is the case then you should give your blessings to such a union even you will agree it would be better for her to be married to one than to snatch flies in an institution now because you are my brother and i use the term advisedly perhaps i can help you find comfort in your attempt to preserve the sanctity and virtue of your race and progeny your daughter need not marry one if you follow a few guide lines i shall present them gratuitously an examination of the total marriage population of our country reveals that statistics are in your comer if one could determine the number of marriages involving negroes only and negroes and whites the percentage of interracial marriages would seem insignificant it would likewise be to your advantage to lower this percentage still further by raising your fair daughter on a farm data on hand reveals that intermarriage rates are higher in urban areas than in rural areas of the states it would do well for you to live in one of the states having statutes that make interracial marriages a crime this is true of all southern states and in all but five of the nonsouthern states west of the mississippi but only in indiana among the northern states east of the mississippi not only is intermarriage prohibited in mississippi but this state has a criminal statute for punishing anyone for publishing printing or circulating any literature in favor of or urging interracial marriage or social equality it appears then that of all the states in the union the land of the sweet magnolias would ideally serve as the remover of all your fears indeed in this state in spite of the entrance of james meredith into ole miss your daughter might grow up to be acclaimed as several others have been before her miss america no pun intended before you decide to move it is only fair to warn you that there are some states and cities that you must avoid at all cost stay clear of new york chicago detroit and boston interracial marriages in these areas rose to a notorious high of per cent during the past years if you are honest in protecting your daughter from this abominable statistic go south old man go south with apologies to horace greeley some northern states however may be entered with relative safety in fact back home in indiana no matter how much one might be in love with your daughter or how much your daughter might be in love with one no justice of the peace judge or clergyman can legally perform such a ceremony any person who forges racial strains together in the unholy chains of matrimony is subject to a fine imprisonment or both a study of interracial marriages raises another point you should consider the possibility of your daughter marrying a negro is raised somewhat if she has been previously married particularly if she has been married more than twice to a gentlemen of her own ethnic background it appears then that the best contribution you can make in conserving your racial stock is to make sure that her first marriage is for real by all means if she is predisposed to get rid of her first mate find her a man any man as long as his face is white lets face factseach time she gets a divorce she is moving in the direction of your nightmare another safeguard at your disposal is for you to become a millionaire the daughters of rich men will think twice before risking being disinherited it becomes most necessary at this point to protect her from your own history in the field of race relations she must never learn that you yourself are a firm believer in segregation in the streets and integration between the sheets consequently your argument to keep the race pure is suspect the late william e b du bois once expressed it thusly the rape which you gentlemen have inflicted on helpless black women in defiance of your own laws is written on the foreheads of two million mulattoes and written in ineffable blood of course we recognize that this is not viewed by you as a breach of morals what has been true for the white gander obviously must be avoided by the black gander but doesnt it strike you as unfair that black geese in the past were forced to bear mixed geese it would be interesting to know what your daughter would think if she realized that a few of the black boys toward whom she now throws flirtatious glances are actually her blood brothers here is where i join you in fearing her marrying one such a marriage would be incestuous wouldnt you agree now i hope this doesnt shake you but what is needed today is an effort to remove the restrictive laws barring intermarriage from the statutes let me reassure you the reason is not what you are presently thinking it is not so much that we desire access to your daughter as much as we insist on access to dignity we refuse to believe that we are an inferior people in spite of your daughter you see we must do away with the statutes for the honor of our own daughters as it stands now my daughter has no recourse to law to protect her from your exploitation in fact she must bear your illegitimate child while i cannot even use my shotgun to give my grandson a name your daughter is surrounded by protective instruments ranging from fines shotguns imprisonment under law and lord help us lynching outside of the law now i must be fair the birth of illegitimate children as a result of mixed alliances has decreased radically in the past decade several factors brought this about in the antebellum days where slavemasters had unrestricted access to their slaves such children were numerous after emancipation the negro was cemented in a caste system by laws and codes of en forced segregation currently the negros increasing interest in his own racial pride discourages promiscuity between races to these factors can be added an almost universal knowledge of the use of contraceptives in his book the american dilemma gunnar myrdal made an acute observation in the negros drive for civil_rights much of the opposition derived from the white mans reluctance to allow his daughter to view the entire prospective in fact myrdal ranked the white mans arguments for segregation in the following order intermarriage social intercourse such as dancing and bathing etc segregated facilities schools churches political disenfranchisement equal job opportunities and housing the negros rank order in his argument for civil_rights is exactly inverse to that of the white mans in reading the racists fears in reverse order then his daughter is found at the bottom of the list now please we are not suggesting that we are disrespectful of your kin we only regret that she is not as important to us as she is to you indeed were sorry but miss anne does not fall into the category of our present needs even if she did since so many of us are unemployed we could not support her in the manner to which she has been accustomed when civil_rights issues are raised in congress senators from the south rise up to filibuster whatever other argument they might present they are actually rising in defense of your daughter it would do well for them to remember that the negros interest does not incline toward your progeny perhaps a letter from you to them reminding them of this fact might shorten their debate whereas more time may be given to such matters as cutting your taxes now i must admit many of us have misled you negro leaders have been continually asked what their viewpoints are on intermarriage most of their answers have been vague neither condoning nor condemning forget it you see most of their thinking is in the area of organizing demonstrations marches on washington sitins picketing etc they have no time to be thinking of the future welfare of your daughter so they havent given it much thought to give serious thought to your daughters nuptial potentials would drain them of the intellectual stamina so sorely needed by the negro masses some of them will even agree with you and say such marriages are unwise even so dont be misled such an answer does not mean they are admitting to negro inferiority what they are saying in essence is that they recognize the infantile emotions you display on the subject you may rest assured that these answers are given as contributions to your own mental health finally if your daughter can break through the maze of your maniacal fears and the negros disinterest if she can bridge the gaps outlined in this discourse more power to her if she dares to cast her lot with her sisters in the per cent and if she risks bearing children to the trash heaps of denial as promised by your prejudice feel proud indeed give her your blessing few fathers can boast of daughters with such rare intestinal fortitude about your childs iq what you should know testing has been one of the boons to modern education that has aided the teacher in aiding the child but like many a blessing when handled improperly can become a curse in the hands of the unskilled or uninformed the information regarding a childs ability or lack of ability can become damaging rather than helpful exactly what is an iq or intelligence quotient technically it is the ratio between the chronological and mental age if a child has a mental age of eight years months and a chronological age of years months his iq is a figure derived from dividing the first figure by the second this child is considered slightly above average if the reverse were true that is if his mental age is while his chronological age is the resultant quotient is and he is considered slow a score of is average from is very bright above that is considered genius however the parent must keep in mind that these are approximations and guides to potentiality rather than hardandfast guarantees when a fond parent presents herself at a guidance office and demands to know her childs iq she is elated when she is told that he has a rating she automatically envisions honors piled upon her offsprings head not listening as the advisor tells her that the testing indicates a high potential which the child will have to work to fulfill it may also mean the child works faster or can absorb faster than others but without the proper study attitudes and habits her child may be like the hare in the aesops fable surprisingly surpassed by some plodding tortoise unwittingly she may pass on attitudes to the child that cause him to sit back and wait for good things to come to him or she may cause him to develop a superiority complex that makes him a burden rather than an addition to a classroom intellectual snobs have not been an unknown quantity even in second grade there are some rare youngsters who can take this kind of information for what its worth as one remarked now that i have my genius license where do i go from here conversely the parent whose child is average may be very disappointed as though normalcy was something rather disgraceful the average child may produce far more than average results so much depending upon personality and drive it is a combination of factors that makes the individual what he is as a contributor to our society and we must not fall into the trap of categorizing a youngster through a series of tests feeling that we can mathematically predict his future so far testing measures mainly literate skills and except for a few new tests on the market does not even attempt to measure creative ability a child may write beautiful prose that is badly misspelled and devoid of commas and will score far below the child who knows mechanics yet any publisher can tell you that proofreaders are not a rare commodity while good writers are oftentimes the youngster who does well on the older standard tests can absorb facts and reevaluate them this does not mean he can tear apart accepted reasoning and create anything new thomas edison probably would have scored low on standard testing he was a pragmatist who had little use for accepted theory performing feats that bookbright and literate scientists assured him were theoretically impossible he often remarked that when he needed certain types of brains he bought them by the dozen it was because of this that he appreciated charles steinmetz who had a unique combination of creative and absorbed brilliance einstein too achieved eminence because he brought new ideas to mathematics and physics ripping away theory that had existed since newton it was the freshness of his conceptual vision that opened the fantastic new worlds of nuclear science with his lack of interest and absentmindedness we can only speculate on the testing results he would have achieved the english teacher often smiles wryly as she admits to herself that jack london never attended high school that oneill flunked playwriting at harvard that jack kerouac writes runon sentences fracturing almost every standard grammatical rule it is true that we live in a world where a high scholastic rating insures a college degree which is an almost automatic entree into the upper economic echelonsbut we will find men and women at the top who did not get there by the high iq highway school administrators do not want to pass on statistical information rashly because they are so aware of the danger of tagging a child as average slow or superior in many schools even teachers can not have such information unless a child has become a problem because even among teachers there can be the one who says oh johnny only has a iq he couldnt get a in english id better lower the mark johnny may have a iq but he may have overaverage language ability perhaps there is a nonlanguage factor in his skills that lowered his general average peter on the other hand may have a iq and not do as well in english as johnny because conversely the nonlanguage factors raised his average or perhaps even though both language and nonlanguage abilities are high peter is not an avid student and only does well what he can do easily one figure that betokens iq can not tell the whole story because of the complexity of the human element the results of any one test can only give one facet of the complete picture and the results of any one test appraised alone can not be taken as conclusive it may only be taken as one indication of the direction in which the evaluation is going the most important factors in an achievement test improperly called an iq test are the separate scores of the childin language and nonlanguage areas and in separate subject fields it is most important for the parent to become cognizant of the childs positive abilities and conversely to become aware of his weaknesses so that aid may be offered through further diagnostic and remedial testing rare indeed is the child who needs no help or guidance the very bright sometimes lack humility or are socially immature the average child sometimes needs a buildup of his confidence and a retraining in basic skills a slow child may need most of all patience and understanding and appreciation for the good qualities he has above all the parent must keep in mind that testing is a guide and an aid not an end in itself that will provide a child with an automatic passport to intellectual greatness the negroes greatest gift to american society there used to be a number of pamphlets and documentary films expounding on the theme americaa great melting pot for foreign peoples inevitably there would be a section devoted to the contributions of the various minority groups that emigrated here the germans would be cited for their brewing talents the jews for their scientists and financiers the italians for their operas the irish for their politicians and the negroes for their contributions to labor and to music these groups were always shown as living together in peace and productivity making america great strong and democratic as i looked at america from a more mature viewpoint it became patently clear to me that the united states was not a great melting pot i was particularly impressed with this fact after spending some time in new york new york had always been used as an example of this concept with its teeming millions of many national origins it was in new york that i discovered what was in fact a composite of many different pots of nationality groupings the vision of german and jew living side by side with negro and italian neighbors was for the most part just not true each of these ethnic entities had its own area its own little pot which was not too receptive to members of another immigrant group trespassing on the area they regarded as their own just as my thinking on the melting pot concept had to change as the facts of life were realistically shown to me so too did my estimation of the nesro contribution to america it is true that the ne it is true that the negro did supply much of the labor on which the early economic wealth of the united states was based cotton might not have become king in such a mighty fashion were it not for the forced efforts of the negro it is true that the negro has provided america with its only original and indigenous art form if we exclude that produced by the savages who were here before the first explorers these however are not the true measure of the contribution of the negro to america upon reading lerone bennetts before the mayflower the reader is indeed impressed with the many other areas in which the negro contributed his role in the revolutionary and civil wars was considerable and perhaps even vital certainly it was pervasive and helped to mould america and americans impressive as the contributions already mentioned may be they fall short of what historians will record as the most significant gift given to america by its black sometimes unwanted often mistreated citizens history shows that a civilization remains strong and vigorous as long as there is an energy a movement within it to keep it from becoming complacent selfsatisfied and selfrighteous this energy from within brings about a reevaluation by the citizens reevaluation brings about action action keeps the society alive alert and viable american society is organized on certain wellknown democratic precepts inscribed in the constitution the bill of rights and the declaration of independence if we allow these concepts to become invalid or weakened we are setting the stage for the dissolution of our society as set forth by these documents we are preparing the prologue for tyranny by a few and an abuse of power and authority by the demogogues who will inevitably follow the desertion of these concepts as a guide for the conduct of american policies it is at this point that the american negro vaults into prominence and is in a position to make his most important contribution to his country it is now up to the negro to see that these principles are kept alive and in force it is his supreme duty to himself and to america to press forward his peaceful democratic struggle for complete and absolute application of these principles recently in talking with a young man from finland i mentioned that i was very impressed with the concern so many overseas visitors displayed over the civil_rights issue he smiled and explained to me that it is true many such visitors are concerned genuinely over the plight of the negro but there are other considerations involved as well in the present international struggle between east and west america is pictured as the bastion of liberty liberality and democracy under the intense pressure of to days political affairs there is only one alternative to democracy and that is dictatorship if the united states fails to uphold the democratic way of life in its full sense then she invites dictatorship not only for herself but for the other nations who look to her for inspiration and guidance for their infant or tottering democracies the finnish visitor further pointed out that in effect this has happened in the united states already in the south where democratic principles have been suspended we already have dictatorial conduct in certain areas the country has been able to survive as a democracy despite this because democratic principles have prevailed elsewhere in varying degrees but if america fails in upholding the law with regard to her black citizens just because they are black then she opens the door for intemperates and bigots to take over if she refuses to honor the law impartially immediately and impassionately america effects a mandate for such people to move from the back door to the parlor this would allow the american society to be irretrievably undermined so that other political concepts would be free to dominate domestic and international policies this axiom has been proven very dramatically in both national and international politics haile selassie came before the league of nations in the s to ask that something be done to halt italianaggression against the law and the sovereignty of ethiopia the league of nations did nothing to correct this blatant breach of international law the emperor of ethiopia predicted at the time that the suspension of the rule of law with regard to his small and seemingly insignificant country would be the prelude toand encouragement offurther such suspensions and that those who chose to do nothing would themselves be affected someday it did not take long for his prophecy to come true five years later the entire world was involved in a war that had its roots in the overrunning of smaller nations by larger nations eventually the great powers found themselves facing a menace they had cowardly helped to create during the last year men have been killed buildings bombed children slaughtered and maimed and none of the responsible people have been effectively prosecuted none of the guilty parties have had to pay anything but token retribution for their crimes is it any wonder that a somewhat crazed fanatic seeing others so far above the law seeing the working of the law suspended in civil right issues should feel free to assassinate the president of the united states after all were not the chief justice of the supreme court and the united states representatives to the united nations spat upon and violated in that same city were not the offenders involved allowed to remain beyond the reach of the law and unpunished regardless of what his own personal motives were for killing the president is it not reasonable to assume that such a warped mind might reason that there was justification in shooting what was to some the symbol of liberal thinking internationalism and civil_rights without having to pay the consequences the chief justice of the supreme court recently said that if the bill of rights were now before the congress it would not pass this is not a very encouraging prospect twenty years ago if someone had made that statement in seriousness he would have been ushered off for psychiatric observation twenty years ago the bill of rights was taken for granted by the lawmakersbut not today why one reason is that the negro civil_rights movement has made all americans stop and think long and deep about the basic democratic tenets of their country further negroes have given these tenets a broader definition and meaning what used to be read as applying to white americans the negro is now insisting be read for all americans negroes are insisting on the literal meaning of the words contained in the countrys most hallowed documents in the course of bringing the civil_rights issue before the tribunals before the nation before the world negroes have dramatically put america on trial before the world they have forced the government of the united states officially to acknowledge their struggle and the principles behind it in addition negroes have forced whites to stand up and be counted with regard to the basic philosophy of democracy they have forced fellow negroes to carry out their democratic duty and obligations in almost every case this has been done with remarkable dignity and restraint this is even more impressive when viewed in the light of the pressures from extremists on both sides who would have it done less peacefully and less lawfully in sounding the cry for equal rights under the law the negro has made americans go deep into themselves regarding their belief in democracy and their feelings about it democracy is being evaluated on a scale and scope unknown before to mankind men everywhere are being called upon in effect to practice a philosophy they have professed to embrace intellectually it is now no longer possible to hide behind the old adage dont do as i do do as i say men everywhere are no longer able to be merely intellectual liberals they must be practical liberals as well and manifest their beliefs in actions the very foundations of american society are being challenged if america successfully meets the challenge then democracy will reach a height of perfection never before known to man it is my conviction that the negro will continue to fight for his cause i also feel that he will meet with continued resistance of the most violent and also of the most subtle varieties but the cause has irrevocably been put into motion a final and permanent solution will have to merge if the negro and america are successful in the civil_rights issue then historians will say that negroes in their struggle made the united states into the greatest practicing democracy of all time if the efforts for equality fail then the constitution the bill of rights and the declaration of independence will merely stand as historic evidence of the gross and tragic hypocrisy either way the negro will have contributed crucially to americas achievement of ultimate greatness to her moral demise general butlers fugitive slave war in may of when brigadier general benjamin f butler of the massachusetts volunteer militia was promoted to the rank of major general u s volunteers and placed in command of the troops at fortress monroe on old point comfort virginia the authorities in washington had not decided what to do about the fugitive slaves who sought refuge with the unions armed forces thus he was left like other army and navy officers in the field or on blockade duty to behave himself as he thought best in this matter at this time the war was emphatically not being waged for the purpose of abolishing slavery and many union officers flatly refused to allow any negroes at all to come within their lines or on board their ships while others permitted southerners who claimed they owned slaves or called themselves agents for slaveholders to search for and seize alleged fugitives some officers even accepted color alone as prima facie evidence of bondage with the result that at least a few free negroes were delivered to claimants under a process more summary than anything provided by the fugitive slave law of a day or two after butler reached fortress monroe he sent about half of the first vermont regiment commanded by colonel john w phelps on a reconnaissance toward the village of hampton virginia near the place where in a dutch brig landed the twenty negars as john rolph of jamestown called them who were the first slaves in the british colonies in north america for some reason the negroes in the vicinity of hampton gained an impression that fugitive slaves were apt to be well received at fortress monroe perhaps the fact that phelps was an oldtime abolitionist accounts for the feeling of the colored populace in the vicinity in any case three negroes decided to test the matter taking advantage of the confusion caused by the vermont troops invasion they escaped and made their way to fortress monroe interrogated separately by butler during the morning of may the three fugitives all told the same story they were slaves owned by colonel c k mallory of the th virginia militia and their master intended to send them to florida where they were to be employed in the construction of some coastal fortifications butler decided to confiscate them because as he put it in his autobiography property of whatever nature used or capable of being used for warlike purposes and especially when being so used may be captured and held either on sea or on shore as property contraband of war early the following day butler was informed that a confederate officer bearing a flag of truce desired an interview with him the confederate believed as he wrote to butler some years later that he carried the first flag of truce used in the civil war when buder and the confederate officer met the latter identified himself as major john b carey of the virginia militia in civilian life the principal of an academy in hampton and remarked that he and the general had last seen each other as fellow delegates to the charleston and baltimore democratic party conventions of at the first of which butler had voted times for the nomination of senator jefferson davis of mississippi as the partys presidential candidate carey first asked and butler sidestepped several questions about the principles upon which the general expected to conduct the war in the neighborhood of hampton then never dreaming of anything but ready acquiescence carey requested the return of mallorys three slaves on being told that they had been seized as contraband of war carey spoke feelingly of the fugitive slave law and of butlers obligations under the federal constitution butler replied that the fugitive slave law enacted by the united states congress could not be invoked by a foreign state which virginia claimed to be and that she must consider it among the infelicities of her position if to some extent he took her at her word mallorys three slaves said that if they were not sent back others would understand that they were among friends and more would come the next day actually two days passed before eight more male negroes reached fortress monroe they were followed hours later by a group of fortyseven persons of both sex and of all ages from three months to years thereafter negroes flocked to the freedom fort in such numbers that butler soon found that at current prices he had worth of slaves on his hands at this point he wrote to his superiors in washington asking for definite instructions by which to guide himself in future having been a lawyer in civilian life he was fully satisfied that he could legally confiscate ablebodied slaves and since they were of great value in the enemys hands it seemed to him to be the part of wisdom to deprive their masters of their services therefore he said that he intended to employ such persons as he could use he already had the men working as laborers or as officers servants the women as laundresses seamstresses etc and to issue proper food for the support of all charging against their services the expense of care and sustenance for the nonlaborers keeping a strict account of the services as well as of the expenditures having the worth of the services and the cost of expenditures determined by a board of survey hereafter to be detailed but he asked as a political question and a question of humanity can receive the services of a father and mother and not take the children after president lincoln and the cabinet had carefully considered butlers letter the secretary of war carefully answered it without really answering any of the questions it contained butler was told that his actions to date were approved he was directed neither to interfere with slavery nor to return fugitive slaves to their alleged masters he was instructed to continue to employ escaped slaves in the services for which they were best suited keeping account of the value of their services and the cost of their maintenance and he was informed that the matter of their final disposition would be reserved for future determination the publication of butlers letter and the secretarys reply led to a widespread discussion of what general winfield scott laughingly called general butlers fugitive slave law and to the immediate adoption of the term contraband as a synonym for an escaped slave most northerners agreed with butler that southerners could not logically argue against his acceptance of their oftenrepeated claim that slaves were property just like any other kind of cattle and approved heartily of his action edward l pierce an abolitionist who found butlers conduct praiseworthy wrote in the atlantic monthly november there is often great virtue in such technical phrases as contraband of war in shaping public opinion they commend practical action to a class of minds which would be repelled by formulas of a broader and nobler import the venerable gentleman who wears gold spectacles and reads a conservative daily prefers confiscation to emancipation he is reluctant to have slaves declared contraband his whole nature rising in indignation when henry ward beecher preaches in a sermon that a thing ought to be done because it is a duty he yields gracefully when butler issues an order commanding it to be done because it is a military necessity butlers technical phrase also commended a course of practical action to a number of men in positions to make their influence felt who were not repelled by broad formulas in august of less than six weeks after the thirtyseventh congress convened in special session its republican members mustered the votes necessary to secure the passage in both houses of a measure which legalized the confiscation of slaves employed in or upon any fort navyyard dock armory ship entrenchment or in any military service whatsoever against the government and lawful authority of the united states a year later during its first regular session the same congress passed another act the sixth section of which provided that within days after a proclamation to be issued by the president the property of all persons in armed rebellion against the united states should be liable to seizure and that any or all slaves of such persons escaping and taking refuge within the lines of the army all slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them and coming under the control of the government of the united states and allslaves of such persons found on or being within any place occupied by the forces of the united states shall be deemed captives of war and shall be forever free of their servitude and not again held as slaves in accordance with this law president lincoln issued a proclamation dated july warning all persons within the contemplation of the law to return to their proper allegiance to the united states on pain of the forfeitures and seizures provided by its sixth section although it has been largely disregarded by historians the truth is that to quote from carlos martyns biography of wendell phillips butler had practically freed thousands of slaves before lincoln even dreamed of emancipation and that congressional action based upon butlers contraband theory freed thousands more before the emancipation proclamation was issued civil war hero one of the boldest deeds of the civil war and one that required a u great deal of nerve and a a good judgment for its e execution was performed by robert smalls a pilot of the confedero ate steamer planter in charleston south carolina harbor in smalls was born in beaufort south carolina the son of robert and lydia smalls and a slave of the mckee family he was kindly treated by his master and allowed to acquire a limited education in smalls moved with his master to charleston and became successively a hotel waiter a hack driver and a rigger in he married his first wife hannah who died in in the confederate authorities pressed him into service and made him a member of the crew of the planter a dispatch and transportation steamer doing service in charleston harbor when fort sumter was attacked he and his family saw with sorrow the lowering of the american flag the high pressure widewheel steamer the planter was a light draught vessel drawing only five feet when heavily laden and was very useful to the confederacy in playing around the harbor and among the islands near charleston her officers were white however the crew was black consisting of the smalls brothers robert and john a gradine an assistant engineer william morrison a sailor and a few others for general work on monday evening may the planter was lying at her wharf her officers were ashore and smalls had been given instructions to see that everything was in readiness for a cruise the following day they were carrying a valuable cargo however smalls had other plans for the cargo smalls did not betray his thoughts by his behavior and when the officers left the vessel he appeared to be his usual respectful attentive efficient and obedient self after eight oclock the wives and children of robert and john smalls came on board as they had sometimes visited the vessel nothing was thought of this circumstance by the wharf guard sometime later a colored man from the steamer etowah joined the crew smalls had been contemplating this move for some time he had heard that colored men were being enlisted in the united states service at beaufort and that general hunter was foreshadowing the freeing of the slaves giving kindly treatment to all contraband refugees he had seen from the pilothouse the blockading vessels and had thought of a plan to turn over the planter with her valuable cargo to the union forces the brave men knew that their fate would be death in event of failure and they decided that they would not be captured alive but go down with the ship if the offshore batteries discovered them they also decided to use the steamers guns to repel pursuit and attack if necessary after midnight the fires were raised and pressure made ready and early in the morning robert smalls gave orders to cast off to guard against a suspicion of anything being amiss he backed slowly from the wharf blew the signal whistles and seemed in no great hurry to get away smalls proceeded down the harbor as if headed toward fort sumter and about four oclock the boat passed the frowning fortress saluting it with loud signals and then the steam pressure was increased her appearance was duly reported but as her plying around the harbor was most commonplace she was not molested and the heavy guns that easily could have sunk her remained silent passing the lower batteries again without danger the happy crew jubilantly rigged a white flag and steered straight toward the union ships they were still in great danger this time from the union guns union forces not knowing of their escape and on the lookout to sink at sight torpedo boats and rebel rams might blow them out of the water before discovering their peaceful flag an eyewitness of the planters arrival a member of the onwards crew and a war correspondent gave a good account of the landing just as no port gun was being elevated someone cried out i see something that looks like a white flag and truly enough there was something flying on the steamer that would have been white by application of soap and water as she neared us we looked in vain for the face of a white man when they discovered that we would not fire on them there was a rush of contrabands out on her deck some dancing some singing whistling jumping and others stood looking toward fort sumter and muttering all sorts of maledictions against it and de heart of the souf generally as the steamer came near and under the stern of the onward one of the colored men stepped forward and taking off his hat shouted good morning sir and further stated ive brought you some of the old united states guns sir that were for fort sumter sir and all the others around him set up a yell and the antics and capers cut could only be done by slaves who by a bold and successful stroke had gained their freedomrunning a steamer out from a large city and passing the battlements of pinckney moultrie and sumter as soon as the steamer came alongside captain nichols of the onward went on board of the planter and was joyously received the boats flag was hauled up amidst rejoicing congress was not unmindful of the daring and valuable services of robert smalls and his men and a special act was passed providing that half of the value of the captured steamer and its cargo be invested in united states bonds and the interest be paid annually to smalls group or their heirs this daring exploit gave robert smalls national fame he was made a pilot in the united states navy and his knowledge of the charleston harbor and its fortifications was of great service to the federal services on december when the commander of the planter deserted his post under confederate fire smalls took command of the steamer and led it again out of danger for this act smalls was promoted to the rank of captain and placed in command of the planter holding this post until september when his craft was put out of commission as for robert smalls when he steered away from the wharf at charleston on that early morning may he started a longer cruise than he ever dreamed for it brought him into prominence as a national character his rise to political importance in south carolina during reconstruction was inevitable he was good natured intelligent fluent and selfpossessed his moderate views and kindness toward the family of his former slave master made him to the whites the least objectionable of the freedmen with political aspirations the fact that he was the pet of their liberators led the freedmen to believe that he was the smartest colored man in south carolina his modesty and lack of education were the only circumstances which prevented him from becoming preeminent among the directors of the state during the reconstruction period as early as may a meeting of negroes and northerners at port royal elected him a delegate to the national union convention he was one of the less prominent delegates to the state constitutional convention of from to he served in the state house of representatives and in the latter year was elected to the state senate where he served through the session of from to except during and robert smalls served in the united states congress his congressional career was not notable his most important speeches were attacks on the election tactics of the south carolina democrats and in support of a bill to provide equal accommodations for the races in interstate conveyances smalls was a conspicuous figure in the republican national conventions of and from to he served in the state militia rising to the rank of majorgeneral in december he was appointed collector of the port of beaufort holding this position until except during grover clevelands second term in he was convicted of accepting a bribe of while state senator and was sentenced to three years in prison but while his case was under appeal he was pardoned by governor william d simpson as part of the policy of amnesty which the state democratic administration deemed wise smalls last notable service was as one of the six members of color of the state constitutional convention of before that body he made a vain but gallant attempt to prevent the practical disfranchisement of negroes the last twenty years of his life were spent quietly at beaufort where he enjoyed the confidence of both races cooperating with white leaders in efforts to advance the material interests of the community he died on february lets picket our pockets not the schools i am a negro mother living in an allnegro r community we have our own mayor schools fire department police department waste collection transportation and businesses there is room for improvement but it is a nice place to live many negroes left here for the march on washington last august the march was called a peaceful demonstration the crowd was tremendousand so was the expense lack of money prevented many from participating it was considered the right thing to do since then riots abound everywhere in some instances murder has occurred our children are fighting rebelling against authority school rooms are empty politicians are using race as a subject to exploit their platforms organizations are picketing other organizations a different type of march is going on among many of our people they are marching for food consider the money that was spent for the march on washington picture just one dollar for each negro in attendance how about a dollar for every negro in america once a month envision schools factories homes and businesses created by negroes to me a boycott of schools prevents education it confuses the young it frightens me my children may be hurt or killed how can people march against injustice and still demonstrate peace forcing a change in laws does not enforce a change in people god gave us a world to live in he left a book of instruction telling us how to live in it peaceful demonstrations begin with ourselves let us picket our pockets and start a riot by providing for our own needs let us not become absorbed into another race instead we can keep our own traditionsteach them to our children with pride we can boycott ignorance there is money for marches for bondsmen for lawyers and leadership the same powerful leadership can serve to guide us toward providing for our own needs let others envy our independence not our militant attitudes what keeps good workers from working it isnt enough for one man to be able and eager to work and for another man to want workers gaps in information communication and transportation some of our police and our charitable practices are right now keeping wouldbe employees from meeting employers in our cities the city of indianapolis is an example since indianapolis is centrally located drawing its income from both industry and agriculture and with jobseekers coming or passing through from all parts of the united states the situation observed during the past year and a half by a group of ministers social workers and retired business people may be of interest to others our observation post was the hall of a small downtown church peoples temple which in the spring of ran out of funds for the free noon meal it had served every day for two years so the congregation appealed to outsiders for financial help as a basis for moneyraising a statistical survey was made with the persons served being asked name age address health how long in town last steady job how far in school and how they had been getting along racially the percentages of negroes and whites were almost the same as in the general populationbut we noted that most of the negroes were staying with relatives or friends and not travelling about nearly so much as the white men one explanation was that negroes encounter more difficulties on the road harassment by police and discrimination at many missions the theory that negroes take care of their own seemed to be borne out by the way residents of quite nice homes let unemployed men stay rent free as well as instances where the clear downandout literally shared their last crust with a buddy however negro employers and negro police seemed to take care of their own by bearing down pretty hard on themaccording to reports from individuals we got to know rather well later in the course of our survey men standing in line proffered advice why dont you let us use the phone free to call former employers this made senseso an extension phone was put in the hall with volunteers sitting by it three hours each day to prevent long distance calls being charged and thus our employment desk was born by letting the men use the phone by advertising for odd jobs and by the volunteers bringing the help wanted ads each day quite a few jobs were foundmostly temporary but at least seemed permanent do you need a helping hand asked a flyer that churches of several denominations distributed to their congregations and carpentry painting wallwashing housecleaning yardwork were listed as types of help these hands that could be reached at the peoples temple had to offer but as phone calls came in and as we analyzed the want ads it became apparent that the hands themselves must have help to get to the available jobs they needed appropriate clothing to work at certain jobs such as a clean shirt for a waiter or baker they needed information which sometimes took several phone calls to acquire as to where to sell blood for quick cash where to get chest xrays for a food handlers permit and where to get medical treatment andor convalescent care in order to become employable if hes interested why doesnt he come apply instead of telephoning office girls sometimes snapped when we inquired about job listings but how come out here without carfare if a man walked five or ten milesand many factories restaurants carwash places where at least that far from downtownhow energetic would he be if he landed the job and if he arrived to find the job takenor that his skin was the wrong shadehow able to answer some other ad would he be walking wears out shoes which none of the missions can ac quire in proportion to the need being out in the rain or snow with no facilities for pressing a suit makes it hard to fulfill the must be neat requisite in many ads and walking when a person is hungry and tired wears down resistance so its easy to catch cold or succumb to other of the many germs encountered in missions or cheap roominghouses and yet many persons who work downtown near the park where tired men sometimes sit often complain those lazy bums ought to be jobhunting and police entertain themselves by urging the men to move oneven arresting quite sober and innocous but shabbily dressed sitters for loitering how does a man hunt jobs when hes broke state employment has a department called spot labor where jobs requiring no outstanding skill are sometimes to be had manpower inc gets calls from employers then sublets men to work manpower collecting the wage and paying the man a percentage according to the men manpower can be counted on to pay the agreed upon priceand it advances carfare and lunch money the men also appreciate the bin where you can leave your bundle when youve no place to stay but many men resent working at a job that pays or more per hour then receiving only or the executive whom i talked with at manpower refused to tell me just what percentage of a mans pay they took so i had to depend on the men themselves for the above figures id rather stand on the curb said a union man who can work only at certain times due to acute asthma on the curb i often get jobs paying as much in two days as manpower will pay in a week many of the men find the curb a good place to get jobsbut the police disapprove of this the curb is a stretch of about two blocks on alabama street just north of the citycounty building and police station where employers and employees have met for at least years but some passersby are said to have complained about so many men in old clothes loafing along there so break it up or ill call the wagon shout certain cops causing jobseekers to scatter out or move to another block then return later and in the fall of a gettough policy was instituted whereby men at one time were thrown into jail for jobhunting at this spot this particular group was released because a minister interceded for them but nobody knows how many others were picked up later peoples temple has a small supply of emergency food to give to distressed families and one such family was brought there by a worker from the court who asked the minister to provide for them while the father is in jail for jobhunting on the corner as a taxpayer i resent having to support men in jail when their sole crime is jobseeking they could be fed and bedded just as well in a missionor for a small sum with friendsand there would not be the stigma of arrest the association with the vicious and the diseased the inability to keep job appointments four times i made appointments for men to work at jobs for which they were well qualified then learned they were arrested the night before for a vague charge of disorderly or loitering or drunkenness he must have done something pretty bad to get five days plus a fine i said to the judge pro tern whom i went to in behalf of one of these workmen oh no said the judge hed have had a bigger sentence than that if hed fought or created a disturbance i dont have the record here but he probably fell down on the street or didnt move along as fast as the officer wanted later i appealed to another judge for clemency for another man who had lost two days work by being in jail but who could start earning that afternoon if the judge would release him but look at that long record this judge exclaimed and he sentenced the man to days plus fine not because what he had done was so bad he fell down on the street and the cop said he was drunk but five witnesses told me he didnt do a thing and i being called to the scene smelled no liquor on him the sentence was on his past record thats good criminology maintained the regular judge of this court a judge pro tern made the sentence i have studied criminology myself at the university of wisconsin i have worked in a psychiatric clinic and even in a state prison as counsellorthis isnt what i was taught but lest my teachings be out of date i checked with a psychiatrist and with the head of the butler university sociology department but most lawyers get almost no psychology or criminology in their training a lawyer friend told me they dont understand human nature so again i as a taxpayer had to support this man while he served his sentence and laid out his fine then i and a psychiatric social worker and two ministers had to spend days trying to help the man recover from the injustice the discouragement the loss of many of his clothes and of course this makes just one more entry on his record which another judge may hold against him if he is picked up for jobhunting on the corner also while serving his undeserved term at the penal farm he lost the clientele of satisfied employers that his excellent windowwashing floorwaxing and housecleaning had gradually built up women in need of help hired other men who were available if a worker is good why unemployed in our survey and during our subsequent experiments with jobfinding three reasons stood out some men had newly arrived in town had no references and no leads as to where to hunt jobs they had come because of layoffs in the mines and mills of the east coast or the factories of detroit or because new methods or too many members in the farmers family reduced need for them on the farm some had held what sounded like fairly good jobsbut the plant moved away or they put in new machinery and laid off men back in the s there were similar layoffs but then there was hope of being called back when worked picked up today new methods and new machinery are making men obsolete vocational counselling and retraining are needed here some had left or been firedthen found their age if over a barrier to getting a new job others had suffered illness or accident forcing them to seek a new type of work a painter who had lost half his foot cant stand on laddersbut he has built up such a following of pleased employers through the peoples temple oddjob desk that he now gets his calls direct where he rents a room a roofer had made good money and enjoyed the prestige of this high callingbut on passing he found he could no longer stand heights i referred him to a cleanup and maintenance job where he proved the workin est guy i ever saw according to the employer but frustration loneliness in this stfange town and the physical and financial comedown he had taken bothered him so that he got drunk every payday then was a day late reporting for work an intensive study of this mans needs was neededbut we knew of no clinic where he could be served two men had had surgery which did not interfere with their particular skills of metal working but which did prejudice insurance doctors ive even offered to work free awhile just to prove i can work better and work cheaper than anybody else but they wont try me said the onelegged man so when last heard from he was on relief what to do from our brief and amateurish experience we see a need for information facilities information as to where certain types of labor are neededeven when apples beans tomatoes will be ready to be picked the state employment office suggests that sometimes the man with the skill and the man with the job register at different employment agencies it would be more efficient if all cleared at a central place information as to what equipment or training a man must have should be available so a man need not waste a long tripand there should be facilities for supplying carfare small loans for lunch suitable clothing even though this will result in some losses because not all unemployed are saintsthere is need for better communication a free phone for answering want ads or calling past employers proved practical but a messagereceiving service should be set up the only service we discovered is that offered by a negro bartender mr ben ross of the panama tavern in indianapolis hotels and restaurants call him when they need extra waiters he locates men he knows and if necessary advances carfare or money to get a shirt washed it reflects oddly on americas puritan past though that only a tavern should offer such service in fact many men said the only places a tired man can rest or warm himself is a tavernthen he is apt to get arrested if he accepts an offered drink communication should include help in dialing and in talking with potential employers we found many men who asked us to dial for them but when we did this then passed them the receiver they failed to get necessary data about where to apply when whom to ask for and what bus to take also many unsold themselves i am glad to say two community centers flanner house and fletcher place now plan job clinics where the technics of effective applying for jobs how to take aptitude tests and merit examinations will be discussed we need an uptodate philosophy about unemployment the nowork noeat ruling of john smith shouldnt apply when there is no work to be had all the missions in indianapolis practice a threenights a month or even a threenights in days limit to the time a man can remain free this is partly to give newcomers a chance since there arent enough beds available to meet the need but it is partly a holdover from the idea that men need a shove to go out and find work but as professor alan keithlucas of the university of north carolina says in his book the church and social work a man cannot be vigorous if we underfeed him nor secure in his independence if we keep him insecure constant moving not only keeps men upset and nervous they lose clothes and job opportunities from having no place to get calls the saddest part of the unemployment picture though is the loneliness the feeling of being outside looking innot really part of the human race on learning that one unemployed mans family had a food grant of for four persons for a week i called the municipal dog pound to see how this compared with their perdogperday food budget it was less but you see explained the pound superintendent if we let these dogs get all rundown and starved looking their owners would raise a fuss the biggest need of the unemployed in most of our cities is for somebody to raise a fuss in their behalf the black troika the triad of negro organizations prominent in our racial struggle might be likened to an unbalanced troika bearing the hopes the aspirations and the destiny of the entire race a timeworn troika pulled by three blind horses each unswervingly sure in his own mind of his ability to bear the load and equally as sure of the rate of speed the rhythm of action most suitable for the long run ahead discord holds the guiding reins this is not to say that the horses have not each performed his duty on the contrary and despite their unrhythmic gallop each has labored gallantly in pursuit of the general goal but as should have been foreseen the path has narrowed now and a trio of units is no longer feasible having very efficiently covered the wide path of civil and social rights and equal opportunity in the economy it is time now that the cumbersome troika gave way to a single horseman nor should the horseman be a passivist a moderate or an extremist but a combination of the three he should be passive to the extent of unashamedly admitting our peoples many shortcomings moderate to the extent of exacting the very best from our people and raceminded to the extent of inculcating in even the younger of our people that we are determined to bridge the intellectual and economic gap which separates us and our white countrymen he should in the final analysis be a realist for the ensuing run is down a long and narrow path bordered on either side by distortions of lifes deeper meanings we are of a different race than our countrymen and no demonstrations no protestations no legislations can alter this basic difference until our race recognizes itself as being such and discards the foolish concept that because it is a living breathing indispensable segment of the american scene it must be indelibly identified in every social activity with its white counterpart until then our every undertaking will end in confusion and neurosis will become a way of life though it might very well be a subconscious motivation this issue of an independent or a dependent identity has ever been an obstacle to the negros progress as it is now a cleavage in our aspirations competition is the foundation upon which this nation was built if then the passive demonstrators the militant organizations the inflexible black muslims and the angry young elocutionists have been instrumental in securing the guarantee of equal opportunities in the fields of education and employment let us bend ourselves to the task of preparing our people so that they might compete against whites with some hope of success it would appear that the gist of every utterance every outward action every printed phrase accredited to our articulate leaders deals with the white mans indebtedness to the negro better would it be if we were to cease heaping anguish upon our race by lamenting over what the white man owes us and lessen the races present frustrations by preparing our people to liquidate the debt we owe ourselves indeed the white man does owe the negro something but what does he owe him the privilege of sleeping in a whiteowned hotel and enjoying its cafeteria facilities and bath the freedom to isolate himself from his own race by purchasing a home in an allwhite neighborhood the consolation of interracial intimacies without fear of reprisals what meagre compensations and what does the negro possess after he has collected these overdue debts yes we passivists may cry that the white man owes us something we moderates may negotiate for insignificant concessions and we black muslims may worship at the shrine of a divided nation but the greatest debtthe ability to perceive and the soul to admit that our final hopes lies in a competitive coexistence with the white racewe owe to ourselves we recoil from preparing ourselves for the job ahead saying the preparation itself is a tremendous job good let our dedication be supertremendous and how do we go about performing this feat by uniting ourselves and our efforts toward one general end a life of competitive interdependence with the white race by daring by looking beyond the day the next week month and year we must sow now a harvest we should not expect to reap before the next decade though the right to do so certainly should be ours it is not necessary that we squander our earnings on the white races gaudy enticements nor is it necessary that we pretend an intimacy of association which doesnt exist we must not attempt to evade the very real fact that the negro american and the white american if engaged in fair and earnest competition would change the face of this nations social structure faster and with less mental anguish than could any number of demonstrations legislation or protestations as little as it is generally realized the majority of negroes are spoiling for a fight admittedly the odds have been and are still against them but with expectations of more opportunities and greater heights being made accessible to them they need only a strong hand on the reins to direct their progress do we have in our race such a man the future social progress of our race demands one americas first negro poet the names of many re nowned poets are wovj en into the past of this great country such names as longfellow emerson whittier riley and dickinson are easily brought to mind the work of these writers retains a certain popularity today and they continue to be widely read that these writers were preceded by others is logical thinking yet very few readers are aware that one of americas first published poets was a negro our nations cultural foundation was aided and enhanced through the efforts of this remarkable man and it is well that out of the archives of the past new light has fallen on his identity for many years controversy raged on this subject as the distinction was thought to belong to phillis wheatley a young negro slave of boston massachusetts historians in recent years have acknowledged another aspirant to the title namely jupiter hammon research has proven that mr hammon wrote and published several prose articles and had at least one poem published before phillis wheatley arrived in america thus his status as americas first negro poet is duly established what do we know of the early history of this illustrious man unfortunately our knowledge is extremely limited yet there are some basic facts which have been preserved for us evidence gives as the year of jupiter hammons birth though nothing is known of his birthplace it may have been africa the west indies or remote possibility america history tells us that he and his mother were purchased as slaves by henry lloyd a wealthy settler of lloyds neck long island a community now more familiarly known as oyster bay obviously jupiter hammon was a young child at the time of this transaction after the death of henry lloyd jupiter was inherited by mr lloyds son joseph later he came into the possession of john lloyd jr joseph lloyds grandson where he remained to the end of his days early mention is made of jupiter hammon in the records of henry lloyd mr lloyd wrote to a physician asking required treatment of one slave jupiter by name about ten years of age who apparently had developed a rheumatic disorder from this and the written word of hammon himself we learn that he was most kindly treated and accorded unusual privileges by his successive masters there can be little doubt the noble character of this family had considerable influence on jupiter hammon as he grew to manhood even in youth he appeared to have great authority over his people and they often called on him for advice it is also apparent that mr hammons talent was recognized at an early age considered a valuable and trustworthy servant the lloyd family took a deep interest in fostering his literary efforts their encouragement was rewarded when his first commendable verse an evening thought was published in the original copy of this verse is in the collection of the new york historical society this poem conforming with all of mr hammons work is of a highly religious nature following the british armies occupation of long island jupiter hammon together with the lloyd family was forced to flee across long island sound where they took refuge in hartford connecticut however the majestic spirit of this man remained undaunted by circumstances in hartford he was warmly received by his own people and many of the white race early in hudson goodwin publishers of hartford brought out mr hammons work of poetry and prose a winter piece which was followed by an essay on the ten virgins the original of this manuscript is in the possession of the connecticut historical society shortly after this publication jupiter returned to long island with the lloyd family where he continued to write and give counsel historians readily concede that jupiter hammon was a guiding force as a preacher and leader among his people he was highly esteemed and his exhortations bore fruit as evidenced by the reception given his prose work an address to the negroes which reached three editions the influence of this treatise traveled far beyond its initial environment as daniel humphreys of philadelphia issued the third edition in presumably after the death of mr hammon filled with religious zeal strong in the faith of the lord spiritual convictions poured from his eager pen no attempt was made to alter the directness in approach or content of his work however some minor errors in spelling stood in need of correction by his publishers it is with unfeigned regret we learn that much of this work has been lost although little is known of the man in life far less is known of him in death historical records have placed the date somewhere between and during this period it was customary to set aside a corner of the fields owned by the gentry as a burial place for faithful slaves in some obscure location possibly on the grounds still retained by descendants of the lloyd family lies the final resting place of jupiter hammon surely this valiant crusader is justly deserving of the approbation long overdue americas first negro poet goodby baby boy hes like every other lucky black boy they cant wait to be seen she said this ones not really like that no cadillacs for him the hell with it buy me another drink she said

the bartender said then make it four he said damn gabe whatcha trying to do cora said marry them in my mind he said marry them in my mind i nothing ike macklin felt this he felt as if the only thing left for him now was the comfort and rest of death he felt as if he were stepping into another world a black suffocating world that closed in on him as soon as he clambered from the back of that pickup truck that brought him from his job his natural scowl deepened as he turned from the corner and the paved avenue and started the trudge down the sandy rutted street to his home he veered from his path to avoid stepping on a something which lay sprawled in drunken somnolence halfin halfout of an alley its dirty ragged garments its very pores reeking with sweat filth and whiskey he moved down past the waisthigh weeds past rubys the moonshiners past the sounds and smells of people who had hit bottom or had been born on bottom and were now wallowing and rottening in the excrements of their own helplessness and humiliation in spite of the cutting wind he carried a frayed leather jacket loosely in the crook of a heavily muscled arm that did a peculiar jerk every time he swung it in its tight downandup arc by the time he came to the twin sycamores the only trees on the blockwhich masked the front of his frame house the same old humiliation and anger began stirring through his very soul hed had no drinks but he suddenly felt very drunk and mad as he stood in front of the house that seemed to lean to one side the soft gray sand cuddled around his thick heavy brogans from the one street light at the far end of the block he could see the trash now scattered and copious over the deeply rutted road that was scarcely wider than a path all of the houses seemed to lean on each other for support as if the very strength had gone from them in their old age they all looked alike all alike down to the last sagging porch and tarred roof all hideous headstones in a giant races graveyard he turned to the one that was his and stumbled up onto the warped porch and for this he paid twelve dollars a week he kicked savagely at the rockerless rocking chair sent it crashing across the porch slamming into the bannister which held various cans filled with the dry sand and miraculously growing flowers he swayed momentarily before the door his stocky body bracing itself and stared hard at the graying wood which had already assumed the lost helpless color of everything in the neighborhood he burst into the tworoom house and saw his wife sitting before the open hearth her hands dangling between her legs a cigaret hanging loosely between two fingers the lights were off and the red glare made the brown of her face glow hell whatcha doin setting here in the dark he growled defensively falling into the pattern of every day of his life the arguments senseless unprovoked providing some outlet of emotion for a shamed man she turned stood up a tall thin woman and the sight of her hurt him her breasts had lost their resiliency and now sagged flatly against her ribs her body once firm suppliant the body of a woman was now hard and angular like a mans god this is the same woman i married almost fourteen years ago shes almost dead he thought she stepped to him and dutifully kissed him on his cheek her lips were warm and ike grabbed her and held her tightly against him a sudden shock wave of humiliation shaking him delia macklin melted to the unexpected surge and wiped away the tear she felt against her cheek it was not hers she stared at her husband when he finally jerked away his back to her broad and straight ike ike what is it she reached for him almost touching him but her hand stopped inches from his back and she stood still a thin sweater draped over her shoulders looking at him she didnt press him she knew it wouldnt do any good she didnt ask him again she just waited goddam he cursed savagely flinging his jacket onto the bed that commanded half the space in the room he stood in front of the fire his hands shoved into the pockets of his khaki trousers how old are you dee you know how old i is she snapped then almost as an afterthought she added quietly thirtytwo we been married most foahteen years right she nodded to his back what we got in foahteen years dee what we got he turned to her his face his hands every muscle asking the question why we got artie and this this here she stopped her hand poised in midair ill tell you what we got nothing not a damn thing dee there aint a thing in this house thats ourn not a thing but the boy this

out slowly drawnout sounding like a cry from a tortured spirit im so sicka this im sicka buildin white folks houses an then comin home to this he sagged back until the edge of the bed hit his thighs and he sat down he fumbled for a cigaret his black face twisted with a pain he could not name he took a deep drag and drove the smoke out with a violent ffffftttttt you know how much ruby makes a week baby he asked and saw his wifes body stiffen and her eyes grow cold still standing she said flatly i dont care how much he makes aint no shine coming in this house ike spoke on as if he didnt hear her

and i mean it ike i dont care if we never have a thing we can still have our self respect i cant eat selfrespect barked ike ike looked at her standing rock hard in the gloom of the fire and he sucked deep on his cigaret and snapped it into the pine flame the boy sleep he asked his voice now calm and quiet delia nodded j f but the boy was not asleep in the darkness of the frame house with the sound of the november wind knifing through the branches of the leafless sycamores artie lay just beneath the lip of the window sill his heart now pounding with excitement as he licked his dry lips and listened to the voices in the other room grow quiet almost to a whisper he wrapped the clean ragged nightshirt around him and listened to the sounds that filtered through to him from the house next door mr rubys house he had heard the same sounds much of his years the loud garrulous guffaw of a man who told a halfheard joke and then the amazingly clear soft whimpering sounds of the woman the woman who occupied the room not feet from his across the alley the strange mysterious woman who frightened him with her tobaccostained teeth who was now locked in some contortionist embrace with some man sweating despite the cold grinding in the dark dark now yes but he had seen when that room was not darkened and the shade was not all the way down he had seen the men going through the same actions with the woman in her faded pink underthings sipping the clear harmless looking liquid then going together animallike with blind hungry caresses closed eyes and open mouths and at the age of he knew every muscle of the woman each curve hollow valley all were familiar to him he could close his eyes and see the heavy pendulant breasts and he could see the curling pubic hair on her body somehow in some strange way he did not understand she birthed a strange new excitement in him she seemed to awaken some horrible part of him that frightened him the sudden sharp cry of his mother startled him and he jumped guiltily under the blanket and pulled it over his head he heard his mother plead no ike no but it was not like pleading when they were fighting when his father was blind drunk raging it was a different kind of plea the sound of which was completely new to him he heard them moving around now and he listened carefully through the paperthin walls curled tightly in a ball warming himself he heard his mother repeat the no and then it was quiet and soon it was quiet from next door and though he waited for those sounds again it was as it often was during the middle of the week there was no more sound he tucked his head under the blankets and fell asleep sh artie had waited for friday all week friday was the night that things began to happen when he saw and heard everything immediately after his frugal supper he washed and retired to his room carefully closing the door which couldnt be locked anyway behind him he sat in the darkness next to the open window and listened to the exciting sounds pour across the narrow alleyspace between the two houses he could see in the room now and the woman was seated on the bed her body papersack brown in the harsh light her back to him a housecoat draped over her nakedness the steady driving sounds of a jazz record pushed at him and he could hear the horn talking to him wringing from him an innate pounding a sleeping other life that awoke twisting and rocking to the steady thumping of the steady rhythm he heard it and was not aware he heard it he heard the sounds distantly the sharp crack as of a tree branch snapping in the wind and then a crash of weeds then he saw the man bounding into the alley crouched low hugging the protection of the house and he heard the loud curses and the screams and the man was at his window tossing something big and heavy through the paneless window and running hard down the alley to the planked back fence and he was over it quick shadowlike then came the sharp flat crack of the gunone two three timesand he heard the bullets slap wickedly into the fence and then the other man fat short and white ran past cursing and screaming he drew back from the window the satchel at his feet and he heard the noises of people yelling and screaming in confusion and then his mother ran into the room and kicked the satchel under his bed he stared at her wideeyed but then remembered the dark running form and he knew he had seen that stocky build before he had seen it crouched in that same piston run when they had played football together it was his father then his mother held him held him close as she had not done in many years and her voice was a voice of pain a voice lost a voice he had not heard since that time granny died it was soft almost not a voice at all and it was crooning the old song of despair and suffering and anguish that had no name it was a song they were born singing a song that was sung to them when they died a song they knew all of their lives it had no words it had no special tune but when he heard it he knew it and his mother was singing it to him now as people slowly filled the alley outside and he heard the staccato sentences you see im the cops call the cops who was it lawd lawd that crazy sonofabitch and cold fear hit him for the first time in his life it was worse than hunger even because he had learned how to beat hunger he knew that he could swallow his own spit and cut the knifing pains he could drink water he could go to the city market with the others and steal fruit but this was something new this made him want to scream to cry to run but his mother was there comforting and she rubbed his head and held him phi later trembling both of them stood on the porch and watched the police car next door milling negroes moved back and forth over the sandy ground crushing the futile attempt of a garden in mr rubys front yard he saw the policeman big and fleshy even in the dark talking to the short fat man who had fired the shots in spite of his sweater he trembled he heard the flat drawl you protect you somebodys got nerve enough to steal from a shiner and im supposed to catch him for you harfff i wisht i knew who it was id plumb near shake his hand the officer turned still laughing and climbed into the patrol car with the other officer and the car moved off the fat man cursed climbed into his shiny cadillac and churned the street as he sped off his mother held him close he wanted to ask her something anything but he saw the fear and anxiety on her face and kept quiet then from around the corner he saw the familiar squat blockhard figure of his father walking casually his arm hitching in that familiar swing of his the leather jacket on the crook of his arm he strolled slowly and artie held his breath as his father came abreast of the scattering crowd walked slowly around it waving to mr ruby who waved back his father came up the steps put his arms around his wife and they all moved into the house where is it ike asked as soon as the door was closed i aint touched it its still in the boys room under the bed ike but he was gone then he was back a jackknife in his hand look dee he said looking at her i didnt steal from no black man ruby got his he got his befoah he even turned this over to him this aint nothing but the money them white folks been stealin from them poor bastards next door silverpure sweat glistened from his black brow but he had to lick his lips to moisten them when he kneeled on the floor forced the lock and spilled the paper out on the floor art had never seen so much money in all his life he listened as his father counted laboriously it seemed like a long time then ike whistled leven thousand threehundred dollars lord i didnt know it was going to be this much dee theres leven thousand dollars here he stood up wiping his hands on his trousers moved over to delia and held her by the shoulders we ggo buy that house he said but we aint go buy it now and when we do we aint go git it with no cash for the next month or so we aint even got this money we go sit on it we aint go buy nothin then we go move out out someplace where this boy kin go to a good school learn somethin sides how to shoot dice make somethin outten hisself dee this was for him not us we aint old but hes what we got to live for ike held her and artie looked at them both still not understanding his father had stolen stealing was wrong a sin but his mother didnt say anything she just sat there her face immobile placid but her body rigid and ike moved from her knelt down and shoved the bills back into the case he pushed the satchel under the bedarties bed and reached into his pocket and took out a pile of crumpled bills he extracted a single gave her the rest i got to go over i been havin a drink ever friday for three years and i cant change nothin i think i need this drink too cant change nothin she nodded imperceptively as he pulled on his jacket ike kissed her on the head and stepped out the door when he walked outside delia seemed to sag in the chair to artie she seemed a very old woman old and haggard and beaten not so much by time and work and worry but by something even greater something that lay heavy over the entire house and street like some suffocating cloud he moved to her side and as he moved he saw her long brown fingers working nervously on the crumbled bulge of bills feverishly twisting and the tear that started down her face looked like silver ice sliding down a craggy mountain he watched her on his knees watched her cry silently her mouth open looking into the center of the blazing pine fire and not knowing why he began crying too it was not so much that his mother was crying but because he felt that out of the sin and crime of robbery something strange and new and wonderful was going to happen it was because he knew his father and he knew he meant what he said and in spite of everything the lying the stealing and the fearinghe was proud of his father proud of being his son sitting there in the glow of the fire that cracked every now and then sitting there in the glow of a fire on a winter night next to his fathers wife his mother in three weeks they were moving and delia sat next to the driver of the dray with a tightly tied shoebox in her lap holding it with the same tenacity as a small child holds a coin the old furniture filled the truck and ike stood in the door of the house with artie his thick arm about the boys shoulder looking into the gray bleak emptiness of the frame shack its floors scrubbed white shone from front to back the windowsthe ones still in were gleaming nothingnesses ike hawked deep in his chest and spat violently in the middle of the front room and the thick phlegm lay there quivering seemingly a part of all the filth and humiliation of ikes life and it belonged there ike slammed the door and he and artie climbed into the back of the dray it was always with v shyness half respect f and half naked fear that barney approached women even now as he stood in the dim hallway at the top of the stairs it was only with the grimmest effort that he could keep himself from squirming a little under the cruel gaze of r cs niece whose daring eyes seemed ready at any moment to laugh rc cleared his throat wanda he said at last tentatively as though baying a small but dangerous animal or should i say miss oneal convinced this was clever rc glanced sideways at his young companion and vinked miss oneal he continued more confidently im certainly surprised to find you at home at such an hour still she said nothing merely continued to stare in a vaguely mocking way from behind the halfopened door can can we come in rc requested the confidence beginning to break he too was usually struck dumb in the presence of his niece though he hated to show it he was a big graying awkward man who seemed ill at ease in even the most informal situation now he stood clumsily in the doorway his arms hanging down silly she exclaimed in a sudden shrill voice why didnt you say so of course you can come in she stepped aside finally to allow them passage rc ventured forth and grabbing nervously at barneys shoulder led him into the untidy little room it was airless and close scattered about the tiny floor were at least a dozen phonograph records articles of clothing hung immodestly from the bedposts and along the windowsill the spotty walls were cluttered with photographs of male movie stars clipped from magazines the young girl clad in a blouse and a pair of shorts closed the door behind them and returned to the bed where she lay on her back gazing with just the faintest amusement at the two men there was an uncomfortable pause wanda her uncle said uneasily wanda this is our new boarder his name is barnes that is mr barnes mr barnes he said turning to barney this is my niece wanda r c made a vague gesture with his hands then repaired to a far corner of the room where he sat down well how do you do mr barnes his niece said with rather exaggerated enthusiasm and without leaving the bed she extended her hand awkwardly barney leaned forward and felt the warm moisture of her small fingers it was as close to her as he had been all day he had yearned to meet her ever since that morning when their eyes had met briefly on the stairway she clung to his hand longer it seemed than necessary then released it adding im glad somebody finally took that dreadful room theyve been trying for monthsto peddle it off i mean oh dont get me wrong theres nothing wrong with it exactly but youre the first person to she laughed suddenly shifting her body sensually on the bed she tried to control the gushing sound but succeeded only in making halfstifled little sniggles through her nose after a long vhile she regained her breath dont mind me she managed to add im silly r c from his seat in the corner slapped loudly against his knee shes a mess that girl he said i swear i cant keep up with her no more maybe you try too hard she said quickly maybe he stammered i dont try hard enough maybe you cant she replied tiredly not looking at her uncle r c sat silent ignoring the insult he clasped his big hands together and looked about the room for something else to talk about finding nothing he nervously left his seat and ambled clumsily across the room at the door he turned and said well folks i got things to do you two get acquainted he smiled suddenly and added but dont get caught he winked at them and turned suddenly and left the room an awkward hulk of a man stumbling noisily to another part of the house wanda grinned mischievously at her guest hes a card she said there was another pause but what about you mr er whatsyourname she almost mimicked the words as if to assure him she really disdained such perfunctory utterances how long you gonna be around i dunno said barney speaking for the first time as long as they can put up with me your family he grinned nervously as though having said something amusing he wished she wouldnt stare so dont worry about that we get some real nuts around here drunkards all kinds you seem kinda nice though without any transition she leaped abruptly from the bed and with a quick little movement snatched up a record from the pile on the floor you dance mr er you can call me barney okay you dance barney not very well he replied what are you a preacher or something no what are you then barney hesitated fighting for courage well nothing exactly but i want to be a writer really she exclaimed genuinely surprised what do you want to write about the music had begun to play she had set the volume much too high and the little room nearly shook with the twang of an electric guitar and something that sounded like a females voice or a childs uttering something about love lots of things he said feeling very foolish like impressions i get sometimes and feelings its hard to describe sort of like she was no longer listening say she exclaimed in a brand new voice you didnt even tell me what your first name was its herman thats cute mines wanda wanda oneal i guess my uncle told you who knows maybe well get along all right but dont pay any attention to him hes silly realizing he did not in fact intend to dance she returned and sat on the edge of the bed and began snapping her fingers to the music her bare legs also moved slightly in rhythm you look awful young to be living alone she said dont you have any folks im twentytwo he said quickly my folks live very far from here how long you been in washington couple of days got a job yet this is a hell of a place to get a job sissie never found one thats a friend of mine or used to be anyway she finally went back home she paused a moment and seemed to reflect i met her at school she continued you didnt take me for the college type did you well im not i put it down after a semester she seemed to study his face carefully then reached inside her blouse and brought out a wrinkled pack of cigarets lighting one it seemed to barney with a kind of studied poise it was a drag she continued to me anyway for others its all right i guess what about you yeah i went for a while its okay i suppose barney reflected a moment plenty of girls he added smiling silly she shrieked youre silly what what did you say you wrote about well never mind i can guess girls barney squirmed again trying to reply and she laughed again as suddenly as before for heavens sake relax and say something most boys i know say too much but you youre kind of different her eyes were staring again barney lowered his head observing his feet he clasped his hands together then unclasped them he bit furiously at his lip and scratched his nose but still she stared anyway she said at length as if deciding something maybe well get along all right that is if you like music she gestured with her hand sweeping over the records that were scattered across the floor and stacked along the wall all these are mine even more because some are downstairs wait ill get them barney squirmed uncomfortably oh dont bother he said rising from his chair relax she shouted and giggled once more just relax mr herman barnes ill only be a minute and tonight if you want to well go out you can meet some of the kids i know just as suddenly she bounded from the bed and disappeared through the halfopened door seconds later barney heard the quick dribble of her footsteps on the stairway left alone his mind began to wander he wondered what they were like her friends what did they talk about what did they do that had made her the way she was she wasnt much to look at unless you took away the lipstick and powder and the arched eyebrows that gave her narrow face an unpleasantly quizzical expression if you took away all that she was rather attractive like someone he had imagined once but couldnt remember when or where and how really appealing she was how appealing in spite of the powder and rouge yes appealing indeed and more than once he had felt the urge to take her by the shoulder and brush the falseness away tenderly brush away the falseness and look upon her as she really was but how foolish he must seem how utterly ridiculous and beside the point and how absurdly he had answered when asked about his work it was like a desecration of writing itself like an apology he could perhaps have said more he could have tried to describe to her that private world inside him he could have attempted to put into words for instance the memories of his midwestthat flat open midwest where wheat fields stretched like a yellow ocean on each side of an asphalt highway he could have told her of steel mills that rose dark and sooty amid flaming cities and elevated roadways stretching over chicago where every morning and every night great trucks thundered out of the endless plains and into the skylines of flaming cities but how tiresome it was at other times how hopelessly personal and beside the point not exactly the most amusing conversation piece especially in the company of such a glittering young lady so wanda was her name wanda oneal how old could she be twenty perhaps not perhaps not even twenty she had asked if he were a preacher was he that way did he seem so to her nobody had ever said that before maybe he was sort of stuffy by her standards anyway barney lit a cigaret and began puffing reflectively his mind drifted across the hallway where his clothes and manuscripts were stuffed haphazardly in the two suitcases all those manuscripts all those hundreds of thousands of words often lately he had regarded them with something like shame did they really say very much the lofty concerns that were a part of his mind seemed rather ridiculous lately and he could not help but wonder how they would fare before the eyes of wanda preacher indeed maybe she would understand though maybe he could communicate them to her they had seemed so terribly important then when their fever first seized him and thus it was mainly that he left home as with his hero thomas wolfe it was a kind of quest a wonderfully intense and gallant quest only now he wasnt sure anymore just what the quest was of and the very idea of a quest seemed somehow provincial somehow square anyway he was having a rollicking time on the road and when the money ran out hed simply have to find himself a job but what about wanda what was she all about behind that raucous fagade what did she read think feel what did she really look for in a man maybe they could sit together in some quiet place maybe then she would reveal herself and speak to him with these thoughts barney let himself sink into the soft armchair and felt the happiness well in his chest and thought to himself with a certain regret how long it had been since hed felt so excited about life wake up she shouted at the doorway catching him by surprise she proceeded to the center of the room where she dumped the huge pile of dusty records on the floor most of these are fortyfives she said all my seventyeights got broken here choose what you like but hurry up because its getting late all the good places close at midnight barney gzed languidly from his chair behind her through the window the little park halfshrouded in the dusk seemed to actually beckon on each side of the broken walkway the grass grew high and weedy in places sprouting up between cracks in the pavement it was a rare place he had been thinking old and tragic with overhanging trees and deep shadows the scene in its dusky brooding sadness caused a sudden lump to form in barneys throat and for a moment he was tempted to reach out and touch her hand instead he merely cleared his throat and said lets just sit here for a while if you dont mind she seemed to study the top of his head just sit she exclaimed incredulously i only sit when im in the bathroom and once more the piercing laughter bounced off the walls youre crazy he said youre cute she said kind of different though she giggled suddenly what did you say you wrote about nothing i mean skip it lets talk about you me she almost shouted the incredulity returned to her eyes now youve really lost your senses theres nothing about me to talk about i dont believe that barney answered gazing a bit too intensely into her faintly laughing eyes i cant believe it youre just pretending i know you are and you youre just silly she answered you talk so silly she seemed to relax settling her small body more comfortably against the wall and half turning her head to stare at him with such an intensity that barney felt the insides of his stomach turn over and over and the cold sweat trickle from his armpits and run icily down his naked skin who knows she said musingly maybe youre gonna be fun after all a little anyway whatll you be doing till you find a job barney fought for courage the irrelevance of her conversation her bold eyes were succeeding despite his rapture in making him unbearably nervous and unsure look for one i guess he stammered she laughed shrilly dont be crazy i mean when youre not doing that i dunno he answered why we could go around together you and i andyou knowbe friends kind of you could even come in and listen to records if you wanted to if im not here just open the door and walk in barney sighed thankfully won dering if now she would talk what kind of music do you like he asked she reflected seriously oh any kind fast kind mostly the kind i suppose that sends me the farthest how about you all kinds said barney cursing the words silly she shrieked and laughed again a kind of sudden impetuous mindless giggle that stopped as suddenly as it had begun be serious now she continued regaining her breath you couldnt possibly like all kinds you either like jazz or rockandroll or classics or something well jazz he replied letting his eyes scan the shadowy treetops outdoors ghostlike in the darkness and thinking how absurd the very notion of syncopation in such a setting in the midst of such noble sadness and how equally ridiculous the sound of cellos in still a second scene a second hour and how odd it was that the world was so many strange and beautiful things all at once at least youre honest she went on in the shrill inflectionless voice i had a girl friend once who took in the classics you know played them all the time or so youd think like youd be talking to her on the phone and there would be beethoven or one of those clowns in the background very highbrow i wouldnt be a bit surprised if she didnt put him on purposely whenever she called you up the snob barney tried to laugh but his sadness was too great and after a short pause he awkwardly groped inside his shirt pocket for another cigaret he inhaled deeply letting the smoke pour from his nostrils in jerky little spurts im different she continued lowering her eyes im honest about what like i listen to all kinds like what for instance asked barney controlling his voice well like the platters and fats domino you know good strong negro music even little richard i play him when im feeling wild hes crazy youre crazy answered barney it was the second time he had said so how he cursed himself how he yearned to talk to her but seriously he ventured why do you call beethovens music highbrow because it is she replied irritably anyway how should i know all thats over my head barney studied her sadly her proud mocking eyes slender neck how he wanted to stroke that neck gently instead he continued awkwardly do you read much oh a little for instance there was an uncomfortable pause while she fingered nervously at her bracelet for instance why do you ask so many silly questions she said finally vexedly barney lowered his eyes youre a funny sort she continued i bet you read a lot still he averted his gaze feeling vaguely ashamed and not knowing quite why he continued looking at his feet and the pattern they made spread vlike on the floor his arms long and awkward hung comically between his legs no not so much he replied anyway not nearly as much as i used to i bet you do she pursued tauntingly then laughing suddenly added i bet you read shakespeare barney blushed no i dont then why do you talk like that like what the way you do she replied reproachfully she sat cruelly studying him her eyes shrewd and calculating squirming under the gaze barney swallowed back what would have been a kind of scream and let his mind flee it was often that he did so in a kind of urgent escape from the menacing present into the realm of theory or that other more private world he was fond of visiting there they were the two of them side by side in the little park and the whisper far away of a fairyhaunted fountain it was a most personal vision one the others could not see following it he had tackled the entire world typewriter in hand like don quixote come back what a quest it was to have been the smell of the spring breeze and the vision of faraway cities and now the quest was ending for there was nothing to be found dumbly almost despairingly he raised his hand and closed it carefully over her small delicate wrist youre crazy she said by way of reply youre the one whos crazy he insisted suddenly emboldened and staring desperately into her eyes you know i believe you really are she removed her hand eyeing him with vague suspicion cant you see it he continued the uselessness of it the crime her gaze relaxed what on earth are you talking about all im asking barney pleaded his voice cracking is that you try just for a moment to be serious i am trying she said irritably but youre so funny barney sat silent tasting the words he threw the cigarette to the floor squashing it with his foot his chin quivered funny how he said in a way that you like she reflected yeah sort of but first ive got to hear you recite poetry then laughing very loudly she grabbed his ear and twisted it vigorously lets go she commanded we may be missing something barney remained motionless where are you taking me he asked dont expect much its sort of a dump then why go he said we could stay here or sit in the park boom boom she replied beginning a slow almost imperceptible wiggle of her hips you know bongos dance floor lets go wait barney protested unable anymore to hide his desperation just a little longer please we havent even had a chance to talk silly she shrieked too much talk talk talk talk lets live then still shaking her hips she began snapping her fingers to the silent beat barney watched with horror as her face underwent an almost complete transfiguration the eyes staring dumbly like hideously empty sockets the teeth clenched as in a kind of epileptic seizure after a long while she looked again at him and the laughter returned to her eyes youre so funny she said why dont you learn to dance i cant said barney why not look at me now she was undulating her shoulders and again the terrifying grimace not so bad huh not so bad barney said at the point of tears but you know id much rather just sit here and watch you thats why i wanted to stay you know so i could go on just watching you silly she cried out again a vague coquetry lighting her eyes and thats what i wanted to talk about barney continued desperately how i could watch you and never get tired cha cha cha she chanted and how wonderful it would be he went on if we could get to know each other you know like really know each other but in a much different sexy she chimed cutting him off the shrill voice seeming to grow louder filled the entire room and barney was about to speak again when her perfume seemed to engulf him and she was kissing him passionately on the mouth satisfied now she said pulling herself away with a deliberate almost comical seductivity barney regained his breath the scent of her perfume hung heavily in the air her breasts seemed to swell and part of her hair had come undone her smell was everywhere a moist thick sensual presence that blotted out the entire room the world had lost its music and there was only her her odor her breathing barney lifted his arms and placed them heavily around her narrow waist pressing his fingers roughly into the moist sticky skin satisfied the word echoed teasingly no he said replying to her question i didnt think you would be she whispered drawing herself coyly away a visit with muhammad it was a rare fall day in chicago it was the kind of saturday mornin one wishes he were on the lakefront watching the weekend skippers ready their slim craft for a day of sailing i decided to walk the nine or ten blocks from the university of chicago quadrangle to the bluetrimmed mansion at woodlawn i did not know any of the students i met along the way old grads like me are always peering hopefully here and there as if they really expected to see someone they used to know some miracle of reincarnation yet even the old professors die off or maybe by progressive moultings they achieve some academic nirvana anyway the new ones who take their places dont look like the ones you used to know but there is consolation in the fact that at least the good grey gothic does not change it is reassuring to know that there underneath the ivy the granite is the same pretentiousness is a word ordinarily associated with mansions if a mansion is not pretentious it may as well be called a house i had walked past the room house on woodlawn before i realized i was even near it somehow it seemed to escape pretentiousness and i had passed it without really seeing it perhaps i was lost in my silent soliloquy on gothic and old grads perhaps it was because there are many mansions on this quiet street their original owners have fled the alwaysthreatening hovering advance guard of the stifled black ghetto had moved in long ago and settled down in decorous serenity north west and south of the great university the ghetto crowds in upon the famous midway where the university coeds sun themselves to sleep while reading aristotle and james joyce i had passed the address i was seeking but even as i did so the awareness of my oversight was signaled into my consciousness it was the blue and white trim on the multigabled old houseso inconsonant with the studied dignity of the neighboring housesthat halted me and sent me retracing my steps to the concrete driveway i had passed without seeing a moment before the number on the gate was it was the residence of elijah muhammad messenger to the mystical nation of islam in the wilderness of north america prophet to a confident empire of militant black muslims who may bow toward mecca in prayer but whose every other genuflection is toward chicago the prophets mansion sits rather near the street and entrance is by way of a portico extending out over the narrow driveway there was no sign of life anywhere about the grounds as i mounted the concrete steps and rang the bell presently the heavy door swung inward and a woman in a white uniform confronted me yes i have an appointment with mr muhammad i gave her my card yes she said ag in the interrogative was spent there was no emotional content in her voice whatever the messenger is expecting you i followed the woman into a small foyer and waited for her to tell muhammad that i had come i had been there before once during my early research on the black muslim movement i had had dinner with the prophet and had spent the entire evening listening to his explication of black islam as he had learned it from farad in the s a year or so later in another marathon session i had filled a small notebook with data on the messengers interpretation of history the respective roles proper to black men and white men in social and political relations and the eschatological promise inherent in the manifest destiny of the black nation he hoped to unite under the starandcrescent i remembered that there had been a comparative quality of cogency to these heterodox arguments that never seemed to come through in the addresses i had heard muhammad deliver in the various muslim temples about the country i awaited the prophets appearance with some apprehension the book i had written on the black muslim movement displeased some of his ministers very greatly and they had not been reticent about their displeasure a delegation of the faithful had called on me in atlanta to discuss the book and at least one irate muslim minister expressed the desire to burn them as fast as they came off the press too i had received some uncomplimentary letters one or two of which were thick enough to require my paying extra postage in order to get at the insults inside that some of the faithful would be unhappy about my treatment of the movement and certain of its leaders was not unexpected since the black muslims like most of the religiously devout themselves offer no pretensions about objectivity it would be naive to expect them to be clamorous in their applause over an objective analysis of their doctrines or activities nor was it altogether surprising that some of the protesting letters came from people who said they were not muslims but who because they do not like white people read the book with myopic impairments as i waited in the little foyer i could sense muhammads approach even though the sound of his footsteps was stillborn in the thick grey carpeting suddenly he was in the rooman electric sort of presenceand i was trying to assess the confusion i felt at what seemed an intuitive response to it welcome professor the muslim leader held out a lean brown hand as if to underscore his greeting i offered my hand in return while searching his face for some clue as to whether the reception was perfunctory there was no clue his eyes were steady and his handshake was firm he did not smile but then i could not remember having ever seen muhammad smile if in fact he does smile on occasion that is not the image by which he is remembered i followed the muslim leader into a large dining room where two young muslims were seated facing each other near one end of the table they arose at the approach of the prophet and remained standing until he had taken his seat at the head of the table i knew them both john x muhammads secretary and james x minister of the chicago mosque while they were standing i greeted each of them in turn secretary john assalaam alaikum minister james assalaam alaikum we shook hands and sat down the muslims had been drinking coffee and at a signal from muhammad the woman who had answered the door appeared and placed a cup of the steaming black brew in front of me it is muhammads custom to teach his ministers in a kind of informal briefing session each saturday morning these are not strategy sessions designed to accomplish some immediate tangible goals although such conferences are frequent the messengers saturday morning lectures are inculcatory their end is the progressive displacement of christian ie the white mans values with with a neofaradian interpretation of black islam as i joined the circle the messenger was addressing himself to the natural heritage of the black man and the superficiality of the white mans sense of moral responsibility it is the white man who disturbs the peace of the world he was saying the teachings of the white christian divide the natural unity of peoples they have put asians against asians africans against africans brothers against brothers all over the world throughout their civilized history this is the secret of their power the congenital blindness of the negro in america is demonstrated in his expectation that the white man will ever give him justice the white man is incapable of justice except to his own kind by nature he is incapable by nature he is a devil in trusting him we close our eyes to knowledge in loving him we ally ourselves with evil the white man is incapable of loving anyone who is not white it is time for us to go for self the white mans rule is ended the future belongs to the black people of the world the future is here if we can wake our people who have been duped by the white mans promises to set them free and make them equal i tried momentarily to bare my reason to this potent hypodermic to see if i could get the lift i have seen transport thousands in the muslim mosques in the black ghettos of america across the damaskcovered tables in an immaculate grey suit and a powderblue bow tie secretary john x was writing i could not see his eyes for he did not look up but i knew that he had missed no word uttered by his master i had been told that john had a college degree and i thought how incongruous seemed his role of amanuensis to the semiliterate messenger of allah john x the black baruch i said to myself and at that very moment as if he too were thinking of another prophet and another scribe years before muhammad was pronouncing doom for all the enemies of black islam jeremiah to proclaimbaruch to write it down elijah muhammad secretary john and now his remarks were addressed to me you intellectual people should pay good attention the white man wants to call you by your slave name now those who refuse to give up the mark of the beast must die with the beast the white devils want to set you against your own people but they will murder you if you forget that you are black give up the white mans name learn to love your own people i shuddered a little i had always thought my own name euphonius suppose i gave myself a private challenge following the black muslim custom of discarding european surnamesbadges of slavery the muslims call themi had to be known as eric x the rest of my life and my son would be eric x and my wife and daughter would become mere cross marks on my income tax returns so many xs could be confusing on the same side of the table with myself minister james sat enraptured he was seated nearest muhammad but his whole body was tense as he strained to capture and memorize every word that fell from the prophets lips occasionally he uttered an ejaculation thats right but the fixed smile never left his face his whole posture was one of unrelieved expectancy i thought about the old old lady with the gruff voice who used to sit on the edge of the front pew and talk back to the preacher in the revival meetings when i was a kid in alabama a long time ago raymond sharrieff came in muhammad paused while we exchanged greetings sharrieff is muhammads soninlaw he is also supreme captain of the fruit of islam foi the secret protective arm of the muslim movement sharrieff sat down next to john directly across the table from me the woman brought more coffee and the messenger resumed his teaching if the average black preacher would study the history of christianity he wouldnt believe in it or teach it to his people the white man will not call you brother there is no brotherhood in his religion the prophet then went on to tell about his experience in the holy city of mecca and in the other islamic lands where he has traveled it is a beautiful and touching thing to get among your own people and see the love that exists the white man cannot love you by nature he cannot love you but you must love each other and protect your own kind the white man will take care of himself the chimes sounded and the woman who had brought the coffee went to answer the door a moment later malcolm_x strode into the room every muslim came to his feet to greet the tall minister from new yorks mosque no muhammad embraced him in muslim fashion kissing him gently on each cheek assalam alaikum wah alaikum salaam assalam alaikum wah alaikum salaameach of the brothers greeted the smiling malcolmbut muhammad would hardly let him go how is the baby the prophet asked referring to malcolms infant daughter who interestingly enough is named attila the hun when did you leave new york there was genuine affection here between these two not unlike the affection between a father and a son who has done well for the family name one could sense that the little drama being acted here was real for the chief actors were for a time completely oblivious of all else who were in the room i had never doubted malcolms absolute loyalty to muhammad but now i made a mental note muhammad has never doubted it either there was a broad grin on his face as he waved malcolm to a seat at the long table it was the first time i had seen muhammad smile the teaching resumed but now two were writing for the ubiquitous malcolm_x would be quoting his master in halfdozen cities within as many days mr muhammad teaches us we cant make a future for twenty million black people by lying around the employment office we have to go for self we forget overnight what the white man did to us mr muhammad was speaking in less than hours a bomb would explode in a negro church in birmingham alabama where the right of black citizens to enjoy the fruits of democracy was still being contested in blood and invective four little negro girls guilty of no crime worse than trying to worship the god the white man taught them to love and believe in would be murdered by monday morning there would be more black muslims and fewer negro christians in america who are its members ace relations in america are relations between ruling elites issues are resolved boundaries are marked off favors are granted and pleas are denied by men of substance and power on both sides of the racial line negroes and whites in america gunnar myrdal observed deal with each other like two foreign countries through the medium of plenipotentiaries what is also true and more to the point is that negroes and whites deal with each other through the medium of competing power structures like two foreign countries like hostile and suspicious strangers negroes and whites negotiate treaties and truces through separate but not quite equal power blocs the white power structure has been endlessly annotated and analyzed but little or no attention has been given to the negro power structure as a group of selfconcious moulders and shapers of racial policy the importance of the negro power structure can hardly be overemphasized it is in fact a parallel government which fills the vacuum that exists between negro citizens and the state plenipotentiaries of this shadow governmentwhich we shall call the black establishmenthave negotiated with the league of nations and addressed formal notes to the united nations during world war ii the naacpthe offensive arm of the establishmentnegotiated with the government of england and addressed formal letters to sir winston churchill in times of crisisand it has always been a time of crisis for the negro black men ask not what their country can do for them but what the black establishment can do for them the black establishment oddly enough is not allblack it is a group of negroes and whites who command the power lines in the negro community the executive secretaries the board chairmen often white the presidents often white and board members of protest and improvement associations the bishops of negro denominations and the pastors of the largest and most influential churches the two are not necessarily synonymous the editors and publishers of major negro newspapers and periodicals the leading educators business and professional men the key members of this group from the standpoint of racial policy are the executive officers and boards of directors of the protest and improvement associations it helps enormously if a new departure in the negro community is sanctioned by these structures of power on the other hand it is difficult though not impossible to carry new ground if the black establishment says no although the power and influence of the establishment ranges over the whole theater of negro life the focal points are concentrated in five cities washington atlanta and nashville are important as centers of ideas programs and recruits new york and chicago on the other hand are control centers the importance of being a new yorker is dramatized by the board of one protest organization eighteen of the twentythree national board members come from new york city and environs what are the prerequisites for membership in the group money helps but many moneyed men are not members and many members are not moneyed men as in the white world control of a major institutiona protest group a major business or a churchis extremely important for our purposes then an establishment member and we are concerned here only with the national establishment is a person who holds a key office president executive vice president secretary treasurer board chairman or board membership in a major educational business defense or improvement association these men and women are the decision makers in the negro community but there are men who decide for the decision makers elites in other words within the elite a member of the inner core of power holds an independent base of power and membership on the governing boards of one or more key national institutions how does one recognize an establishment man by the boards he acquires here is a power profile of channing heggie tobias one of the least known and most powerful negroes in recent history note particularly the signs of establishment grace membership on governing boards channing h tobias social worker educator national decision maker student secretary international commission of ymcas senior secretary for colored work of ymcas of usa director phelpsstokes fund member president trumans civil_rights committee alternate delegate united nations member governing boards board of directors or board of trustees of following organizations and institutions naacp chairman marshall field foundation jessie smith noyes foundation liberia company hampton institute howard university paine college palmer memorial institute national council of churches of christ in usa commercial state bank and trust company of new york the important thing to note in this power profile is what sociologists call the accumulation of advantages an unnecessarily obscure phrase for the admirably simple biblical rule to them that hath more will be given what this means in terms of national negro power is that influence in one sphere can be transferred to influence in another sphere prominent educators and bishops for example often serve on the boards of directors of major business and protest and defense organizations and powerful businessmen in turn often serve on the boards of trustees of educational and philanthropic organizations contrary to the generally accepted opinion power does not inhere in individuals without access to institutionalized power individuals are powerless in both the negro and white community the popular error is to confuse prominence or wealth with power these things as we have shown are convertible into power over racial policy but they are j not in themselves instrumentalities of national power some politicians for example hold local power but are not usually members of the national establishment nor are politicians as politicians adam powell jr excepted fertile in raising and disposing of large issues bearing on national racial policy one makes a great leap into an understanding of the establishment if one perceives why adam clayton powell sr was admitted to the establishment while his son adam with greater fame and greater local power was excluded powell the elder sat for many many years on establishment boards the son has not yet occupied a seat in the inner sanctum relevant here are questions of style and temperament as well as availability powell has over the years complained bitterly of establishment snubs and he has discovered repeatedly that establishment games are played by establishment rules what precisely are establishment rules why for example is a richmond physician and a new york city judge more influential in shaping national racial policy than say congressman william l dawson or congressman adam clayton powell jr the core answer is that the physician and the judge are members of the littleknown inner core of establishment power both are among the ten men and one woman who were on the naacp board in and who were still listed twenty years later in more importantly both men were members of the executive committee of the board in the new york judge though little known nationally has ranged over the whole arena of establishment power he was a founder and incorporator of the naacp legal defense and educational fund and he is a former member of the executive committee of the urban league board through the physician and the judge we come to the heart of the matter continuous service in establishment circles board members in every organization come and go the names that turn up year after year are important they indicate centers of power and influence more importantly they point to the hierarchies within the hierarchy the governing boards of establishment organizations change periodically but the surface changes hide a steel core of continuity there is as professor n p tillman jr pointed out in a study of the naacp an inner core of men who hold board seats for years and then dying hand over the torch to another core in a study of the persons elected to the board through professor tillman focused on the nuclei of active minorities which dominated the board in the two periods and he concluded between and the nucleus appears to have consisted of john milholland d walter sachs joel spingarn arthur spingarn william e walling john h holmes mary ovington oswald villard and w e b du bois all but the first carried over into the second period both as board members and general officers thus providing continuity of personnel and policy in the second period they were joined by others predominantly negro namely louis wright charles toney allan chalmers alfred lewis channing tobias theodore spaulding and perhaps robert weaver meanwhile some of the holdovers died or resigned among whom only du bois was forced out in for the good of the association what emerges from all this is the power of establishment boards and the relative weakness of men whatever their local power or influence who do not participate in the informal giveandtake that precedes decision and the formal voting that ratifies it the only exceptions to this are the individuals who can make their weight felt without formal entree into the board rooms before a white administrator was named to head an establishment agency the appointment was cleared by long distance calls to a handful of men across the country but this exception proves the rule the men who received long distance calls were not asked to vote on the appointment the board had already voted they were asked to close ranks behind an establishment fait accompli we return then to the major premise men remote from the board rooms do not vote and men who do not vote in the small groups where one vote makes a difference do not generally count this is not to say that national boards are the final arbiters of racial policy the ruling boards of the establishment are free to decide policy within certain limits prescribed by other institutions within the family of power in the negro world of vast importance in this connection are negro educational institutions negro educators have always exerted tremendous influence on racial policy the nature of this influence was dramatized by the sitins which led to the expulsion of hundreds of students and the firing of scores of teachers the family of power includes not only negro organizations but white organizations racial policy is subtly shaped and diluted by the expectations priorities and fears of liberal labor religious and minority groups from this white liberal nexus the establishment seeks allies and donations the most talented of these allies have definite ideas about the goals and the direction of negro policy and it is not always possible to accept the donations without accepting the donors program among the leading organizations in this shadow cabinet of the shadow cabinet are the uawcio and other liberal unions the americal civil liberties union the american jewish committee and the american jewish congress the race relations departments under various names of the ywca ymca the national council of churches the roman catholic church and the american friends service committee another layer of hidden power on the fringes of the establishment centers in philanthropic organizations and their representatives the rosenwald foundation the american missionary association of the congregationalist church the rockefeller foundation and the harmon fund have played huge roles in shaping and braking negro policy of crucial importance in the context of current power realities are the taconic foundation and the phelpsstokes fund these organizations and their representatives are part of the formal and informal network of power surrounding the core organizations of the establishment some of these groups send white delegates to the establishment some groom specially selected negroes who represent them in the inner councils of power white delegates to the establishment should not be confused with bona fide members of the estabhhment certain positions in the establishment are apparently reserved for white men the naacp the national urban league and the naacp legal defense fund have never had a negro president or a negro treasurer nor for that matter have many other negro institutions of power final control chairman of the board and financial control treasurer and chairman of the financial and investment committees of negro colleges are generally vested in white hands one eastern investment banker for instance is chairman of the board of one negro college president and treasurer of the board of another and a member of the investment and executive committee of a third although this trustee holds enormous power in the negro world his name seldom if ever appears in a negro newspaper analysis of white power in the black world is complicated by primogenital relationships no negro family for example has exerted greater influence on negro policy than the baldwins the rosenwalds or the spingarns william h baldwin the elder was a close and influential advisor of booker t washington his wife ruth standish baldwin was a founder of the national urban league lester granger said she did more than any other person to shape the basic philosophy of the urban league since that time there has always been a baldwin on the urban league board the spingarns have made a great contribution to negro welfare and they have held power positions commensurate with their contributions dr joel e spingarn an erudite professor of english served as treasurer and chairman of the board of the naacp before assuming the presidency which he held from to his death in he was succeeded as president by his brother arthur and as a board member by his widow amy the spingarns are to the naacp what the baldwins are to the urban league in other words there has always been a spingarn on the naacp board in fact for almost fifty years there have been two spingarns of the naacp board arthur spingarn the current naacp president was chairman of the legal committee for more than years he was also a founder incorporator and first president of the naacp legal defense fund other white men in black_power in the year of the revolution were allan knight chalmers professor congregational minister author president of the naacp legal defense fund former head of the scottsboro defense committee former cochairman of the national council for a permanent fepc onetime member of more than governing boards jack greenberg attorney new york executive director of naacp legal defense fund former associate director of the fund henry steeger new york publisher of argosy magazine

for major civil_rights organizations other influential and wellheeled whites poor whites like poor negroes are democratically excluded shape negro policy and exercise veto power on new issues through their positions as board members and patrons and links to the white power structure the counterparts of the white friends in power are roy wilkins an exnewspaper editor who is executive secretary of the naacp whitney young jr a former social worker and educator who is executive director of the national urban league and cochairman of the council for united civil_rights leadership also influential on the national scene though not in the limelight are frederick douglass patterson veterinarian educator foundation executive new york city president of phelpsstokes fund president of national business league president emeritus of tuskegee institute founder and former president of the united negro college fund board of trustees bennett college bethunecookman college hampton institute palmer memorial southern educational foundation ralph johnson bunche political scientist un official new york city board of directors naacp phelpsstokes fund board of higher education new york fund for advancement of education rockefeller foundation harvard university board of overseers stephen gill spottswood ame zion bishop washington d c chairman of board of directors of naacp how much influence whites exert on negro policymakers has long been a matter of bitter debate no one doubts however that white influence is important in negro decisionmaking ralph j bunche among others has sharply criticized the role of white men in negro affairs in a memorandum prepared for the myrdal study bunche said white men exercised a great deal of control over the selection of negro leaders and scholars he went on to criticize the whole philosophy of interracial liberalism white members of interracial organizations he wrote usuall fix the measure of value of the organization deciding not merely the question of how much to ask for but also how to ask and indeed whether the negro should ask at all similar attacks have come from carter woodson w e b du bois e franklin frazier and others all echoed in varying degrees the charge of jessie o thomas who said once that interracial cooperation often ends up with negroes cooing and white people operating bunche in particular was scathing in the memorandum in his criticism of interracial liberalism too often bunche said in a criticism often repeated in the sixties negro board members receive their cues from white board members in general he concluded concern for the opinion of white supporters and allies is a powerful factor in keeping negro organizations respectable establishment arbiters denied these criticisms in the forties and they deny them today in their support it should be said that some whites in the establishment are more militant than some negroes jack greenberg for example is one of the more militant members of the legal wing other examples could be cited a former national urban league board member who championed a more militant urban league policy at a time when some though not all negro board members were opposed and yet when all this is said the fact remains that most white members of the establishment are moderate whites as a group have served as a brake rather than as an accelerator of the freedom movement it would be a mistake however to blame white liberals and moderates for establishment style the establishment in its present form is an invention of two radically different men booker t washington and w e b du bois and it betrays the tensions of this extraordinary miscegenation between conservatism and militancy in the first decades of the twentieth century booker t washington established an entente between moderate negroes and the better element of whites in this same period du bois established a similar entente between militant negroes and liberal whites after washingtons death these divergent forces met at joel spingarns country home in dutchess county new york and decided in so many words that booker t washington and w e b du bois were both right and that all roads leading to the goal were equally honorable this of course was no decision at all and du bois perceiving this years later left the establishment with a blast at the ruling group the basic problem in laffaire du bois was not program but style to understand establishment style we must hold to contradictory ideas at the center of our minds the establishment is both militant and conservative its pronouncements in other words are militant but its actions are cautious and conciliatory what distinguishes the negro power structure above all is its reluctance to act this powerful group whose tentacles extend into every area of negro life rarely raises new issues fepc nonviolence sitins mass demonstrations dontbuywhereyoucantwork came from without through the years the dominant voices in the negro power structure have been voices of caution and compromise through the years the manipulators of the structure have been men too timid and too cautious to initiate and direct action the establishments word protest is a mask for inaction the deepest strain in establishment protest is sterile and socially irrelevant endless debate polite petitions the sending of telegrams and letters the whole ritual of mimeograph machines and typewriters all this has been a substitute for hard analysis and risky action the word risk this separates the establishment and its perennial critics the radicals the establishment has never been willing to take serious risks it has never been willing to jeopardize place position and institutions in adventures for freedom as a result there has hovered over all establishment activities a faint smell of gamesmanship of pretense and posturing and evasions of reality it was this i think that led myrdal and bunche to write two of the most mournful sentences in the whole history of leadership analysis bunche leadership itself is a form of escape myrdal the negro hates the negro role in american society and the negro leader who acts out this role in public life becomes the symbol of what the negro hates there are endless stories on the game aspect of establishment leadership the best one i think used to bring down the house on the old vaudeville circuit a negro comedian mimicking a big negro leader would begin the following sentence in a stentorian voice and gradually lower his voice until at the end it was a bare whisper what we colored folks have got to do is to rise up and strike down these here damned white folks since the establishment of the establishment negro leadership has been under constant attack no serious student of the negro ethos has failed to note what drake and cayton called the ritual condemnation of negro leadership day in and day out from barber shop bar and beauty shop the cry arises negro leadershipthe people who run things i e the negro establishmentis no good a great deal of this constant and sometimes petty criticism stems from the social distance between the leadership and the masses students of power say that a people always get the kind of leadership they deserve but the reverse is also true leaders in the long run get the kind of followers they deserve the main bone of contention between the establishment and its critics revolves around the cumbersome wordmasses garvey in the twenties bunche in the forties a philip randolph in the forties e franklin frazier in the fifties and rebellious students in the sixties have contended that the establishment is a conspiracy in contempt of the masses however that may be it is certain that the establishment has never solved what du bois called gingerly the inner problem of contact with their own lower classes bunche went further and said in the forties that the negro elite knows little if any more about the negro in the mass than does the average white man the question at issue however is not knowledge but use the establishment has never organized the masses for social contention down through the years the negro power structure has been more active in accommodating the masses to misery than in organizing them for an attack on the forces responsible for the misery establishment statements point to a deep fear of direct intervention on the part of the masses the fear is not altogether unreasonable and it is not a fear of the establishment alone some of the new organizations trembling on the verge of risky action have shrunk back shuddering from the abyss into which they had just peered behind all the words and all the slogans is a terrible reality millions on millions of men and women with deep fears and resentments and needs fears and resentments and needs it should be noted that cannot be met by the appointment of a negro federal judge or the filing of a court suit no one knows really what will happen if this force is loosed for the lower strata of the negro working class does not belong to any organization not even despite current propaganda the church how bitter are these men and women how far are they willing to go if they are set in motion can they be controlled many men not all of them members of the establishment have asked themselves these questions and have decided in good conscience that they would rather not know the answers the establishment says officially that the negro masses cannot be organized that they are utterly apathetic and demoralized what this means unofficially is that it is impossible to organize the masses around a responsible respectable moderate programaround the establishments program in short in essence the establishments program is a program of agency relation of carefully selected agents acting for the masses in the courts and other theaters of power the central weak ness of this programand establishment men are too brilliant not to know itis that men cannot be freed by agentswhite or black the everrecurring cry of the negro power structure and some of the new organizations have taken it up is deal with us or the radicals will take over this is a curious confession of programmatic and ideological poverty the statement as a statement of leadership tells much about the relationships between the masses and the men who claim to be their leaders over the years negro men of power have built up considerable good will with the white power structure they have access to the state house and the white house and the sources of white money and this access enables them to get small favors for the people they say they are leading radicals surprisingly enough admit the existence of this good will but they contend that power and prestige are capital and like capital must be invested and risked occasionally if it is to bring a proper return at issue here are deep questions of power ethics power works the same way everywhere and men respond to power in the same way everywhere outs for example tend to be radical ins tend to be conservative the same rule applies to organizations experience suggests that reform organizations cannot stand too much success the more a reform organization wins the more money it collects the more staffers it acquires the more conservative it generally becomes establishment in style can best be understood in a comparison with radical out style radicals seek a showdown the establishment seeks an accommodation the establishment says it is necessary to reduce racial tensions radicals say it is necessary to raise them to the highest pitch to create what bayard rustin a leading philosopher of the freedom movement calls creative social confusion radicals denounce white people the establishment appeals to their sense of fair play radicals call for a revolt the establishment calls for a conference radicals appeal to the masses the establishment appeals to the better people radicals march the establishment confers radicals demonstrate the establishment negotiates radicals demand the establishment resolves radicals are radicals in the latin sense of root the establishment is conservativemilitantly so although the establishment resists new ideas it contains many bold and some radicalmen to say that the group is moribund and reactionary is to simplify a complicated process reactionaries have always been members of the establishment but so have progressives atlanta life insurance company for example sponsored many forwardlooking developments in atlanta supreme life financed and carried to the supreme court through earl b dickerson a key restrictive covenant case prominent members of the inner core have supported none causes and some like dickerson thurgood marshall ralph bunche and w h hastie have made laudable efforts to move the structure in the direction of the dominant social challenge the negro masses men who see a simple blackwhite dichotomy between the establishment and radicals would do well to ponder the actions of emen during world war ii dickerson and hastie resigned important government positions as protests against discrimination radical representatives of labor protested but did not resign other independent establishment men include two powerful editors who continued to print news about paul robeson in the fifties equally independent was an insurance executive who disavowed the ideas of the elder du bois but refused to disavow the manat a time when many radicals were running for cover but here as elsewhere rank has its privileges and here as elsewhere the exceptions prove the rule what matters in the establishment is not the individual but the group as a structure of power as a selfconscious determiner of negro policy the establishment moves slowly views all new ideas and departures with suspicion if not hostility like men of power everywhere establishmentarians are victims of their fears and phobias they would rather see things not happen than to see them happen they are in short hamlets who prefer to bear those ills they have than to fly to others they know not of and yet like hamlet they can be goaded into action one of the most important decisions in the history of american negroes the midforties decision to attack segregation per se in the courts was made by a handful of emen in a manhattan hotel room among the decisionmakers were the late walter white thurgood marshall and w h hastie the decision made by these men and others was later ratified by a larger group that the establishment was able to initiate and carry this radical new departure until then the dominant issue in negro life was separatebutequal facilities despite strong opposition from men in local power structures indicates the power and the potential of the group although members sometimes meet behind closed doors and make large decisions affecting the lives and livelihoods of the negro masses the establishment is not a conspiracy most decisions in fact are unconscious extensions of establishment style decisions that crystallize and take shape without vote or indeed an articulated proposal members of the establishment are by and large men who look out on life from the same vantage point as managers of men andor material and as holders of real estate and stocks and bonds establishment men are moulded by the same forces and respond to events with the same style like their contemporaries in the white world like men of place and power and property everywhere they tend to fear men and issues that rock the boat establishment policy is not entirely a matter of common temperament since the armenia conference of a negro unity conference called by a white man joel spingarnthe negro power structure has been a selfconscious group composed of men of weight who make decisions with other men of weight in mind and more men in the inner circle know each other see each other socially play bridge and poker together and decide affairs of state and money over martinis and scotch when the late president kennedy invited negro leaders to the white house for the emancipation centennial celebration negro guestsfrom north south east and westgreeted each other with the warmth of longlost cousins as indeed many of them were an administrative official dimly recognizing the implications of all this said with consternation and surprice why these people all know each other the establishment is linked not only by formal and informal ties but also by common backgrounds most members of the current establishment are lineal and according to their critics spiritual descendants of house slaves and the free negro elite not a few sprang from the black puritan class which placed a high premium on respectability responsibility and the middleclass values of thrift sobriety and steadiness almost all of them were marked for ill or good by strong men and women who desperately almost fanatically dedicated themselves to proving to themselves and to othersthat they were not negroes a common educational background also links the power structure a significantly large percentage of toplevel leadership has come from ivy league colleges many more however came from a handful of negro colleges which form a subivy league league howard university for example has served as a kind of postgraduate school for harvard postgraduates the number of negro leaders who studied or taught at howard bunche hastie thurgood marshall charles e thompson james nabrit carl murphy is impressive from these men came some of the establishments best thinkingpro and con the successful legal campaign was mapped at howard the pioneer thinking on nonviolence came largely from howard mordecai johnson james farmer howard thurman w s nelson and the thinking for several beyondtheestablishment organizations the national negro congress the negro sanderin was hammered out there atlanta and nashville have been equally important as establishment nurseries the southern branch of the ivy league consists of atlanta university james weldon johnson walter white virginia union eugene kinckle jones lincoln thurgood marshall morehouse martin_luther_king jr james nabrit jr mordecai johnson and fisk w e b du bois j finley wilson charles wesley the black puritan background the tutelage of white puritans in new south missionary schools and new england universities the proving of self and race against the standards of white power the postgraduate training in and around howard fisk morehouse and the leadership factories of chicago new york and washington this was the common womb from which came men imbued with a stern sense of duty responsibility men driven and set apart tragically separated from their white peers who patronized them and the negro masses whom they patronized this background plus du bois ideology of the talented tenth sent forth leaders with a rather aristocratic and not altogether realistic concept of noblesse obligemen who felt they were responsible for the masses and discharged that responsibility at a safe distance there was a mark on the brow of such men by the mark they recognized each other and excluded interlopers in their time and in their place they made important contributions it was not their fault really that they were products of their time and their place it was not their faultor was it reallythat they learned caution with duty that they learned to value order and respectability in the same places that taught them the desirability and the inevitability of social change they were on the whole a remarkable lot though not revolutionaries themselves they tilled the ground and prepared the way for the bitter harvest for many years the elite of family education property and yes color was in part an interlocked directorate composed of several large families tied together by marriage and a larger group who stood in candicacy for powerand marriage there are indications that the establishment is losing some of its caste and color flavor despite ingroup mating and a certain snobbishness based on status and color the establishment has always been open to talent backed by money andor organization and if possible respectability within recent years new members have entered the group by marriage and accomplishment the bumper crop of new doctors and professional men with status and money has also changed the contours of the establishment more important still is the expanding middleclass which makes it difficult to tell without a scoreboard where the establishment ends and the commons begin even more important as a factor in the waning influence of the establishment is the revolt of the masses asa philip randolph opened a pandoras box of mass participation when he called laborers and maids to the barricades in the forties there is considerable evidence that the establishment was scandalized but since the process was unstoppable the establishment wisely joined the movement and pushed it forward the postwar world which called off all bets has shaken the establishment to its foundation having fought off one challenge in the garvey movement of the twenties the establishment found itself face to face with another massbased black nationalist movement the nation of islam in this same period there was a complete revolution in mass communication a revolution that bewildered the establishment and almost isolated it in the void stepped john h johnson an inventive chicagoan who rose to the top ranks of the coalition establishment with a new kind of journalism there were other changes the shifting of the center of gravity from new york to atlanta in the wake of the montgomery boycott and the sitins and the emergence of the negro student as a social force the net result of these changes was a new correlation of forces in which a few ragged students could make decisions and carry them out without the advice and consent of the establishment in faraway new york then in the sixties the establishment was called upon to face a long suppressed issue the growing chasm between it and the masses urban renewal more than any other issue made the negro power structure face the fact that what is good for the negro real estate broker or the negro millionaire is not necessarily good for the negro laborer or the maid on relief a variety of issues in every big city issues revolving around poverty and middleclassness or the lack of it has called into question the good faith if not the good sense of the establishment it would be a mistake to conclude from all this that the establishment is dead far from it with the resiliency that has marked it for more than fifty years the group has grafted the new onto the old new men with new power have been accepted by the curiabut the curia has so far failed to ask itself the ancient questions about new wine and old bottles these questions are pushing the new men of power in quite a different direction a new establishment has sprung up around the core groups of the southern christian leadership conference the student nonviolent coordinating committee the congress of racial equality and the negro american labor league the new organizations are tapping new sources of negro and white expressiveness radicals pacifists intellectuals rebels nonconformists negro and whiteare finding niches in the new organizations among the persons who have served on the governing boards of the new organizations are harry belafonte sncc ella baker sncc rev c k steele sncc and core advisory committee howard thurman core advisory committee james baldwin core advisory committee and l d reddick slcc historian interestingly though the new men of power are weaving yet another interlocking directorate rev fred shuttles worth the president of the alabama conference of human rights is secretary of the sncc king himself and many of his aides and supporters flit in and out of core the fellowship of reconciliation and other organizations king is even fashioning a separate legal organization the ghandi societya move that has greatly disturbed the old establishment an analysis of the governing boards of the old and new organizations reveals two different layers of support with few exceptions members of the old organizations are not members of the governing or advisory boards of the new organizations among the interesting exceptions are james b carey allan knight chalmbers earl b dickerson a philip randolph ira de a reid walter reuther hobson reynolds jackie robinson and bishop w j walls the establishment exists today as an uneasy coalition of old patriarchs new men of power and rebels but it still wields force as an independent power in the negro world its continuing power and influence were evident in the march on washington where establishment men moderated and mitigated explosive forces and militant men the establishment still lives but it operates in a different climate establishment men grew up in a world where simple people acquiesced in the decisions of their betters now suddenly all that has changed policy is made now in the full glare of kleig lights with intellectuals students and a comedian dick gregory looking over the policymakers shoulders having survived marcus garvey in the twenties black lenins in the thirties and asa philip randolph in the forties the establishment is waiting now for the next turn of the wheel the only thing wrong with this calculation is that the name of the game has changed the young students and behind them the young black nationalists are playing for keeps when a game or historical process reaches that point as french conservatives and american tories discovered establishment men who refuse to bet lose all the time almost everyone knows that the white power structure is threatened by the negro revolution what is not noted often enough is that negro men of power are also on trial not for the decisions they made but for the decisions they did not make not for the battles they lost but for the battles they did not fight
the frustrated masculinity of the negro male there is a saying that the only people free in america are the white man and the negro woman while this is true only in a special sense it does point to the simple fact that negro men are extremely frustrated in playing the masculine role this leads to a psychological effort to compensate for feelings of inadequacy by way of a struggle for conspicuous masculinity many cloak their deepseated feelings of inadequacy in boldly masculine garb and mannerisms for example while only eccentric white males and old west villains wear mustaches the mustache is widely sported by negro men this spotlights their visible contrast with women more than a few negro women for their part will say that they dont want a man without a mustache tassled shoes umbrellas and earmuffs are regarded as feminine within the lower class although this now is waning to some extentwhat with the adoption of the continental and ivy league look the bouncing jitterbug walk and the bluffing demeanor of negro males is still another aspect of the quest for conspicuous masculinity while white men think nothing of crossing their arms or legs as a gesture of refinement negroes typically spread their legs and lean forward ever so slightly to achieve an effect not open to women wearing dresses and skirts then there are the masculine epithets such as man stud a stallion jack a male mule cat lion or panther and the like to suggest a masculine ferocity they long for but do not have women are accordingly given less ferocious labels such as babe and chick this does not include broad which apparently has come down from slavery days meaning a negro slaves wife owned by the master of another plantation and called an abroad wife the frustrated masculinity of the negro male also is apparent in the extreme suspicion of homosexuality among even the most normal of men thus the negro man who plays the classical piano or dances the ballet is likely to be called homosexual much more so than in the case of white men a negro man with the refined bearing of rock hudson would be viewed with suspicion or regarded as queer much of this is realistic anxiety for it is true that negro males are frustrated in the effort to play a male role before the coming of nonviolence in racial discord with its relative safeguards against resisting white mobs negro women and children were typically sent in men hung back apparently then rushed in after the situation was underway witness rosa parks who sparked the passive resistance movement autherine lucy first negro to enter the university of alabama ada lois sipuelfisher first negro to enter the university of oklahoma in a nonsegregated capacity and daisy bates who stood up to faubus along with the little rock nine now that the pattern has been set and the ku klux klan tamed negro males have become more reckless although one wonders what they would do without constance baker motley of the naacp legal staff and gloria richardson militant leader of the cambridge maryland protest this is in contrast to the cultural expectation that men should be the aggressive guardians of their women and children yet in some deep south communities negro males cannot even preserve the sanctity of their homes from invading white suitors the fact that the negro man cannot protect his family presents a special problem to the negro male psychology negro women can and often do rationalize wed get our rights if our men would face up to the white man negro males on the other hand have no one on whom to project the blame rather they are likely to internalize the contempt held by their women who have two national organizations the national council of negro women and the national association of colored womens clubswhile negro men have none as such witness the incident in chicago during the summer of when a group of negroes having obtained official permission to use calumet park which then was regarded as white were stoned by white teenage boys most of the men present ran off leaving four teenage boys and the women and children to fend for themselves on an individual level one irate worn an complained that her husband pretends to snore whenever she must arouse him from bed to check some mysterious noise downstairs say in the kitchen similarly negro males are frustrated in the effort to play the role of provider this is illustrated in the fact that a major tenet of the black muslim movement is to restore the male to a respectable position in their families women are expected to obey their husbands and relinquish some of their power in the family group men are bound in turn to a struggle to provide for and protect their families while there is some doubt that the muslims are successful in accomplishing these goals it is true that in muslim services unlike many christian churches which are disproportionately filled by women and children men do dominate the conduct of church affairs but the fact remains that negro men in general are impeded in the role of provider they are more likely to have their salaries outstripped by their women census figures for show that considerably more white males than females are enrolled in college percent to per cent this is not true for negroes where per cent of the males were enrolled in college against percent of the females even if a negro male does go to college he is more likely to wind up in a nonprofessional occupation while considerably more white males than females are professional the reverse is true for negroes needless to say there is often a strain between the nonprofessional negro male and his professional wife he may resent her professional associates while she may reject his nonprofessional friends the nonprofessional husband may feel sensitive to the professional status of his wife in contrast to his own and she may feel the need to apologize for him before her professional friends even those negro males who go to college and work in professional capacities are most often pushed into the traditionally feminine occupations of school teacher and social worker beneath the college rank high school women graduates may get clerical jobs in the white collar category and feel a prestige not accruing to their blue collar mates thus many negro women ex press the belief that a negro man cant do nothing for you financially or dont know how to treat a woman such women pride themselves on the possession of white sponsors who pay their clothing bill or the rent the negro malethey feelis minus the masculine prestige contingent on the ability to provide luxuries and satisfaction for females the paramount importance of the occupation to the males selfrespect has been pointed out by harold finestone see cats kicks and color in identity and anxiety ed by maurice stein and arthur vidich thus some reject work altogether and turn to pimping as a compensatory exploitation of the female but this is counter to a culture which expects the contrary only many persons mistakenly point to the negro males success in sports as an indication that negro males possess superior masculinity but this is not necessarily so such theorists may be overlooking the fact that the athletic field may be especially attractive to individuals who have a need to spotlight or showoff a conspicuous masculinity professor kirson weinberg of chicagos roosevelt university made a study of professional boxers for instance see the occupational culture of boxers american journal of sociology and found among them young men who were called sissie in childhood or who originally had femininesounding names one individual decided to learn boxing because his sister had grown tired of taking up for him much of the viciousness of welterweight champion emil griffiths fatal fight with benny kid paret was said to be the result of hostility generated at the weighin when paret patted griffith who also is a designer of womens hats on the buttocks and called him a woman in spanish the lynch mob also has helped to exaggerate and spread the myth of the negros superior masculinity yet only one out of six lynch victims were even accused initially of rape see arthur raper the tragedy of lynching sex was merely used as a pretext by angry white mobs even so there is an old theory that many negro sex offenders are acting out their frustrations especially when the victim is white one negro simply walked up to a strange white woman in a chicago elevator and hit her in the mouth he explained that he simply had an irresistible impulse to bop her not to rape her and did not molest her sexually although many a man has shared this urge toward women of both races the point is still conceivable another who raped a negro girl said that he had always been too shy or meek to approach a woman in the usual manner but this has not offset the myths and jokes among whites regarding extreme or animalistic sexual prowess and equipment attributed to negro males it has helped to make the negro male an object of curiosity to more than a few white women but in turn has been utilized by white supremacists to salve their guilt regarding their easier access to negro women in the deep south see john dollard caste and class in a southern town at the same time the white supremacists develop fears that their own weird tales may contain some element of truth the next step naturally is to try to stifle or minimize the masculinity of the negro male in actuality sometimes even by outright castration john o killens author of a novel about negro men at war and then we heard the thunder was no doubt aware of this when he had a woman character tell the hero solly the one thing they will not stand for is for a black man to be a man and everything else is worthless if a man cant be a man the myth of the white backlash currently editors c columnists and commentators are making much of the socalled white backlash against the civil_rights movement they argue with uncommon unanimity that the stiffening resistance of white people against negro demands as exemplified in the large vote for alabamas segregationist governor in wisconsin indiana and maryland represents a significant loss of sympathy among whites for the cause of equal rights the assumption supporting this proposition is that there existed prior to the eruption of school boycotts sitins lieins stallins and the ascendancy of negro militants a great store of sincere goodwill toward negroes on the part of most northern whites and this is almost per cent pure myth if such goodwill did exist for negroes among northern whites then how was it manifested was it translated into activity designed at lowering racial barriers against negroes in the norththese are important questions for the key to the nature of the whole crisis of civil_rights in the north lies imbedded in the answers and yet these are questions few of the editors and analysts are asking the simple fact is thathad such goodwill been prevalent among northern whitesthere would never have developed any need for boycotts and demonstrations and the moderate and responsible negro leaders like roy wilkins of the naacp would never have been eclipsed by the extremists if northern white people generally favored equal rights for negroes then there would have existed no racial barriers in the craft unions no nonnegro hiring policies by many industrial firms no practice of keeping negroes in menial jobs in those firms where they are hired no exclusion of qualified negroes from middleclass or white residential areas and therefore no allnegro schools with facilities equipment and instruction demonstrably inferior to that in predominantly white schools those who argue insistently that negro militance has hurt the negro cause neglect to offer convincing evidence in support of their argument it may be that such evidence is in fact quite small and difficult to come by it is even possible that the argument is used largely as a club with which to discourage the growing nuisance of demonstrations viewed from the negro side of americas racial wall the proposition that there is a white backlash against the civil_rights movement takes on the character of a particularly insidious canard just what are these proponents of the white backlash theory up to anyway are they genuinely concerned that white sympathizers with the negro cause may abandon the struggle or are they attempting ever so subtly to blackmail negroes into submission surely any honest observer of the civil_rights scene who is capable of even moderately accurate perception must know by now that the white community tends to act in favor of negro rights only in the face of concerted negro pressure rare indeed are the instances where white authority bows to the principle of total equality of the races on its own initiative it is true that northern whites are reacting with some vehemence to the disruption of the status quo but are those who interpret this as a backlash unconsciously equating the status quo with the conditions of amiable race relations to negroes it would certainly seem so many of the whites who now are claiming disaffection with the ne gro cause because of some excesses on the part of some civil_rights activists or groups are actually revealing their own latent condescension prejudice and intolerance they are in effect seeking to punish all negroes for the behavior of a few negroes which is precisely the excuse southern racists have always employed now these people may proclaim themselves friends of negroes if they choose to but it is extremely unlikely that negroes have ever thought of them as friends this of course is another way of stating the dilemma of the liberal many whites who think of themselves as being friends to negroes would be embarrassed to read what amounts to a description of themselves in a book written by enlightened virginia aristocrat lewis harvie blair back in directing his words to those fellowpatricians who protested that they were gentle and helpful to negroes lewis harvie blair wrote in a southern prophecy but we forget that our kindness to the negroes proceeds from the standpoint of condescension and of assumed caste superiority and we expect it to be received with humility and from a feeling of acknowledged caste inferiority and if not so received by the negroes they are thought impudent and impertinent and the foundation of our kindness dries up the cause of justice and equality is either right or it is not and if it is right it does not become wrong because of the behavior of some individuals or groups concerned with it to say to negroes that their cause is just only so long as they behave in a way to deserve equality is not only to insult negro citizens but it is also to ascribe to white people precisely those powers over negroes which no citizen can have over another in a free society the point is that those who are defecting from support of negroes are those whose support was only token to begin with not only do these whites who believe in real equality still give unqualified support to the cause they also understand how and why many negroes are resorting to extremism these white people are not racists which is to say that they do not assign human rights and values according to race and therefore they are able to put themselves in the negros shoes and having done so they know that nothing short of death would prevent them from insisting that they have the same rights and privileges as all other americans and looking at the prowallace vote in wisconsin indiana and maryland from this viewpoint it is possible to be cheered rather than depressed by the results if wallaces pull of onethird of the vote really means that this proportion of the people oppose negro equality then it also means that the other twothirds are willing to accept negro equality indeed if the vote means any such thing it amounts to a great victory for the cause of equal rights in those two states personally however i am not so optimistic what the country is finally facing are the consequences of its own timidity hypocrisy and neglect americans in no section of the country have ever been subjected to any intensive coaching in the honoring of negro rights quite the opposite has been true and even some conservative observers are getting around to admitting as much in a recent column in the chicago daily news john m johnston wrote nobody who reads the papers should be surprised by the wallace phenomenon it was not by oversight that a hundred years have gone by without spelling out the privileges of citizenship for negroes as is now being attempted in washington indeed it was not i suggest that when the full impact of the meaning of the negro revolution dawns on white america the vote in favor of states rights and against government interference will be even greater than that recorded in the recent wisconsin and indiana primaries for negroes are in no popularity contest and they are not asking for tolerance negroes are insisting upon their rights as free citizens furthermore it is highly unlikely that negroes will be impressed by the endless admonitions of moderation and pleas for restraint directed at them by whites white people have been telling negroes to wait for their full rights for over a hundred years in fact it is precisely because negroes failed to insist upon their full and equal rights in the north that many of the racial restrictions now prevailing came to harden in custom many people believe for instance that the question of housing segregationundoubtedly a central concern in the nations racial dilemmais a relatively new and particularly delicate consideration in the overall problem but such is not the case the basic federal law on housing was passed nearly a century ago in it provided a year in prison a fine of or both for those who violated the following provision all citizens of the united states shall have the same right in every state and territory as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit purchase lease sell hold and convey real and personal property however in the south custom was joined by brutal suppression in the conspiracy against negro rights writing recently in the reporter of the great racist reaction that overtook the country in the s historian c vann woodward had this to say in the south the reaction found expression in whitesupremacy propaganda segregation laws poll taxes literacy and poverty tests white primaries and other devises for disfranchising the negroes it was accompanied by an increase in lynching riots and other forms of violence against the minority race it resulted in driving the negro from all forums and avenues of political life in stripipng him of many of the civil_rights and defenses he had gained through the reconstruction amendments and in reducing him to a despised and segregated outcast well negroes now are calling for a redress of all these grievances and it is the nations challengenot his aloneto see that the grievances are redressed with honor and dispatch in recent years liberals have replaced segregationists as the prime targets of negro ire writers like james baldwin and leroi jones have gone so far as to picture the liberals as millstones around the negros neck and poet calvin hernton flatly blamed the failure of white liberals for the rise of the black muslims these attacks of course were not leveled at genuine liberals who are relatively few but at that vast army of americans who mistake a patronizing attitude however subtle for a liberal conviction what most of these people mean when they say they are friends of negroes is that they dont mind negroes as long as negroes stay in their place and that place invariably turns out to be somewhere other than where full and unconditional rights of citizenship are a reality in other words these liberals tend to balk and to reject their convictions at the point where negroes insist on being simply men and women like any others with precisely the same rights privileges and obligations as other men and women and so whites in the metropolitan areas of the north are being flushed out into the openforced to go on recordrelative to their true racial attitudes it was one thing to strike a liberal pose in favor of negro rights so long as what was involved only amounted to a question of unsegregated seating on a southern bus or free use of a public park or even unrestricted service at a sandwich counter but it is quite another matter when this liberality is put to the acid test in terms of jobs schools and housing areas where some adjustment and possible inconvenience on the liberals part is required to make negro equality an unqualified reality white analysts of the civil_rights movement may choose to see a great white backlash but negroes remain unconvinced there is no surprise for negroes in the revelation of widespread bigotry among white people north or south what is happening is that the two major races in this country have arrived at the inevitable confrontation this is the true meaning of this moment this is the service governor george wallace of alabama is rendering to americans he is bringing us closer to the longpostponed moment of truth the time has come when white people are going to have to decide whether they are to be guided by the principles of justice and equality as spelled out in the constitution and bill of rights or whether they are going to submit this system of government to the rationale of racism we are now witnessing the weedingout process the separation of the true believers from the hypocrites from now until the resolution of the race problem one way or another white people will find it increasingly difficult to cloak their desire for white privilege in robes of genteel patronage the partys over it was sitting alone i f near the end of the p bar trying to finish a quick afterwork scotch when this tall blond fellow with bushy eyebrows came up to me and blurted would you come to my party beg pardon i said id like to invite you to this party im having up to my house friday night he explained noting the look of amazement on my face he plunged on you see im having this big party and a lot of people will be there but i dont have a negro you dont have what i asked not sure i had heard him right but certain i did not understand him if i had well youre a status symbol everybody else has one and i havent been able to find one anyplace he complained i mean ben matthews has got one working for him over at his accounting firm and joe gleason has got one selling cars at his agency bill miller knows one personally who is maitred at the golden rooster and bill can quote him on the negro problem in sales meetings and at social gatherings but i dont have anybody i could see frustration written all over the poor fellows face and i was not at all sure but what he was about to cry it would have been indecent of me not to be sympathetic what time is your party i asked oh goody its about eightish do you mean youll come but why me i asked you dont even know me well ive got to have somebody he cried you mean you want me to be your token negro i said drily oh yes indeedy you are most welcome he said well what are the ground rules i asked i mean what do you expect me to do what kind of party is it oh its just a cocktail affair you can dress casual and you dont have to do anything but stand around with a drink in your hand and talk to the other guests and maybe answer some questions about some of your friends like mahalia jackson and theolonius monk i dont know mahalia jackson and theolonius i said you dont he asked incredulously for a moment i thought he was going to take back his invitation well never mind he said finally talk about jazz and sugar ray robinson in his heydeyboy he was some fighterand maybe even martin_luther_king and all those dogs and water hoses down in birmingham we all felt just terrible about that how about barry goldwater i asked what suppose we get to talking about things like the presidential candidates maybe somebody will want to know what i think oh i think id stay away from politics he warned and added with a quick laugh you know what they say about never discussing politics and religion unless you want trouble what about a discussion of some of the organizations currently on the american scene like the john birch society i wanted to know well now there are going to be some more or less conservative people at the party andwell after all the john birch society is against communism you know isnt everybody i said but i tell you what suppose i just stand around and maybe talk business like what is real estate going for in the neighborhood oh i dont think id ask a question like that if i were you he protested quickly i mean therell be a lot of liberals there and all but a thing like mixing neighborhoods gets to be pretty touchy will there be dancing i wanted to know my yes he said and youre welcome to dance all you want as a matter of fact wed like to see you dance of course youll want to bring your own date i mean someone who knows all the dances then too you know how other guys are about someone dancing with their wives or dates he laughed again is it all right if i smoke i asked finally well i dont know about that he answered with all this cancer scare about smoking you know some of the guests might be a little queasy about being around a cancerous negro we just sort of stared at each other blankly for a moment say ive got a great idea he boomed at last how would you like to serve my party the negro who saved america the year was thomas jefferson had just become the third president o f the young struggling republic that was the united states in france napoleon bonaparte had just become the first consul of the republic for life and had barely begun his fantastic career of european domination but it was a former negro slave toussaint louverture who lived on the small caribbean island of san domingo around which world events would turn for the next two years from the island of san domingo toussaint louverture saved the united states from a possible war halted napoleon bonapartes plans for a western empire and made it possible for the united states to purchase louisiana from france to understand how this almost unknown figure came to have such a large influence on world events it is necessary to look at life on the island of san domingo in the year in san domingo was divided into two parts the eastern part of the island now called the dominican republic was a spanish colony the western half of the island now haiti was french and one of the richest colonies in the world at this time there were about onehalf million people living in the french colony about were white french colonists about were mulattoes and the rest were fullblooded negro slaves toussaint louverture was one of them the french revolution which had taken place two years before had severe repercussions on the island in the mulattoes who were wealthy well educated and french citizens but still subject to a kind of caste system demanded their freedom as french citizens the whites fearful of the mulattoes refused their demands and became ardent royalists the quarrelling and fighting between the two groups went on for two years until the government in san domingo decided in to stage a slave uprising to scare the whites and mulattoes into forgetting their differences and uniting behind the government the government called together the slave leaders and planned a mock uprising the slaves in return for their help were to receive one day off a week and a promise of no more whippings the slaves were to walk off the plantations and then the french troops would come in and pretend to end the pretended rebellion on august the slaves walked off the plantations as planned but a few slaves got carried away and the mock uprising turned into the real thing the whites and mulattoes now frightened ceased quarrelling joined forces and began to kill as many slaves as possible most of the slaves who had no intention of killing anyone now found themselves hunted by the whites and mulattoes who killed any slaves they caught to save their lives the slaves fought back and the battle was on toussaint louverture and other slave leaders seeing a chance to turn a senseless uprising into a real fight for the long dreamed of freedom gathered together an army of slaves and started the fight for freedom for two years toussaint conducted guerrilla warfare against the french insisting on freedom for the slaves as a part of any armistice agreement just as the french were preparing a campaign planned to ultimately defeat toussaints troops the french people removed louis xvi from the throne and france became a republic armies all over europe quickly mobilized against the democracy which threatened the safety of royalty everywhere england and spain seeing an opportunity to grab more land each sent troops into the french colony on san domingo toussaint quickly joined forces with the spanish who lacked troops in return for professional training for his troops the french fighting a war on two fronts now found themselves slowly losing ground finally the break toussaint and his troops had been waiting for came the french people at the height of their revolutionary ardor proclaimed the freedom of the slaves in january toussaint immediately offered his services to the new democracy and was accepted toussaint now turned to the task of defeating the english and the spanish this took time but by toussaint and his troops had driven out the english and had taken the eastern half of the island in the name of france although san domingo was still technically under french rule in toussaint louverture now held the real power being both governor and commanderinchief under the leadership of toussaint san domingo prospered by the island had reached twothirds of its prerevolutionary production toussaint invited the french planters who had fled the island during the fighting to return and pick up where they had left off many went back and enjoyed prosperity once more toussaint placed an overseer in charge of the lands owned by french colonists who did not return and divided the profits from these lands so that the workers received onequarter the government received onehalf and the absent owner received onequarter in a trust fund in case he should ever return toussaint improved roads and started schools he instituted a simple universal tax system under which everyone paid the same fixed percentage he made secret trade agreements with the united states and great britain and conducted a lively trade with these countries in short everyone from the white planters to the black former slaves prospered under the leadership of toussaint louverture more important everyone had freedom in the true sense of the word and there was no conflict between the whites and the blacks by the revolutionary government of france had fallen and bonaparte was now in power he had grandiose plans for building a colonial empire for france his original plan was to extend the french domain to egypt india and louisiana but by he had met failure in egypt and his plans for india had fallen through only louisiana was left for french expansion bonaparte wanted louisiana because it was a vast prosperous section of land enough land to start a new france new orleans was a trading center through which all american trade coming down the mississippi had to pass trade between the french caribbean colonies such as san domingo and louisiana would prosper all which would produce more wealth for france and gave bonaparte more room in which to operate besides louisiana would also be an excellent base from which to mount a french invasion of the united states if the occasion should ever present itself a french owned louisiana would have had a tremendous effect on the united states war would have been inevitable our rapidly expanding nation could not have tolerated a french colony on our western boundary the french would have been much more resistant to united states expansion than the spanish had been our struggling nation could not afford a war we had no army to speak of and our navy consisted of just seven frigates if we had gone to war alone against france we might easily have lost and become a french possession if we had joined forces with great britain against the french the greater possibility we would have been very dependent on britain for our existence and our future if we had won the war on britains side it is quite possible that canada would then have surrounded the united states on three sides a situation just as bad as a french louisiana the united states was in a tight spot and things looked dark indeed bonapartes plans for louisiana included san domingo bonaparte wanted to use the island as a supply base for the new colony however the island belonged to the french in name only the island really belonged to toussaint louverture and the negroes who might cut themselves loose from the mother country at any moment that situation could not be tolerated napoleon didnt exactly like the blacks either i am for the whites because i am white i have no other reason that one is enough besides that black upstart in san domingo had let himself be called bonaparte of the antilles and even had the nerve to send a constitution for bonapartes ratification in which he made himself governor of san domingo for five years opened the islands ports to any country in the world and declared san domingos local independence so bonaparte resolved to do away with toussaint and reinstate slavery france had ceded louisiana to spain in and bonaparte had to force charles iv king of spain to sign a treaty of retrocession of louisiana to france the treaty was agreed upon in october but it took bonaparte two full years to force charles to sign the treaty and make it legal while bonaparte waited for charles to sign the treaty he concentrated his efforts on san domingo he placed leclerc one of his best generals and his brotherinlaw in charge of the expedition to the island leclerc was to deceive the blacks win their confidence and then arrest toussaint disband his army and restore slavery napoleon gave him two months to accomplish this task when that had been done leclerc was to proceed to louisiana and assume a hostile attitude toward the united states great britain fearful of slave rebellions in its own colonies agreed not to interfere the united states trying to avoid war withdrew its trade from san domingo toussaint and his army alone were left to thwart bonapartes plan for a western empire leclercs troops set sail in january it was the largest expeditionary force ever sent overseas it consisted of troops generals and war vessels the fleet was so large that when toussaint first saw it he exclaimed we shall perish all france is come to make us slaves it was to be his only moment of panic quickly returning to the hills he issued to his people a proclamation which breathed vengeance my children france comes to make us slaves god gave us liberty france had no right to take it away burn the cities destroy the harvests tear up the roads with cannon poison the wells show the white man the hell he comes to make his people proved themselves equal to the task when leclerc landed in le cap one of the islands finest cities he found it reduced to ashes it was a scene which was to be repeated many times in the coming days the twomonth schedule bonaparte had set for leclerc came and went but the blacks showed no signs of giving up the fight although the french had captured the major cities and the coastal plains and many of the blacks had deserted toussaint he held on with an ever dwindling force continually defeating and eluding leclerc in the field leclerc was getting desperate he was losing as many men in sickness as he was on the field the morale of his troops was sinking lower and lower his supplies were in the same pitiful condition toussaint was also getting desperate his troops had dwindled down to men a force too small to fight the french toussaint could either hold out as long as possible or he could agree to an armistice let his troops go home to their families and be prepared to fight again when the time came to do so either way toussaint knew the coming rainy season would bring with it yellow fever which would effectively wipe out the french toussaint chose the latter course and arranged an armistice leclercwho wasted four months and troops trying to catch toussaint readily agreed to the armistice the armistice was a victory for toussaint the blacks were to be free french citizens and there were to be no reprisals but the armistice was not to last long toussaint was suddenly arrested and sent to france where he was put in a dungeon after his arrest toussaint told a french officer in overthrowing me you have cut down in san domingo only the trunk of the tree of liberty it will spring up again by the roots for they are numerous and deep numerous and deep they were indeed for all over the island insurrections were raised against the french the french their troops now badly depleted by yellow fever became increasingly powerless against the freedom fighters when leclerc died of malaria bonaparte reckoning that his army of had been defeated by toussaints uneducated badlyequipped black troops decided to withdraw from san domingo before he lost his reputation as a military genius he quickly leaped into a war with britain and in left the island to the negroes who had finally won their freedom while bonaparte was having his troubles in san domingo jefferson catching wind of napoleons plans for louisiana dispatched james monroe to france to try to buy new orleans and west florida for million dollars jefferson would have been satisfied if the united states could have retained its right of deposit at new orleans bonaparte his plans for a western empire now shattered by toussaint louverture was only too glad to be rid of new orleans and the rest of louisiana by selling louisiana he could raise needed money for his war with britain and could at the same time keep louisiana out of british hands napoleons representatives and monroe and livingston the other united states representative agreed to terms of million for all of louisiana even though monroe was not authorized to buy it agreement to terms was reached on april only days after toussaint louverture died of pneumonia in his lonely cell bonapartes dreams of a western empire came to an end san domingo had won its independence and the united states had gained an immense area of land the debt this country owes to toussaint louverture is considerable yet he is a forgotten man most united states history books fail to even mention his name race prejudice alone has blinded the american people to the debt they owe to toussaint louverture and the courage of onehalf million other negroes who would not be enslaved the nation needs your gifts a part from anything wanted to be able to come here and speak with you this afternoon because you are young gifted and negro aj in the month of may in the year i for one can think of no more dynamic combination that a person might be you are after all the product of a presently insurgent and historically vivacious and heroic culture a culture of an indomitable will for freedom and aspiration to dignity for even though it is not as well known as it should be our people have sustained one of the most heroic resistances to tyranny in the history of man our african ancestors came to the new world fighting slavery by mutiny on the high seas and by suicide the character of slavery itself was defined by the black mans repudiation of his enslavement which he daily did battle with by sabotage work stoppage acts of violence against those who enslaved him and of course most telling of all by running away by the thousands from slavery and when the time came to help give the fatal blow to the slave system our ancestors now by the tens of thousands fell into the ranks of abraham lincolns union army to serve in any way they could to destroy that hideous cancer against human dignity that was the confederacy they served as cooks they served as spies they served as work battalions men and women thousands and thousands of them but above all they served as the most determined fighting soldiers to don the union blue and storm the barricades of the rebel camps and after that war the civil war the negro people and the poor whites of the south sent their own sons for the first time into the halls of congress to represent them and create the finest democratic hour the south and this nation have ever known during the period of the reconstruction for example the free public school system was made available for the first time to the southlandwhereas before only the children of the rich had been able to enjoy the right to education it was against this brief upsurge of democracy for black and white that the bourbon south unleashed the night riderto take away the ballot from the negro and thereby from his poor white brother as well it was against this brief upsurge of equality that slavocrat apologist historians arose across the land to villify and defame the reconstruction and create an image of it that persists to this day and it was against the threat of the return ever again of such an hour of democracy and opportunity for allthat the system of brutality murder and economic intimidation we know today became the instruments used to guarantee the disfranchisement of the black men and degradation of the white men of the south it is this system which prevails today and it is this system that once again shall compel this nation to find better education or be torn asunder once again but apart from all these things apart from this little known and much distorted history of the negros threecentury struggle against oppression in the new worldis the fact of his culture a culture which since the seventeenth century has thrust forward poets and since the nineteenth novelists and journalists contrary to the notion of the quiescent intellectuality of the american black man is the fact that he first began publishing his newspapers in while the greatest of his number were yet in chains he began writing classical verse before america was a nation more important the inflected speech and idiom of our people continue to influence an entire nation as indeed do our everreplenishing dance and music forms continue to dominate our national arts and entertainments and that is why i say that though it be a thrilling and marvelous thing to be merely young and gifted in such times it is doubly so doubly dynamicto be young gifted and black look at the work that awaits you there is a story to be told and retold again until no man can plead his ignorance of the things i have just ripped through in such paltry outline i suppose what i am trying to do is to urge you in an opposite direction from the more fashionable attitudes and vogues of our times there are many who would have you believe that there is something wrong with you as writers if you concern yourselves with anything that i have just put before youwho would try to persuade you that genuine sophistication lies in the realm of the psychoanalytical novel and the absurdist play drawn not from the world as it is but from only your most highly internalized and overdistilled notions of that world i am too young and unwise not to offer advice this afternoonand i caution you as developing writers away from those seductions language symbols spoken and written have permitted man to abstract his awareness of the world and transmit his feelings about it to his fellows that may be the most extraordinary accomplish ment in the universe for all we know and even if it is not it is certainly one of the most wondrous and marvelous things to have happened since our particular group of megatons or whatever either fused or split to make this particular world of ours and it is certainly too important a gift to waste in not using it to the best of ones ability in behalf of the human race write if you will but write about the world as it is and as you think it ought to be and must beif there is to be a world write about not only exotic disappointments but ordinary ones write about the sitins write about the lady who bored you on the airplane write about how the stars seem viewed from earth write about love write about hatred pride jealousy in short write about all the things that men have written about since the beginning of writing and talking and write to a pointand dont pretend that you are being modern when you cant find what the point in what you have written is throw that thing away and start over with honesty write work hard at it care about it eschew the unstructured and the undisciplined and the pointless no matter what anyone tells youthey are cheap evasions of art and write about our people tell their story leave the convoluted sex preoccupations to the convoluted you have something glorious to draw on begging for attention use it one day several years ago mrs rosa parks refused to move to the back of the bus in montgomery alabama and gave the whole nation something to talk aboutand write about dont pass it up use it good luck to you the nation needs your gifts perfect them ft lee in enemy territory one doesnt have to be a galbraith to realize how impossible it would be to draw an economic picture of petersburg virginia without having the neighboring army base fort lee dominate the canvas yet if one uses the attitude of its citizens as a gauge he can only conclude that the town has retained its social and political autonomy despite this dependence now this attitude alone is in striking disagreement with the common belief that a town adjacent to a military base is forced to adopt its social customs and standards but petersburg actually goes a step further not only does it refuse to let the army influence its social customs it even tries to exert as much of its own influence as possible over fort lee the primary reason for this attitude lies in the location of the town petersburg is in the southcentral section of a state that is southern in both geographical position and temperament virginia is a state that prides itself on being the cradle of the confederacy a term which to its citizens is synonymous with independencesouthern style that is but it would be an understatement to simply say that virginia is in the south any virginian worth his tobacco or peanuts will tell you virginia is the south and any person who dares question this distinction risks being accused of an ignorance of american history a casual glance at a map is all it takes to prove that geographically this argument is fallacious but historically the virginian is on firm ground when he makes this contention for even the most desultory student of american history is aware that the state supplied many of the leading civilian and military heads of the confederacy general robert e lee made it all too clear that his allegiance to virginia took priority over his american citizenship to strengthen his argument the virginian is quick to point out richmond as the first capital of the confederacy it was at richmond that the illfated government took shape amidst the cheers of the throngs who hailed it as a declaration of independence from the tyrannical government in washington and it was in the richmond area that the once magnificent army of lee its ranks now thinned and illequipped had its final death throes the adventure had begun and ended in virginia the fall of a government however does not erase an image and the proud independent and selfreliant image the virginian had of himself persisted all through the humiliation of reconstruction like a muscle it absorbed this punishment gaining strength in the mere act of resistance until today this strength is boldly manifested in a monolithic resistance to edicts handed down by the federal government from prince edward county to arlington the backyard of the nations capitol this image flaunts itself the key word in virginia is independence its significant that petersburg which lies so close to richmond doesnt consider itself a suburb of that city the distance between the two cities can be traveled in thirty minutes and a community even an hour farther from a city like say chicago would accept the suburban label as a matter of course my first glimpse of the town came at night from the window of a rickety army bus that had picked the group of us up at richmonds byrd airport perhaps the poor first impression it made on me was because of my disappointment at not being shipped overseas immediately after basic training this plus the natural distaste a chicagoan has for any small town was enough to make the shabby buildings shabbier and the dim lights dimmer on the outskirts of town just before we reached the base the bus passed a cemetery few of us were surprised by its immense size but its unkempt appearance was enough to shock even the most complacent among us gravestones ran right up to the edge of the highway sitting there in a grotesque fashion still i could not help but see a poetic quality in having a cemetery serve as a buffer zone between a town of peace and a military installation it was as though it had been placed there as a reminder of the ultimate consequence of war a week passed before i was able to see the town again the intervening time was spent getting myself situated on the base that was to be my home for the next sixteen months fort lee turned out to be as beautiful as a college campus and as unique as the man whose name it bears like most of the military bases close to washington it is a showcase established as a training camp during world war i it has since become a training center for quartermaster officers the buildings are new and strikingly modern in design some even require visitors to remove their shoes before entering the floors can literally be eaten off of the lawns are green and wellkept the athletes and there are many for lee is also a special services center wear letter jackets and the commanding general often wore a red dinner jacket to social functions as my platoon sergeant often told us the quartermaster corps may not be the fightingest outfit in the army but ill be damned if were not the bestdressed lees athletic facilities were the envy of every college on the atlantic seacoast and many were quick to take advantage of them during the college spring vacation of the track team met princeton penn state morgan state winstonsalem and hampton institute lee certainly couldnt have been considered a breather for these schools because three members of the team had also been members of the u s olympic team bo roberson a silver medal winner later became a star halfback in the american football league baseball was the commanding generals pet sport so its not surprising that the baseball field was the best in the area what was surprising was that this small base had four swimming pools while much larger installations were lucky if they had one or two small wonder that when i finally received orders for an overseas assignment i was told that i was at last joining the army as pleasant as life was on the base i was still curious about that town that was a scant three miles away finally on a bright saturday afternoon i boarded the bus that made hourly trips into town it was significant that i remained in my seat near the front once the bus was through the post gate five years before the bus would have stopped after it had passed this gate and the driver would wait patiently until all his brownskinned passengers had movedprobably sullenly to the rear i was enjoying a privilege that certain individuals had risked courtmartial to win we drove past a field i hadnt seen or noticed on my first journey down that broad new highway the many plaques and statues indicated that it was meant to be much more than a park it was in fact a memorial a memorial to the confederatenot union mind yousoldiers who had died in the battle of petersburg later i learned that the gallantry of the union forces hadnt gone entirely unnoticed they had been buried right next to confederate soldiers one magnanimous virginian pointed out a man couldnt ask for a finer resting place i soon discovered that petersburg was full of civil war memorabilia plaques indicated where confederate troops had camped and large xs on sidewalks marked the spots where lee had conferred with his lieutenants it seemed that the city fathers were trying to create the impression that the entire war had been fought in that one small area i was reminded of the story told by a visitor to greece if one were to believe the many plaques and markers found in greek villages he stated then its clear that a handful of greeks nearly annihilated the entire turkish army in their war of fifteen minutes after leaving the base we arrived at our destination the bus station in downtown petersburg had two memorable features first there were the signs over the two doors where the words colored and white had recently been removed the imprints were still visible however perhaps to indicate that at least the ghost of segregation remained the second feature was not only strange but a little disturbing as well it was strange that the majority of the negroes still insisted on using the inferior facilities they had been relegated to during the stations segregated era instead of availing themselves of those in the erstwhile white section this botheredbugged would be a better wordme because i had learned that hundreds of students from nearby virginia state college had satin and picketedat the risk of imprisonmentto end the stations discriminatory practices as one leader of the demonstrations put it it just proves that you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink but one of his colleagues quickly pointed out that the purpose of the demonstrations had not been to force negroes to use the white facilities but to have their right to them recognized by station officials the fact that most of the local negroes refuse to abandon their old patterns of behavior doesnt mean the demonstrations were failures he contended i believe were justified in claiming a victory when the lone negro traveler no longer has to suffer the humiliation of being ordered to use a particular rest room or dining room unfortunately the bus station was the only victory the demonstrators could claim when it had come to the city library and local picnic area the white citizens had followed the example of their neighbors in prince edward county closing the library had obvious effects on citizens of both races but closing the picnic area produced unexpected and rather ludicrous results the petersburg picnic area it had no official name covered a dozen or so acres near the outskirts of the city it consisted of a few patches of seldomcut lawn sand mixed with stones and glass scraggly pine trees and a lake that was too muddy for swimming and where voracious snapping turtles had long ago destroyed the fish yet it offered the white petersburger the pleasure of quiet and negrofree weekends and was therefore considered well worth the tax money spent to maintain it naturally the negroes disagreed with this point of view as unappealing as that plot of land was it was still supported by public ie white and negro tax money and consequently it was the negroes right to decide for themselves whether or not to use the facilities so the inevitable picketing and demonstrating began interestingly enough the negroes were protesting the injustice of the policy rather than an inconvenience for they had always preferred lake jordan an armymaintained resort a mere eight miles from town lake jordans waters were clean and blue well stocked fish not snapping turtles and its picnic area looked like one all this was in addition to the fact that the facilities were available to everyone within a week after the petersburg lakes closing lake jordan officials noted a sharp increase in attendance it was clear to even the casual ist observer what was happening white petersburgers who only a week before had vowed to resist integration forever were flocking to integrated lake jordan this phenomenon could have been predicted from what had been happening at fort lee for years local whites however grudgingly had long been sharing the bases excellent athletic facilities with negroes on sunday afternoons even the lilywrhite restaurants were forsaken by these whites to enjoy an inexpensive dinner at the bases cafeteriaand few of them complained about having to share a table with a negro gi in the usually crowded dining room apparently they viewed segregation as a luxury to be enjoyed only when it was convenient for them since there was so much contact between fort lee and petersburg and since it was obvious that the town needed the base more than the base needed the town one would think that the base would take advantage of this opportunity to change local customs such was not the case instead there was overwhelming evidence that army officials had succumbed to local pressures no other explanation can be given for two service clubs and two noncommissioned officers clubs being maintained when one of each was more than adequate for such a small base no attempt was made to openly bar a particular race from any of the establishments but it was generally understood that a certain place was for us and the other place for them a few negroes ignored this silent decree and insisted on patronizing the white clubs just to assert their right to do so but the majority had little interest in integrating those pleasure spots where the blue grass variety of rock n roll music was a specialty actually the only ones inconvenienced or embarrassed by the system were members of the sizeable group of northernbred whites who had a predilection for a more sophisticated type of jazz occasionally a few of them could be seen cringing in a darkened comer of the negro club listening to the sounds that reminded them of their new york or chicago haunts how far fort lee officials would go to conform to local customs wasnt made clear to me until a certain incident on a hot spring afternoon the occasion was a parade in honor of j lindsay almond then governor of virginia who was touring various military installations in the state those with military experience need not be reminded of the grueling hours the soldier must spend preparing a base for the visit of a dignitary particularly if he is a politician the task was especially distasteful to negro soldiers who knew that almond represented all the social injustice they had encountered in the state it had been governor almondnot senator byrdwho had encouraged monolithic opposition to the supreme courts school desegregation order but the command had been given for everyone to stand tall for the occasion and distasteful as it may have been this order applied to black as well as white the army frowns on boycotts as a clerk in a battalion headquarters i was usually spared the harassment and discomfort of parades this time there were to be no exceptions how i swore as i labored over my scuffed boots and tarnished brass its at such times that a soldier asks what in hell have parades got to do with winning wars and invariably an old soldier would reply trooper a good soldier never questions orders it has always amazed me how quickly college graduates products of institutions encouraging inquiry adjust to this rigid code its even more amazing how many seem to enjoy having someone make decisions for them could it be that inquiry is often used as a means to escape responsibility if inquiry were a means of escaping anything then i was certainly eligible to be excused because a dozen questions passed through my mind as i stood at attention on the griddlehot parade field i was too angry to be bothered by the boilinghot sun that was baking my helmet and heating the metal on my rifle a few rows behind me i could hear someone whispering his own words to dixie i wish i was in old manhattan where negroes wear just silk and satin run away run away run away from dixieland but i was too engrossed in my thoughts and this spectacle before me to be amused by my comrades levityor bitterness why i asked myself were we being forced to stand at attention while dixie was being played why was the army so concerned about making a good impression on almond why werent any negro dignitaries in the reviewing stands along with the dozens of petty white politicians if it was because the white politicians had requested that none be invited why had the army complied with their wishes was it only the officials at lee who were unaware of the armys position to influence and change social policy or did this ignorance extend all the way up to the top brass since these were silent questions i expected no answers and even if i had had the courage to voice them theres little doubt that they would have been viewed as merely rhetorical questions however an explanation was offered unwittinglyimmediately after the parade units were ordered to pass in review a corporal next to me a young yankee whispered to the staff sergeant directly ahead of him say sarge are we expected to goosestep as we pass the reviewing stands trooper the sergeant replied the important thing in the army is to keep in step that was it the army in its efforts to keep in step with local custom had fallen out of step with the times had i been a hero or a fool i would have shouted this as i marched past the stands but since i considered myself a good soldier i saluted instead the story of the quakers among the most active of all religious groups in the area of civil_rights is the religious society of friends commonly called the quakers surely the quakers have done more for american negroes than has any other group in christendom at a time when it was illegal to provide religious instruction for slaves george fox the founder and leader of the quaker movement wrote about his concern that the enslaved negroes might come to the knowledge of the lord too he admonished slavemasters to treat their slaves mildly and gently and to consider setting them free after certain years of servitude fox had just visited one of his mission outposts in barbados where he had come face to face with the phenomenon of negro slavery for the first time seventeen years later a group of foxs followers in germantown pennsylvania expressed their conviction that human slavery was evil because it violated the golden rule it encouraged adultery and it caused cruel treatment the german friends concluded that slavery should be abolished it was largely by quaker action that pennsylvania began the legal abolition of slavery in nearly a hundred years before lincolns emancipation proclamation and early quakers were among the leaders of the abolitionist movement nationwide valiant antislavery voices in america included those of john greenleaf whittier lucretia mott and levi coffin all quakers coffin vividly described the activities of courageous quakers on behalf of the underground railroad between the slave states and canada with proclamation of the emancipation of the slaves the quakers did not consider their work finished the exslaves were for the most part ignorant untrained and confused quakers were prominent in the formation of freedmens associations which provided for the protection education and practical training of the emancipated negroes in modern times we find that quakers have been active in the formation of such organizations as the national urban league and the national association for the advancement of colored people who are these people the quakers why have they been so concerned about the welfare of negroes both of these questions can be answered satisfactorily by our taking a look at the history and basic convictions of the quakers first of all let us understand that quaker wa not the name which members of the group took upon themselves at first in fact for many decades after the appear ance of the movement it had no name there is no evidence that george fox intended to form a separate religious body born into the family of an english weaver in fox was a very serious and conscientious child as he grew up he became more and more unfavorably impressed by the formalism and irrelevance of the prevalent religions and soon left home to find a more vital dynamic faith the conviction unfolded within young fox that all christiansnot only the officially ordained clergymenwere priests who could speak directly with god from the depths of his newfound living faith fox began preaching in not only did he speak in churches but also in barns at market crosses and wherever else the opportunity presented itself by fox had followers by he had over the actions and way of life of the early quakers followed naturally and logically from their beliefs fox preached that every christian could hold mystic communion directly with god the spirit of love and truth therefore ordained ministers and forms of worship were unnecessary anyone believed the quakers could be guided by the holy spiritan inward spirit or inner lightif he would sit quietly and shut the world from his thoughts in the sight of god preached fox and his followers every man woman and child was equal and sacred by acceptance of these basic tenets every quaker found himself on what a later american quaker john woolman called the damascus road whereon he became aware of the concerns o the spiritual life and the drawing of the supreme spirit god soon he found himself on the jerusalem road which required a quickened conscience and a complete commitment to the holy life next came the jericho road the one on which he was called to action and service on behalf of his faith finally said woolman the quaker reached the erasmus road the way of true christian fellowship the followers of fox refused to take their hats off before judges or even kings feeling that you was too formal a title to be used among equals they addressed each other as thee because they believed that there was that of god in every man they absolutely refused to bear arms against another human or even to sue a neighbor because they felt that legal oaths implied a double standard of truth the quakers refused to make them the story is told of a modern quaker who was called to testify in court as he mounted the witness stand the judgeknowing the man to be a quakerasked him do you swear or affirm neither replied the qauker i tell the truth very well said the judge you may proceed such an attitude of tolerance might very well mark officials toward quakers in midtwentieth century america but it most assuredly did not characterize the views of the seventeenth century english officials what the quakers were telling the churchstate of england was in effect that it was wrong that its theology and ritual meant nothing that men did not have to attend steeplehouses to worship god and that it was evil to pay taxes in support of the state church of england certainly the group was not looked upon with favor from the time of their appearance the quakers were the objects of almost continuous persecution which they endured with almost incredible patience and courage in contrast with the other disapproved sects in england the quakers never met secretly for worship they always insisted that it vas a christian duty to meet openly no matter what the consequences many hundreds of them were imprisoned because of their refusal to attend the services of or pay tithes for the support of the recognized churches and especially for their steadfast refusal to take the governmentrequired oaths of supremacy and loyalty while being tried in derby england george fox admonished the presiding judge to quake with fear of the lord contemptuously the magistrate called fox a quaker and the epithet has been used ever since it was not until almost years after their appearancethat the group the quakers first referred to themselves as the religious society of friends which is to this day the formal name of the group the earlyday quakers fared little better in america than they did in england of all the early american colonies only rhode island at first welcomed the quakers in all the other colonies they were whipped deported hanged and in other ways persecuted some of the quaker women were even accused of being witches in the first american martyrs to the quaker cause william robinson and marmaduke stephenson were hanged on boston common mary dyer a quaker woman had been twice banished from boston but had returned with stephenson and robinson she had been sentenced to die with them too but was reprieved at the very last moment she was deported but returned to boston a year later insisting upon martyrdom as she ascended the gallows she was told she would be freed if she promised to leave massachusetts and never return nay she replied i cannot it was a windy day and after the execution a witness pointed to the body and exclaimed look she flies there like a flag when englands king charles ii heard of the heinous execution he was outraged and commanded the massachusetts authorities to stop killing quakers but to deport them to england the mary dyer execution was one of several events that led finally to englands toleration act of and the end of quaker historys long period of horror less than two years later george fox died it seems that with the passing of the toleration act and the demise of george fox quaker zeal began to wane and die no longer did the friends feel impelled to go out into the world and rid it of evils instead they began to turn in upon themselves they developed and enforced ever more rigid codes of discipline on the society music art pleasure and the marrying of nonquakers were all strictly forbidden scrupulous honesty sobriety and punctuality were demanded quaker dress and speech became painfully plain during this timefrom to the quakers grew more and more different and dour indeed they became a peculiar people and they lost many members while gaining very few however respect for quaker education and philanthropy grew deeper and stronger and the ardent activities of the quakers for prison reform and the abolition of slavery began to take effect william penn a convert to quakerism established the model american colony pennsylvania and built its model capital city philadelphia he made with the indians what has been called the only treaty never sworn to and never broken the quakers treated the indians like dignified and intelligent sons of god and the indians reacted in kind during the years in which the quakers controlled pennsylvania and philadelphia the colony was never raided by the indians too it was unequaled in prosperity and in the excellence of its hospitals and educational institutions in the quakers stepped down and out of power in the city and colony when the demand was made upon them to pay a tax to finance a war against the shawnees and the delawares modem quakers belong to several divisions called meetings of the society of friends in complete contrast to every other group in christendom traditional quakerism has no formulated creed demanding definite subscription no liturgy priesthood or outward sacrament and no inequality between men and women in the organization though the friends have no written creed their beliefs generally agree with those of other protestants some are as liberal theologically as unitarians while others are as conservative as southern baptists most quakers study the bible placing special emphasis upon its moral teachings probably all of the friends insist that the bible is only a part of the continuing revelation of the divine spirit to man all quakerslib eral or conservative modernist or fundamentalistshare the doctrine of the inner light the divine spirit within every human being in the early days of quaker history all meetings for worship were silent or unprogrammed the members would gather in the severely plain meetinghouse and would sit in silence until some member felt moved to speak many of the friends still prefer the silent meeting however there are modern quaker groups that have paid ministers organs choirs and orders of worship their services are hardly distinguishable from those of presbyterian congregational methodist and other oldline protestant congregations and there are friends churches that conduct revivals and crusades as diligently as ultrafundamentalist baptists methodists and pentecostalists modern friends have kept alive the traditional quaker emphasis in education philanthropy and social justice for more than two centuries american quakers have sought ways of agreement by which they could approach the social problems with which they were concerned not only have the friends labored for better race relations but also for religious liberty the cause of peace temperance prison reform and care of the mentally ill throughout all their history the friends have sought first to achieve the new higher social order within the individual then in the meeting and thereafter to create it in their community and nation probably the most effective instrument of the modern quakers has been the american friends service committee the committee was formed in by members of most of the quaker meetings in america to care for the innocent victims of the war with a small group of paid workers and trained volunteers and relying heavily on local help and resources the afsc carries out an extensive program of relief and reconstruction in times of peace the committee maintains centers and work camps in europe and latin america as well as in underprivileged areas of the united states it is extremely active in the humanitarian works of resettling immigrants slum clearance and the improvement of housing it also collects repairs cleans and distributes large amounts of clothing in the american friends service committee shared with the british friends service council the nobel peace prize for worldwide labors for the cause of brotherhood the quakers have come a long way no longer are they merely a peculiar people who refuse to fight avoid politics and require absolute simplicity in speech manner and dress the modern quakers in america support registered representatives in washington dc and have produced a president herbert hoover and a vicepresident richard m nixon as well as untold scores of our countrys leading educators philanthropists men of letters and men of medicine rather than passively frowning on war the friends have sought ways to alleviate it many have rendered invaluable noncombatant service to their country in times of strife and a few have even fought in wars thus we see that the quaker concern for the negro has been and is but a part of a much larger picturethe vision in the heart of every friend of a world wherein there is peace and goodwill towards all men a fantasy the civil_rights bill of had been extremely weak when compared to the one that confronted congress in the new bill had been before the legislative body for almost a year and the filibustered were still going strong on both sides of the fence pro and con tempers were growing short it seemed to be just a matter of time before the negro revolution would change from passive resistance to a violent offensive the president had appeared on television numerous times in efforts to calm this explosive situation but his words were not enough and russia sat like a giant buzzard waiting to pick clean the bones of a nation that could die from the cancer of violence such was the state of things when it first appeared all the residents of the little town where it arrived had been evacuated and were virtually being held prisoners in an area cordoned off by a regiment of soldiers only a select group of scientists military men and important political figures was allowed to roam freely in the town all reporters were barred from entering and none of the select group was permitted to discuss the matter outside of the immediate area not even those who first observed it were exactly sure of the time it had arrived they only knew that it had come somewhere between midnight and am on the fateful morning of december investigation subsequent to its arrival allowed that one frank garvey night porter at the markus building was probably the first person to observe it after vigorously shaking his head to dispel any visual illusions he had run down the street to the all nitery biterya restaurant owned by frederick fred jacoby since fred was entirely familiar with the amount and consistency of frank garveys drinking a full half hour elapsed before he finally realized that frank was not in the clutches of delirium tremens at exactly six oclock fred stepped outside and looked what he saw sent him scrambling back to the telephone it was freds telephone call that eventually brought the horde of scientists military men and important political figures swarming to the town the military soon after arriving placed fred frank and all other eye witnesses under guard to keep them away from newspapermen and television owing to the rapidity of the exodus and to the removal of all eye witnesses the remaining residents did not really know why theyd been evacuated the fact that many carefully avoided all contact with their neighbors resulted from a rumor that mr jones mcklinin the used car dealer had contracted and spread a deadly tropical disease there were those who broke through the military cordon and fled to the woods in the belief that all populated areas were to be devastated by negro pilots who had stolen giant aircraft equipped with nuclear bombs but by the second day the facts began to emerge newspapers around the world carried the story on their front pages in germany herr grantz dropped his prized beer stein when he heard the news over his radio and tokedasan in japan bit the ends off his favorite chopsticks when he opened his newspaper the occurrence carried such impact that the possibility of an american race war was momentarily averted by evening of the second day even the aborigines in australia knew that an alien space ship was hovering over america the space ship did not whirl twirl nor spin it did not move backwards forward or sidewards it just hung there motionless nine hundred feet from the ground measurements by highly accurate scientific equipment showed that its altitude and position did not vary from day to day military and scientific aircraft equipped with cameras flew above below and beside the space ship the photographs that were taken received close study from a highly trained group of scientists but nothing of value was disclosed however reports from pilots of various aircraft revealed one significant fact on the upper right side of the otherwise unbroken surface of the space ship was a round sliding panel about three feet in diameter the angle at which it was located prevented those on the ground from photographing it through telescopic lens at irregular intervals the panel would rapidly slide open and shut as yet no aircraft had been lucky enough to snap a picture when it was open on the third day the panel slid open and shut at least fourteen times it was on this day that professor v c swainer a scientist began fiddling with the dials of a radio that sat on the counter of the all nitery bitery the group had selected the restaurant as a sort of headquarters for their activities therefore many heads swiveled toward professor swainer when he tuned in on the frequency of the towns radio station for a high metallic voice was blaring from the instrument repeating the same two sentences over and over i wish to communicate with the president you can contact me on this frequency i wish to communicate with the president you can contact me on this frequency iwishtocommunicatewiththepresidentyou there was complete silence in the restaurant as each highly trained mind assessed the repeated statements silence reigned as each scientist military man and important political figure reached the logical conclusion the silence persisted as each man accepted the conclusion in relation to the space ship outside the alien was speaking then professor swainer dropped his coffee cup and the silence was broken tables were overturned chairs kicked over and military shoe shines were ruined forever as men scrambled for the radio on the counter for telephones for radio transmitters and in some cases for safety itself one hour later everything was set communications with the space ship had been established then reestablished on a different secret frequency the president was standing by on a direct telephone line from the town to the white house fearing for the chief executives safety in such a strange situation his advisors had suggested that all information from the alien be relayed to the president via telephone at precisely ten minutes past two the alien began speaking through relay to the president of the united states of america no one except the select group of scientists military men and important political figures will ever know exactly what was said during that strange executive conference for the entire text of the conversation has never been made public but some facts were revealed at six oclock that same day when the president spoke over a a world wide hookup of radio and television my fellow americans and citizens of the world today has been one of the strangest and most important of my life we of this earth have long wondered if life exists out there among the stars we have long wondered if god in his wisdom saw fit to create other men on distant planets we have long wondered if such men would be compatible with our own world if they would have human characteristics if they would come in war or peace we need no longer wonder today i talked with such a man the president went on to explain that only one alien was on board the ship it had come as a sort of advance scout for the group that would eventually follow the alien he explained had not yet come out from the space ship because the atmosphere was slightly different from that of its own planet however after a period of adjustment it would be able to breathe the air without harmful effects thus the sliding panel in the side of the ship was enabling the alien to gradually become used to earths atmosphere the president continued there is no need to speculate on the intellect of these people the fact that they sent a space ship here shows their intelligence is far advanced when compared to ours i was informed that the customs languages policies and systems of governments on this earth have been under surveillance for years the president paused then looked steadily at the camera as he resumed speaking i was also informed that these people have concluded that we on earth will destroy each other if there is no outside intervention for reasons which were not told me they decided to intervene in so doing they further decided to support and expand the principles philosophies and government of the nation which is most similar to their own after years of study the nation of their choice is the united states of america in the wake of this news there were of course many reactions the russian news organs proclaimed that this is another devious capitalistic scheme to threaten the soviet union and all other good peoples of peace loving nations in a rabid rage red china swore that vile vicious warmongering lies will not deter us from our chosen objectives below the cotton curtain the misdirection of southern intelli gence resulted in the deduction that the aliens have studied all facets of ouah society and have ahproved all that white america has done therefoah they have studied segregation and found that it is propah in foreign lands american diplomats aurgued that in view of the aliens superiority it is apparent that we must do whatever they decree lest we ourselves be destroyed on the morning of the fourth day it was by the sheerest luck that captain gregory parrin veered in on the space ship and snapped a picture at the exact moment the panel slid open he himself did not realize that he had captured the interior of the ship on film more important he had photographed the alien within thirty minutes after the picture was taken captain parrin landed his aircraft it wasnt until three hours later that an excited group rushed a copy of the photograph to the white house only one half hour elapsed before the president again looked out on an international audience from the television screen dispensing with all preliminaries and formalities he began speaking immediately during the past days all of us have no doubt wondered what the being on board the space ship looks like perhaps we expected little green men with horns or some other monstrosity but this is not the case as we all know when god made us he made us in his image it is now apparent that when he made other men on other planets he abided by the same rule i have in my hand a picture of our visitor i am happy to say that he is not really alien at all though he is super intelligent he is just another man like you or me here is his picture the cameras focused on the enlarged photograph that the president held up for all to see it showed a man that was bare from the waist up it also showed that he was fair skinned blond haired and blue eyed two thirds of the worlds population viewed that picture with apprehension the question of whether it had anything to do with the sudden defeat of the civil_rights bill in congresswith the bloody uprisings of africans in various colonies with the vicious attack on the u s zone in panama or with the sudden sneak attack on russia by the chineseis now academic practically the whole world was in turmoil on the fifth day that day the space ship descended for two hours it sat on the ground unopened in the small town the ban on newsmen and television was lifted reporters and cameramen vied for the most advantageous positions even the president surrounded by security guards journeyed to the town and waited to greet the alien the word flashed around the globe and all fighting ceased at the end of those two hours men everywhere where sitting in suspense waiting and watching all talk and noisy speculations were halted by a high whining noise as a door in the space ship swung slowly open when the alien stepped forth mens breath caught in their throats as they gaped in astonishment only then did they remember that its picture had been taken in profile for the side of its body that resembled a fair skinned blond haired viking warrior blended in perfectly with the other side that resembled a black skinned curly haired african king the eyes of the world were upon it and its blue eye and brown eye stared back at the world by thomas merton if i dare to imagine that these letters may have some significance for both of us it is because i believe that christianity is concerned with human crises since christians are called to manifest the mercy and truth of god in history christianity is the victory of christ in the world that is to say in history it is the salvation of man in and through history through temporal decisions made for love of christ the redeemer and lord of history the mystery of christ is at work in all human events and our comprehension of secular events works itself out and expresses itself in that sacred history the history of salvation which the holy spirit teaches us to read between the lines we have to admit that this meaning is often provisional and sometimes beyond our grasp yet as christians we are committed to the attempt to see some meaning in temporal events that flow from human choices to be specific we are bound to search his tory that is to say the intelligible actions of men for some indications of their significance and some relevance to our present choice as christians history then is for us that complex of meanings which we read into the interplay of acts and decisions that make civilization and we are also this is more urgent still at a turning point in the history of that european and american society which has been shaped and dominated by christian concepts even where it has at times been unfaithful to its basically christian vocation we live in a culture which seems to have reached the point of extreme hazard at which it may plunge to its own ruin unless there is some renewal of life some new direction some providential reorganization of its forces for survival at present in a worldwide struggle for power which is entirely pragmatic if not cynically unprincipled the claims of those who appeal to their christian antecedents as justification for their struggle to maintain themselves in power are being judged by the events which flow from their supposedly christian choices for example we belong to a nation which prides itself on being free and relates this freedom to its source in christian theology our freedom rests on respect for the rights of the human person and though our society is not officially christian this respect for the person can be traced to the christian concept that every man is to be regarded as christ and treated as christ briefly then we justify our policies whether national or international by the implicit postulate that we are supremely concerned with the human person and his rights we do this because our ancestors regarded every man as christ and wished to treat him as christ or at least believed this to be the right way to act even though they did not always follow this belief now if we advance this claim and base our decisions and choices upon it we must not be surprised if the claim itself comes under judgment if we assert that we are the guardians of peace freedom and the rights of the person we may expect other people to question this demanding from time to time some evidence that we mean what we say commonly they will look for that evidence in our actions and if our actions do not fit our words they will assume that we are either fools deceiving ourselves or liars attempting to deceive others our claims to highminded love of freedom and our supposed defense of christian and personalist ideals are going to be judged we believe not only by other men but above all by god at times we are perhaps rashly inclined to find this distinction reassuring we say to ourselves god at least knows our sincerity he does not suspect us as our enemies do he sees the reality of our good intentions i am sure he sees whatever reality is there but are we absolutely certain that he judges our intentions exactly as we do let me cite an example our defense policies and the gigantic arms race which they require are all based on the supposition that we seek peace and freedom not only for ourselves but for the whole world we claim to possess the only effective and basically sincere formula for world peace because we alone are truly honest in our claim to respect the human person for us the person and his freedom with his basic rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness comes absolutely first therefore the sincerity and truth of all our asserted aims at home and abroad in defense and in civil affairs is going to be judged by the reality of our respect for persons and for their rights the rest of the world knows this very well we seem not to have realized this as well as they another example we claim that we are really solicitous for the rights of the negro and willing to grant him these rights some time or other we even insist that the very nature of our society is such that the negro as a person is precisely what we respect the most our laws declare that we are not simply a society which tolerates the presence of the negro as a second class citizen of whom we would prefer to rid ourselves altogether if we only could they assert that since the negro is a person he is in every way equal to every other person and our religion adds that what we do to him we do to christ since we are a free society based on respect for the dignity of the human person as taught to the world by christianity how then do we treat this other christ this person who happens to be black first if we look to the south which is plentifully supplied not only with negroes but also with professed christian believers we discover that belief in the negro as a person is accepted only with serious qualifications while the notion that he is to be treated as christ has been completely overlooked it would not be easy for a christian to mutilate another man string him up on a tree and shoot him full of holes if he believed that what he did to that man was done to christ on the contrary he must somehow imagine that he is doing this to the devilto prevent the devil doing it to him but in thinking such thoughts a christian has abdicated from christianity and has implicity rejected that basic respect for the rights of the person on which free society depends from then on anything such a man may say about christianity or freedom has lost all claims to rational significance only with the greatest unwillingness have some very earnest southern christians under duress accepted the painful need to ride in the same part of public conveyances with negroes eat at the same lunch counters use the same public facilities and there are still not a few of these christians who absolutely refuse to worship christ in the same congregations as negroes even some catholics have refused to receive the body of christ together with negroes in sacramental communion and they have been astonished to find themselves excommunicated officially for refusing integrated schools when in point of fact they had already by their own action manifestly excommunicated themselves acting purely and simply as schismatics rending the unity of the body of christ nevertheless the inner conflicts and contradictions of the south are not to be taken as a justification for the smugness with which the north is doing just as poor a job if not a worse job of defending the negros rights as a person the race problem is something which the southerner cannot escape almost half the population of the south is negro though there are greater concentrations of negroes in northern slums yet northern negroes can be treated as if they were not there at all for years new yorkers have been able to drive to westchester and connecticut without going through harlem or even seeing it except from a distant freeway the abuses thus tolerated and ignored are sometimes as bad and worse than anything in the south it is clear that our actual decisions and choices with regard to the negro show us that we are not in fact interested in the rights of several million persons who are members and citizens of our society and are in every way loyal americans they pay taxes fight for the country and do as well as anybody else in meeting their responsibilities and yet we tolerate shameful injustices which deprive them by threats and by actual violence of their right to vote and to participate actively in the affairs of the nation here i can see you will protest you will point to the supreme court decisions that have upheld negro rights to education in integrated colleges and schools it seems to me that our motives are judged by the real fruit of our decisions what have we done we have been willing to grant the negro rights on paper even in the south but the laws have been framed in such a way that in every case their execution has depended on the good will of white society and the white man has never failed when left to himself to block or obstruct or simply forget the necessary action without which the rights of the negro cannot be enjoyed in fact hence when laws have been passed and then contested and then dragged through all the courts and then finally upheld the negro is still in no position to benefit by them without in each case entering into further interminable lawsuits every time he wants to exercise a right that is guaranteed to him by law in effect we are not really giving the negro a right to live where he likes eat where he likes go to school where he likes or work where he likes but only to sue the white man who refuses to let him do these things if every time i want a coca cola i have to sue the owner of the snack bar i think i will probably keep going to the same old places in my ghetto that is what the negro until recently has done such laws are without meaning unless they reflect a willingness on the part of white society to implement them you will say you cant legislate morality that phrase may be quite true in its proper context but here it is a question not of morality but of a social system if we have got to the point where the laws are frequently if not commonly framed in such a way that they can be easily evaded by a privileged minority then the very structure of our society comes into question if you are responsible for legislation that has only a dubious value and if as a result the authority of law itself begins to be questioned then you are partly to blame for the disorders and the confusion resulting from civil disobedience and contempt of law i think there is possibly some truth in the accusation that we are making laws simply because they look nice on the books having them there we can enjoy the comfort of pointing to them reassuring our own consciences convincing ourselves that we are all that we claim to be and refuting the vicious allegations of hostile critics who question the sincerity of our devotion to freedom but at the same time when our own personal interests and preferences are concerned we have no intention of respecting the negros rights in the concrete north or south integration is always going to be not on our street but somewhere else that perhaps accounts for the extraordinary zeal with which the north insists upon integration in the south while treating the northern negro as if he were invisible flatly refusing to let him take shape in full view lest he demand the treatment due to a human person and a free citizen of this nation that is why the negro now insists on making himself just as obviously visible as he possibly can that is why he demonstrates he has come to realize that the white man is not interested in the rights of the negro but in the white mans own spiritual and material comfort if then by making himself visible the negro can finally disturb the white mans precious peace of soul then by all means he would be a fool not to do so yet when we are pressed and criticized and when the negros violated rights are brought up before us we stir ourselves to renewed efforts at legislation we introduce more bills into congress knowing well enough how much chance those bills have of retaining any real significance after they have finally made it if they make it at all the negro finally gets tired of this treatment and becomes quite rightly convinced that the only way he is ever going to get his rights is by fighting for them himself but we deplore his demonstrations we urge him to go slow we warn him against the consequences of violence when at least so far most of the organized violence has been on our side and not on his at the same time we secretly desire violence and even in some cases provoke it in the hope that the whole negro movement for freedom can be repressed by force i do not claim to be either a prophet or even a historian i do not profess to understand all the mysteries of political philosophy and i am thank god not a sociologist but i question whether our claims to be the only sincere defenders of the human person of his rights of his dignity of his nobility as a creature made in gods image as a member of the mystical christ can be substantiated by our actions it seems to me that we have retained little more than a few slogans and concepts that have been emptied of reality it seems to me that we have little genuine interest in human liberty and in the human person what we are interested in on the contrary is the unlimited freedom of the corporation when we call ourselves the free world we mean first of all the world in which business is free and the freedom of the person comes only after that because in our eyes the freedom of the person is dependent on money that is to say without money freedom has no meaning and therefore the most basic freedom of all is the freedom to make money if you have nothing to buy or sell freedom is in your case irrelevant in other words what we are really interested in is not persons but profits our society is organized first and foremost with a view to business and wherever we run into a choice between the rights of a human person and the advantages of a profitmaking organization the rights of the person will have difficulty getting a hearing profit first people afterward you ask me indignantly to confirm these vicious allegations it appears that the one aspect of the negro demonstrations that is being taken most seriously in the south is that they hurt business as long as there was talk only of rights and of freedom concepts which imply persons the negro movement was taken seriously chiefly by crackpots idealists and members of suspicious organizations thought to be under direct control of moscow like the naacp but still all this talk of negro rights especially when accompanied by hymnsinging and religious exhortations could hardly be taken seriously it was only when money became involved that the negro demonstrations finally impressed themselves upon the american mind as being real we claim to judge reality by the touchstone of christian values such as freedom thought the spirit faith personalism etc in actual fact we judge them by commercial values sales money price profits it is not the life of the spirit that is real to us but the vitality of the market spiritual values are to us in actual fact meaningless unless they can be reduced to terms of buying and selling but buying and selling are abstract operations money has no ontological reality it is a pure convention admittedly it is a very practical one but it is in itself completely unreal and the ritual that surrounds money transactions the whole liturgy of marketing and of profit is basically void of reality and of meaning yet we treat it as the final reality the absolute meaning in the light of which everything else is to be judged weighed evaluated priced thus we end up by treating persons as objects for sale and therefore as meaningless unless they have some value on the market a man is to us nothing more nor less than what he is worth he is known to us as a reality when he is known to be solvent by bankers otherwise he has not yet begun to exist our trouble is that we are alienated from our own personal reality our true self we do not believe in anything but money and the power or the enjoyment which come from the possession of money we do not believe in ourselves except in so far as we can estimate our own worth and verify by our operations in the world of the market that our subjective price coincides with what society is willing to pay for us and the negro he has so far been worth little or nothing until quite recently there was no place for him in our calculations unless perhaps we were landlordsunless we had real estatein harlem that of course was another matter because the negro was really quite profitable to us and yet we did not think of profit as coming to us from the beings of flesh and blood who were crowded into those rooms on the contrary it came to us from the only thing that was realour estate the negro was so shadowy so unreal that he was nothing more than the occasion for a series of very profitable transactions which gave us a good solid reality in our own eyes and in the eyes of our society but now suddenly we have discovered that there are also some real negroes for them to be real they must have the same kind of reality as ourselves reality is estimated in terms of financial worth and so we discover that there are a few negroes who have money why has this rich negro suddenly earned the grace of our benevolent attention because he is a person because he has brains because of the fantastic talents which alone could enable him to be a professional success against such inhuman odds none of this it is now to our interest to recognize him because we can use him against the others so now when the negro claims he wants to take his full part in american society as a person we retort you already are playing your part as a person negroes over the years we now declare have had a rapid rise in income a nice vague statement but it satisfies the mind of anyone who believes in money large numbers of negroes drive highpriced cars another beautiful act of faith but here we come with exact figures it is estimated that there are now thirtyfive negro millionaires in the united states what are these statements supposed to mean simply that there is no need for the negro to make such a fuss to demonstrate to fight for recognition as a person he has received that recognition already thirtyfive negroes are millionaires thirtyfive out of twenty million large numbers drive highpriced cars what more do you want these are indications that the negro has all he needs for he has opportunities he can make money and thus become real what opportunities even though a negro millionaire may live in a fine residential neighborhood he is still living in a ghetto when he moves in the whites move out the neighborhood is taken over by negroes and even if they are millionaires their presence means that a neighborhood is no longer fine for a white man it is no longer even residential so that even when he is worth a million a negro cannot buy himself in the land of the free the respect that is given to a human person doubtless the mercy and truth of god the victory of christ are being manifested in our current history but i am not able to see how they are manifested by us a little time perhaps only a few more months and we will realize that we have reached a moment of unparalleled seriousness in american history indeed in the history of the world the word revolution is getting around accepted at first with tolerance as a pleasantly graphic figure of speech it is going to be regarded with more and more disapproval because it comes too near to the truth and why what is a revolution what does it mean to say that the negros struggle for full civil_rights amounts to a revolution i much as it might distress southerners the fact that a negro may now sit down next to a white woman at a snack bar and order a sandwich is still somewhat short of revolution and if by dint of courageous and effective protest the negroes who have a vote in deep southern states should actually manage to cast their votes on election day without getting shot that in itself does not make a revolution though it may have something radically new about it the question is who will they be voting for ross barnett yet i have often thought there is something true as well as sinister in the usual conservative claim to realism we must admit that the southern politicians are much more fully aware of the revolutionary nature of the situation than are those northern liberals who blithely suppose that somehow the negroes both north and south will gradually and noiselessly fit in to white society exactly as it is with its affluent economy the mass media its political machines its professional thoughtlessness and its middle class suburban folkways we seem to think that when the negroes of the south really begin to use their largely hypothetical right to vote they will be content with the same candidates who were up last year and the year before if those candidates themselves were under any such illusion they would long since have done something that would get them the negro votes in point of fact the southern politicians realize very well that if the negroes turn out full force to vote and thereby establish themselves as a factor to be reckoned with in southern politics the political machines of the past are going to collapse in a cloud of dust to put it succinctly if the southern negro is really granted the rights which are guaranteed to him de jure by the american constitution and if he fully and freely exercises those rights it is all up with the old south there are quite enough negroes in the south to make any really free election catastrophic for the status quo and negroes both south and north are not going to waste time voting for people who sic police dogs on them and drench them with high pressure fire hoses while occasionally lobbing bombs onto their front porches for good measure so much for the south but what about the north northern negroes are already able to put some of their own men into office but this is only the beginning of what is suddenly becoming a very conscious and concerted drive for real political power this drive is going to be more and more accelerated by the problem of jobs with five million unemployed officially acknowledged in with no indications other than that this figure must grow and with repeated strikes and protests in which negroes demand to be hired along with whites there is going to be violent conflict over the limited number of jobs with the best will in the world nobody is going to be able to give jobs to negroes without taking them away from whites and there is no indication at the moment that the whites intend to retire en masse and spend the rest of their lives watching tv so that the negroes may carry on the work and collect the paychecks of the nation this represents whether we like it or not a radical threat to our present systema revolutionary situation and furthermore it accentuates the already clearly defined racial lines dividing the two sides in the conflict this means that the negro is going to continue to be what he has decidedly become aggressively aware of the power and impact on white society of mere threat of revolutionary violence the negro himself is in the presence of a social structure which he has reason to consider inherently unjust since it has never done him any real justice except in fair words and promises he also sees that this society has suddenly become extremely vulnerable the very agitation and confusion which greet his demands are to him indications of guilt and fear and he has very little respect for exhortations to go slow and be patient he feels he has been patient for a very long time and that anyone who cannot see this for himself is not being honest about it he also feels that there is no hope of any action being taken unless he takes action himself and that the steps taken by the government are mere political maneuvers leading nowhere this means that a wellmeaning liberal policy of compromises and concessions striving at the same time to placate the negro and to calm the seething indignation of the conservative whites is not going to avert danger it may on the contrary aggravate it hence the realism again of the conservatives who think that the only thing is to stop violence now by the full use of all the repressive agenciespolice national guard armywhich they themselves still fully control after all the traditional line of thought of those who use repressive power to defend the status quo is that they are justified in applying force to prevent a chaotic and explosive outbreak of revolutionary disorder save many lives protect property especially their own of course and maintain a semblance of national identity which would otherwise be dissolved in blood needless to say this is identical with the argument which revolutionaries themselves advance for repressing all resistance once they themselves have achieved their aim and have seized full power now my friend here is your situation you the wellmeaning liberal are right in the middle of all this confusion you are in fact a political catalyst on the one hand with your good will and your ideals your fine hopes and your generous but vague love of mankind in the abstract and of rights enthroned on a juridicial olympus you offer a certain encouragement to the negro and you do right my only complaint being that you are not yet right enough so that abetted by you he is emboldened to demand concessions though he knows you will not support all his demands he is well aware that you will be forced to support some of them in order to maintain your image of yourself as a liberal he also knows however that your material comforts your security and your congenial relations with the establishment are much more important to you than your rather volatile idealism and that when the game gets rough you will be quick to see your own interests menaced by his demands and you will sell him down the river for the five hundredth time in order to protect yourself for this reason as well as to support your own selfesteem you are very anxious to have a position of leadership and control in the negros fight for rights in order to be able to apply the brakes when you feel it necessary this is why the negro emphatically rejects you now he does not want you in his way you are more a nuisance than anything else and you offended at this lack of appreciation want to reassure the negroyou are really on his side and to prove it you will help him to get just a little more you will be satisfied with the headlines you will once again feel cozy with your liberal imagefor a few days thus you make it possible for him according to the fantasies of conservative thought to taste blood and conservative thought is not always deluded in its choice of metaphors on the other hand when you come face to face at last with concrete reality and take note of some unexpected and unlovely aspects of what you have hitherto considered only in the abstract you yourself are going to be a very frightened mortal you are going to see that there are more than ideas and ideals involved in this struggle it is more than a matter of images and headlines and you are going to realize that what has begun is not going to be stopped but that it will lead on into a future for which the past perhaps offers little or no precedent but since it is one of the characteristics of liberals that they prefer their future to be vaguely predictable just as the conservative prefers only a future that reproduces the past in all its details when you see that the future is entirely out of your hands and that you are totally unprepared for it you are going to fall back on the past and you are going to end up in the arms of the conservatives indeed you will be so much in their arms that you will be in their way and will not improve the shooting these are frank and brutal facts my good friend but they are the facts on which you must base your future decisions you must face it this upheaval is going to sweep away not only the old style political machines the quaint relics of a more sanguine era but also a great deal of the managerial sophistication of our own time and your liberalism is likely to go out the window along with a number of other entities that have their existence chiefly on paper and in the head what are you going to do are you going to say that though changes may be desirable in theory they cannot possibly be paid for by a social upheaval amounting to revolution are you going to decide that the negro movement is already out of hand and therefore it must be stopped at any cost even at the cost of ruthless force in that case you are retreating from the unknown future and falling back on a known and familiar alternative namely the alternative in which you who are after all on top remain on top by the use of force rather than admit a change in which you will not necessarily be on the bottom but in which your position as top dog will no longer be guaranteed you will prefer your own security to everything else and you will be willing to sacrifice the negro to preserve yourself but it is precisely in this that you are contributing to the inexorable development of a revolution for revolutions are always the result of situations in which the drive of an underprivileged mass of men can no longer be contained by token concessions and in which the establishment is too confused too inert and too frightened to participate with the underprivileged in a new and creative solution of what is realized to be their common problem this is the case at present in the united states instead of seeing the negro revolution as a manifestation of deep disorder that is eating away the inner substance of our society because it is in ourselves we look at it as a threat from outside ourselvesas a deplorable revolutionary adventure by an understandably dissatisfied minority goaded on by red agitators but this is a totally fanciful view which removes the crisis from the context of reality into a dreamworld of our own in which we proceed to seek a dreamsolution we forget that the negro is there because of us his crisis is the result of our acts and is in fact our crisis our total inability to see this is turning a common political problem into a violent conflict in which there is no possibility of real dialogue and in which the insensate shibboleths of racism drown out all hope of rational solutions when this happens even those whites and negroes who would normally be able to work together to find a common solution will be driven apart and the white man will become the black mans enemy by the mere fact that he is white as martin_luther_king sees so clearly if the negro struggle becomes a violent conflict and this is what would best please the white racists it is bound to fail in its most rational and creative purposethe real vindication of negro rights and the definitive assertion of the negro as a person equal in dignity to any other human person i am convinced he says that if we succumb to be the temptation to use violence in our struggle for freedom unborn generations will be the recipients of a long and desolate night of bitterness our chief legacy to them will be a neverending reign of chaos from strength to love by harper bros in one word there is a serious possibility of an eventual civil war which might wreck the fabric of american society and although the negro revolution in america is now unquestionably nonmarxist and just as unquestionably a completely original and homegrown product of our own there is no doubt that if it resulted in a revolutionary upheaval of american economic and political life there might be a danger of marxist elements capturing the revolution and taking it over in the name of soviet communism remote as it may seem this fits an already familiar pattern and furthermore it has to be considered because it already dominates the minds of the segregationist right wing my question to you is this can you think of a better way of conducting yourself does all profoundly significant social change have to be carried out in violence and with murder destruction police repression and counter repression is it not possible that the whites might give closer attention to the claims of negro leaders like martin_luther_king who assert that they do not want violence and who give every assurance backed up by some rather convincing evidence if you can remember birmingham that the negro is not out to kill anybody that he is really fighting not only for his own freedom but also in some strange way for the freedom of the whites this is a new and quixotic concept to us since we are fully convinced that we are the freest people that ever existed is it true that all change of our present social framework is necessarily a disaster so great that any price can legitimately be paid to keep it from coming about is it not possible that whites and negroes might join together in a creative political experiment such as the world has never yet seen and in which the first condition would be that the whites consented to let the negroes run their own revolution nonviolently giving them the necessary support and cooperation and not being alarmed at some of the sacrifices and difficulties that would necessarily be involved is there no alternative but violent repression in which reluctantly no doubt you decide that it is better for the establishment to be maintained by the exercise of the power which is entirely in white hands and which ought to remain in white hands because they are white because of course negroes are not yet ready for any kind of power this presupposes a simple view of the situation a belief that when the chips are down it is going to be either whites or blacks and since whites have proved their capacity to run the country and keep order it is unthinkable even to permit the possibility of that disorder which you take it for granted would follow if negroes took a leading part in our political life conclusion revolution must be prevented at all costs but demonstrations are already revolutionary ergo fire on the demonstrators ergo at the end of this chain of thought i visualize you my liberal friend goose stepping down massachusetts avenue in the uniform of an american totalitarian party in a mass rally where nothing but the most uproarious approval is manifest except by implication on the part of silent and strangely scented clouds of smoke drifting over from the new camps where the negroes are living in retirement ill how is christianity involved in the negro struggle dr martin_luther_king has appealed to strictly christian motives he has based his nonviolence on his belief that love can unite men even enemies in truth that is to say that he has clearly spelled out the struggle for freedom not as a struggle for the negro alone but also for the white man from the start the nonviolent element in the negro struggle is oriented toward healing the sin of racism and toward unity in reconciliation an absolutely necessary element in this reconciliation is that the white man should allow himself to learn the mute lesson which is addressed to him in the suffering the nonviolent protest the loving acceptance of punishment for the violation of unjust laws which the negro freely and willingly brings down upon himself in the white mans presence in the hope that the oppressor may come to see his own injustice the purpose of this suffering freely sought and accepted in the spirit of christ is the liberation of the negro and the redemption of the white man blinded by his endemic sin of racial injustice in other words the struggle for liberty is not regarded by this most significant sector of the negro population merely as a fight for political rights it is this and it is also much more it is what gandhi called satyagrahaa struggle first of all for the truth outside and independent of specific political contingencies the mystique of negro nonviolence holds that the victory of truth is inevitable but that the redemption of individuals is not inevitable though the truth will win since in christ it has already conquered not everyone can come to the lightfor if his works are darkness he fears to let them be seen the negro children who walked calmly up to the police dogs that lunged at them with a fury capable of tearing their small bodies to pieces were not only confronting the truth in an exalted moment of faith a providential kairos they were also in their simplicity bearing heroic christian witness to the truth for they were exposing their bodies to death in order to show god and man that they believed in the just rights of their people knew that those rights had been unjustly shamefully and systematically violated and realized that the violation called for expiation and redemptive protest because it was an offense against god and his truth they were stating clearly that the time had come where such violations could no longer be tolerated these negro followers of dr_king are convinced that there is more at stake than civic rights they believe that the survival of america is itself in question they believe that the sin of white america has reached such a proportion that it may call down a dreadful judgment perhaps total destruction on the whole country unless atonement is made these negroes are not simply judging the white man and rejecting him on the contrary they are seeking by christian love and sacrifice to redeem him to enlighten him so as not only to save his soul from perdition but also to awaken his mind and his conscience and stir him to initiate the reform and renewal which may still be capable of saving our society but this renewal must be the work of both the white and the negro together it cannot be planned and carried out by the white man alone or even by the negro under the white mans paternal guidance it demands some negro initiative and the white man cannot collaborate fruitfully until he recognizes the necessity of this initiative the negro is not going to be placated with assurances of respect and vague encouragement from our side he is going to make sure that we are listening and that we have understood him before he will believe in our attempts to help the purpose of nonviolent protest in its deepest and most spiritual dimensions is then to awaken the conscience of the white man to the awful reality of his injustice and of his sin so that he will be able to see that the negro problem is really a white problem that the cancer of injustice and hate which is eating white society and is only partly manifested in racial segregation with all its consequences is rooted in the heart of the white man himself only if the white man sees this will he be able gradually to understand the real nature of the problem and take steps to save himself and his society from complete ruin as the negro sees it the cold war and its fatal insanities are to a great extent generated within the purblind guilt ridden selfdeceiving selftormenting and selfdestructive psyche of the white man it is curious that while some southern whites are surrounding their houses with floodlights to protect themselves in case negroes creep up to murder them in the dark all the violence in the south to date has been on the part of the whites themselves barbara deming a white new england woman who demonstrated with the negro children in birmingham was sent to jail with them the jail was of course segregated she was thrown in a cell full of white prostitutes and other delinquents and found them not only furious and hostile towards her but terrified lest the negro children who were still singing hymns after a sublime display of christian heroism might rape and murder them in the jail curious that these white southerners people to be pitied indeed from their halfworld of violence petty thievery vice and addiction were the ones who felt themselves menaced and menaced by the clear eyes of children the truth is that they had very good reason to fear the action of the children was aimed at them and aimed directly at them it was an attack not upon their property their jobs their social status but upon their inmost conscience and unless that attack could be met and deflected these people would not be able to continue as they were in all literal truth if they heard the message of the negro children they would cease to be the people they were they would have to die to everything which was familiar and secure they would have to die to their past to their society with its prejudices and its inertia die to its false beliefs and go over to the side of the negroes for a southern white this would be a real death indeed this is the radical challenge of negro nonviolence today this is why it is a source of uneasiness and fear to all white men who are attached to their security if they are forced to listen to what the negro is trying to say the whites may have to admit that their prosperity is rooted to some extent in injustice and in sin and in consequence this might lead to a complete reexamination of the political motives behind all our current policies domestic and foreign with the possible admission that we are wrong such an admission might in fact be so disastrous that its effects would dislocate our whole economy and ruin the country these are not things that are consciously admitted but they are confusedly present in our thoughts and fears they account for the passionate and mindless desperation with which we plunge this way and that trying to evade the implications of our present crisis unfortunately not all negroes can appreciate the christian foundation of nonviolent action as it is practiced by the followers of dr_king many northern negro leaders and especially the organizers of the black muslim movement categorically reject dr_kings ideas as sentimental they believe that his nonviolence is a masochistic exhibition of defeatism which flatters the whites plays into their hands and degrades the negro still further by forcing him to submit uselessly to violence and humiliation in some cases the sharp criticism of martin_luther_king is carried so far as to accuse him of deliberately and cynically sacrificing his followers in order to get power and prestige for himself in white society this reaction against what is basically a christian protest leads to another extreme a black racism as intransigent and as fanatical as that of the white racists themselves it is true that the black muslims must not be painted as a corporation of devils yet the muslim movement is one of absolutely hostile rejection of all that is white including christianity conceived as the white mans religion instead islam regarded as african religion and as the worship of a black god or at least of the black mans god is substituted for it emphasis is laid on the martial and combative elements in the faith of islam and the first principle of all race relations is that the white man is never to be trusted he is worthy only of hatred and contempt no dialogue is possible between white and black and all that can be achieved is a complete separation their aim is to achieve this separation without violence in so far as this may be possible but they will not hesitate to use violence if this becomes necessary theoretically then the black muslims do not have a systematic program of violent attack on the white population as some seem to imagine but since the separation of which they dream is and can be no more than a dream the tension between the races in the big cities of the north where the muslims are concentrated will undoubtedly produce some violence sooner or later it can be said however that the fact that the muslims are disciplined and organized makes them to some extent an asset they will certainly try to control violence and direct it this is preferable to completely uncontrolled and in some ways uncaused rioting exploding at the slightest spark and spreading in aimless fury through whole cities until its force is spent yet the muslims however disciplined they themselves may be can easily start a general conflagration among other negroes the black muslims have so far had no influence in the south and although the negro spokesmen in the north are often hostile to martin_luther_king he has immense prestige wherever negroes are to be found in the united states though birmingham was not understood by all of them as a victory for their race it seems however that all hope of really constructive and positive results from the civil_rights movement is to be placed in the christian elements it is also possible that as the movement gains in power the reasonableness and the christian fervor of these elements will recede into the background and the movement will become more and more an unreasoning and intransigent mass movement dedicated to the conquest of sheer power more and more inclined to violence if the christian and nonviolent element in negro protest is finally discredited it may mean that christianity itself will become meaningless in negro eyes those negroes who attack their christian leaders in the south are usually completely disillusioned with christianity if not bitterly hostile to it because they are convinced that it has no other function than to keep the negro in passive and helpless submission to his white oppressors when white christians express admiration and sympathy for dr_king this is immediately interpreted by his negro critics as evidence for their own negative thesis as for the attitude of white christians toward the negro freedom movement protestants and catholics alike are at best confused and evasive in their sympathies one gets the impression that they mean well and that they recognize the validity of the negros protest but that they are so out of contact with the realities of the time that they have no idea how they can effectively help him it is true that the american hierarchy has denounced the sin of racism some but not all catholic bishops have taken action to integrate catholic schools or to castigate the worst abuses of discrimination here and there christian leaders get together to make encouraging statements yet at the same time even those white christians most favorable to the negro cause have been quick to react against the protests in birmingham and jackson censuring them and demanding more patience on the negros part sincerely believing that the whole problem can be adequately settled only by the administration in washington this to the negro is more than naive he cannot help but interpret it as evasion and bad faith and consequently he has little or no confidence in any white christian group including the catholic church evidently many white christians will be grieved and disappointed at this evaluation of their sincere concern over the negros struggle for his rights they will remind the negro that they have taken certain steps in his favor they will expect him to be more grateful i think the time has come to say two things about this attitude first of all it shows that they do not grasp the real dimensions of the problem as the negro sees it like the average liberal they think that the negro is simply presenting a few reasonable demands which can be met by legislative action and as a corollary to this they assume that if the negro were to ask any more than this he would be unreasonable if not rebellious in actual fact the negro is not simply asking to be accepted into the white mans society and eventually absorbed by it so that race relations in the us may finally come to be something like those in latin america i think that most catholics tend half consciously to imagine that this would be a reasonable outcome let the united states imitate those countries that were settled by catholics in the first place and where there has never been a very strict color line catholic values will triumph and there will be no more racial problems because the united states will be like brazil as present events in brazil make quite clear this is no solution the actions and attitudes of white christians all without exception contain a basic and axiomatic assumption of white superiority even when the pleas of the negro for equal rights are hailed with the greatest good will it is simply taken for granted that since the white man is superior the negro wants to become a white man and we liberals and christians that we are advance generously with open arms to embrace our little black brother and welcome him into white society the negro is not only not grateful he is not even impressed in fact he shows by his attitude that he is at the same time antagonized and disgusted by our stupidity and here i think is where all christians are innocently no doubt doing the gravest harm to christian truth for some unknown reason the white man especially the southern white does not seem to realize that he has been rather closely observed for the last two centuries by his negro slaves servants sharecroppers mistresses and bastards he does not seem to be aware of the fact that they know a great deal about him and in fact understand him in some ways better than he understands himself this information has never been passed on to the white man who has never dreamed of asking for it he has assumed that the ideas of the negro were more or less worthless in the first place do negroes think of course not they just sing dance make love and lie in the shade doing nothing because they are different they hadnt got the energy to think the negro knows precisely why the white man imagines that the negro wants to be a white man the white man is too insecure in his fatuous selfcomplacency to be able to imagine anything else consequently when the catholic church gives the impression that it regards the south as a vast potential pool of negro converts in which a zealous and ardent white apostolate can transform a few million uncle toms into reasonably respectable imitations of white catholics this actually does very little to make the negro respect the truth of christ practically nothing to help him understand the mystery of christ in his church it is often quite evident that the genuinely warm sympathy which so many catholics have for the negro is nevertheless something the negro himself now accepts only with resignation and disillusionment what we love in the negro tends to be once again the same old image of the vaudeville darkie the quaint black mammy of plantation days the pullman porter with ready wit the devoted retainer whose whole family has served a white southern feudal tribe for generations this is a caricature of the negro of which the negro himself has long since grown tired and its chief function is to flatter the white mans sense of superiority one has yet to find very many catholics including especially priests who are really able to deal with negroes on an equal footing that is to say without the specious and fraudulent mediation of this image most of us are congenitally unable to think black and yet that is precisely what we must do before we can even hope to understand the crisis in which we find ourselves and our best considered and most sympathetic consideration of the negros plight is one calculated to antagonize him because it reflects such pitiful inability to see him right before our nose as a real human being and not a higher type of domestic animal furthermore we do not bother really to listen to what he says because we assume that when the dialogue really begins he will already be thinking just like ourselves and in the meantime we are not too disposed to offend the white racists either we still want to please everybody with soft words and pleasant generalizations which we convince ourselves are necessary for charity a genuinely catholic approach to the negro would assume not only that white and the negro are essentially equal in dignity and this i think we do generally assume but also that they are brothers in the fullest sense of the word this means to say that a genuinely catholic attitude in manners of race is one which concretely accepts and fully recognizes the fact that different races and cultures are correlative they mutually complete one another the white man needs the negroand needs to know that he needs him white calls for black just as black calls for white our significance as white men is to be seen entirely in the fact that all men are not white until this fact is grasped we will never realize our true place in the world and we will never achieve what we are meant to achieve in it the white man is for the black man that is why he is white the black man is for the white man that is why he is black but so far we have managed only to see these relationships in a very unsatisfactory and distorted fashion first of all there was the crude initial concept the black man was for the white man in the sense that he belonged to him as his slave but in the relationship of master and slave there is no correlative responsibility the master is like god who cannot enter into a relationship with a creature the creature can only enter into a relationship with him so the master could do what he liked with the slave and perhaps incidentally he might find himself without realizing it living to some extent for the slave whom he had come to trust and love but though there was a germinating humanity in this relationship there was no sense of a real social obligation to slaves as such who therefore were never really admitted to be human beings thus though the south of slavery days was a kind of eden for the white man and is still remembered in the southern myth as eden it was without human significance because it was empty of basic truth the truth of man was absent because here were two different kinds of men who were supposed in the order of nature to complete one another as correlatives and one of them was not admitted to human status the civil war came and the negro acquired a human status on the books of law but only on the books in actual fact his position was even less human than before to assume the superiority of the white race and of europeanamerican culture as axiomatic and to proceed from there to integrate all other races and cultures by a purely onesided operation is a pure travesty of catholic unity in truth in fact this fake catholicism this parody of unity which is no unity at all but a onesided and arbitrary attempt to reduce others to a condition of identity with ourselves is one of the most disastrous of misconceptions it may be true that a french missionary who brings the truth of the gospel to a west african pagan is bringing him the truth indeed but unfortunately the fatal tendency has too often been to assume that everything he was bringing down to his clothes his table manners his cartesian habits of thought his gallic selfesteem and in a word the infallibility of the bien pensant were all pure revelations of god and his church in such conditions missionaries have assumed with extreme generosity that their only function was to give of their sublime fullness and that it was never necessary for them to receive to learn to accept any kind of a spiritual gift from the native and from his indigenous culture material contributionsyes but nothing else there has generally been no conception at all that the white man had anything to learn from the negro and now the irony is that the negro especially the christian negro of the heroic stamp of dr_king is offering the white man a message of salvation and the white man is so blinded by his selfsufficiency and selfconceit that he does not recognize the peril in which he puts himself by ignoring the offer but is the white man in a position to recognize the providential char acter of this hour if i say that the negro offers him an opportunity the white man will perhaps scrutinize him afresh in order to find out what he has to sell and what will he see something at once disturbing and unattractive processions of discontented black men and women carrying signs groups of exalted children singing hymns frightened but determined people letting themselves be rolled around the street by the power of firehoses there is courage there no doubt and they obviously mean business but we have courage too and there is no need at all for us to have the hoses turned on us but this is not the point the negro in fact has nothing to sell he is only offering us the occasion to enter with him into a providential reciprocity willed for us by god he is inviting us to understand him as necessary to our own lives and as completing them he is warning us that we cannot do without him and that if we insist on regarding him as an enemy an object of contempt or a rival we will perhaps sterilize and ruin our own lives he is telling us that unless we can enter into a vital and christian relationship with him there will be hate violence and civil war indeed and from this violence perhaps none of us will emerge whole it must then be said that this most critical moment in american history is the providential hour the kairos not merely of the negro but of the white man it is or at any rate it can be gods hour it can be the hour of vocation the moment in which hearing and understanding the will of god as expressed in the urgent need of our negro brother we can respond to that inscrutable will in a faith that faces the need of reform and creative change in order that the demands of truth and justice may not go unfulfilled it is for this reason that the prudence and the selfstyled wisdom of some white christian leaders may well prove to be a sign of spiritual blindness and as such it may be decisive in leading the negro away from christian truth and natural reason to embark on a violent and chaotic fight for power characterized only by brutality and pragmatism in this struggle the lessons given by the white police and politicians in the south will certainly be turned to good advantage what the negro now seeks and expects or perhaps what he has entirely given up expecting from the white christian is not sermons on patience but a creative and enlightened understanding of his effort to meet the demands of god in this his kairos what he expects of us is some indication that we are capable of seeing a little of the vision he has seen and of sharing his risks and his courage what he asks us is not the same old string of meaningless platitudes that we have always offered him in lieu of advice he asks us to listen to him and to pay some attention to what he has to say he seriously demands that we learn some thing from him because he is convinced that we need this and need it badly negro writers like james baldwin have repeatedly demonstrated that this conviction lends an extraordinary power to their words there is no question that they have more to say than anybody else writing in america today many have read their books and heard their message but few are prepared to understand it because they simply cannot conceive of a white man learning anything worthwhile from a negro still less can tney imagine that the negro might quite possibly have a prophetic message from god to the society of our time in simple and christian terms i would say that the message is this white society has sinned in many ways it has betrayed christ by its injustices to races it considered inferior and to countries which it colonized in particular it has sinned against christ in its lamentable injustices and cruelties to the negro the time has come when both white and negro have been granted by god a unique and momentous opportunity we have this opportunity because the negro has taken the steps which made it possible he has refused to accept the iniquity and injustice of white discrimination he has seen that to acquiesce in this injustice is not virtue but only collaboration in evil he has declared that he rejects both the physical evil of segregation and the moral evil of passive acquiescence in the white mans sin but this is only the beginning now the white man must do his share or the negros efforts will have no fruit the sin of the white man is to be expiated through a genuine response to the redemptive love of the negro for him the negro is ready to suffer if necessary to die if this will make the white man understand his sin repent of it and atone for it but this atonement must consist of two things a complete reform of the social system which permits and breeds such injustices this work of reorganization must be carried out under the inspiration of the negro whose providential time has now arrived and who has received from god enough light ardor and spiritual strength to free the white man in freeing himself from the white man i state these two conditions as nakedly and unequivocally as i find them in the words of negro leaders my only comment is that in making these demands they are committing themselves very heavily to provide answers in case we should ever ask them any questions the negro is saying that in effect he has answers so far his actions in birmingham make his claim credible i for one am willing to hear more but i must admit there is as yet a certain vagueness in the inconclusive remarks so faradvanced concerning the future i am not too sure the negro knows any better than anyone else where this country is actually going yet this is a challenge and a very bold one the negro leaders are making some fantastic claims and they are perhaps all the more fantastic because those who make them have half despaired of ever being heard certainly all the official good will of the administration is in no sense an acknowledgment that these claims have even been considered in their depth that is because washington is professionally capable only of seeing this as a political issue actually it is a spiritual and religious one and this element is by far the most important but it is the element that no one is ready to see a white detective in birmingham watching scores of negro children file into the paddy wagons gave expression to the mind of the nation when he said if this is religion i dont want any part of it if this is really what the mind of white america has concluded then we stand judged by our own thought what is demanded of us is not necessarily that we believe that the negro has mysterious and magic answers in the realm of politics and social control but that his spiritual insight into our common crisis is something we must take seriously by and large in the midst of the clamor of every possible kind of jaded and laughable false prophet the voice of the american negro has in it a genuine prophetic ring who knows if we will ever get another chance to hear it in any case the negro demands that his conditions be met with full attention and seriousness the white man may not fully succeed in this but he must at least try with all the earnestness at his command otherwise the moment of grace will pass without effect the merciful kairos of truth will turn into the dark hour of destruction and of hate the awakened negro will forget his moment of christian hope and christian inspiration he will deliberately drive out of his heart the merciful love of christ he will no longer be the gentle wideeyed child singing hymns while police dogs lunge at his throat there will be no more hymns and no more prayer vigils he will become a samson whose african strength flows ominously back into his arms he will suddenly pull the pillars of white society crashing down upon himself and his oppressor and perhaps somewhere out of the ruins a new world a black world will one day arise this is the message which the negro is trying to give white america i have spelled it out for myself subject to correction in order to see whether a white man is even capable of grasping the words let alone believing them for the rest you have moses and the prophets martin_luther_king james baldwin and the others read them and see for yourself what they are saying it is related that when mohammed was seeking the light he thought of becoming a christian and he went to some nestorian christians in a corner of arabia and sought a sign of the truth of christianity from them in order to see whether they had faith he asked them to show him the credibility of the christian message by walking barefoot on red hot coals the nestorians told him that he was mad mohammed saying nothing departed from them and soon the conviction that he sought came to him in the burning heat of the arabian desert it was a truth of stark and dreadful simplicityto be proved by the sword originally published in ramparts magazine whats a negro revolt boy an amateur freelance writer i nevertheless scooped the nations press in an interview with the notorious jim crow never before had old jim as he is affectionately dubbed by his devotees granted an interview for publication getting the meeting was very difficult the explanation of why an amateur was able to get it is quite simple old jim is press shy over long decades of observing from a distance so to speak how the press operates he has come to distrust the integrity of the gentlemen of the fourth estate he says they have always misrepresented him and often even maligned him and now he maintains they seek to dress him in a gray flannel suit and make a racemanipulating hypocrite of him but in his homeland old jims most quoted aphorism is i operate right straight from the shoulder after seven weeks of negotiation through an intermediary who must remain unnamed i was finally able to get the interview simply by convincing old jim that his answers would be published precisely as givenunadorned and unexpurgated the following interview occurred last march in old jims unpretentious hotel suite in dixie city capital of the empire of jim crow after i arrived in the city all preliminary arrangements including the satisfactory establishment of my identity had been made through one of old jims faithful lieutenants who at the scheduled time ushered me into the presence of this unique political boss seated behind a plain magnolia table old jim merely nodded when i spoke and indicated my he firmly advised get started chair i had barely got placed when instantly the interview began question what is the central purpose of racial segregation in your country answer to guard and maintain the pristine purity of the great anglosaxon race q would you say this racial purity has been kept unimpaired to date a hell yes of course otherwise how do you think it could be maintained you cant maintain what aint q then how do you explain the presence of so many light skinned negroes in the empire of jim crow a these are the legitimate offspring in the practical moral sense of the word of free white men and nigger girls or women but these mulattoes are examples of an impure nigger race since they have nigger blood in them they are niggersnot whites so the white race remains pure q but by the same token then wouldnt you have an instance of the impurity of the white race in the offspring of a negro man and a white woman a wed have just an ordinary mulatto nigger and two hangings q is there any economic purpose in segregation a the driving purpose of nigger slavery was economic gain and one of the chief secondary purposes of segregation is of course economic advancement economic exploitation of inferior races is one of our godgiven rights and we should show the good creator our appreciation by using this right without shame or reservation also social gains naturally flow from segregation in a civilized society a racial caste system releases the most capable members of the superior race from the cheap dirty dangerous work so they can devote their time and talents to business politics the professions education travel and recreation or fun q but what about the socalled poor white trash how do they fit into this caste system that is based on race a these rednecks and crackers no matter how povertyridden and ignorant can always look down upon the niggersand lord it over em this is a big boost to their spiritsthe whites i mean it enables them to adjust more easily to their natural poverty and this adjustment helps to insure the political stability of our society so segregation is both a psychological and a political asset it encourages contentment and fosters patriotism after all these lazy white people like the shiftless niggers get the kind of jobs they are best prepared for and the kind of living they deserve why man without these poor competing whites the niggers would make too much moneyand vice versa both groups come in very handy indeed q jim people all over the country are especially eager to get your uncensored views on education for negroes a beyond a little elementary schooling the least education they have the better off they areand the better off our country is too whatever is good for them is good for the country you never in all your life saw an educated nigger that wasnt uppity and you never saw an uneducated niggerif he was uneducated enoughthat was uppity its them educated town niggers that take off after them damn yankee trouble makers senator eastlands niggers dont ever bother nobody education ruins niggers as quick as a little extra money does besides they dont need no education above the grades for the jobs we need them for a little onthejob training at a nominal wage can teach them all they need to know anyhow dont anybody with just half sense know that you cant really educate a subject race and continue to hold them in subjection they wouldnt stand for it maybe the ancient romans did have some educated individual greek slaves but here in democratic america in the last half of the twentieth century we are dealing with a race of twenty million niggers that are already getting democratic ideas in their heads we either keep them in poverty and ignorance or they will eventually escape our domination and become free q how then would you explain the reason for the many new brick school buildings for negroes that have sprung up rather suddenly all over the empire of jim crow since when i was down through here last a actually they are essentially just window dressing a kind of false front or what some of them educated niggers like to call a facade what is taught inside them is little different from what was taught in the old inexpensive frame buildings which were really adequate for the purpose to teach the niggers a smattering of the three rs a little vocational training lots of life adjustment behavior and plenty of civics and patriotismloyalty we are not about to start that separate butequal education youve heard so much hypocritical talk of really them expensive buildings are an unnecessary strain on the taxpayers but many of my people i must admit have lost some of that old dontgiveadamn independence that nearly everybody down her used to haveeither from conviction or from apathy and even jim crow has to adjust his sails slightly to the prevailing windsuntil he can change the winds in a word a lot of my people have become appeasers instead of standing up and fighting like free white men they are trying to stave off real schoolhouse integration by appeasing them communist bureaucrats in washington with a few shiny new buildings and a little tokenism q see you mean stand up and fight like governor wallace did when he stood in the schoolhouse door he a why hells bells no like george wallace my eye here old jim shook the spittoon with a spout of ambeer how long did he stand in that door till them washington stooges bodily overpowered him manacled him and hauled him away no he meekly walked away with a sickly look on his face as meekly as a little lamb being led to the shears and if you please how many other schoolhouse doors has this redoubtable states rights governor said with a supercilious sneer stood in exactly none hes been too damn busy traipsing all over the country trying to polish up alabamas image image hell get it straight i mean stand up and fight like bull connor honesty forces me to admit that many of my people have become infected with that social malady of conformity at least they want to put up a nice looking front as they say and quite a few of them in fact a disturbingly large numberactually want to make what they call some long needed reformsa nice sounding word for unprincipled surrender evidently some of them are really deeply troubled by a warped sense of right and wrong theyve become soft q one more question please if you have time old jim had just glanced at his watch lying on the table do you think negro citizens should have the same voting rights that caucasiani mean anglosaxon citizens have a hell no and neither does anyone else down here who values our great democratic anglosaxon heritageor even just his own hide of course a little token voting by the right kind of niggersthe ones who know their places and stay in themis all right in fact at times it can serve the good of the country from my long career i can recall several instances in which we were able to swing a local election by using the nigger vote in manageable numbers but if we are to preserve our democracy the ballot must always be carefully protected the democratic ballot must never be subjected to promiscuous use by the niggers after all niggers dont automatically have the rights of citizenship they have only what rights we choose to give them practically speaking niggers are subjectsnot citizens when old jim picked up his watch i knew the interview was over although i was strongly tempted to ask him to elaborate upon his concept of the right of the ballot in a democracy i discreetly crammed my papers into my briefcase arose and thanked him for the interview he nodded without further formalities i left the roomand dixie city
by byron fulks this is the eleventh school year since the u s supreme court announced its epochal decision banning socalled separatebutequal public education but only this year has the wall of segregation been breached in the last of the defiant states in the late confederacy and all across the deep south the wall has been only breached racial segregation in our schools is still the only system in hundreds of southern communities and the dominant pattern all over the south further it is a disruptive practice mentally morally and socially stunting in many cities over the rest of the country its an old southern customwidely admired and emulated executive orders as well as other supreme decisions have sought to extend integration to other important activities of our public life such as service in the armed forces the use of parks recreational facilities transportation facilities libraries hospitals and housing numerous state laws and city ordinances have been enacted for the purposes of integrating our uses of public facilities and of more nearly equalizing our opportunities for education employment health and decent living standards these efforts national state and localhave by no means been in vain much indeed has been accomplished but immensely more remains to be done we have not yet become one nation indivisible we have not yet won liberty and justice for all in fact in these laudable endeavors as in integrated education we have really only barely begun for the most part we still have an essentially segregated society racial segregation discrimination and domination are old caucasian customs that will die hard why do we who widely and loudly profess to be a free nation and who propose to lead the socalled free world in a determined effort to maintain and further the ideals of liberty equality fraternity and democracywhy do we continue so long to procrastinate about implementing the individual rights provisions of our national constitution as well as our traditional ideals of democracy why do we hesitate so long before a watchful world to practice what we preach to other nationsand to ourselves was ever a primitive tribe more reluctant to forsake the venerable but violent ways of its fathers than we are to give up the narcotic fruits of racial segregation will it take a widespread mixing of blood in death to awaken us from our insensibility to human feelings and human rights our national virtues are involved in conditions so anomalous that a searching inquiry into the rationale of segregation is unavoidable if we negro digest december are to escape a national tragedy and an international revulsion in facing the naked facts of the cruel degrading and demoralizing uses of segregation we should find the inescapable obligation and the necessary courage and determination to end its brutal practice why does segregation remain so popular in caucasian circles high and low primarily it is because caucasians are the segregators rather than the segregated the rejectors instead of the rejected the shunnersnot the shunned that makes a vast differenceall the difference and people who actively practice racial discrimination have either too much arrogance or too little imagination or both to put themselves into the shoes of those who are forced to walk the lonely humiliating path of segregation our lack of a vigorous application of democratic and equalitarian principles to the civic life of each of our citizens alike is ultimately due in large part to our preference for property rights over human rights basically our aloof attitude toward the negro springs from an anachronistic concept of property rights he was once a marketable chattel he is even now in most southern localities popularly considered to be a communal hand available for use by the white community at a price near subsistence level indeed in many rural areas of the south a strong vestige of personal ownership of negroes is strikingly revealed through the common method of identifying a colored person as one of mr broadacres niggers thats an old southern custom congressional members from the rabidly apartheid states are relatively few in number but strong in influence and power this is partly because they openly and boisterously voice notions of white supremacy held in varying degrees by many other members who nevertheless find democratic pretensions more expedient politically than racism thus our political democracy remains almost exclusively a white democracy but segregationists by no means abhor color instead they find it politically useful socially gratifying psychologically flattering and economically profitable their apparent aversion to color as such is only pious pretense and those southern segregationists who thunder loudest against color are only indulging in diversionary tactics of course they are not afraid of color as their forefathers did for long generations before them they live intimately with it they work with it eat with it play with it sleep with it love it and help to procreate it but of course all of these interracial relations must by all means conform publicly to the rituals of white domination and negro submission this old southern custom is the sole requirement for close racial communion neither do these superior race advocates really object to the de velopment of a mongrelized race that they do not in practice object to miscegenation anyone can see again the manner of doing it is paramount they do not object to the act which is generally a form of exploitation but only to legalizing the act see john dollards caste and class in a southern town such legalization would eventually raise the status of the lower caste to the point of endangering the whole caste system which is to them centrally fundamentally and vitally important though the motives for interracial sexual intercourse are doubtless diverse and complex sexual exploitation of negro women by white men even to the point of rapeis an old southern custom the basic importance of color lies in its use as an indelible badge that permanently identifies a minority group and thus makes its exploitation hereditary the fundamental role of color is not to generate prejudice but to bolster and perpetuate it and the bourbon segregationists of the south have no intention whatsoever of surrendering now or later their way of life they cant easily be divorced from the idea that the negro still somehow belongs to them they will have to be pried loose this is an ugly fact of american life which will not go away because we minimize it try to ignore it or deny it its an old southern custom to have negroes during the last decade more advice has been given to the colored people of the united states about the desirability and necessity of obeying and upholding the law than has been given to the southern segregationists on the same subject during the entire career of jim crow whose sun is now sinking but in one respectin regard to the civil_rights of negro citizens the rulers of the south have always been a lawless group for half a century and more they lawlessly and blatantly ignored the equal part of the separatebutequal doctrine in utter disregard of the fifteenth amendment they have persistently denied the great mass of negro citizens their lawful right to vote when this denial could not be accomplished by legal subterfuge it has been unhesitatingly lawlessly and unblushingly achieved by threats of force the free use of force in unmerciful beatings and mutilations or even by planned murder for generations southern folklore has taught young caucasians that they were not obliged to respect the legal rights of negroes equally with those of whites and any time a white mans prestige or power came into conflict with a negroes rights those rights were tacitly ignored or for emphasis more often arrogantly flouted depriving the negro of his citizenship rights is an old southern custom in fact the negro people in the south have had to live without the protection of the law to a degree unparalleled in the life of any people of any other great modern country negro digest december unless you call apartheid south africa a great country not only has the law failed to protect the negro it has been freely used to keep him in his placein bondage and for many decades public lynching was a distinctive folkway of the south it has now been practically replaced by clandestine murder and murder from ambush unless a prominent negro is thus murdered these methods of killing cause far less publicity than a neighborhood lynching in any case quiet murder leads to less criticism of the southern status quo regardless of the method employed murdering negroes remains an old southern custom away down south in dixie today lawlessness not only lurks in ambush and slinks through the night with dynamite it also stalks across the land in the guise of law and orderin uniform and police boots with a cattle prod in one hand and a gun in the other in civilized communities the police dog is becoming the segregationists best friend today segregation in the deep south is being maintained by nothing less than a reign of terror this white terror was plainly exposed for all to see by the summer project in mississippi last summer there courageous young democratic americans all dedicated members of the human race tore a shockingly revealing hole in the segregation curtainunmasking more than one old southern custom thus a century and more after the emancipation proclamation the negro is still dominated socially exploited economically and sexually shunted aside politically terrorized and then widely and loudly blamed for causing unlawful disturbances well of course it really is disturbing for the oppressed and dispossessed to protest vigorously enough to be seen and heard round the world both the philosophy and the practice of racial segregation have become so deeply embedded and so intricately entwined in the traditions the folklore and the customs of the deep south that the white man has been caught in his own segregationist trap he is now sweating and floundering between its jaws of fear and hatred and through practicing segregation against his colored neighbors he has become so stupefied socially so insensible to human values that he cant conceive of negroes as individuals with varying personalities as ordinary human beings with ordinary human attributes as persons fully entitled to all the rights and privileges of citizenship instead in his social stupefaction he sees them only as indistinguishable units of a mass of beings known collectively as niggers somehow not quite fully human and therefore incapable and unworthy of full citizenship only a half century ago the question does a negro have a soul was still current in the late confederacy around the turn of the century the rising segregationists driving hard to consolidate and consummate the undisputed rule of jim crow had arrogantly challenged the negros humanity in order to make his new bondage appear justified for instance a book by charles carroll in bore the title the negro a beast or in the image of god this campaign of vilification met with enough success that its psychological mark is still evident though the deepest infection and the most virulent manifestations of this social malady of racial segregation are in the south it affects the entire country in some degree and it impinges upon our foreign relations with an endlessly recurring discord getting rid of it is a task that confronts and concerns the whole nation now and no matter which way we turn it will still confront us releasing ourselves from the entangling and constricting grasp of segregation and its numerous attendant social evils is a tremendous job that calls for a strong and continuous effort to awaken the nation to the shameful and frightening realities of our social predicament it calls for a sustained effort in mass social and political education and reeducation it calls for a concerted and determined effort to apply impartially all of the protective and equalitarian provisions of our federal constitution to all citizens and to enforce our national laws in all of the states alike today in the heartland of jim crowwith its segregationist sheriffs its battalions of riottrained police and its thompson tank law and order has become synonymous with segregation the stranglehold which these fierce bayou segregationists have upon the negro people can be effectively broken only by a federal government determined to enthrone the majesty of the law throughout the defiant south and thereby actively insure the full rights of citizenship to every citizen by now this should be plain enough to everyone when you consider all the people of the south racial segregation is not simply an old southern custom venerable and harmlessthat has become a cherished way of life it has always been a rapacious practice for the negro people it has always been and still is a way of degradation humiliation suffering and death devoid of both compassion and justice segregation is a continuing monstrous social evil it is an affront to human dignity it is an assault upon the human soul a rape of the human personality how much longer will the american conscience and american justice permit the negro people to be shamelessly sacrificed upon the altar of the immoral and illegal old southern custom of racial segregationwhich is not so very old after all morality law and common human decency all demand that this soulless custom regardless of age be stopped now is there really a negro revolution persistence of nem gro oppression in one form or another stems fr m the way ne r es u as weu as whjtes have conceptualized or misconceptualized the entire problem of race relations in america this is especially true when it comes to the socalled negro revolution that is going on now why after all of these years is the negro not free why has not the negros struggle taken a more effective a more final mode it is because i submit the negro has accepted the white mans definition of how to achieve his freedom by this i do not mean that any single white man or group of white men are directing the negros struggle i mean negroes themselves have accepted in theory and practice forms of struggling or protesting that are defined by the modus operandi the way we do things over here of the american establishment in a word the freedom movement has become institutionalized itthe movementis governed and handicapped by the very mode of politics economics and everything else that governs and handicaps this nation the white establishment is not going to approve of let alone allow a mode of struggle that will lead to the effective and speedy overthrow of the white mans dominant position in society anyway the sheer machinery of the establishment the law politics economics etc sloppy though it may beoperates in such a way as to impede if not outright prevent any major and speedy success in the negros struggle to become free you see how long it took to get the civil_rights bill into law it will be years or more before the provisions in it can be universally enforced the institutionalization of the negro struggle is achieved in the following ways the negro struggle is made into a formal movement every effort exerted by negroes must be approved of one way or another by the legitimate establishment this negro digest december puts the negro in a position where he must reveal what he plans to do before he does it there are set channels and procedures in and through which the negro must go whenever and wherever he decides to do something about his oppression a tendency for the struggle to become ritualized ensues no matter what the situation is tha negro becomes accustomed to struggling against it in a fashion that is repetitive and most of all one that is easily predictable by whites this makes the struggle orderly which is a prescription set down by whites in the end a great deal of the effort exerted by negroes amounts to no more than empty ceremony a solemn parade or a turbulent demonstration where negroes suffer brutality from white mobs water hoses and hound dogs classic examples are the march on washington in the first instance and the birmingham demonstrations in the second instance the negro always has to sit down and talk this leads to compromise on whatever he is talking about which means the negro struggle is being arrested the common form in which this process occurs is the committee the committee is appointed by someone from the white establishment who is revered for his nonpartisanship the committee is composed of people of goodwill and high standing in the society or better yet from the community in question of late the usual thing is to set up a biracial committee during the negotiation it is the whites who givein less than the negroes then too the whites have a way of not keeping their promises meager as they might be when infrequently promises are kept it takes so ong to institute them another fact about negotiation is that a few of the blacks are usually encouraged to do something that smells like selling out this is a clear indication that the negro struggle is governed by the traditional mode of american politics currently quite a few negro leaders have assumed the role of race diplomats too many negroes in positions of leadership play the traditional role of uncle tom only now they are educated uncle toms and are not so easily detected they deal with the white and black communities in such a way as to protect their own self interest a doctor a preacher a president of a negro college especially in the south it is not unusual to find negroes in high places who softpeddle demands for freedom and equality in order to make their own positions secure in most instances nobody knows it but the diplomat and the few whites in question traditionally when white people of goodwill in the south wanted to stop negroes from doing something or to start something the pattern has been to call in the local doctor preacher or college president and negotiate all of this is done behind the scenes except in rare cases where the situation becomes public knowledge blows wide open the masses do not know what is going on until the negro returns and tells them that suchandsuch a line of action usually inaction or ineffective action is the best thing for them and is what they are going to do the nature of diplomacyfrom its historical beginnings to the presentproves one thing it is rare that a diplomat actually represents the entirety of his constituency the best he usually does is to represent himself along with his immediate coterie or peersthe class interest this allows for an explanation as to why after the suffering and struggling on the part of all negroes only a few usually middleclass really benefits every time the negro does something to achieve his freedom the response is lets study the situation this means all activity by negroes must cease while the study is in process nine times out of ten white people do the study or administer it which is the same thing it takes a great deal of money which of course must come from the white establishment what the study boils down to is this whites are going to tell about how whatever the negroes want will create more problems than it will solve and above all about how whites and negroes simply cannot get along together some white sociologists or authorities on race and their staffs earn a great deal of money the authority gets his findings published in one of the journals or better still in newsweekall about what whites think about negroes never the other way around then he publishes his study in book form receiving high acclaim and ultimately as a consequence of his monumental work he assumes the chair in social sciences at one of the larger universities this also applies to the few negroes who from time to time get the chance to head up a study meanwhile years have passed the stockpile of our knowledge on race relations accumulates like debris in the archives of the dead bring the struggle out of the streets and put it in the courts first one must sit and be intimidated by the bigotry of southern courts local judges and other officials then if one is lucky one comes up through the state courts and finally to the supreme court this takes years and more money than any single negro or local group of negroes can ordinarily afford an avalanche of litigation red tape is unavoidable and still even if the supreme court decides in your favor there is no certainty on the local level that you are actually going to get what is now legally yours the adjudication of the negros rights works in such a way as to prolong the granting of those rights the negros struggle to achieve his freedom tends to be conceptualized in mythological terms negroes do this as well as negro digest december whites the struggle is defined in terms of mystical measures such as love those who hate you the need for understanding suffering forgivingness we are told that the problem is in the hearts of americans those who make speeches employ such phrases as go down moses go tell it on some kind of mountain i have a dream etc etc negroes are told that prayer is a powerful weapon against oppression and that god is on their side all of this makes for some fine oratory and more times than not sloppy poetry what it means in too many instances is that the negro has adopted a view towards alleviating his oppression that tends to prolong that oppression a christian approach towards solving the race problem can do just so much nonviolent methods of struggling can do just so much then the law of diminishing returns sets in anyway negroes are not living in a land of ancient kings singing about go down moses and if i had a hammer might call up in the negro a powerful sense of his suffering but it also tends to transport the negros concentration away from this world and this time a world and a time that if he is to become free he must deal with in an objective secular fashion this equally applies to black nationalism backtoafricanism and black muslimism any solution to negro oppression that does not provide realistic means towards that solution is a mythsolution the poetic and symbolic rhetoric of the freedom movement often indicates its nonmilitancy therefore the threat of violence in coercing compliance with negro demands is not being utilized this is what happened when because of the very secular language in which john lewis chose to state negro demands his speech was heavily censored at the march on washington in addition to this the progress that negroes make tends to be generalized in such a way that when one negro achieves something it is played up as if all negroes have achieved it sidney poitier has definitely achieved but the rank and file of negroes has not achieved anything the same goes in the case of jackie robinson ralph bunche and so on this type of thinking represents tokenism in negro progress it is a form of vicarious progress and not real progress no matter what the negro says he wantscivil_rights fair employment better education human rights and so onthe white man especially the southerner never fails to bring up the question would you want your daughter or your sister to marry one this question seems to sufficiently caution if not inflame all whites against integrating negroes into the mainstreams of american democracy it seems to me there is a trend on the part of some civil_rights groups to place an undue amount of emphasis on policy more and more the freedom movement is becoming involved with bureaucracy bureaucracy often confuses communication and impedes progress the leaders and other personnel of the movement are beginning to look and act like organization men what organizationism does is to coerce every small or local group to conform to policy this prevents or limits spontaneous action and independent thinking the negro freedom movement tends not to tolerate protest action or demonstrations that veer from its current policy of nonviolence and of not offending or embarrassing white friends of the movement this is known as negro liberalism of course the policy of nonviolence and negro liberalism is a direct reflection of the influence that the white establishment has upon the negro struggle negroes go along with this policy because i am afraid it is the only one that liberal whites approve of and mainly because negroes have the same values as the white establishment i have already mentioned how john lewiss march on washington speech was censored and disapproved of because the speech made a radical departure from the agreedupon policy agreed upon by whom by whatby white liberals and negro liberals who did not want to say or do anything that would offend the white establishment and most of all john f kennedy and company another example occurred when one branch of new york core decided to stage a massive automobile stallin on major transportation arteries on the opening day of the worlds fair there was much debate amongas well as betweenthe major civil_rights groups the local chapter of core made an effort to go ahead but the stallin as such was a telling failure i do not know if any heads rolled i do know that the local chapter was expelled or suspended from the larger body instead of intensifying the aggression against the wider society many negroes feel that they must get themselves ready must prepare for integration and equality they must acquire good manners and in general they must learn how to act before they can expect whites to treat them as human beings what this means is that too often negroes assume toward themselves the same attitudes that whites have frequently the psychology of the negro is that of a freak striving to achieve equality with normal people the normal people whites define the terms of the freaks equality the negro accepts these terms he abandons his own qualities his manners and habits and strives to imitate the values habits and behavior patterns of white folks it is this viewpoint that tends to color or usurp every phase of the negros struggle for human recognition in america considering everything i have asserted so far how may one evaluate the current wave of negro protest as a revolutionary movement the answer is inescapable there is no black revolution a revolutionany revolution is a ruthless program of aggression on the part of the oppressed masses against the very foundation of the powers that oppress a movement with revolutionary intent seeks not to reform certain limited aspects within a society but to destroy or overturn the entire organizational structure it leaves in its wake the ruins of not merely the one institution that is directly identified with oppression it makes havoc with the entire socioeconomicpolitical complex because revolutionaries know that it is the complex which is ultimately responsible for oppression or freedom you cannot escape hatred and oppression in a world of hatred and oppression that world has to be destroyed that world has to be reorganized from top to bottom both materially and psychologically there is no revolutionary mentality in america americawhite and blacklacks the kind of imagination that creates revolution the leaders the organizations and groups that are in the forefront of the negro struggle and which are accepted as legitimate by the white establishment are not clamoring so much for individual liberty freedom as they are for uniformity in social status and public treatment equality these kind of negroes want to be accepted in and by white society not as individual personalities but as if they were white themselves they have the same values that whites do this attitude necessarily puts a straitjacket on how far the negro will go out on the limb in throwing off his oppression freedom for most americanswhite and negroespecially middle class negroes has a madison avenue meaning it means material comfort and while the majority of negroes are not actually middle class they are definitely middle class oriented james meredith for instance has repeatedly stated that the main motivation behind his endurance at the university of mississippi was the very american desire to get ahead to be able to function as a lawyer in his mississippi hometown and to acquire the material comforts propagandized as common to our american way of life just as any white man would do this is the crucial point most negroes want to throwoff oppression within the context of the american establishment the negrow is not yet willing to run the risk of a total assault on the culture to find that many of the things for which he has fought and is fighting will no longer be available that is within the socioeconomic and political framework that now characterizes this nation it is a question of values whether it is best to completely do away with oppression as undesirable and find that other desirable values are also done away withor to deliberately or unwit tingly protest in such ways as to prolong in some form or another the existence of the race problem and thereby retain many of the more desirable features of the american system this is the real american dilemma at this moment in our history it pertains almost exclusively to the negro for contrary to what myrdal asserted in his book an american dilemma the vast majority of whites in the united states have never had any bones about the discrepancy between the american creed and what they actually did in real life it was only when someone tried to significantly change the status quo that whites became alarmed it is largely the same today there is on the other hand a revolutionary force in america but it is a force locked within itself because it has been and is alienated from its own powersthe powers of violence i am referring to the black massesthe ignorant impoverished unrefined bottomrun negroes in the south and in the black ghettos of the north these are the final people historically anywhere in the world the only power the masses possess is the power of violence or the power which is the threat of violence the black masses constitute per cent of the negroes in america these are the people america will ultimately have to deal with these are the people that negroes the liberals and middle class orients will have to deal with these are the extential negroes beause the negros struggle tenus to be institutionalized on every level and in all respects the masses of colored people are largely excluded from receiving any of the gains that middle classoriented negroes are now making this is true in all but a few isolated instances one notable exception was the montgomery bus protest movement when the deal went down allnot one or two or a fewall negroes rode the bus in montgomery they still do on the other hand take birmingham the masses of negroes endured the water the dogs the brutality of the mobs when the deal went down they had nothing concrete to show for it but their scars i believe two negroes got jobs and one lunch counter was desegregated the birmingham situation is not the exception but the rule until the violence of the masses of negroes or their potential for violence is felt throughout the nation there will be no negro revolution we will be experiencing a revolution when civil economic and human oppression in a very concrete way is lifted from the lives of the black masses but this will involve much more than just a black revolution it will be an american revolution whether one describes the current activities of negroes as the negro digest december civil_rights movement the freedom movement the negro upheaval or by any other phrase is not purely a question of semantics there is something going on there is a great deal of activity a tremendous amount of noise since there are peopleblack and white who refer to all of this as the negro or black revolution it is not enough to show that they are in error one has the responsibility of trying to understand what the term means to the people who employ it in relationship to what is actually happening and most of all one must unearth why people are using this term when its real meaning does not apply to the situation it was around that louis e lomax negro reporter and author published an article called the negro revolt in one of the better slick magazines the article was then made into a book published under the same title largely the revolt that mr lomax was talking about had to do with the younger generation of negroes revolting against the older type negro leadership the young predominantly college enrolled negroes sitinners were thumbing down on the orthodox leaders as being too slow and conservative and they were beginning to take things into their own hands a new militancy developed the term negro revolution seemed to have come into prominence subsequent to lomaxs book revolt revolution as time passed and more and more negroes took to the streets the term began to appear in the white press with mounting frequency i believe also that the cuban revolution had a suggestive impact upon all americans especially white americans so that the term slipped into the press to describe what negroes were doingalthough quite unaware of the psychology involved and to be sure although there was a world of difference between what castro did and what negroes were undertaking to realize this is to see clearly what the white press either consciously or unconsciously was and is doing in labelling the activities of contemporary negroes as the negro revolution the whole thing begins to make sense a pattern begins to emerge american white people tend to view anything the negro does to achieve his freedom as being revolutionary it is at once a fear reaction a sort of racial reflex response in lieu of protecting their dominant position and a conscious or unconscious attempt to illusion the negro so that he will not really become revolutionary if negroes can be made to think they are being revolutionary they will become satisfied with what they are getting or will become illusioned as to the exact nature of what it takes to really make them free and what it is really like to be free when one or two negroes as a consequence of mass demonstrations sitins liedownins and so on receive employment as construction workers in a very real sense for whites this is an ex ample of the negro reflation negroes rhapsodized by masr media and perhaps by the intoxicating effect of assuming a collective consciousness are lulled or excited into viewing their behavior also as the black revolution another factor which lies behind the rhetoric of the negro revolution is sensationalism five years ago judging from the mass media one would have had difficulty saying for certain that negroes lived in america except for rapists murderers thieves and other criminals today the news about negroes dominates the media radio television newspapers magazines everything at last the negro is commercial the black gold rush is on so much is being published about the negro that one simply cannot keep up with it all life time newsweek look saturday review harpers saturday evening post and on down the line the publishing houses are rolling the stuff out i will hazard that during the last five years more negro material has been published by the american press than in any other twenty years taken altogether most of it is little more than garbage but who cares it sells noticeably the new york times began to carry much more news about negroes shortly after its west coast edition flopped there has been no other time in the history of publishing not even during the leftwing s that so many negroes have gotten into public print as during the past five years many of these negro authors do not even profess to be writers whites also are exploiting the unprecedented commercialism of negro subject matter in fact there is an underground animosity developing between negro and white writers despite the negros superior knowledge of the subject whites seem to be cashing in on negro material with much less difficulty from publishers reviewers and the public than most negroes hollywood has made black like me written by a white man into a movie nobody to my knowledge has dared to film ralph ellisons invisible man with reference to the socalled black revolution itself whites are infiltrating the movement wherever there is a negro sitin wadein prayin or any sort of protest or demonstration whites are to be found among the ranks at least onethird of the marchers on washington were whites even the black muslims whose attitude towards whites is unmistakable are plagued by caucasians clamouring to join them i know there are some white people who are genuinely dedicated to the cause of freedom i also know there are too many whites who are aligning themselves with negroes simply because they have a pathological craving for attention and publicity many whites are downright jealous of the attention negroes are currently receiving via the mass media they join the movement because i am afraid they negro digest december have no other means of acquiring recognition i am reminded of a young white man who is or was an official of a brooklyn chapter of core the young man was brought into court tried and given a short sentence for civil disobedience he sat down on the floor of the court room and refused to be moved the judge advised him to leave or be charged with contempt the white zealot refused to budge and called the entire court including the judge members of the ku klux klan growing impatient and peeved the judge added ninety more days to the sentence whereupon the zealot went into a tantrum and had to be dragged from the floor of the court he received plenty of attention the next day his name appeared in the new york papers and his face over the television networks since it is now receiving more publicity than at any other time in history the negro movement in two many instances becomes a bandwagon for white crackpots and misfits this is equally true of some negroes who incidentally are playing revolution they are jumping on the bandwagon there occurred an incident in harlem where some negroes were picketing a small restaurant owned by a puerto rican working there were one negro dishwasher in the rear and threeskinned puerto ricans up front the negroes were demonstrating to have a darkskinned negro employed up front unknown to the public there was some fuss as to who was the leader of this demonstration there were two preachers contending for leadership they were at each others throats suddenly a policeman informed one of them that he had to move his automobile that was when the newsmen and television cameras converged upon the second leader i watched him on television he knew his picture would be in the papers he knew his statement would appear in the press he was so aware and proud that his face was being televised i made an observation that man should not have been the leader of that demonstration any more than ross barnett should have been the governor of mississippi there is some question in my mind as to whether the demonstration should have been or not yet i wonder in as much as barnett was the governor of mississippi then that porkchop preacher should have been the leader of that demonstration dead water an dead sand contending for the upper hand as long as the dispossessed masses of black people remain dispossessed as long as the american establishment does not provide an avenue through which the ignorant utterly depraved portion of the negro and white community can realize a sense of personal dignity and social worth in terms of the humanity of man it will go on it may never end at the present rate before it gets better it will get worse the sensationalism and commercialism of the freedom movement serves to obscure what is really happening there is some progress being made how much and where it is all leading is difficult to say also no one knows or has tried to discern what all of this is doing to and unleashing in the emotional chambers of white southerners mississippi for instance is now a virtual nazi state awaiting the final solution no one as far as i know is preparing for the worst between blacks and whites in the south and north except the cops and the racists we are too busy being sensational and making money why it remains to be answered at this particular time in our history is the negro so commercial in the media why does the black revolution seem to be the most saleable thing that is happening in this country without bringing in the international situation which limits whatever analysis one might make there seems to be a news deprivation an excitement vacuum in america which the current negro upheaval is filling secretly we are on pins and needles waiting for the next headline the next radio announcement the next bloody photograph in the tabloids waiting for the televised barbarity between blacks and whites to boom into the boredom of our living rooms obscenity this is what we are reduced to i suggest that it is not horror that we feel when we see in the media black men and women being maimed in the streetsit is prurience the pornography of black and white bodies clashing together to wit most americans especially whites perceive the intermingling of negroes and caucasians as something extremely lewd to witness it acted out via the mass media not in love but in hate and violence constitutes a vicarious ecstasy of the most depraved nature before me i have the new york times on the front page is a photograph of white men in st augustine florida beating a group of negroes with bottles and sticks what has come over us i am a negro and i will not submit m body to that kind of twisted pain if i were white i could not participate in that form of orgy let me make one more observation about the black masses as they relate to the socalled negro revolution at a new york rally shortly after a white minister was accidentally killed by throwing himself down in front of a bulldozer during a negro demonstration in cleveland ohio malcolm_x refused to declare a period of silent prayer in reverence of the ministers death a white man from the audience had suggested the period of silence malcolm_x refused to honor the negro digest december request he stated that unnumbered negroes have been and are being murdered and nobody has offered up a prayer for them while this is not altogether true malcolms attitude had a tremendous effect upon the audience most of which were bottomrun lowerclass negroes they leaped to their feet and cheered i discovered something during that rally malcolm is apocalyptic his words are brute concrete secular and he communicates with the masses whether you or i like it or not he can become the most followed negro of our times he has an anticharisma that recriminates radical whites and middle class negroes and he electrifies the common masses here are his words in a merica whites go around with the attitude t am white in the sound of their voices in the essence of their beings it is impossible for a white person to believe in capitalism and not believe in racism you cant talk this negro revolution jive to me when youre not ready for it when the deal is down most of you arent malcolm_x is the only negro who talks like whether he is or not a real revolutionary meanwhile drew pearson is calling dick gregory and adam c powell too radical he says that whites are forming a solid block against negroes and that negroes are losing understanding and sympathy from whites in the north as well as in the south the white backlash precisely it can be this kind of attitude among other things that might bring an abortive end to the current stage in the freedom movement unless one is insane he hopes it does not come to that nevertheless it seems as if drew pearsons attitude or was it an observation is the growing tendency among more and more whites and i fear we will not become sufficiently aware of the meaning of what is happening inand tous until it is too late the current struggle constitutes the precipitating stage unless we do something now one way or another to free those millions of blacks whom i have spoke of as existential negroes there may not be a revolution but there will definitely be armageddon psychoanalysis revisited the thunder of the helit g copter landing on the r rooftop of my office buildin sent me div ing headfirst under my desk as papers scattered in all directions a lot of people think that those of us in the psychiatric profession dont have our own little fears too but im here to tell you that we do and the thought of having an airplane land square on the top of my skull is mine ill bet it gets a rise out of you too anyway i didnt even peek out from under that desk until i heard the sound of the skylight opening and saw this guy making his way down this ropelike ladder thats aheh hehpretty dramatic way to make an entrance i said sheepishly crawling out from under the desk get right to the heart of the thing i always say the stranger answered no need pussyfooting around hung up in all that automobile traffic so i fly my own plane did it in world war ii still an air corps reserve man i see i said and began picking up my papers and shuffling through them i trust you have an appointment i cant seem to find your name here do i have an appointment hah ive had an appointment for two weeks thats impossible i said ive been booked up for a month we psychoanalysts are busy people nobody could have made an appointment with me in the last two weeks you think not he snapped you hired a new receptionist two weeks ago didnt you well who do you think slipped her in here she worked in an appointment for me first thing thats the way i operate get your own people in first and thenwham as he spoke his arm came swooping down upon the desk with a bang so loud i dropped my papers again i paused for a long moment to study my visitor he was tall and squareshouldered with an indian arrowheadnose set in a tanned face topped with silver hair his voice was tight with a western flavor and he had the cool clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth i waved him to the couch and switched off the overhead fluores cents then i switched on a small lamp near us conserve a little electricity i remarked ah a conservative eh i like that he replied well now i said when we were both settled whats your problem the world is my problem he snapped russia red china vietnam social security medicare civil_rights the cold war the hot war yes yes i interrupted in a patient tone these are trying times in which we live and i can understand your concern but in the hour or so we have together today let us just discuss your major maladjustment or in the argot of the layman whats bugging you oh he said and i could see his manner slowly beginning to change as if he werent so sure of himself ohwell you see i have a feeling that a lot of people dont like me well i said slowly persecution complex huh i know how it is seems like some days everybody is against you its nothing to worry about we all go through that now and then and its just no no you simpleton he shouted i dont mean in just an ordinary sense i mean literally thousands and thousands of people dont like me many of them even seem to be afraid of me and its important that people like me millions of them have to like me as he talked i thought i saw a tear form in the corner of one eye well now thats a little ambitious isnt it i said to ask that millions of people like you i mean nobody has millions of friends look you jackass he snarled i didnt come in here to listen to a bunch of liberal platitudes i want some hard answers and i want em quick what are you headshrinkers anyway a bunch of pinkos or are you just too lazy to go out and earn an honest living ill bet if we defoliate these downtown office buildings wed turn up a bunch of you guys i could see he was getting pretty excited and talking a little irrationally so i tried to calm him down a bit psychoanalysis is dangerous work you know i mean if a guy goes off his nut right there on your couch and starts swinging you can get clobbered let me get you a drink of water i said after i managed to calm him a little i walked to a water cooler at the corner of my office took a paper cup and pushed the button nothing happened hah hah i laughed weakly with embarrassment ill bet i forgot to pay the water bill again and theyve cut it off im kind of forgetful about that theyve cut off your water he asked incredulously getting his hackles up again why id never stand for a thing like that if i were you id get a couple of marine buddies and march right down there and turn that water back on i dont think that will be necessary i said ill just put a check in the mail to them tonight all right coward he said lets get back to your problem i suggested why do you think millions of people should like you because i know whats good for this country he declared besides im a straightshooter and im for home mother flag and the buffalo nickel they dont make buffalo nickels anymore i said you see he shouted thats whats wrong with this country nothing is the way it used to be weve got to get back to basics but times change i argued nothing stands still like the commercial says progress is our most important product or in the words of president johnson shut your mouth he screamed and for a moment i thought he was having a stroke look i said who sent you to me anyway or did you just pick my unlucky name out of a phone book a friend of mine recommended you he said quieting down some short darkhaired little fellow was in to see you about a month ago he was having these hallucinations sometimes he would get to thinking he wasif you will pardon the expressioncolored oh that one i replied i remember him well but dont tell me you are getting that kind of complex too no you silly bastard he shouted i told you what my problem is for some stupid reason people dont like me sir i said adopting a very formal air i can understand your concern and i realize that you are a paying customer while i am only a poor servant of the people nevertheless i do not feel that you need to conduct yourself in this hostile manner i find your attitude belligerent and your language reprehensible he gave me a cold stare namecalling in the pursuit of a competent analysis is no vice he declared and scampered back up his ladder tribute to a freedom fighter thr ee courageous young men were viciously murdered this summer while fighting for freedom a nation grieved their fate and so did i on sunday august i attended funeral for a young man named wayne yancey who also died while fighting for freedom but a nation did not grieve there were however those of us who did he didnt die from a bullet and his death didnt bring any headlines but there was something as dastardly in his death as in the deaths of the other three wayne yancey was a yearold negro volunteer in the mississippi summer project he was killed in a headon automobile collision august in red bank mississippi while carrying out a project assignment i find the details of his death rather insignificant and i suggest that a speeding automobile was only a symbol of what really killed him he quite like the other three fell victim to a very sick society a society which preaches brotherhood and principle while practicing bigotry and intolerance might very well be symbolized by a speeding automobile both are extremely destructive i met wayne several months ago while working on civil_rights projects in chicago we never became close personal friends but we worked in the movement together and we conversed from time to time in march we were among a group of chicagoans who attended the sncc conference in atlanta and together we talked about the forthcoming summer we intended to spend in mississippi now so suddenly it seems wayne has passed on from this challenge i known as life to that unknown that awaits each of us now i am left with impressions of the young man and in his death i have discovered that i knew him much better than i realized during his life this to me says something of life and lifes final act death and my impressions of wayne seem to reveal something about my people about my country and about this humanity to which we are indebted by the very nature of our breathing wayne yancey exemplified the victimization of my people by this society which has so long tolerated racism he often talked about his past and the things he hoped to do in his future one of the most poignant memories im left with is his having said to me in atlanta in march again back in chicago and once again on the night before we left oxford ohio for mississippi that after the summer in mississippi he wanted me to join him and a few other fellows in a civil_rights project in a town called paris tennessee he used to say its a small town and in a few weeks we can really shake it up i knew wayne traveled a lot engaging in rights activity and consequently i made no special connection between him and the small town in tennessee and so on sunday august i went to paris tennessee and there learned for the first time that wayne was born and raised in the little town he wanted me to help him shake up this young man who had actively participated in the struggle in chicago new york atlanta and mississippi hadnt forgotten the place where he first learned the bitter lessons of being black in this country he hadnt forgotten the little town where he was introduced to the mental lynchings we have all endured during our struggle against oppression although the little town was no longer his physical hell it somehow stood between him and freedom and such seems to represent the very cruel psychology this nation has forced upon black men and so i went to paris as wayne had asked but my journey was premature and my mission was not the desired one we went to paris tennessee to bury a young man whose existence in this world was far more honest than his surroundingsa young man whose words to me so vividly portrayed the alienation that once engulfed him wayne left paris tennessee a few years ago finished high school in chicago tnd struck out against a society which had deprived him the same society that killed him in the only way he knew he joined a gang in chicago and allowed his anger his hate and his frustration to flow but he never stopped searching and he found something he could truly identify with something that would give his life a meaning society had prevented it from attaining he found his road to the manhood society systematically denied him and seemingly intended for paranoiac reasons that he should never have yes he found the freedom movement and there is no doubt in my mind that the movement did indeed become his life he chose a gallant way of living with his anger his hate and his frustrations and he enabled himself to control his feelings while finding the courage to go about making a better life for himself and others this was his alternative to destroying himself yes he rose above many adverse situations he became a man by the very fact that in his short years he discovered a way to contribute to a society which had disparaged ostracized and punished him from his very beginning siipply because he was born black yes black men must pay special dues to this society and wayne paid more than his share he was aware of and concerned about the evils in this society and although he died trying to help it i must ask was society aware of or concerned about him i am somehow afraid that to society he died a stranger i find great significance in the circumstances which brought wayne to that fatal moment and i assert that his presence at that scene represented his struggle for not his freedom alone but for yours mine and all mankind i insist that he died for that which killed him and consequently we stand indicted i am assured that we are indeed a sick society shall be sick until we look at rrfen like wayne yancey and begin to face the reality that each of us every human being on this earth is equally importantand just as equally unimportant when we are delivered from this sickness we will then be indebted to men like wayne yancey iy the end it is only we who can insure that he did not die in vain my last thoughts of wayne are what i believe in my mind and what i feel in my heart i believe he was a black man who only a few years ago felt there was no hope for him and his people in this country i can only hope that he died believing that there is hope just as i believe there is at last no in his death there were no headlines no fanfare and very little said or known but in his death in his life there was a certain greatness that we must attempt to understand and learn from im certain that in that great unknown wayne was embraced by andrew goodman james chaney and michael schwerner and somehow i could hear them saying to wayne welcome brother the supre me race race is a haunted word bloating with pride burdened with suffering clouding the reason of commoner and ruler alike it is also a term of biologic science in its latter potency it lends a flavor of objectivity to statements about innate race differences invented for political and economic purposes popular race concepts lag far behind current progress in the fields of population genetics and physical anthropology now human groups can be evaluated in terms of qualities with clearcut inheritance these new and forthcoming facts cannot be dismissed as troublesome they may not fit into our view of equity but they remain unyielding facts of nature and we had better try to understand them ageold race concepts founded on skin color stature facial traits and hair characteristics seem to fulfill some primary requirement of classification a central african pygmy would soon be recognized as a stranger among eskimos of alaska the differences are real and easily recognized turning to details we find an enormous variation within geographically defined populations some europeans rise above the stately nuers of eastern africa others are short or actually dwarfed often enough short parents have short children all of us can easily remember the stubby parents of some rangy friends though stature has some heritable basis we must turn to the extremes to discern simple modes of inheritance thus chondrodystrophic dwarfs in marriages with persons of normal stature have normal and dwarfed sons and daughters in equal proportions nobody would come upon the idea of referring these dwarfs to a pygmy race some thirty per cent of all europeans cannot taste dilute solutions of phenylthiourea at least one fourth of the brothers and sisters of a tasteblind person reveal the same deficiency we would not classify them as belonging to a tasteblind race why not are we reluctant to refer a fixed proportion of a persons brothers and sisters to a different race we need a definition now turning to webster we find race defined as a division of mankind possessing traits that are transmissible by descent and sufficient to characterize it as a distinct human type let us admit that defective bone formation with resultant dwarfness is insufficient to characterize a race negro digest december we can dismiss the tasteblind race on the same ground but questions of this type whether classification grounds are sufficient or not meet the scientist today in his study of physical anthropology two hundred years ago men were conveniently black brown red white and yellow but hindus and north europeans with their different hues shared the classification as whites or caucasians a subdivision seemed reasonable but it had to stop somewhere if every shade of pigmentation served to separate a specific race we would meet such absurdities as several races within the same family of palefaced tawny and dusky europeans the number of races would soar rejecting color as the sole racial division line physical anthropologists turned to such traits as hair texture proportions of head and face form of eyelids and shape of nose long skulls came together on the museum shelves with separate sections for round and intermediate skulls such criteria cut across the ancient race line then the anthropologic classification resorted to clusters of traits among europeans tallness goes with a blond complexion and a long head a nordic race with these characteristics may have existed but never in pure form when people from northern and western europe are compared with inhabitants of the central parts of the continents differences are observed in stature body proportions and head form a rough distinction between northwest europeans and an alpine type may be accepted on such grounds similarly an east african population can be set off from the majority of the sudanese people using pigmentation hair form and series of measurements physical anthropologists have defined some thirty different races no observer of human diversity can easily free himself from the question why stop with races we could add some geographically welldefined groups and get a round number of perhaps racial groups could be named or let us return to these questions a little later armed with new facts now we accept the anthropometric division of mankind as convenient if somewhat arbitrary it is founded on sets of traits generally of a graded character sufficient to characterize fairly distinct human types in addition these traits are transmissible by descent but how what is inherited we do not inherit long legs what we receive from our parents are series of genes that control growth one set of genes interact to form a long and slender build other genes combine to check growth and produce a stocky figure genes are chemically active sites in molecules of known composition they form us during early fetal life they pilot our vital pur poses they fix our natural life span accidents called mutations change single genes to dodgers such as the mutant gene responsible for chondrodystrophic dwarfism in this case a single gene profoundly affects growth an exceptional situation what has been said about growth and stature holds in the case of skin color series of genes are at work producing varying amounts of pigment in skin hair and eyes exceptionally one distinct gene mutates and produces when it goes with a similarly changed partner gene the general lack of pigment called albinism both these abnormalities dwarfism and albinism are easily analyzed growth is stunted by one mutant gene inherited from one of the parents the coloring matter of skin hair and eye falls short when another mutant gene is inherited from both parents otherwise the graded characters studied in classical anthropology are determined by syndicates of genes of unknown number sure enough such inheritance is accessible to its special kind of analysis in view of the general and fervent interest in skin color it seems rather remarkable that pieces of main importance are indeed lacking in our knowledge of pigment genes it is certain that we can measure and classify people without resort to distinct gene differences if we limit our analysis to graded characters we discard however our most powerful tool for weighing the gene content of human populations we carry a maximum of two counteralbino genes in each ordinary cell some people have one plus the albino gene the rare albinos carry two albino genes only thus close to per cent of all sites for this gene in north americans is occupied by the normal counteralbino gene and the rest sevenperthousand is the frequency of the albino gene such statements would be void of meaning but for our potent tool the stability rule under random mating if marriages are contracted without regard to the presence or absence of a certain gene its frequency remains constant from generation to generation we cannot apply this rule to shades of skin color but it tells us something about the chances of marrying a carrier of a single gene for albinism they amount to the double product of the two gene frequencies we have to count with normal and albino thus unobserved carriers of the albino gene come to a thousand or almost one and a half per cent how can we use such knowledge a parent of an albino intends to marry a second time with the risk of onein to wed another carrier of the albino gene this is true if he does not marry a relative if he marries his first cousin the risk that she is also a carrier amounts to one in eight he should know that in this case he runs close negro digest december to nine times the normal risk such calculations have been applied to many diseases caused by mutant genes when the inheritance is recessive as in the case of albinism the risk that the first cousin of a known carrier is also a carrier never drops below one eighth or per cent the frequency of unknown gene carriers can on the contrary vary considerably in the general population when different abnormalities are compared in the case of albinism it is of some consequence that marriages are not contracted entirely at random in the meaning that anybody can wed any person of the opposite sex some observations point to a higher frequency for the albino gene in some intermarrying groups than in the general population of the u s now we are back to our first problem that of characterizing human groups obviously gene frequencies lend a specific meaning to such classification when they account for differences in disease predisposition to characterize populations we need common genes such as those responsible for the blood groups here we can calculate gene frequencies the genes a b and o alternate on a specific chromosomal site and all of us belong to one of the four blood groups a b ab or o today all major populations have been examined with respect to blood groups striking differences occur thus american indians largely lack this gene in eskimos its frequency comes not much above one per cent in china and india on the other hand the frequency of the b gene amounts to twenty per cent while such differences may have as we shall see a profound biologic meaning two points must be stressed first the same genes occur in all populations though their frequencies vary in small groups like pure chippewa indians the b gene frequency actually sinks to zero secondly a person cannot be referred to any race on the ground that he belongs to a certain blood group we note such differences without neglecting the agreements eskimos and egyptians have about the same frequency of the a gene with the study of gene frequen cies physical anthropology won a deepening insight into the composition of human populations the rh blood group system with a chromosomal site different from that of the abo system soon proved useful in anthropologic work and now a dozen systems have been used in the course of this genemapping of the continents five major races were distinguished they fitted roughly the old concepts of american indians australoids caucasoids mongoloids and negroids this way of characterizing races has flaws it fits some major geographic regions but only roughly so the basques in northern spain and southern france are caucasoids but endowed with extremely low b and high rh negative gene frequencies they seem to be the remnants of an early european population gene frequencies reflect historical and prehistorical events thus the b gene reaches eastern europe with a broad front of high frequencies diminishing through central europe but still distinct from a low frequency in western europe the great invasions the migrations of nations and the social intercourse with neighbors resulted in extensive outbreeding and reshuffling of genes careful evaluation of gene frequencies defined no pure white race the study of blood groups has shown that men are brothers under the skin whether they like to admit it or not recent improvements of chemical analysis have revealed striking differences in the minute composition of blood proteins the latter include the haptoglobins serum proteins capable of combining red blood pigment the first mapping of human populations revealed that one gene in this system hp occurred at a rate of about per cent in europeans increased to per cent in some west african regions from a generally high frequency in africa and was rather low in asia the haptoglobins and several other newly detected serum protein differences fit the concepts established by the blood group techniques thus differences do occur between roughly defined major populations these differences are mainly quantitative populations differing with regard to gene frequencies major races are not pure as long as we have been close enough to exchange blows and wares we have turned over genes this new anthropology armed with improving methods for the study of gene differences tends to disclose an increasing number of inherently distinct groups within nations and geographically defined populations again we meet differences in percentages rather than inequalities between individuals such minorities may establish their divergent gene frequencies by chance fluctuations in very small original groups or by settling as immigrants among foreigners whatever its origin the diversity tends to be maintained as long as marriages as a rule are contracted within the group the lapps in northern scandinavia constitute a minority with distinct gene frequencies here the relative isolation is due to traditions language and nomad life the mabaan people of the upper nile province sudan look and speak like their neighbors the dinkas nuers and shilluks but they differ in blood groups in this case a wide wilderness separates the mabaans from their neighbors negro digest december scores of similar instances are known we may add different jewish groups with their own gene frequencies and religion together with customs and environmental attitudes as the more or less rigid boundary line gene differences between indian castes have to do with agelong social demarcation all these facts add up to an unavoidable arbitrariness when it comes to defining a race anthropometric traits could release a rather unhampered subdivision of populations if they were used for race criteria now we meet much the same situation when we apply gene frequencies let us remember that human nature is too rich and varied to be caught in any meshwork of artificial definitions it is true that neighboring groups differ slightly and distinct groups decidedly many students of human diversity hesitate to designate the small inbreeding groups with distinct gene frequencies with the loaded word races are all differences in gene frequencies due to chance and diversity in origin no anthropologists have long been aware of the possibility that some such differences are adaptive one population meets other conditions of survival than the inhabitants of a climatically different region it was thought that body build and skin color were the end results of the cruel winnowing by hardship in past generations today some wellfounded doubt meets the thought that any gene is without advantage or disadvantage when it can be observed in alternate forms genes which seem good under some conditions may be bad under other circumstances one striking example of the relative value of a mutated or changed gene is presented by the s gene in the hemoglobin series the coloring matter of our red blood cells hemoglobin occurs in various genedetermined forms of which only a is unconditionally normal in adults when both parents carry the hemoglobin s gene in a single dose onefourth of their children develop a severe blood disease sickle cell anemia as these children do not build families the gene would slowly disappear or almost so new mutations tend to keep the frequency of a detrimental gene at a low but constant level in many african populations however the hemoglobin s gene is quite common this is true of peoples in tropical africa where subtertian malaria is or until quite recently was of permanent occurrence millions of children and adults in these regions carry the hemoglobin s gene in a single dose rendering them resistant against the parasite plasmodium falciparum which causes the predominant form of malaria in these regions this was the first wellestablished form of inherited superiority in geographically defined populations in north america the gene for hemoglobin s is decreasing among the descendants of africans of no advantage in regions free from malaria the gene is tapped off through early deaths of doubledose carriers thus the superiority bestowed on africans is sustained under special environmental conditions only recent investigations reveal that the hemoglobin s gene follows the distribution of the falciparum parasite rather than nationality outside its broad belt of high frequency across tropical africa the hemoglobin s gene occurs along the mediterranean shores on the arabian peninsula in southern india and northern thailand the relatively high hemoglobin s gene frequency does not set off an exclusively african malariaresistant race the s gene in one of the two hemoglobinregulating chromosomes produces a moderateand in malaria regions beneficial quantity of the special blood pigment when it occurs in duplicate the hemoglobin s gene kills its bearer thus any people with a high rate of this gene pays for its survival with a high child mortality if the hemoglobin s gene conferred an unconditional advantage it would in a limited number of generations establish itself as the normal gene this is nowhere the case no people in africa or else where can claim a general biologic supremacy still could my people not be endowed with a series of distinct if relative advantages in a biologic sense yes much forthcoming experience points decidedly to this possibility valid for any people let us remember that extreme hardships and an uneven struggle for subsistence fell to the lot of most people a few generations ago existant high level equilibriums between gene frequencies are remnants or symptoms of this struggle for survival as a tribe or a people often at the cost of the individual a possible symptom of presentday adjustment appears in northern ghana with its peak incidence of hemoglobin c this chemically distinct hemoglobin seems to be limited to the peoples of west africa and their descendants on the caribbean shores and in the u s the search for new cases of balanced selective forces was greatly stimulated by the discovery of a connection between malaria and hemoglobin s in mediterranean countries thalassemia an inherited hemoglobin disorder has a remarkable peak distribution in recent malaria regions the same holds good for a certain enzyme deficiency of the red blood cells cradles of the malaria parasite in southeast asia hemoglobin e occurs at a high rate and seems to offer some advantage to the heterozygous gene carriers the wellknown blood groups negro digest december a b ab and o usually occur at such frequencies that even the rarest of them cannot be maintained by new mutations in other words we seem to be forced to conclude that the common blood groups are at the play of beneficial and harmful forces that balance each other the actually observed increased risk for ulcers in the stomach and small intestine of persons with blood group o is only a forerunner of so far very fragmentary information there is no lack of clues however and much more will become known about the influence of blood groups upon health vigor and longevity when it comes to mental traits our measuring devices are at the very best comparable to the yardstick such measurements can be used for genetic analysis but not for the calculation of gene frequencies the essential problem here consists in the sifting of cultural and educational factors from biologic endowment the latter consists for all we can grasp with a thinking tainted by biologic experience of the universal human blend of strengths and weaknesses when analysis arrives at primary mental abilities some of them may spell conditional advantages transformed to handicaps in other surroundings on a cruder level every human group has its bullheads some of whom if winds came colder be loved for their staunchness we all have to make the best with what we have got under present conditions it is illboding for any youth to come out with the idea that his lineage has supplied him with an innate superiority or inferiority whatever his race may call itself it has supplied him with genes tens of thousands of which are common to all men he also has genes perhaps scores of them that are more common in his own people some of them may confer a conditional advantage he may find his way to use it from a biologic viewpoint race grants very little and dooms to nothing in its immense and sightless power nature has culled survivors from groups with varying degrees of genetic diversity some of these survivors have remained in their original surroundings keeping up a precarious balance with beasts and plagues and droughts among them on the outskirts of progress we may find what would correspond most closely to the idea of pure races the unfathomed dynamics of the present population growth and the subtle powers of the everchanging terms of modem life will mark the emerging populations in a way we can hardly predict our hope for a future meeting us with sudden and extreme hardships or alluring ease lies in the great diversity within all major populations of today whatever comes some gene combinations will empower their bearers with endurance and uplift earth will always belong to the supreme race the race of man washingtons african museum it is more than fitting that the first museum the in me united states devoted completely to the art of africa should occupy the premises of the former town house of frederick douglass tions history who established the intellectual bases for the now acceptable linking of americans with ancient african cultures the museum of african art in washington d c is the project of warren m robbins a former government employe who was once chief of the american cultural program in germany following his resignation from the foreign service in mr robbins established the center for crosscultural communication an organization concerned with educating the public in the relationship between the social sciences and the arts through the arts it is felt people may gain on both a national and international levela new and constructive perspective on the customs histories and cultures of other people the museum of african art developed from center for crosscultural communication plans when the museum opened last june there were some art objects from african countries on display a large number of pieces belonged to mr robbins and many others were borrowed from private collections and various institutions possibilities for expansion of the collection are limitless most of the african nations which have gained independence since world war ii have embassies in the nations capital and it is not unlikely that they could be persuaded to make contributions to the museum shortly after the museum of african art opened in the old town house once owned by frederick douglass another douglass home in the capital became a part of the national park system the room douglass home located on an eightacre hilltop lot officially was transferred from the douglass memorial and historical association to the national park service of the department of the douglass had occupied this home from to when he died the national park service is in the process of restoring the suburban douglass home and its impressive furnishings all of which were preserved by the association books and historical documents are stocked in the rooms at the museum of african art a restful garden is one of the features spectacular pieces of african sculpture are distributed over the grounds collections of african art similar to that in the museum can be found in several museums in other cities notably the university museum in philadelphia penn a group of detroit artists and citizens recently opened a campaign to establish a special african section in the citys art institute there are impressive collections of african art in the major new york museums last spring national educational television presented african writers of today a series of programs surveying the literary scene in contemporary africa one of the programs featured an interview with the south african writer ezekiel mphahlele author of an autobiography down second avenue a book on current problems of african culture entitled the african image and a collection of short stories the living and the dead born years ago in the squalor of a segregated black south african township near pretoria ezekiel mphahlele grew up to know the scourge of racism and poverty all the anguish which ezekiel mphahlele carries in his soul as a writer had its beginnings here in his autobiography mr mphahlele recalls his childhood on second avenue in marabastad where he scavenged after the funeral when buddy and ernestine got home and she had kicked off her shoes they punched a couple of cans of beer and sat negro digest december around for a long quiet time they were thinking about jamie and it seemed right when a person had just been buried to think a lot about them to think thoughts hard enough to last because they wouldnt ever come to mind like that again jamie had been born right there in harlem and had almost never gotten out of it he had grown up therefirst in the one furnished room with a hotplate then the two rooms then the four rooms on the second floor where his mother and father moved when the old man had become foreman he grew slowly and he grew quieter as he grew up he was a slim small boy for his age when he was fourteen and he ran hard and played hard and played hooky when he could and could get away with it but he was too quiet for his age and it wasnt just a timid quietit was a sullen caged quiet that bothered people he got under their skins when his eyes just stared at them like a dumb and furious animal and he was speechless they used to mock his tight mouth that only grew tighter into a mean pucker under his dark wide eyes the kids who played with him used to mock him until when he was fourteen he swung a baseball bat at one of them because the boy had mocked him and then he ran home with his eyes still dryly soberly mad when they found out it wasnt a skull fracture but only a large knot on the boys head that would go away the boys parents dropped charges against jamie but jamies parents were tired anyway they were tired of the oppressive heat and airlessness tired of their lives and helplessness tired of jamies dark fits of silence and the black sullenness of his pride tired without hope they decided he should spend the summer with an uncle down south and they sent him it m was the first time he had been outside of harlem he didnt stay a summer he stayed a year he stayed although his mother wrote him and told him how lonely she was and how nicely his room had been arranged with all his baseball pictures on the walls and his father wrote that his allowance would be raised he stayed until he was almost sixteen and then he came back to harlem to school again they went downtown to meet him and they almost didnt see him when he came up the ramp from the trains he was older and taller and thinner than ever and his face with its smooth long cheeks drawn toward his narrow chin seemed less mobile more confirmed in its sorrow than ever he stood there awkwardly in a too small suit that still managed to sag unhappily everywhere a cardboard suitcase bulging in one hand as the crowd about him turned away his mother dragged his lean hard ribs to her bosom and his father shook his hand and then they just stood as though waiting but it wasnt long before his mother looked into his eyes and saw what was missing it was that mean darkness that had troubled her heart like a stiff fog and it was gone he smiled then and it rolled back his lips from dull close teeth they saw his hand slide into a pocket and then saw a glint of silver as he raised it to his mouth but they didnt recognize the mouth organ until he blew the first hoot upon it a hard gusty chord that burst in their ears with a sensation like plunging into the silent pressure of water and the liquid jovial ragtime notes poured at them in a talkative challenging flow as he danced a little jig in front of them it wasnt just that the silent resentful pride had left him that was only a part of the truth and then only the negative part what mattered was that he had found a voice he had found it somehow during his year away and the hard uncertain things that had struggled in inner darkness struggled no more his parents soon found out that jamie and the mouth organ were already inseparable he was no more talkative than ever and his mother came to accept the harmonica as before she had accepted his silence but where she had loathed the brooding silences of her son jamies mother came to listen for jamies mouth organ on the stairs its tempo telling his mood lovingly as though it were in fact his voice its facile eloquence had beguiled her it was a colorless object now dull characterless except for the life the brightness or dark moody blues that jamie blew into it it was a barometer that registered every change and pressure and his parents listened at the closed door of his room as the random chords recorded and charted the unembarrassed weather of his soul negro digest december a year passed a year of school of homework of regents the cold drab city blocks pasted with a grey winter slush then warming with the drop and glassy shatter of icicles the flush of water down papermatted gutters finally spring and the small budding of isolated saplings on the city street and the heat beginning to press the tenants onto fire escapes roofs the broad sidewalks where an endless procession of tireless children played the mouth organ had been lusty and imperishable it snorted and roared all the husky jazz notes that it held that it had caught swelling upward from jamies breast and the jangling strings of buddys guitar on the roof with him accompanied that was when buddy had first known jamie and had known him well and close as two boys can only be perhaps for a summer buddy was the one friend they had made jamie and his harmonica he was jamies age but already he played the guitar with the leisure and insouciance of precocious age they played in their own passion and the urgent sharp harmonies leaped above the blocks of grey indistinguishable buildings rutted by the narrow lanes of butting autos they mingled with many dark nights with clear air above the close greasy apartment smells with many white stars some that dripped like bright celestial tears down the dark face of the night buddy was the first one to mention bringing girls up to the roof one night the organ swooned barked sardonically but buddy could remember with the bubbling expanse of beer inside him that there had been another sound in the instrument a nervous quaver like a quickened pulse like a giggle too and the first girl came it was near the end of summer in the first steaming days of september that buddy brought ernestine one night up to the roof she popped out through the door ahead of buddy and buddy said i brought ernestine you know ernestine dont you jamie shook his head with a disjointed snatch of a pop tune loosed from the organ i was in your math class this spring she murmured jamie nodded an acceptance a slow smile before ernestine sat beside buddy and buddy bobbed his head meaning to begin the night had still been dusk when they arrived as the darkness became complete the stars brightening ernestines head drooped upon buddys shoulder and the guitar quieted became a subdued rhapsody no longer taciturn and apart but with a tremulous muted concern after awhile jamie felt urged away from them as the guitar strings sunk to a whisper over which the voices of buddy and the girl mingled endlessly he got up with a boastful strut of dixieland that took him to the roofs edge where he watched the streaming lines of traf fic in the streets below but irresistibly the bravado suspired from the organs voice sinking toward a husky seeking blues the guitar strings idled but from the hand cupped over jamies mouth a flood of insistent notes lapped at the nights distance seeking in its darkness something more when buddys guitar shattered his solemn melody with a sudden raucous clatter jamie turned to the couple leaning together over the guitar it rang with a loose jarring refrain a bitch crying buddy called it and jamie fell silent before it it was not until he went down to bed and lay on his back waiting for sleep in the sweaty blackness that he pressed the line of square holes against his lips which parted over the salty silver of the casing and blew a tune softly so softly like an echo returning to its source spring had come again a climactic spring before he met julie like ernestine she had been in his class all semester and one day she had spoken to him in the waning days before graduation he had not even known until one of those now infrequent times when he and buddy stopped to talk in the halls between classes that she was vicepresident of the senior class and he had forgotten it again for months when she was waiting outside of his building one morning of the last week of school he found out that she lived in the next building his parents heard the new moodiness of the mouth organs refrain the restless agitated whine of it which came and went between odd jumbles and snatches of melody as though a constant struggle toward order were being waged and lost and mourned they bought jamie a new suit for graduation because the one job that his father had found for him he had mysteriously indifferently lost and he still had only an allowance and they saw him take the diplomalooking very handsome they thought if he would only smile and go back to his seat one hand thrust desperately into the pocket of his jacket the girl next to him smiled too warmly too proudly at him for his mother not to elbow her husband and incline her head although they did not know her yet especially did not know she already considered herself engaged to their son but then jamie did not really know that either yet howd he ever take up with julie anyhow i never heard him say more than two words to anyone all the time i knew him except to you and then all you talked about was music i dont know buddy said i guess it just happened jamie wasnt bad looking you know the girls all noticed him for his looks they just forgot about him after awhile because he didnt talk like the rest of us he never had anything to say to them julie was different though you remember julie you couldnt stop her her parents hadnt stopped her with their warning of her silent jobnegro digest december less suitor and his parents hadnt stopped her with their confidences about their awkward and unconfiding son and jamie himself hadnt stopped her with his remote privacy isolated behind the medley of the harmonica jamie told me he used to be quiet and not talk because somebody was always talking and nobody listened so he played and everybody knew what he was trying to say then and when they stopped to listen he could feel that he was saying it good julie had told buddy right after the wedding but i didnt listen i didnt let that stop me so i got through to him and he had to hear whether he wanted to or not she had bridged the flood of sound and had chipped away at the flinty silences until he had given her his class ring and then she had chipped some more you should hear my mother and his folks they act like hes already married to that harmonica they think itll drive me nuts theyll see they think hell never hold a job theyll see she had said and she had chipped some more and they saw graduation had changed things it sure did ernestine said she had kicked off one stocking and was rolling the other one down but she was thinking of something else she was thinking of how jamies father had gotten jamie and buddy jobs at the factory and how that summer she and buddy had gone steady and then they were engaged and how jamie and buddy had joined a little jazz combo downtown and buddy had saved money and quit the combo and married her and how buddy was now a foreman himself but buddy was remembering something else that summer hadnt been like the other summer when he and jamie had first met they had graduated in june and before two months were up julie had married jamie and somehow they werent friends anymore without anything having come between them after the combo had finished for the night and waiters were tossing chairs about stacking them he would cross the floor on the way home and jamie would be sitting there he just sat and he didnt seem to see anything with his head cocked like he was listening but there wasnt anything to listen to but the scuffle of polished wood and the tinkle of glasses being shelved behind the bar hey boy your womans waiting for you he used to say and sometimes he would get a drink from the bar and bring it over and sit with jamie in the dark club but jamie never finished a drink and he had nothing to say he would finger the harmonica and turn it and sometimes he would hold it up to catch the remaining light in the dim room and tap it but whatever he expected never came out and he used to shake his head like a bewildered man and looked at buddy with his empty eyes get some sleep boy see you in the shop tomorrow buddy would say not long after that ernestine had talked buddy into dropping out of the combo it was long hard hours and it wasnt getting them anywhere and maybe if there was a break later he would go back they gave him a party after his last show with them only jamie left before it was over buddy hadnt seen him go he had seen him sitting to one side in the smoky shadows of the club after it closed fingering the harmonica and then he had looked again and the chair was empty still sitting back from the table with a lighted cigarette on the table edge burning over an inch of ash buddy had already gotten his promotion so they didnt see each other in the factory anymore and they no longer called each other after work so he hadnt seen jamie again for a couple of months until he took ernestine down to the club he was surprised when he heard the combo they were never exciting the way reviewers called the more modem combos they played somewhat oldfashioned jazz but they played it well usually and those that liked to hear traditional jazz came back often to hear them but they were off and all at once he knew that it was jamie who was playing away from the group and he had never heard him off before not even when they were teenagers on the roof and that was when he realized something that he had known all the time but hadnt thought about before that even before he had quit jamie had stopped playing the organ to himself after each performance he would sit endlessly fingering the instrument without once bringing it to his lips time and again he would examine it as though it had become strange before his eyes it was no longer identical with him and he seemed to watch it with an evermounting sad suspicion buddy had even asked him why he looked at it so curiously i have to work with it he had said it doesnt say everything it cant say it all in another minute he had said julie cant hear it thinking about it buddy hadnt wanted to stay around to say hello to the combo he and ernestine had sat far back and had left early after that they heard that the club had replaced jamie and then they only knew of him from time to time when ernestine would come in with a rumor he had picked up a habit julie had someone on the side she was pregnant he had hocked the furniture she had miscarried he had lost his job and gone to lexington he was dead they had believed it when they heard he was dead even before they called julie the other things had been too incredible they didnt believe them they had nothing to do with the sad powerless shadow of a man they had known who only listened and played as though he were some secret keyhole through which an inner world revealed its jubilation and regret they had known for a long time that he was dead he had died in the memory of those who had known him like lights disappearing at night into the dark face of a tenement and finally they had the rumor and then the solemn black tuxedoed stranger with hollow grey cheeks in the shrouded box in the undertakers parlor to confirm it there was a knock on the door and buddy put his feet down off the chair seat when ernestine opened the door julie was standing there looking very pretty and carefully composed still in the black dress from the funeral she came in with an unsuccessful smile and sat down quickly on the edge of a straight chair buddy and ernestine waited a moment for julie to move to speak she seemed so precipitously arranged that she might fall to pieces at any moment then buddy stretched for the refrigerator handle and asked have a beer no thanks her rejection was quick and tidy what can we do for you julie ernestine bowed solicitously above her she looked up i wanted you to have this she said blankly to buddy she reached into the black purse and extended a small parcel shrouded in a womans handkerchief buddy unwrapped it and held up the tarnished harmonica for me i thought you used to be such close friends when you used to play the guitar i gave it up just when i had about given up hope ernestine said folding her arms warmly about his throat jamie never gave that up till the day he died id rather not keep it buddy decided abruptly and offered the harmonica back to julie who looked at him surprisedly with a stare as though she had been betrayed it wouldnt be right anyhow it was like a part of him like an arm or leg i wouldnt want to have it around maybe it shouldve been buried with him ernestine interrupted irrelevently he went at that thing like a baby to his bottle i tried to wean him julie said tried god knows i tried and she slowly shook her head he could have made something of himself he could have been somebody if he would have put down that damned thing well theyre separated now she said still refusing to take it back it should have been right there in the coffin with him buddy insisted again he gave a last look at it and slid it into the pocket of his shirt i remember jamie saying that when he played he was like a genie going into a dark blue bottle that the sound just bottled him up and then he was okay because nothing could touch a genie in his bottle no one could find it very funny though they tried to smile and after that there wasnt much any of them had to say finally julie rose from her tense perch and said she was anxious to get home and change she was hot and she left buddy opened another can of beer and then he took out the mouth organ and fingered it revolving it slowly between the thumbs and forefingers of his hands he laid it lightly against the toughness of his lips and blew a faint harsh buzz escaped and faded in the humid air a fly buzzed about the damp rings on the table he started to smack the fly with his hand and then he thought of the fly stoppered in a little blue bottle flailing uselessly toward some outpost of his tinted vista and his mind seemed to close over jamie for a moment he forgot that he had been thinking about him he put the harmonica on the table edge and the fly rose and droned away into another room unzip me ernestine said her back turned to him utomtomism or the bigoted assumption that african culture is intrinsically sexy savage and sinister portrays the dances of black africa in terms of myths the first myth envisions seminaked savages leaping and hooting by firelight in celebration of unspeakable rites of sexuality this hollywoodabetted image what are they saying asks deborah kerr of white hunter stewart granger while together they witness a supposedly erotic bit of african choreography in king solomons mines finds expression sadly enough even in wellintentioned writings on tropical africa but real african dances are not sex dances although occasionally they may turn rabelaisian for reasons of humor or social satire traditional africans normally dance several feet apart from each other and regard our method of embracing while we dance as indecent another myth imprints the common mind with a notion that war dances are important south of the sahara a misconception that probably tells more of the civilized white mans fascination with and inability to avoid warfare than it does of choreography the wardance myth would find apparent corroboration in two dances recently presented at the african pavilion at the worlds fair one zulu the other burundi in fact something like marte moritors description of watusi dancing flashes in the mind of many americans when they try to imagine what african dancing is like eyes defiant they rush forward as if carried by a single wave wildly shouting while stabbing an imagined foe then drawing back and again leaping forth how silly this might seem to say a kanuri of northern nigeria whose social dancing elegant and precise as a minuet has nothing to do whatsoever with martial intent finally the third cliche notion beloved of certain american cartoonists introduces the ferociously attired witch doctor in paraphernalia stemming from melanesia if anywhere who stamps and postures above an ailing patient lying prostrate on a mat lightyears removed from this point of nonsense are actual african medicinal dances on the mainland opposite the island of zanzibar people used to dance a round implausibly called pepo in which the patient himself not the shaman danced out a search for relief from neuritis and neuralgia with gay movement that resembled a simultaneous rendering of the shimmy and the samba we in the west are only now beginning to explore the legitimate therapeutic properties of dancing especially in the field of psychiatric disorder hopefully these uncle tomtomist stereotypessex war and jujuwill dissolve as an increasing number of subsaharan dances become known in the west as a natural consequence of the triumph of black nationalism the ballets ajricaines which brought the good earth of the republic of guineas folk dancing to the usa in the early sixties actually represented the merest indication of more to come as one of the most choreographic continents on earth wakes up to its deepest cultural potential no fewer than three pavilions at the worlds fair offered or will offer african dancing at the african pavilion one could witness exciting choreographic episodes from the ivory coast east africa and other places practically every hour on the hour in tropical africa the highest art form is the dance comparable to the place of symphonic music or architecture in our own culture writing in the twenties about the southern parts of nigeria ethnologist p amaury talbot was emphatic indeed amid the tribes of this region the dance may be taken as the chief method of portraying and giving vent to the emotions traditional africans know this of course as evidenced by the amiable boast of the kaleda dancers although all signs point to the capital importance of the dance in africa mention of this esthetic activity is almost entirely omitted from no less an authority than the international african institutes ethnograhic survey why perhaps because of the relative unimportance of dance in western european culture anthropologist james h howard admits candidly most ethnographers ignore the dance completely as something beneath their consideration howard suggests that one ought to accord the dance at least the same importance as it is given by the people you study by that criterion every working monograph on an african society ought it seems to me to indicate something about dancing until americans are exposed to frequent reports with critical focus on african choreography uncle tomtom with a leer on his face and a spear in his hand is likely to play havoc with the intellectual issues the dancers of the ivory coast zululand burundi sierra leone and guinea currently raise at the worlds fair for the eye is notoriously subjective and the uncle tomtomist sees only what he wants to see this is so pervasive a problem that when one dance troupe came to the usa from africa the press found nothing more substantial to report essentially than in which cities the girls were allowed to dance with bared bosoms and in what cities they were not how urgent is the solution of this problem very for the dancers of africa are already features of the worlds fair uncle tomtom not only downgrades authentic materials but negro digest december grants wide latitude to african and afrolatin phonies as well thus at least one american negro has donned nigerian robes memorized a few ethnic beats mostly from haiti culled from lps and chanting africa with a short american a beguiled teenage safaris by afternoon and adult safaris by night into believing they had just made contact in a nightclub with base line african music then enter his dancers throwing their respective pelvises in all directions grunting and stamping and posturing sexily with a touch of interpretive via india with these and other problems in mind i have attempted to write a brief sketch of some of the more salient aspects of african dance one hopes that these suggested traits will serve as grains of sand around which the intelligent amateur of african dance can spin at the fair the pearls of his own appreciation here they are apart dancing it is worth noting reported monsieur f de kersaintgilly in that in negro africa man and woman never put their arms around each other while they dance as we do in france this puts a finger upon the key characteristic of west african dance suppose we call this trait apart dancing by which is meant that although two or more persons may dance facing or beside each other contact is rarely established and never prolonged observe for example the ivory coast traditional dance called digreba at the fair a young female dancer heavily painted with kaolin and splendidly attired in rattles a necklace of large beads loud yellow raffia bra and cloth skirt dances among equally colorfully dressed young men but they never form a couple each dancer remains a separate entity and acts for the most part independently of all others a far cry indeed from the european embrace dance part of our culture from the moment we learn the foxtrot which seems to have evolved from the sixteenth century drehtanz turning dance in central europe almost from the beginning this remote ancestor of the american teenagers cheektocheek stimulated the invectives of organized moral indignation thus stubbes in his the anatomie of the abuses in ailgna for what kissing and bussing what smouching and slabbering one of another what filthie groping and uncleane handling is not practiced in those dancings by contrast for what chaste distance one from another is not maintained in the ivory coast digreba at the african pavilion the association of dance with sexual proclivity is a largely european problem what dance bigots refuse to recognize is the impertinence of this preoccupation when applied to subsaharan dance tradition wherein man and woman if they dance in the same company at all always dance apart from one another when we watch the ivory coasters and remember that three basic traits of couple dancing in the west are linked or embraced position synchrony of movement and limited body english ours eyes are primed to savor the complex implications of african apart dancing the apart dancer as it were unlocks his arms from the european embrace and gives them back to the dance his torso is equally liberated this sets the stage for the second basic trait of tropical african dance total body movement when the zulu male dancers perform at the fair at times all of the muscles of their bodies seem to be used incessant wavelike ripples activate their shoulder blades arms and backs even the zulu women when seated in a dance vibrate their bodies from the waist up amidst a rich mosaic of song offbeat whistling and a marvelous female vocal effect called ukuyiyiza to incite people to defend themselves or as a sign of happiness total body dancing is handsomely attendant in the negro new world one scholar finds that the whole body is used in afrobrazil courlander describes gross direct movements in haiti and the wittiest report of all marshall stearns has portrayed one especially vibrant united states jazz dancer as a oneman laocoon doubtless one of the most accessible repositories of the africanism which links in spirit not genetically new york to zululand is spanish harlem mambo thus in the early sixties practically every wednesday evening at the palladium on broadway one could observe earl lovell a brooklynborn negro rattling his shoulders waving arms bent at the elbow shimmying his kicks in short activating most of his body this parceling out of dance rhythms to every part of the physical frameso evident in the work of the female dancer of digreba at the fairis the choreographic equivalent of the west african musical trait of dominance of percussion there is a lot of percussion and several meters to get around in west african music listen carefully to the musician on filin gbe a giant drum from bouafle country in the ivory coast at the fair and it will become clear he is playing a different time signature against the meter followed by his confreres on smaller drums the body cannot absorb all these meters in the feet as in the foxtrot or even in the arms and legs as in the highland fling but must interpret them through the head shoulders hip and torso too dances of derision clearly the dancing at the fair is a mere sampling and one element of african dancing that i sorely missed there was the dance of derision choreographic equivalents of the african song of allusion a form of social control whereby a soloist or negro digest december a group sings about the pretensions or misdemeanors of an individual to make him literally face the music and inspire him to behave or recognize his fallibility are one of the most striking practices of tropical africa kaigh calls them dances of domestic oddities and found them among the zulu of south africa they dance after any event white or black which takes their fancy i have seen danced imitations of myself and party too veracious to be flattered or even comfortable after i had lost a steeplechase by being thrown from the horse my boys danced the accident so faithfully that i came away a sadder if not wiser clown the boy who took the part of me was most embarrassingly accurate as to detail these boys had danced a sly dig at their white master announcing in dance movement a sabotage of the myth of white supremacy pride and pretension are as much a target of the west african as well as south african zulu dancer as they are of the singer one wishes the zulu at the fair would dance a satire of some of the sunburnt tourists from darkest america who push and crowd about the dance pit at the african pavilion and smirk at what they see the colonial authorities of northern rhodesia were clearly aware of the purpose and force of the dance of derision or so chapter section of the laws of that area implies no person may organize or take part in any dance which is calculated to hold up to ridicule or to bring into contempt any person religion or duly constituted authority dances of derision have been reported across the face of west africe from mali where they have been described as satires in action to the capital of the nupe people in the northern region of nigeria now and then the young men will imitate with comic exaggeration a typical womens dance or caricature the walk and gestures of women this specific tendency may well have given the jazz dance some of its special flavor thus leadbelly the famed negro blues guitarist was also expert at countrystyle buckandwing clog dancing in one number he would imitate the gait of all the women of shreveport high and low pete seeger whether dreamt up in negro america or in nigeria these satires in action refer back to apart dancing as the key to understanding it is wellnigh impossible to poke fun at your partner or her dance by any means other than vocal when you are tightly locked to her in western embrace position my friends at the african pavilion tell me that they know several satiric dances and may incorporate one or two into their presentations before the fair is over next year posture one of the most frequent postures of west african dance is a matter of moving according to harold courlander with the feet flat on the ground the knees bent and the back swayed the female dancer of digreba at the fair is an almost classic demonstration of this point when she bends her knees and dances about with flywhisks in either hand there are other postures in african dance of course but the bentknees swayedback mode is certainly prevalent at least on the guinea coast thus an american if he wants to look for substance instead of smut at the african sierra leone guinea and sudan pavilions at the worlds fair can look for apart dancing total body movement dances of derision and typical posture all of the dances are apart dances and all activate the human frame in ways that demand great precision and wit in the corporeal exploration of polyrhythmic music with as professor paul bohannan tells us the head moving in one rhythm the shoulders in another the arms in still a third the torso in another and the feet in still another africans have evolved one of the most remarkable art forms on earth the folcroft incident the young man had t f y been married for four z years before he decided to look for a new home his daughter terri lynne was two years old and horace baker a technician for the radio condenser company of camden n j felt that it was time to take his wife sarah a yearold nurse at pennsylvania hospital away from west philadelphia sarah baker saw the neat terraced lawns in front of the homes on heather

house folcroft police chief samuel myers and his small force of seven patrolmen were alerted and the scene was prepared a racial disturbance was about to begin most of the people on heather road had also lived for years in the ghetto areas of philadelphia while they had been growing up in sagging brick tenements negroes had begun moving into their neighborhoods a home an apartment a block at a time there were good and bad negroes and they went to school with them and heard their parents curse them they fought with them and spawned a hatred for people with black skinswhen these people grew up and began to have families of their own they saved money until they could move into the suburbs they came to delmar village and breathed the fresh air and created an allwhite community where there was no black skin to remind them of the slums when they did see a negro their out their old hatred sometimes in obscene children heard and also expressions came and learned to hate now the negroes were coming again thought delmar village it was fine for the church to preach that was its purpose but the church did not know what it was like to live with niggers a man could be pushed only so far and then he would fight no matter what authority said it was wrong glass sprayed the empty floors at heather road crude foothigh white letters were smeared on the front wall go home niggers thursday morning august the bakers attempted to move into their new home a cursing rockthrowing crowd estimated at five hundred persons threw yellow paint at their car and forced them to leave the men of

rear doors were smashed in the garage door was crushed with an iron bar and someone got inside and pulled out all the electrical and plumbing fixtures local patrolmen werent going to be niggerlovers when the crowd grew into a mob of close to the state police were called we just cant handle it alone said chief myers its out of hand its being caused by outside influences outside agitation said mayor mcvicker the boroughs pm curfew for persons under eighteen went into effect and the jeering swearing demonstration was cut in half early friday morning the damage to the bakers home was completed when a bottle of flaming gasoline arched through an upstairs window a sudden early morning shower discouraged others in the crowd and folcrofts fire company arrived to put out the fire do a good job boys wreck the niggers place the fire caused damage and the demonstrators of delmar village returned to their homes to sleep the house at heather road was ready for horace and sarah baker some of these people have had unpleasant experiences with negroes said sarah baker all that is necessary is for them to see that we live the same way they do go to work come home and try to keep our home and property as clean as humanly possible said horace baker if we cannot live up to a challenge like this we will have no place to go the bakers were ready to move on the morning of august a glazier sent by a baptist church in philadelphia appeared with the first sunlight and replaced the first floor windows at heather road some groups of teenagers shouted at him for a while and then talked among themselves of what would happen if the bakers tried to move the rumors said the bakers would come to the village at am the glazier cut his hand taking out the broken glass state police were now entirely in charge road blocks sealed off all entrances to the area to keep out the curious major singleton schaeffer commandant of the th state police district surveyed the already growing crowd of informally dressed demonstrators and turned on his heel the major was dressed in civilian clothes and was smoking a pipe he was going to let the sun burn some of the anger out of these people an naacp leader william cecil moore president of the darby area branch criticized major schaeffer for the four hour delay of the bakers claiming the trooper was not a policeman but a politician it was a day full of resentment the troopers and their major though undermanned because of the labor day holiday and almost overwhelmed at one point later in the evening did an excellent job their first program was to gain the respect of the crowd they did this efficiently by snuffing each point of friction as it appeared during the long hot afternoon they refused to give an inch there was a healthy fear of the troopers by the time the bakers arrived members of a local naacp chapter approached a roadblock and were told not to enter the area they wished to stage a counter demonstration a peaceful strike im afraid there wont be anything peaceful down there said a state trooper at the barricade the crowd at heather road was restless someone was passing out copies of an american nazi party publication the stormtrooper numbering about eight hundred as the arrival time approached the gathering had the appearance of a harmless community outing a family entertainment children played in the street running among the legs of adults standing there teenage boys sat on the hoods of police cars legs dangling and wives with their hair in curlers pushed baby carriages up closer to the center of the festive excitement so they wouldnt miss anything as always when there is any kind of audience to appreciate humorless slang humor adolescent toughs shirts unbuttoned and tails hanging over pegged trousers put on a spirited verbal rebellion against authority the troopers and this time they had the approval of their parents there were women agitators also their shrill complaints were half for the benefit of their neighbors and half for the stern impassive faces of the troopers a slender woman arms folded across a pink blouse hair in curlers delivered all of the following in one continuous burst of indignation you wouldnt want them living next to you now would you they come in and right away make it like trash i wouldnt never mind a nice clean white man but i dont want niggers i hate them i know youze aint niggerlovers you just got a job to do but still i dont see negro digest december no black state troopers the police moved restlessly alert in their grey uniforms only occasionally turning their backs riot sticks dangling from their wrists a trooper walked slowly down the long line of jeering young faces and in each hand he carried a blackjack a pile of rocks bottles eggs and vegetables was collected on the lawn in front of the bakers home as the crowd was searched for anything that might become a weapon later on students from crozer seminary in chester and ministers from several local parishes came silently to protest the demonstration and to welcome the baker family a stone glanced off one of the new windows and a fresh round of eggs splattered against the walls the five members of the clergy moved up the terraced lawn and stood in front of the threatened home to face the jeering swearing mob the barrage continued five state troopers went into the mob and pulled out one man forcing him into a folcroft patrol car driven by chief myers if you take that man chief youre out of a job you a niggerlover too the car drove away father chapman also came in the morning and walked among his parishioners talking to those he recognized they were out here doing what he had told them was a sin they did not understand but they are black they said and shattered all the windows in the home father chapman went away and did not come back again gee i sure wish theyd come said a tall young thing dressed in pink curlers and shorts she leaned against a chain link fence listening to a transistor radio and chewing her gum waiting im so fed up said a folcroft patrolman who was guarding a street into the village id shoot the first black bastard that even looked at me funny a darkhaired tough walked up to a reporter and showed him a series of scratches on his leg lookit what the black bastards did to me why dont you print that in your papers two of em over in darby cut me with a knife the crowd waited but the bakers were not there on time several of the women and a group of kids sat down in the street and chanted two four six eight we dont want to integrate mocking the southern protests a boy carrying an american flag led his gang in a march up and down behind the troopers we want our freedom too they dont really know what the hell theyre doing said a trooper none of it made any sense it was getting late in the afternoon and uncomfortably warm there was a reporter from the pennsylvania guardian who had a full beard as he stood beyond the line of state police with the other members of the press he suddenly became a communist agitator and a niggerloving pig a housewife pointed out this fact to the others and they took up the cry communist agitator you can smell that pig from here senator mccarthy must be smiling in his grave said the reporter it still works none of it made any sense it was almost pm and many of the demonstrators had tired of waiting then all the troopers were given lastminute instructions major schaeffer had given the goahead more troopers came down heather road using their cars to force the crowd out of the street and onto the sidewalks someone leaped on the hood of a moving police car and four troopers burst through its doors and carried him into a waiting police wagon major schaeffer cleaned his glasses and walked the length of the now howling seething mob looking for another candidate this was it there could be no mistake this time or someone would get seriously hurt pipesmoking

running calling to each other in the excitement filling the street and the alleyway next to the home the bakers are at home five minutes later the only two whole windows in their home are gone in ten minutes the rear window of their car hit by two bricks is shattered into dust and chrome strips are pulled from its sides the police meet violence with violence pulling a teenager from the crowd and

niggerlovers at the top of her voice there are some calm voices who do not share in the hatred right now i am ashamed to say i live here said mrs arlene crecco a resident of the village for five years me and my husband dont see eye to eye on this but im disgusted at what theyre doing to their children said mrs crecco when they start to teach kids like that hatred where do they draw the line thats

myers were the first negro family in levittowns community of and were greeted by an eightday riot today there are a total of nine negro families in levittown property values per unit have risen as much as and higher there have been no new incidents since the disturbance the moving van left and troopers braced themselves for an exhausting evening the afternoon of waiting in the sun had weakened some of the mobs anger and many threw their remaining curses at the greyuniformed cordon and returned to their homes for the evening meal it was friday and the smell of sea food was in the air all a them is on the side of the niggers explained one particularly furious little woman who had offered periodical bits of opinion all during the afternoon this time she referred to members of the press still clustered on the bakers lawn and theyre all trying to brainwash every one of us you me everybody she told a trooper every time you look in a paper or turn on the television what do ya see or hear about niggers thats what they talk about giving them rights and freedom but at the same time they take away all of our rights that barnett is right weve got to fight all this brainwashing look at the niggerlovers theyll m never tell our side of the story how would you like to be married to that one said a trooper shes been out here screaming all afternoon a long night was about to begin for the bakers darkness came bringing fresh courage for the demonstrators early in the evening the crowd reached full strength more than one thousand angry and curious people as the fury of the bottlethrowing mob reached its highwater mark major schaeffer called for all the help he could get at midnight it subsided leaving the lawn in front of the bakers home covered an inch deep in broken glass and garbage p james mosley a white senior student at crozer seminary in chester who was among the clergy who drew the crowds anger by their presence in front of the bakers home stayed with the bakers during their first evening at home he helped sweep away the debris saturday morning no i dont think any of us were afraid mosley other ministers phillip savage and the bakers but they did get awfully close to the house i had begun to wonder if the police were keeping anyone away said mosley at saturday morning troopers arrived to reinforce the deadtired troopers already on duty what remained of the mob was told to return to their homes twelve mounted troopers trained in handling riots were dispatched to patrol delmar village streets we kept our sense of humor through the whole business during the night we thought up more crazy jokes than dick gregory will think up in ten years he said yeah said savage if the negroes started a campaign to buy burial lots in allwhite cemeteries the civil_rights theme song would change from kwe shall overcome to we shall undertake vjrf it is the day after glass is being swept from the floors inside heather road mounted policemen lift children onto their saddles and give them rides as they patrol the long lines of row houses the man stands on his front porch and sees the litter on his lawn the screen door will have to be replaced up the street children are running in the early sunlight soon he will bring his own daughter to live here when it is safe the next step is to go along with life said horace baker the tension and hatred that did all this will die down in time no insult no intimidation no threat no nothing will make me leave he said troopers came up the stairs bringing food to the embattled couple and protestant ministers arrived with the they had collected to help repair the damaged home the only traffic in delmar village was families on their way to mass every citizen of this great nanegro digest december tion of ours has the right to select the home of his choice said protestant and catholic pastors to their sunday flocks in the afternoon male home owners of the village met and issued a statement saying that they deplored the violence of the demonstration outsiders were to blame but that they planned boycotts of any business which serves or deals with the bakers we do not welcome the baker family into our community they said because of the way they arrived perhaps this small borough can show this great nation that the federal government cannot force social integration upon the population another naacp plot said delmar village tuesday september the bakers went shopping in a local shopping center the press reported the community was adjusting rapidly collections taken by clergymen of all denominations went over the mark to help the bakers repair their home the local delaware county aflcio council started raising funds to pay union tradesmen to work on the damage they reported another monday september mayor mcvicker said the borough has made a marvelous recovery it was the same day the bakers went back to work for the first time since moving to the village they also brought terri lynne home to live with them it was safe reporters at the incident took a long look at the character of the rioters they make me sick said a cameraman they make african tribes look pretty good from here i think you might be wrong said an old reporter dabbing at a stain on his shirt where he had been hit by an egg theyre out there right now making my good opinion of them look bad but their only real sin is a lack of imagination of intelligence this makes them try to find answers in a hurry through violence he said another tv editor took the pipe out of his mouth to agree sure he said give people just like these some good cause and watch them then they go without food and sleep and money to dig two guys out of a mine cavein the fellin mine near hazleton pennsylvania but he added tell them they have a chip on their shoulders which many of them do or quick tempers and theyll knock out half the teeth in your head to prove how mildmannered they are the sad thing is that theyre out here throwing rocks and garbage because they dont understand said the old reporter one last observation on thursday august after the bakers had made a first attempt to reach their new home a postman walked through the mob carefully sorting a handful of letters he glanced at and then crossed the street easing the strap from his worn leather bag further up on one shoulder someone called his name and he nodded except for that no one seemed to notice him at all but when you think about it whats so unusual about a colored mailman i have a dream said the reverend martin_luther_king
theres too much hypocrisy on civil_rights i think the time has come for some plain speaking on the prob lem of civil_rights words have a way of losing their fundamental meaning through overuse for instance the words freedom democracy and security lose the strength of meaning with repetition and so we find that when people speak of civil_rights they seem to be saying it in a rather casual way one gets that sort of feeling when listening to some of these heated discussions on civil_rightsthat too many of the people dont quite mean what they say or dont quite know what they mean they have carried from their early school years an acceptance that civil_rights is a basic right of all the people they regard civil_rights which is another word for human rights as something that they are of course for and that every decent person must be forand there can be no question about their position on it unfortunately this ready acceptance all too often blows sky high when some of these same people become involved in a civil_rights matter in a personal way at such a time they come face to face with the problem of what amounts to a separation of attitudes on the one side is the right of privacy and all the many privileges that go with it such as the choice of company choice of club choice of friends and whatever social categories with which one elects to associate but on the other side is the attitude they are obligated to practice outside their homes and clubs here their freedom is subject to the other peoples rights and public policy here rights to free action must be accommodated to the rights and freedoms of othersand anyone who would refuse to go along with that commitment is going against the current of american present day thought and action again our rights of privacy and the privileges of free social choices we may enjoy in our homes are inviolateand there we can do and say as we please but when we are out in public and deal in such areas as public transportation public parks public schools hospitals housing and such our rights are limited to where they do not infringe on the rights of others regardless of the color of their skin or what neighborhoods they come from in the eyes of the law and under our system there are no levels or degrees of privilege the protection of the dignity and freedom of one man is as sacred as that of the next man if we are to enjoy all the benefits of equality there can be no special publicly privileged class or any discriminations there are those among us who are still afflicted with the prejudices and primitive hostilities of a bygone age which transcend their other good intentions and good qualities for example whom one eats with or where is a personal choice whom one invites to his home or private club that is a social matter and it is of no concern to the community but when it comes to public places and facilities involving the health education and economic opportunities of all the people thats something else again there is no room here for prejudice bigotry or special pleading and no unfair discrimination personal likes or local hostilities should bar any citizen and that means every citizen regardless from obtaining an education seeking any job he is capable of holding and being entitled to a decent place in which to live and to bring up his family in considering the broad question of civil_rights some of us tend to confuse our likes and dislikes with what is right and wrongand as a matter of fact in our public behavior toward our fellow citizens as well as to mankind everywhere it is necessary to understand and practice to do what is right and not what we happen to like or not to like too often the things we either like or dislike turn out to be wrong so what we must understand is that we are dealing with the differences of right and wrong and what amounts to the difference between fair treatment or mistreatment of our fellow man as james m barrie expressed it the secret of happiness is not doing what one likes but in liking what one has to do from the early beginnings of our history we as a nation have been dedicated to the belief that all men are created equal and that differences of race color religion or national origin should not be cause to deny anyone equality of treatment and equality of opportunity this nation has been from its very beginning a haven for the oppressed of other landsand surely we cannot tolerate oppression in our own land we have managed to produce a highly successful and stable society under our system of government in preserving a free and open society to help maintain that way of life we need to balance our personal liberties with group authority for practical purposes we operate generally under a majority rule procedure but we learn from past history that majority rule if unrestrained could lead to tyranny and oppression the founding fathers understood this very well they made sure this would not happen when they provided for the protection of the dignity and liberty of the individual by attaching a bill of rights to the constitution this made it a matter of the basic organic law of this nation that all would enjoy freedom of worship freedom of peaceful assembly and equal participation in the choice of government on all levels the question naturally arises as to why we are continuing to experience resistance from some quarters in putting into full working practice these rights which we have been duty bound to do for over one hundred years perhaps one of the answers is that under our thin coat of company manners we are preoccupied with selfishness in other words we are still living by a double standard there are in every community the social snobs the economically overprivileged the selfserving political bigots to whom human rights are revolutionary subversive words these are people with special problemsand we understand them for they regard themselves above the crowd but i find it difficult to understand some of those able and intelligent men who speak for those southern states in a manner truly representative of those statesand surely not of these times if their hard unyielding position on the civil_rights bill is the customary delaying action and yet another contest to defer the inevitable i think these men are badly mistaken and are hurting the nation where it is most damaging i would hope that they would choose instead to cooperate with the inevitable and hasten the day when as a united nations we can pursue many other urgent tasks which need to be dealt with for the security of the nation we have had all the sectionalism and needless local rivalries we can stand we have enormous tasks ahead of us to meet threats from without without having to weaken our position by senseless divisions among ourselves we are flanked by two gigantic powers one on each side of us communist russia and red china they are driven by a fanatical zeal to impose their archaic system on the rest of the world they are determined to destroy us if we fail to resolve the issues of civil_rights between states and the federal government we shall surely be extending the new tyrannies a helping hand we are faced with many complex internal problems which will tax our courage and intelligence for many years to come one of these serious problems has been developing in our industrial centers where chronic unemployment is rapidly reaching a critical stage due to the growth of automationthe machine age another crisis is developing on our farms where mechanization is resulting in a great new productivity and an ever diminishing farm force these men on the farm added to the men in the factories who are being displaced by machines should not be dismissed as unfortunate casualties of the industrial age and abandoned to a life of tragic idleness for which they were in no way responsible i know of no area of public concern that requires more urgent attention than the need to find new ways and areas into which to channel these millions of unemployed where they can be restored to usefulness and productivity where they can retain their dignities as gainfully employed members of our society then there is the as yet unsolved problem of how we are going to meet our responsibility for guarding and protecting the publics health this has been put off too longmostly for no good reason we should be concerned with the problems of health as they affect the lives of all of our people the life and health of each of us must be regarded as equally important to all of us there continues to be a serious maldistribution of doctors nurses technicians and facilities in all fields of medical care every industrial nation in the world has seen to it that this need which could not be left to discretion and control of privately organized medicine had to be supported by a nationally sponsored program yet in this country regarded as the most advanced of nations we are being held back from adopting a program of general welfare by the faulty logic of organized pressure groups which make no more sense than the arguments advanced by those who would deny all citizens their civil_rights these are no longer partisan political problemsthese go beyond political debate the time for that has long passed we have put off action far too long it is over sixteen years since i proposed to deal with the problem of civil_rights during my presidency at the time i directed the military to abolish segregation and proposed to the congress to enact a civil_rights program we have been trying to advance that cause step by step but it has been painfully slow i hope that we can now proceed to put into effect the comprehensive program now before the congressso that w we can get on with the many other urgent tasks before us we have had too much talkit is time for action the negro americas abstract man until a few years ago a favorite game of mine went something like this id make a mental listing of all the generalizations american white people were known to entertain about negroes then proceed in my every contact with them to behave just the opposite at first glance this would seem old hat for a large number of american negroes already act out this role and its necessity has remained one of the real tragedies in their daytoday relationships with whites but my game was subtler more confounding i would take the reverse stereotypes and in turn reverse them without somehow returning to the starting place thus where many negroes were supposed to be officious and over dressed i strove to be relaxed and casual or where i was expected to covet things like automobiles i made it quite clear my values lay elsewhere the reward for this absurd behavior was of course to watch in delight while the white mans carefully constructed universe crumbled beneath him a spectacle i still find extremely gratifying and compelling there was however still another more urgent motive the desire to somehow convince my fellow american that i was in the final analysis just a human being not a victim or a moral or a clause in the constitutionbut a plain old natural phenomenon like him and this is where it ultimately failed me this little game of mine i was a private in the army a friendship developed with a fellow soldier from boston and the matter of his whiteness and my negroness couldnt have seemed more remote for our relationship was based on a sound enough premise a likeness of background and temperament then one day the training ended and the discussion as army discussions will fell to the matter of womenin this case the female population of the little white community near the installation it was then that i made an amazing discovery that in the mental world of this intelligent perceptive and socially conscious young person i existed in a fantastic manner one as strange and eerie as all the re gions of the mind on the one hand in our relationship was my immediate self a kindred spirit with whom he talked and drank and damned the army while on the other hand was the negro i stood for something different altogether something vast impersonal and ultimately terrifying and to be dealt with independently it was then i discovered what every american negro must eventually discover and try to accept that defy the stereotypes though i may confound to my hearts content all his neat generalizations nothing i really said or did or thought of myself could ever begin to destroy that carefully designed pattern of thought that appears so vital to the american white man in his view of the negroa view that has become less a representation of the real world than a myth a symbol an abstraction and which is at the very root of what we call the race problem for we are of course ducking the real issue if we deny that the only possible reality of this persisting question is its existence in the minds of the majority population thus nothing will be solved so long as we persist in employing the abraham lincoln approach in place of the more realistic more painful freudian frame of reference but history has nonetheless assigned statesmanship to the task and a great deal of the negros rage i think springs from his dim awareness that this is a deliberate scapegoat and it no more represents the real confrontation between himself and american race prejudice than the imposition of social reform as a cure for paranoia for the th century american negro obviously is less a man than an idea to his countrymen he is firstly the negro and only secondly the physician the socialist the bastard or simply mr jones should he write a book of win a nobel peace prize or climb a flagpole in his undergarments it is invariably noted that a negro has done these things somehow not an american somehow not a man it is this abstraction moveover which renders him so easily a victim to injustice and atrocity that he is somehow not a fleshandblood human presence like bill jones next door but a vast impersonal lifeless abstraction and even his countrymens acts of good faith are thereby suspect offered as they invariably are on the basis of justice freedom or one of the other noble principles which testify so plainly so offensively to the impersonal manner in which he addresses himself to the negro it is this abstract approach i think which is the basis of james baldwins reference to the white mans impertinent assumption that he must accept you an assumption that dodges altogether the all too obvious fact that it is he not you who is in need of salvation this assumption be it noted is far from conscious so that when an american says he believes in the intrinsic equality of the races more often than not he is telling the truthso far as his conscious faculties tell him it is true but cast away the abstractions allow one of those intrinsically equal beings of his own accord to behave as such allow one to say establish a more than casual relationship with a white female a perfectly natural phenomenon even negroes often forget between animals of like species and opposite sex or to aspire to goals outside his reservation to exercise his intrinsic right to live where he chooses seek the neighbors friends inlaws of his own sovereign choice allow one to even exhibit a little more than middling intelligence sensibility valor insofar as these exist outside his own restricted category of the universe outside the abstractions in short allow one to behave in any way as though he too believed in his intrinsic equality and had determined to arrange his life accordinglyand something quite remarkable takes place within his countryman something that defies all his rationalities something as old as the civilization of europe let us cite a few examples of this abstract approach and how conveniently it masks the real confrontation between negroes and whites there is for example the case of congressional representative adam clayton powell whose petulant words they never forgave me for leaving the plantation stirred up such indignation a few years ago irrelevant was the outraged replyand irrelevant they most apparently were as a defense of the charge at hand some infraction or other of the code by which congressmen supposedly behave yet not ultimately irrelevant the fact is that of the some americans who make up our national house of representatives powell has remained by far the most intimidated and harassed and relevant or irrelevant his complaint invoked a basic truth about the attitude of nearly all american whites to just about all american negroes an attitude held over from the feudal days of our country when their universe was quite differently constructed so that even today it is one thing for a negro to become a congressman and address himself to the affairs of this country as though they were in some measure his affairs too but quite another thing for that same negro to claim a committee chairmanship and to marry a caucasian and and but powell is the happy exception here for the most tragic effect of all of the abstract approach and its resulting ghetto has been its awful stain on the negros own psychology how he looks at the universe and his place in it while still a soldier i happened to be passing a weekend in st louis the local negro ywca had been conducting weekly dances for servicemen in the area and a companion and i had planned to attend as we often did during our excursions to the city this time however we were informed the program was discontinued and advised to try the downtown y which had a similar recreation now you would have to have been born a negro in america and reared in a ghetto to have attended segregated schools churches social clubs to have planned your entire future your marriage your job where you intended to live all in accordance with the fact that you were indeed a negro in order to understand the genuine mental crisis this prospect caused my companion as far as he was concerned this boy out of a northern ghetto the evening was overfor the downtown branch was white and we who were not white did not really belong there and there ultimately is the productthe final grotesque product of one of the most sustained and unrelenting systems of racial quarantine in the history of western civilization and all the more merciless for its good faith for its smiling american camaraderie and goodfellowship a situation that renders frustrating even mental protest one so carefully cloaked in abstractions the victim often loses sight of what it really implies about his utmost being as it turned out he happened to be right my prudent friend for no sooner had i arrived and completed the first dance than i was approached very respectfully by a gentleeyed middleaged woman whom i took to be the hostess and given a remarkable offer if for some reason i was not having a good time she would be only too glad to refund my moneyfifty cents in this case of course i assured her i was having a tremendous time and appreciated her concern what i then asked was the cause for this concern this was obviously unexpected and for a split second i think she was compelled to look squarely at the situation well she said at length recovering as it were her frame of reference to be perfectly frank its difficult for the girls to dance with you before the implication of this could sink in she quickly began the old spiel about tradition and attitudes and eventual understanding and the other cloaks behind which such white people hide the remarkable distress of their inner lives and there followed that smile that nervous distraught american smile that every reasonably sensitive negro has felt in his deepest entrails to be the most rending insult of them all you understand dont you she beamed appealing oddly to my reason but what was i really to understandthat i was a kind of subhumanthat i was somehow a shameful natural phenomenon whose very presence in human traffic heralds disaster this i was unready to understand moreover this is not at all what i was called upon to understand by regarding me fundamentally as an issue and not a kindred human being she was quite unable to see the appalling reality of her offer she was not humiliating a fellow human being an american soldier in uniform she was upholding moderation in the mixing of the races and in that regard her conscience was completely untouched this incident is important not only because of its ghastly testimony of the nations foremost spiritual sicknessand one which ultimately will defy any ratiocinative solutionbut because it indicates how subtly its real face has been hidden behind issues behind abstractions the antagonist be it noted was no ruffian who is much more easily dealt with but one of those christianly matronly types one often finds around ywcas and other institutions of good work the kind that raises such a sincere fuss over racial atrocities in the south the kind even to perhaps actively protest some particularly odious injustice yet who herself was able in all good faith to inflict an atrocity every bit as inhuman in its own way as a mississippi lynching not all such insults are so obvious some are less immediately felt yet ultimately just as destructive as one of those glaring we reserve the right notices that so impersonally rob the american negro of his human legacy and place him in a special category of the species as a newspaper reporter in washington d c i was assigned one day to cover a hearing by the house unamerican activities committee subpoenaed were a dozen or so u s students and young adults including paul robeson jr son of the negro concert singer who defected to europe the group had been accused of antiamerican demonstrations at the russiansponsored world youth festival in vienna and included the usual array of bearded youths and ponytailed coeds actor yul brynner happened to be in the audience and the entire assembly as is often the case at hu ac sessions was rather a gay festive theater gathering to these merry young people robeson contrasted sharply a sober mannerly youth in plain suit and tie his protest was very different from theirs less theoretical more immediate we talked several minutes before the hearing with robeson and his counsel explaining the details of their case suddenly the lawyer glanced at me and asked of course youre from the afroamerican a more conventional phrasing might have been what newspaper do you represent or something but no offense was taken at least not by me beneath his calm reserved exterior the youthful and sensitive robeson had recognized it for what it was another case of the american need to classify to categorize of the sort that perhaps had sent him off to vienna in the first place and falling so carelessly from the lips of the very person assigned to defend his protest a lawyer of no small reputation locally as a champion of negro causes robesons resentment was infectious and so as to make at least a middling comeback i rejoined of course youre from the aclu american civil liberties union childishness perhaps but maybe not consider such assumptions multiplied a thousand times dominating the negros every encounter with whitesreflecting a vigilant awareness not only of the obvious differences of appearance often of dialect etc but some kind of cosmic difference decreeing that the negro journalist is really less a journalist than a negro journalist or that an american leader who happens to be a negro is necessarily a negro leader and so on in short decreeing that the negro is fundamentally an abstraction and only secondarily a man hollywood has helped sustain and therefore contributed to this national illusion by keeping the negro an abstraction at first glance it would almost seem contrived remembering that one out of ten americans is a negro it is difficult to otherwise explain his almost complete absence from any account of american life outside of those which involve him in the abstract as an issue or as a shadowy servant there is of course no conscious contrivance this is simply the only manner in which the negro impresses himself on the average american not that he would consciously make the exclusion it simply would never occur to the ordinary casting director to launch a film in which the protagonist or the villain or any minor character just happened to be a negro in the sense that the bank teller just happened to be bald or the private detective just happened to be wearing a checkered overcoat it simply would never occur to him that any negro had a thing at all to do with life in america other than slavery oppression intermarriage passing or one of the other insulting abstractions with which he identifies nonwhites in general and negroes in particular of course it might be argued that hollywood didnt create the world least of all america that in american life the negro does by and large pose some problem or other either of his own making or the white mans that he is not just an american just a man yet this argument when really examined reflects still another of the limitless assumptions with which the american white man addresses himself to the negro does it raise the question for instance as to whether the negro considers himself anything beyond or below an american a man i personally know many negroes who qualify as americans to an almost alarming degree who are just as freeenterprising and castrohating as the most provincial midlander who share the national pride fears and myths with every bit as much fervor as any daughter of the american revolution and yet they are not really americans for they in no way exist as such in the minds of their countrymen a feature of the current emancipation commemoration has been the vogue among orators to cite the all too obvious fact of the negros continued enslavement but only the sharpest insights most notably james baldwins have pointed to the far more pertinent factthat negroes are enslaved in turn by slaves the american white man is bound to a system at best pragmatic even in its heyday and which now lives on as a useless and imbecillic relic grotesquely dictating his psychology with the same inevitability it did in as for the intervening century it goes without saying that had normal developments taken place there would be no negro problem in the first place for the perfectly logical reason that there would be no negro except in the purely biological sense the normal cultural giveandtake would have swallowed up the negro into the mainstream of american life in exactly the same manner the absence of such barricades has liquidated the italian and to a lesser degree the jew and even the prospect of a negro attaining the presidency itself would raise as few eyebrows as say the election of a descendent of irishmen the late john f kennedy the difference of course has been the extraordinary antiamalgamation theory and its lingering influence on the white mans psychologyan influence that compels him to look at his fellow citizen not as the fleshandblood phenomenon that he is but as a huge lifeless and menacing abstraction to be dealt with accordingly now of course this system has not been entirely destructive isolated from mainstream values the american negro has been spared many of the more notorious characteristics of the th century american white man including what has been coined as the cult of conformity and its attendant mediocrity of outlook and poverty of soul they have remained indeed part of that great nonwestern world which from all visible indications is about to resume its proud chapters in history the american negro denied the decadence of prevailing manners barred from the appalling comforts of the suburbs has retained a kind of equilibrium a kind of easy serene skepticism born of healthy privation and lack of powers illusions nor can one who has grown up in the ghetto fail to appreciate its own peculiar lorenot just jazz and good times but a kind of realistic and very nonamerican way of reckoning with this terrifying world these things speak well for the ghetto but they in no way justify it for quite apart from its poverty and consequent crime and moral laxity is the harsh psychological effect of the ghetto on a people who realize that for some unexplained reason they are forced to live their the entire lives in quarantineor in a special category of their countrymens mind commenting on the soulless nature of unsleeping history as apart from the human souls who nonetheless make that history the late aldous huxley has made this point when such institutions are left to their insomnia when they are permitted to function according to the laws of their own being subordinating individual insight to collective tradition they become madnot like an individual lunatic but with a solemn traditional and systematic madness that is at once majestic and ludicrous grotesque and terrifying and who can fail to see the wide chasm between institutionalized american racial attitudes and the insight of the average individual american who nonetheless contributes to and sustains that institution every waking hour of his life the real tragedy of course is not mississippi or any isolated area or event in the whole of the system isolations which really provide only convenient scapegoats by which the system can escape the menace of selfreckoning the real tragedy is that million civilized vigorous and apparently talented people are being lost to historysimply because their country is terrified to look at them and find out who they really are chinn is one of jr the footnotes of his tory a lovely phantom who has eluded all but l fc fc w a the professional historian a beautiful skeleton rattling around in the closets of political greatness in the era of andrew jackson she was as important as the scandalous peggy eaton but today her name exists only in a few musty old county records and in the longforgotten accounts of the election of who was she who was this lady who was talked about behind the closed doors of washingtons female society who was ignored publicly as though she did not exist and yet was directly the cause of the collapse of the political career of one of the countrys outstanding liberals julia chinn was the common law wife of richard mentor johnson vicepresident of the united states during the first administration of martin van buren julia chinn was the second lady of the land in the period preceding the war between the states and a negro many southerners of this period had relationships with their female slaves many raised backyard families but these relationships were always pseudoclandestine their white wives were always obligingly blind to their husbands extramarital activity not so richard mentor johnson he could not marry julia legally but he took his obligations to his wife and two children seriously and treated them with every courtesy and consideration he was proud enough of his daughters to try to introduce them to washington society to use his influence to gain them acceptance in the ballrooms and banquet halls of the socially illustrous what a stir he must have created one account tells of how he was refused permission to seat his daughters on the reviewing stand where he had been invited as guest orator the girls waited in the carriage while he spoke as soon as he had finished his speech he strode from the platform and drove off angrily with them ignoring the rest of the program and the festivities held in his honor how naive is the historian who writes that richard mentor johnson never married and then proceeds to give an account of how he deeded to his children money and property and slaves legend has it that richard johnson had fallen in love with a poor seamstress and had been refused permission by his mother to marry the girl because of her lowly position in a fit of pique he took on the arrangement with julia a lovely slave who had been raised by his own mother whatever his motivation he accepted the alliance with solemn devotion was he a great man the people of kentucky would have responded with a violent negative his socalled doctrine of amalgamation exemplified by his own marital arrangements offended them to their peculiarly chivalrous senses he would have been more of a gentleman if he had sold his family on the slave block as many of them did to the westerners he was a great herothe slayer of the indian warrior tecumseh at the battle of thames during the war of severely wounded in this battle he carried scars for the rest of his life in spite of his reputation as an indian warrior it was he who had the compassion to organize some of the first indian schools even acting as a superintendent of one of them to the downtrodden eastern debtors he was a virtual savior advocating measures to aid them and to abolish debtors prisons he was devoted to the underdog as one colleague remarked the people loved him because he loved them first his views on many subjects including that of women in society was that of the most liberal of thinkers today he was an anachronisma misplaced progressive a contemporary and friend of andrew jackson he expressed ideas that might have been regarded as extreme today many questioned his relationship with julia chinn and speculated that it might have resulted from his failure with other women this is highly unlikely since he was handsome desirable exciting a white woman friend commented on his pleasant geniality and his strong masculinity a big man sturdy and capable he was looked on with favor by many washington ladies but he preferred julia his sweet and cherished mulatto wife as mistress of the great brick house at blue creek records show that there was a certain glamor in his careless dress the scarlet vest he always affected the cane the slight limp the steady smile his love of literature was wellknown and he spoke clearly in a language full of powerful metaphor the speech of a man who admired fine words and fine expression a writer of sorts his compositions were used as texts for the children of virginia he was also commissioned to record the history of battles and campaigns in which he took part he inherited a love of music from his mother and he had more than a passing knowledge of many instruments his greatest pleasure was to sit by the fire and listen to julia as she played on the pianoforte both the sight and the sounds were lovely his marital position was accepted by his colleagues in fact it apparently was of little importance to anyone andrew jackson had had his own troubles but won out despite charges of adultery that had been leveled at him and his wife rachel jackson had died brokenhearted still shunned by washingtons ladies jackson the widower president had become the defender of peggy eaton the lady who had scandalized society as a divorcee and by marrying the man who was supposedly the cause of the divorce the fact that her new husband was the secretary of war did not give her an automatic entry into the homes of other officials president jackson believing in peggys innocence and still rankling over the past insults to his rachel tried to force her down the throats of the wives of the other cabinet officials he chose as the champion and ambassador of his cause richard mentor johnson feeling that he had the right touch to handle this delicate situation the fact that johnsons own affairs were an affront to the mores of washington society seemed to have been overlooked at least they were overlooked until the election of it was then that the opposition felt they could gain political advantage by publicizing the story of johnson and julia and their two daughters imogene and adeline johnson had never denied his relationship to the two girls he had in fact reared them carefully hiring a white tutor who remarked frequently of the girls beauty and gentility he also remarked that as a stranger he would never have suspected that they were the children of a colored woman johnson could easily have fabricated a story and passed them off as white their education was vastly superior to the females of that day in accordance with their fathers standards julia was part of johnsons property inheritance from his father his mother a kindly talented woman had raised the slavegirl in her own genteel manner teaching her all the things that made her admirably suited to be mistress of blue creek she even managed the choctaw academy in johnsons absence she corresponded with him frequently giving him reports as to details in running the plantation and the school and he responded with suggestions and orders he sent the girls gifts and encouraged them to mind their lessons and learn both girls later married white men and their father deeded them each an estate adeline received blue creek and imogene land to the north it was natural perhaps for the southern states to object to johnsons candidacy for vicepresident in the newspapers of virginia screamed against his nomination saying that the negroes would have an esther at the throne to speak for them most of the other arguments were less polite however so great was johnsons popularity that he was chosen despite his domestic arrangements the election was a tie and went to the senate to be resolved there he was elected by a large majority his southern colleagues found that their loyalty to their party superceded their moral convictions most of them were not distressed by his relationship to a negro and a slave in fact many of them had the same sort of relationship their complaint was his lack of willingness to hide his indiscretions in the meantime during the period of the campaign julia was stricken with cholera in one of the great epidemics that swept the country and died shortly afterward johnson also lost his elder daughter he was extremely lonely and his whole life began to change stories of his degeneracy began to filter back to washington an old man physically unkempt living in a house he had let go to a shambles he had taken to himself a nineteenyear old negro girl after her there were others his public appearances became disgraceful he was slovenly his speech was disjointed vague desperate his oncekeen grasp of affairs was gone and only a fuzzy muddled mind remained his oncegreat appeal as the slayer of tecumseh was overshadowed by the great hurrah for the legendary general harrison the most promising liberal of the s was the hasbeen of the s the democratic party saw no profit in defending his action and as the second van buren campaign began johnson was dumped as candidate for the vicepresidency his whole career had ended with julias death what was her real role in his life she had been raised by his mother undoubtedly had many of his mothers mannerisms and ideas was it possible that she was his discipline a sort of reincarnation of jennie johnsons beliefs and standards did she set the pattern by which he lived and which disintegrated when she died there can only be speculation over her place in his life because records are so sketchy however while she lived johnson led a wellordered life attending to all the details of his many personal interests and to his political responsibilities with great expertness his skill and political value were great enough to allow his colleagues to tolerate his offenses against their standards but without julia he was only the remnants of a man who had missed greatness julia chinn is and perhaps will always remain only one of the interesting shadows that lurk in the pages of history the jim crow christ the pastor said he would rather see us afterward in his study we said wed wait we had plenty of time when we were alone with him he sat silent and then sighed and said what you say is true only too true but if i invited negroes to come to our church youd have to beg them to come said harry the crazy irishman they dont go for that halfhearted invitation stuff were here to ask you to beg them to come a look of quick pain passed across the pastors face as if his toe had been stepped on and then he began again if negroes came to our church our white members would fall away from what said harry the crazy irishman from their antichristianityour church said the pastor ignoring harry the crazy irishman would be empty except said harry for the least of them and for christ my church would be empty said the pastor you have got to understand my position what is your position said the crazy irishman are you running a box office or a house of god you have got to understand my position said the pastor still ignoring harry a minister can not be too far ahead of his congregation are you the shepherd of the flock or one of the sheep said harry the pastor by this time appeared to be inured to harrys impudence of course i agree with you gentlemen he said with emphasis on the gentlemen that the segregation of our colored brethren is deplorable we didnt say it was deplorable said harry we said it was antichristian deplorable said the pastor and this time there was a note of firmness in his voice that suggested that the crazy irishman was beginning to get to him but we have got to face the fact that the church can not get too far ahead of society if it is going to remain effective i now wait a minute said harry ill pass that one about the church remaining effective but a minute ago you said the minister cant be too far ahead of his coni gregation and now youre saying the church cant get too far ahead of society which do you mean both said the pastor sharply the rest of us all glanced at each other the pastor had been caught off guard and had answered harry directly somebody had to shut harry up or hed ruin us but hed ruin the pastor first none of us said anything how far ahead of the jews was moses when they built the golden calf how far ahead of the disciples was jesus when he went the route and they all ran out on him it was harry the crazy irishman of course the pastor was getting mad im not here to discuss theological questions he said well we are said harry but maybe were in the wrong place maybe we should have gone to the pub and talked to the publican that was too much for the pastor he turned on harry and said young man a little christian humility wouldnt hurt you a little christianity would hurt you said the crazy irishman and thats why you wont practice it harry got up clapped his hat on his head and went out the rest of us sat there as red as the pastor he pulled his frock coat together as if he was going to button it and straightened himself up in his chair that took time enough for his face to fade from red to white you will have to excuse me gentlemen he said but i have a meeting i want you to know that you are always welcome here and that i am always at your service that after all is my humble function here and i want you to know also that i approve heartily of your ideals if not of your methods you know gentlemen and now he began to spread out in his chair again as if we were settling down for a long talk these things are complicated complicated he shook his head obviously regretting that though what he said was true he had to say it these things take time two thousand years is long enough it was the voice of the crazy irishman coming through the first floor window from the sidewalk this time the pastor looked as if hed been stabbed in the back and harrys voice as a matter of fact had come from behind him goodday gentlemen goodday harry was dancing around outside im sorry if i spoiled your teteatete boys he said if it hadnt been for me you might have got a cup of tea out of it but you wouldnt have got anything else and you know it what did we get out of it this way said somebody ill tell you what we got out of it said the crazy irishman we let him know that we know that he isnt a christian isnt that enough for one day i sympathized with the parson myself he has a big family a big house a big car and a big congregation he doesnt do any actual harm and i know he does a lot of good in a quiet way hed even stood up a time or two on the race issuewhich is more than you can say for most of them the only place he cant stand up is in his own church well thats a terrible way for a man to have to live but we all live like that more or less we dont want to be crucified and it seems as if the only way to avoid being crucified is to crucify that parson doesnt want to be like christany more than you or i dohe just wants to sound like christ hes got to liveor at least he thinks he doesand he isnt fit for anything else than preaching hes a oneskill man just like you and me if he lost his job hed be in a tough fix we havent got any more right to condemn him than he has to condemn us wait a minute i dont know about that he undertook to preach the gospel of jesus christ and he isnt doing it that sounds worse to me than not listening to it which is bad enough as between the jim crow pastor and the jim crow churchgoerneither of them christiansi suppose the one that undertakes to preach the gospel to the other is the more damnable the only extenuating circumstance i suppose is that the pastor didnt know what he was undertaking when he undertook it the ministry is so strictly a trade in our time that the poor devil probably flipped a coin to decide between dentistry and preaching and preaching won be ye perfect as your father in heaven is perfect ill bet nobody ever bothered to tell him when he was young that if he wasnt willing to be perfect he should go into dentistry you never hear any of them any more trying ot justify their crucifixion of christ the way they used to especially in the south saying that cains sin was marrying a negro woman or that the negroes are the children of ham who was cursed by noah and condemned to father a progeny of servants and i suppose that its something gained to get them to stop perverting scripture but it cant be much in gods sight we are made of one blood all nations of men we are all one in christ jesus we are all members one of anotherthey cant ignore scriptures like that not while god is around christ died to save all men and there is no distinction of persons or races in holy writ there was the darkskinned king at the epiphany the man of ethiopia when philip baptized in acts and the ethiopian counsellor who persuaded the king to let him deliver jeremiah from prison if these three men were negroesi cant find any others in scripture and im not sure these three were they were among the most glorious of christians they were among the elect racism and christianity dont mix a man can run a jim crow restaurant or a jim crow college and be nothing worse than an ene my of democracy but the man who runs a jim crow church is an enemy of christ and theres no getting around it his business and his only business is to bear witness to christ if the christian church isnt christian it ought to go out of business and if it werent for bingo book reviews and box suppersnone of which has anything to do with christs witnessit would have been out of business long ago and there is nothing the negro can do about it except pray to god who has hardened the hearts of the jim crow pastors and the jim crow churchgoers to soften them the negro christian who wants to save the christian church cant save it by forcing his way into it if god has willed its destruction it will be destroyed and there is no reason for the negro to be sorry for himself he is not deprived of the kingdom of god which is of course within him he is deprived only of the opportunity to associate with unrepentant sinners and to be contaminated by them if the negro is going to be sorry for anybody he should be sorry for the jim crow pastor who has to crucify christ in order to hold on to his job and the negro should be sorriest of all for the jim crow churchgoer who hasnt got the excuse of having to hold on to his job but is free whenever he wills his own salvation to walk out of the jim crow church and never reenter it if my parents hadnt supposed ghosts to be a melodrama about a haunted house my introduction to ibsen would have been much delayed but on my thirteenth birthday at the brighton beach theatre i saw my first professional production of a playthe ibsen classic starring alla nazimova then and there began my love for theatre and my deep interest in ibsen and his work it was pirandello who said after shakespeare without hesitation i put ibsen first so do i fourteen years after my exposure to ghosts in english and fortified with norwegianenglish dictionaries and grammars i decided to plough through ibsen in the original language all the way from catalina to when we dead awaken the battle was long exhausting and rewarding a twomonth european vacation in allowed two weeks for norway landing in bergen norways second largest city i took one sweeping look at those mountains that surround the city breathed the sharp clean air saw the beautiful harbor alive with boats and stayed the whole two months in the land of the midnight sun armed with a letter of introduction to mr and mrs tancred ibsen given to me by one of my former teachers at the american theatre wing mr romney brent i arrived in oslo several weeks later tancreds father was the son of henrik ibsen and his mother was the daughter of bjornstjerne bjornson hows that for lineage tancreds wife lillebil ibsen is one of norways leading actresses the ibsens gracious and charming introduced me to many of norways leading actors and directors i remember meeting ellen isefiaer and congratulating her for her outstanding production of look homeward angel little did i guess that miss isefiaer would direct me in othello six years later at den nationale scene norways oldest theatre when the vacation ended i returned home to new york bringing with me a great love for norway and its people and a determination to learn to speak norwegian as well as i could read it actually my vacation had been much more than that for in the summer of bjarne andersen artistic administrator of den nationale scene in bergen invited me to play othello there during the spring of happily i was playing the role at the great lakes shakespeare festival and in my spare time had worked on mem orizing it in norwegian when during one performance i noticed a strange expression in iagos laurence luckenbill eyes and heard mutterings in the audience i realized suddenly that i had transposed the norwegian text with shakespeares original the next day i cabled herr andersen my acceptance of his offer to my ears norwegian is somewhere between english and german what it lacks in vocabulary it more than makes up for in the intricacy of its phrasing and inflection tonefall at the beginning of the run playing othello in norwegian was like shifting gears i was sometimes tempted to think in english while playing in norwegian and that would have been disastrous because my norwegian tonefall would have as a result gone straight out of the window but as the run went on playing in norwegian seemed quite natural and i actually wondered what it would be like to play othello in english again othello at den nationale scene the national stage was the most wonderful experience of my life under ellen isefiaers inspired direction the production was swift clear and exciting lasting two hours and fortyfive minutes with one long intermission after iagos i am your own forever jeg er for alltid deres per fjelds set was simple yet evocative three arches and three platforms of varying heights all mounted on a revolve which allowed great freedom in choice of playing areas pers colorful rich costumes and his wonderfully imaginative light plot worked like a charm we ran for two months playing every night including sundays to packed houses i shall never forget those warm receptions the norwegians may stem from the vikings but their enthusiasm is anything but polar i shall never forget per theodor haugens superb iago anne gullestads beautiful desdemona heartrendingly moving in her last scene and astrid schwabs warm beautifully spoken emilia i shall never forget our last performance after which bjarne andersen unveiled a bronze bust of me as othello which was placed at the top of one of the staircases in the foyer of the theatre just across from a bust of henrik ibsen woweeee even though norway is a small country in terms of its population a little over three and a half million people the theatre is and has for a long time been in the mainstream of norways cultural life the beautiful theatre buildings themselves radiate permanence and importance when you enter them every visit to the theatre is an occasion for the norwegian he is proud of his theatre most norwegian theatres are subsidized by both the national and municipal governments for example nationaltheatret and det norske teatret in oslo den nationale scene in bergen and the trondelag teater in trondheim are subsidized the government has no artistic say in the doings of the theatre but it does encourage the theatre to pay its own way as much as possible for example a theatre can receive a larger sum in subsidy from the government if it has played to per cent or more of capacity during a season the actor signs as a rule a twoyear contract at one of these theatres which can be cancelled at the end of that time by either the actor or the teatersjef artistic administrator who has sovereign sway over the artistic side of the theatrecasting choice of plays etc it is not too much to say that once a norwegian actor has made his mark at a theatre he doesnt have to worry about where his next job is coming from small wonder that i found the norwegian actor less tense about his outlook on his lifes work than the average american actor i was struck too by the versatility of the norwegian actorand versatile hed better be because even the greatest hit cannot run consecutively for more than three or four months the population of oslo for example is a little over half a million this means that a new production must be ready to take over every two months most of the time however the norwegian theatre plays in repertory per theodor haugen rehearsed a radio play from to am then rehearsed iago from to pm and then at played bill in kiss me kateall on the same day the average production is rehearsed for two monthsfour hours a day am to pm according to the rules of norwegian actors equity mention must certainly be made here of the riksteatret which tours professional productions all over norway even bringing theatre to towns and villages with only three or four hundred inhabitants and norway remember is a very long country flip it over and it would reach all the way to sicily the ibsen tradition is of course woven into the fabric of norwegian theater productions of his plays are heatedly discussed long after they have closed the norwegian actor measures his talents against the characters of ibsen much as we measure ours against the creations of shakespeare the heartwarming affection of the norwegian people must leave its mark on any man and bring with it the desire to reciprocate in kind to show them that we too know and love our theatre and have a heritage perhaps one day a company of norwegian actors will come to new york and play ibsen for us in their own language we would understand it i am sure meanwhile this actor is especially grateful to den nationale scene and to our own state department which made my travel possible mississippis freest man s not the prettiest town in the ij mississippi delta eso d pecially in the autumn icom glare of a long drouth with dirty cotton curls from a bumper crop edging the curbs and gutters like dust still the streets are wide and the green and gracious trees sometimes nearly meet across them and among neighborhoods of drab little houses and new modern ones there are occasional old columned places whimsical victorian houses and gardens and lawns redolent of spacious antebellum white living tended by dear and deferential darkies downtown several wide streets crossed by second and third streets is undistinguished with a movie theater cafes office buildings glasswindowed shops and the redandgold woolworths but pleasant with amiable and softspoken people who nod and smile at strangers still there is a mildly prosperous white sheen of business uptodate facades and bright new fashions including spots of mink here and there in the stores so going east on issaquena street crossing third and moving under the viaduct to the negro section one finds the dingy secret ramshackle look of darktown marked and immediate here live negroes more than half of clarksdales total population of there is a block of dusty crowded darkwindowed buildings which seem grown togethersecondhand clothing stores used furniture marts blindfaced cafes and one comparatively gleaming drug store with bright glass and chrome front and a sterile and immaculate array of new wares inside fourth street the hub of negro downtown crosses this poor and squalid block with another succession of hidden offices cafes and the fourth street drug store the fourth street drug store its windows halffilled with drug advertisements sundries and posters proclaiming vote for freedom and aaron henry for governor is crammed with a fountain jammed center shelves and two other counters lining the big room behind them is a narrow office space the width of the store walled with drug supplies and cut off by another breasthigh counter in the drug store it was dim crowded and closelooking like the rest of the street but when aaron henry looked up from the counter of his office smiled and spoke in quick cordiality the place expanded brightened and hummed with life his smooth nearly black face round and gently receding under a wide nose and mouth opened with the sweet eager look of a man who likes everybody who will let him and his vivid voice rose in welp come owner of the drug store mississippi president of the national association for the advancement of colored people and candidate for governor of mississippi henry who is fortyone years old looked to me like the freest fellow id seen in a long hot dustplagued journey through mississippi and after we had talked for an hour i figured he is the freest man in mississippi notwithstanding his rigid segregation house and store bombings and shootings threats law suits jail sentences and other white persecutions indeed his white neighbors have done everything that mississippians can do to a nonviolent negro revolutionary trying to lead his people to the ballot except kill him they might have done that henry has heard last june when medgar evers mississippi field secretary for the naacp was shot in the back and killed i heard it was a flip of the coin decided whether it would be medgar or me he said with a shrug i was in texas making a speech anyway we totted up the attacks on the henry family in the last two years trying to record every intimidation damage and threat since his leadership in the statewide negro drive but he couldnt remember every one and the repeated terrors became tedious his home a pleasant and comfortable frame house in a grassy neighborhood a mile or so beyond the fourth street district has been shot at three or four times bricks and homemade bombs have broken his store windows half a dozen times he pointed up to a rectangular hole in the ceiling as yet unrepaired since the last bomb attack when he was meeting with friends in the back of the store shortly after the first such evidences of white displeasure over henrys interest in negro voting his insurance policies were cancelled after a long saturday at the store our busiest dayin march a year ago henry left for a meeting with freedomstruggling friends at a funeral parlor and then went home we ate dinner he recalled and turned on the hit parade rebecca his young daughter and i were dancing and fooling around and then i undressed to get some rest before i started out again noelle mrs henry lay on the bed beside me and rebecca came back and said daddy somebodys flashing lights around the front and i said its nothing baby dont pay any attention to it i didnt want her to get scared then she came in and said somebody was at the door and noelle went and came back to the bedroom and said ben collins the chief of police wanted me i put on a robe and went to the front and he said he had to take me in i asked him what for and he said he didnt know so he followed me to the bedroom and stood there while i dressed he took me to headquarters and i still didnt find out the charge then he drove me to bolivar county and locked me up and next morning i was hit with this morals charge i was supposed to have picked up this white boy a hitchhiker on the highway and asked him to get me a white woman when he said he couldnt then they said i made advances to him i tell you i really blew my top collins and dave pearson the coahoma county solicitor were there i said along with some cussin language collins you cooked this up they just took my cussin and didnt say a word shortly however chief collins and pearson sued henry for libel not apparently for his explosive epithets but for saying they had framed him pearson got a judgment and collins a one neither has made any effort to collect but collins has approached henry to let him insure his life a proposition which he rejected can you imagine henry asked his high forehead wrinkled in wonderment the gall my life wouldnt be worth two cents henry was convicted of the morals charge on the word of a transient teenage white boy despite testimony of witnesses who were with henry on the afternoon he was alleged to have picked up the hitchhiker then the state court of appeals reversed the verdict a few days later the court of appeals reversed its own judgment after henry says pressure from state politicians the case is now on appeal to the u s supreme court henry recovered from his shock and disgust at the charge and convictions wtih the resilient tolerance and unfaltering fight which seem to sustain him in his leadership and with a perspective which convinces him that every pain and loss in the struggle advances the negro cause a philosophical stoicism with a broad streak of humor has inured all three of the henrys to the daily telephone calls with threats of death obscene insults and such fanciful falsehoods as that of a man who told rebecca your daddys dead and down at the funeral home little rebecca with equal spirit sasses and scoffs at the callers mrs henry amuses herself by quoting scripture to the anonymous enemies or promising to pray for them one wonders if all of white clarksdale approves and supports the savagery of police and vigilante attacks on the henrys and their colleagues we havent got one white friend in clarksdale henry said in brief and bigeyed sorrow but then as if he were obliged to remember white fears and difficulties to save himself from rage and despair he shrugged and explained that is no white man who can come out publicly they got their problems it aint easyyou know businesses jobs families pressures of course theres hal brownstein of the seed company works for the city park commission he makes sure the negroes have some balls to play with and horseshoes to throw a nice fella the paternalistic kind of thing a lot of em come by here one at a time and tell me quietly theyre sorry theyre ashamed and express sympathy but nobody can lift a hand or speak out for us the carr boy who threw a bomb in my house came by and told me he was ashamed and asked me to forgive him if i could he said he didnt know the boy he was driving had a bomb for my house the boy had told him he wanted to collect some money from me young carr said when the boy threw the molotov cocktail there wasnt anything he could do but drive him off i said sure i forgive you no hard feelings henry seemed disturbed like a man with a fresh wound that throbs through his efforts to ignore it at the recent killing of ernest gells and the unanimous indifference of the white community the police take credit for the shooting gellsa boy twentyone not in the freedom struggle never had an arrest or any recordgot in an argument about a banana at the fair deal grocery store a white mans store in the negro section as i understand it the white man broke for his gun and gells ran out of the store the grocer began shooting and the police took up the chase and shot at him too the boy had several holes in him anyway he died they tell the fantastic tale that gells had a rifle pointing it at the grocer can you figure a colored boy going to a white grocer for a banana with a rifle on him anyway we filed fifteen or twenty affidavits from witnesses on what happened and sent copies to local businessmen we didnt hear a word from a one of em henrys most recent encounter with the clarksdale law was on the occasion of an august march of eightysix negroes including boys and girls as young as fourteen on the city hall a demonstration against the entire system of segregation which reflects itself in continued abuse of the negro population police ordered them to disperse which they did not and all were arrested for parading without a permit henry got nine days and was put to tipping garbage a chore he assumed with his customary humor and ebullience to the wry laughter of freedomfighting negroes over the deep south and his clarksdale constituents and presumably to the gratification of ruling whites the henrys seem quite unafraid rebecca a golden brown blackeyed little girl rolypoly like many twelveyearolds dimples as the henrys laugh at the grisly telephone calls mrs henry a gravemannered young woman with a rare and pretty smile did get nerv ous when medgar evers was killed up until then i would just laugh she recalled i had thought of it that way as just insults and some attacks but not much danger and i wasnt necessarily scared but after medgar was killed one woman kept calling and telling me my husband would be next so she extracted from aaron the promise that he would never go out alone after dark armed friends now take turns guarding their house at night henry talked thoughtfully to me of his life his awakening to his passion for freedom and equality and his faith in the negro movement i was born right here in coahoma county on a farm we worked hard as childrenhoeing planting and picking and going to school it was happy childhood lots of outdoors and hard work and we didnt know about anything else my first heartbreak about this race thing came when i was six years old my best friend was a little white boy i played with constantly we were inseparable and i loved him with all my heart his family lived near us and we visited back and forth and they tell me our mothers would leave us at each others houses as babies and that sometimes my mother would nurse him and sometimes his mother would nurse me well when time came to go to school they told me we couldnt go together that was just how it was he had to go to a white school and i had to go to the negro school i cried and cried and i reckon he did too i think i didnt realize the negro thing but just that wed be separated but as soon as school was out hed run right to my house and we spent all the rest of the time together hes out in california now and we keep in touch christmas cards and that kind of thing henry remembers the inspiration of a high school teacher who talked of negro rights democracy and american equality shed give us books to read like richard wrights black boy and persuaded the senior class to join the naacp his interest in history in high school and college also illumined the negro situation for him and fired him with a resolve for justice and liberation he spent two years in the army in world war ii in california and the south pacific after his service he met this chick here at a methodist vacation bible school program a slender quiet girl the color of dark honey and she really got me they were married after he finished xavier university in new orleans with a degree in pharmacy and returned home to open a drug business with a friend later he started his own business which became a rendezvous for colored youngsters and a headquarters for the clarksdale freedom movement at xavier he was awakened and stimulated by his scientific studies more history some sociology philosophy and literature and particularly by the friendship of a nun whom the students called sister bill some of the negroes hadnt had the preparation for college work he recalled and shed take us on to tutor us and fill us in so we could keep up whenever we got in any trouble academic or any other kind we could count on sister bill going to bat for us and if we couldnt pay for lessons it didnt matter shed keep on working with us a zestful methodist and a leader of haven methodist church henry is chairman of its social concerns group and his study and programs in this methodist effort also have sharpened his commitment and sped his crusade for freedom he believes in god with easy convictionoh surebut not in the sense of a pipeline up there not that kind of stuff wistfully but also in a tone of affirmation as if to remind himself that good things may be possible again he remembers easy days in clarksdale before the supreme court decision a time of fond and free friendship with whites a deep south anomaly now destroyed in white fear and oppression for former negro friends sure we associated he said wed get together at each others homes sometimes we even took the kids and visited back and forth but not any more during the recent gubernatorial campaign in which democratic candidate paul b johnson vowed to k o kennedy and preserve white domination against federal interference and republican candidate rubel phillips repudiated past liberalism and as loudly defied negro aspirations and federal law the negro freedom ballot campaign conceived by a federation of the civil_rights organizations in mississippi advanced aaron henry for governor and reverend edwin king a young white methodist chaplain and dean of students at negro tougaloo college near jackson for lieutenantgovernor the night i heard henry speak to negroes and a sprinkling of whites at jackson amid the harsh noise of the white campaigns and against the dark backdrop of statewide negro persecution he sounded like an insouciant sort of saint a massive bellvoiced old brown minister reverend r l smith introduced henry with some highminded remarks of his own we are not fighting alone and will not win alone we dont hate anybody we try to love everybody we hate the lies and doubledealing that are going on against us we are grateful for every decent man white or black and thank god for a few nativeborn mississippians who are with us it is a new day in mississippi for here is a nativeborn white american reverend edwin king who says he wants freedom for all there is something great in aaron henrya man willing to walk out and take a stand for you and me who served time on the chain gang and that didnt stop him the kind of man who made america great mississippi needs such a governor she wont be ashamed of who wont stand in the door but who stands at the door and beckons all men to come in henry dark dapper and smiling rose and hailed the intimidations and difficulties the reverend king has sufferedwhich are in fact considerable including jail and abuse in jackson for demonstrating with negroes he also praised robert moses his campaign manager a young new york negro now nearly three years in mississippi working for voter registration and head of the council of federated organizations national and local civil_rights groups joined in the struggle to vote moses a victim of many beatings and jailings himself is henry said fool enough or brave enough or whatever you want to call it to run this campaign and the way he works me he must have been my granddaddys slave driver on june th henry continued swiftly and solemnly one of the best friends i ever had had his life snuffed out by a coward who waited in the bushes and shot him in the back he fell his full six feet two inches and he carried us exactly six feet and two inches down the road to freedom we will never have to replace or gain again that six feet and two inches because medgar evers carried us that far with his life weve worked hard to secure the rights were now applying for candidate henry said because for generations we worked all year for nothing today we want our payment when the white businessmen say negroes dont pay taxes well if theyd pay us the overall wage due us theyd live forever tax free henry spoke emotionally of our terrific love for this country of ours and pointed out that black people in africa secured their freedom by driving the white people out when we secure the freedom which is ours he promised to applause our white brothers and sisters will be right here with us with emphasis and applause he declared the freedom vote is a vote for the right to vote and a political reform by which you can make a senator javits of senator eastland he espoused the cause of love for white and black brothers and sisters and said we have no prejudice against white people because theyre white we cant get to firstclass citizenship by such secondclass means we cannot live in yesterday we forgive the white men for their past we want equality and freedom for all of us upstairs after the meeting a dozen youngsters clapped danced and sang freedom songs laughing the black boys began the old spiritual im gonna sit at the welcome table bye and bye and concluded with the mississippi version vm gonna marry barnetts daughter bye and bye man one boy bent over in mirth his daughter she bout thirtyeight years old in meetings throughout his campaign henry pointed out that in a close race the to negro votes could decide the election the negro freedom ballot campaign plan was for registered negroes to write in henry and king on the official state ballots thus voiding them under mississippi law once we withdraw our votes henry explained and the man who loses figures that if wed voted for him hed have won then the next time hell do something to get those votes of ours henrys big appeal however was for the freedom vote a straw ballot of to which would show the country and the state that mississippi negroes will vote if they let us of mississippis persons are negro with a sixty per cent majority in the delta if we get a civil_rights bill with protection for voting we can change this whole state henry fervently predicts weve had more than fifty mass meetings around the state over this thing yes ive had a ball i enjoy campaigning and the crowds and enthusiasm weve got this organization now from districts right on down to city blocks we know every negro voter thats registered and all the campaign workers and well keep our eyes on the election now and this campaign is aimed at a lot of uncommitted congressmen people from north and south dakota utah other states up there without any negroes if we show them what were up against and that this dixiecrat crowd doesnt represent mississippi then we may get their votes on the civil_rights bill if we get set back on the civil_rights billhenry looked worriedi dont know therell be a reaction therell be more of the black muslim psychology infiltrating and we cant defend against it no we dont have any black muslims now he laughed freedom in mississippi sure i believe in it henry declared with earnest emphasis we can turn this state upside down and really have us a place to live in and be proud ofa place for everybody jobs education equality freedom and politicians who represent all the people that we wont be ashamed of the white folks will be free too i think well be through this thing sooni give it four or five years will they get me he mused undismayed as if he had considered the question many times and come to terms with it well i find if you keep on standing up to em they arent as rough on you i feel like things have eased up a little for me but if you take a stand and then let em cow you down they got you sure i might die you got to be prepared for that but i figure medgars death advanced us twenty years in negro support and white reaction it was one of the biggest shocks the state of mississippi ever had why they couldnt even have a parade in jackson until medgars death and then or negroes walked in that memorial procession what few concessions weve got in jackson his death brought about if i get killedso everything contributes said henry a man of faith and freedom the november freedom vote with ballot boxes on the plantations in town and country churches in poolrooms and votemobiles pulled some mock votes from disenfranchised negroes many of them henry jubilantly noted from black cottonpickers heretofore scared even to write their names down three weeks of campaigning also gave us an organization so we got our hands on every registered voter and nearly every negro who wants to vote here clearly is a formidable group of politically potent citizens awaiting their liberation and negro mississippians and furtive white liberals figure it gave them henry an engaging politician of highminded promise for soul brothers emancipation proclamation four score and like f y twentyone years ago the bearded white father moved in on the happenings with a new pact hung up in human dignity and cut out on the pattern that all soul brothers and soul sisters drop off the balls and chains now we are caught up in a great big hassle testing whether our group like the ofay group should have a right to latch on to some justice and freedom we have won victories to that effect like in the law courts we have got eyes to throw out the laurels for those who went to their last lay down pad blowing the horn for integration its crazy man crazy that were on this kick but in an offbeat sense we cant make out we cant clue in we cant even talk up this jazz the freedom fighters with us and down under who slaved here have sounded off too nice for us to ever add our say the segregationists are not hip to this bit and they dont dig this talk we talk but like its for us the freedom bound to grab up the horn and keep on blowing like its rather for us to keep jamming the sounds and beating the rhythms which those longgone rights leaders gigged and wailed that from these wayout characters we jump up to the cause for which they went and blew their gaskets that we here riff the tune that these crucified soul brothers shall not have got wasted in vain that this nation under equality shall ever more be swinging and that a jazzy new group of freedom fighters of the members by the members and for the members shall not cut out from the scene by william melvin kelley the barbershop was t warm enough to make carlyle bedlow sleepy and smelled of fragrant shaving soap a fat man sat in the great chair his stomach swelling beneath the striped cloth standing behind him in a white hairlinted tunic which buttoned along one shoulder garland the barber clacked his scissors garlands hair was well kept his sidebums cut off just where his wire eyeglasses passed back to his ears hello carlyle how you doing he looked over the tops of his glasses so you decided to let me make a living huh yes sir carlyle smiled he liked garland taking advantage of bronx misery sir mean when folks is having trouble getting their cars dug out you making money shovelling bronx snow oh yes sir garland was always teasing him because carlyles family had moved recently from harlem to this neighborhood in the bronx he maintained carlyle thought the bronx was full of hicks okay youre next ill take some of that snow money from you he returned to the fat mans head carlyle leaned his shovel in the corner stamped his feet took off his jacket sat down in a wirebacked chair and picked up a comic book he had already read it and put it down to watch the barber shave the fat mans neck with the electric clippers the fat man who had been talking when carlyle came in continued cant see why hed want to do that can you garland but aint that just like a nigger he was very dark the skin under his chin was heavily pocked and scarred and just like a white woman too man these cats marry some colored girl when they starting out just singing in joints and dives she supports him while hes trying to get ahead but then he gets a hit record or a job at the waldorf and bingohe drops her quick gets a divorce and marries some white bitch white chicks know where its at they laying in wait for him when he makes it theyll cut in on a good thing every time anyway it wont last a year and you can quote me on that garland finished cutting great patches of hair from the mans head and started to shape the back a short lightskinned negro opened the door and leaned in hello garland he did not close the door and cold wind blasted in around him say man how you doing you after the boy there all right he continued to work hardly looking at the head in front of him he could cut hair blindfolded the short man nodded and closed the door behind him he removed his coat put his gloves carefully into a pocket sat down and stretched only then did he take off his hat his hair was straight and black he did not seem to need a haircut i read in the amsterdam how mister cool and his white sweetie finally got shackled yes sir we just talking about that garland reached behind him touched a switch and from an aluminum box lather billowed into his palm aint that just like a negro and like a white bitch too the fat man added dont trim the sideburns just around the ears ill trim the sideburns myself garland nodded man i seen the same thing happen a thousand times a negro making more money than a white man starting to act foolish like a white man even though he should know better i guess it aint really that negros fault all his life he been poor and a nobody garland put the lather behind the fat mans ears so as soon as he gets some money its bound to mess up his mind dont touch the sideburns garland the fat man shifted un der the striped sheet yeah i think you right and them white bitches is waiting to ambush him the short man folded his thin arms across his chest well dont all a colored mans problems begin with mister charlie and miss mary mostly when miss mary wants to make time with her nigger chauffer or handyman and mister charlie finds out about it he dont blame miss mary for it thats sure the fat man leaned forward garland stopped shaving reflecting mostly when you find some white woman being nice to you nicer than she ought to be then watch out he started to shave behind the fat mans ears them white women know where its at the short man nodded yeah but i cant see why no colored mand want to marry no white chick on purpose like mister cool did not when theres so many fine spade chicks around garland agreed i like my wornen the way i like my coffee hot strong and black the fat man jerked his head i guess he thinks he taking a step up now he thinks he better than all the other boots standing on the comer hes got himself a white recording contract with a big white company and a booking at a fine white nightclub and a white cadillac and an apartment on park avenue painted all white and a white bitch too why man he almost white himself except for one thing he still a nigger they all laughed uproariously slapping their thighs it seemed much colder with his hair cut short his neck shaved clean carlyle trudged flatfooted planting his feet firmly so as not to slip up the middle of the carless street through the shadows cast by the snowclogged trees he wished he could go home take off his wet shoes listen to records and read the paper that each night his father carried home tucked under his arm he knew too that the later it got the angrier his father would be his father liked to eat as soon as he came home besides his father would want him or his little brother to clear their own driveway and carlyle had not asked to take the shovel he decided then walking along the rutted street he would not waste his time with small jobs he would look for a long snowbanked walk of a house set way back from the street this is what he finally found down a solitary sidestreet lit faintly by a single streetlamp at the middle of the block the house set back on a short hill that surely in the spring and summer would be a thick lawn perhaps bordered with flowers snow clung to the empty blackened branches of a hedge concealing a grotesque iron fence the house too was grotesque painted gray its gables hung with daggerlike icicles he hesitated a moment looking up at the house there did not seem to be any light burning and he did not want to wade twenty or thirty teet through shindeep snow to find no one at home going further on up the sidewalk he found a lighted window down the side near the back and he returned to the gate and started up the drifted walk the porch was wood and clunked hollow when he stamped the snow from his feet he climbed the steps gingerly and peered at the names on the doorbell if there was a mans name he still might not find workwomen living alone or old couples more usually needed someone to clean snow there was a womans nameelizabeth reubenand a mans too but his which was typed had been recently crossed out with a thick smeared angry pencil slash carlyle rang the bell no longer walking his feet got cold very quickly and when after what seemed a long while the door openedand then only a crack he was hopping from one foot to the other yes what is it he could see a nose and one eye could hear a womans voice miz reuben he slurred the miss or missus so as not to insult her either way yes would you like to have your walk shoveled he moved closer and spoke to the nose and eye there was a pause while she looked him over up and down and inspected the shovel he held in his hand no im sorry i dont think so well uh there was nothing else to say he thanked her and turned away wait it sounded almost like a scream and then softer young man wait he turned back and found the door swung wide the nose and eye had grown to a small plumpish white woman of about forty in a pale blue wool dress she was not exactly what he would have called pretty but she was by no means a hag she was just uninteresting looking her hair was a dull brown combed into a style that did her no good her eyes were flat and gray like cardboard on second thought young man i think it would be nice to have my walk cleaned off im expecting some visitors and it will make it easier for them to find me she smiled at him but come inside you must be frozen solid walking around in all this snow and cold thats all right maam ill start right away he took a step back and lifted his shovel you do as i say and come in the house this very moment she was still smiling but there was enough of a mothers tone in her voice to make him walk past her through the door which she closed behind him rest your coat and shovel there and follow me im taking you into the kitchen to put something warm into your stomach he did as she ordered and walked her down the hall lit by a lowwatt bulb in a yellowing shade the first thing he noticed was that the kitchen smelled of leaking gas there was a huge pile of rags and bits of cloth on the table in the center of the room there were more rags on the window sill and stuffed at the bottom of the back door she saw him looking at them its an old house it gets very drafty she smiled nervously wringing her hands now are you old enough to drink coffee or would you rather have hot chocolate he had remained on his feet she bustled to the table and swept the rags onto the floor with her arm sit down please he did now what would you rather have hot chocolate please hot chocolate good thats better for you she headed toward the stove almost running it was big and oldfashioned with a shelf for salt and pepper above theburners whats your name dear carlyle maam carlyle bedlow carlyle did you know you were named after a famous man no maam i was just named after my father his names she was laughing shrilly unhappily he had said something funny but did not know what it was it made him uneasy what dear you started to say something i interrupted you nothing maam he was wondering now what he had said and why she was being so nice giving him hot chocolate maybe she was giving him the hot chocolate so she could talk to him about things he did not understand and laugh at his ignorance it was just like the men in the barbershop said most of a colored mans trouble began with white people they were always laughing and making fun of negroes do you like your hot chocolate sweet carlyle i can put some sugar in it for you behind her voice he could hear the milk sizzling around the edges of the saucepan could hear the gas feeding the flame yes maam i like it sweet the milk sizzled louder still as she poured it across the hot sides into his cup she brought it and sat across from him on the edge of her chair waiting for him to taste it he did so and found it good with his minds eye he followed it down his throat and into his stomach is it good her gray eyes darted across his face yes maam she smiled and seemed pleased that puzzled him if she had him in to laugh at him why was she so anxious to get him warm why did she want him to like the hot chocolate there had to be some other reason but just then the chocolate was too good to think about it he took a big swallow well now lets get down to business ive never had to hire anybody to do this before i used to do it myself when i was younger and then there was a man here whod do it for me but hes not here anymore she trailed off caught herself how much do you usually get for a stoop and walk that long she smiled at him again it was a fleeting smile which warmed the corners of her mouth and left her eyes sad ive been very nice to you i should think youd charge me less than usual so that was it she wanted him to do her walk for practically nothing white people were always trying to cheat negroes he had heard his father say that cursing the jews in harlem he just stared at her hating her she waited an instant for him to answer then started to figure out loud well lets see thats a long walk and theres the sidewalk and the stoop and the steps and its very cold and i probably cant get anyone else its a question of too little supply and a great deal of demand she was talking above him again id say id be getting off well if i gave you five dollars she stopped and looked across at him helplessly does that sound fair i really dont know he continued to stare but now because he could hardly believe what she said at the most he would have charged only three dollars and had expected her to offer one she filled in the silence yes five that sounds right he finished his chocolate with a gulp but maam i wouldnta charged you but three really three that doesnt sound like enough she bolted from the table and advanced on him well ill give you the extra two for being honest perhaps you can come back and do something else for me she swooped on him hugged and kissed him the kiss left a wet cold spot on his cheek he lurched away surprised knocking the cup and saucer from the table the saucer broke in two the cup bounced rolled lopsided and crazy under the table no maam he jumped to his feet im sorry maam thats all right its all right im sorthats all right about the saucer she scrambled to her knees and began to pick up the pieces and the cup once she had them in her lap she sat staring away at nothing shaking her head now he knew for certain what she was up to he remembered what garland had said when you find some white woman being nicer than she ought to be then watch out she wanted to make time with him he started from the kitchen maybe he could leave before it was too late wait young man she stood up ill pay you now and you wont have to come inside when youre through she pushed by him and hurried down the shadowy hallway he followed her as before but kept his distance her purse was hanging on a peg on the coatrack next to his own jacket she took them both down handed him his jacket averting her eyes and fumbled in her purse produced a wallet unzipped it pulled out a bill and handed it to him but its a five maam he could not understand why she wanted to pay him that much now that he was not going to make time with her she looked at him for the first time her eyes wet i told you id pay you five didnt i yes maam all right do a good job and remember dont come back yes maam you let yourself out she started to the back of the house even before he had finished buttoning his jacket by the time he opened the door she was far down the hall and as he closed it behind him and stepped into the dark twinkling cold he could hear her in the kitchen she was tearing rags the next evening the white woman was in the newspaper a boy trying to deliver a package had found her in the gasfilled kitchen slumped over a table piled high with rags carlyles father who saw it first mentioned it at dinner had a suicide a couple blocks from here he told who and where carlyle sat staring at his plate his father went on white folks man if they had to be colored for a day theyd all kill theyselves we wouldnt have no race problem then white folks dont know what hard life is whats wrong junior she was a nice lady his parents and his little brother looked at him you know her junior his mother put down her fork she was a nice lady mama i shovelled her walk yesterday she give me five dollars oh junior his mother sighed five dollars his father leaned forward crazy huh have some respect his mother turned on his father angrily carlyle looked at his mother are white people all bad theres some good ones aint there mama of course junior his mother smiled what made you think sure there is junior his father was smiling too the dead ones is good a black poet in europe beyond the time and space of this small cafe in paris there lies a world which threatens to steal my manhood that is why i am in paris at this hour while i speak my roots ache inside of me through my day and throughout nightfall i walk the streets of paris alone among throngs of chattering people i glimpse faces of others who need paris as much as i do we have gathered and gathered our tender pieces of flesh and come down and away from that intoler able paramount of a homeland dying from things symbols and sorrow we have descended to paris to her warm sun to this cafe from which i write you discovering on some illfated hour the valley of death spread out before us burning our eyes recalling our dreams painting our faces black again sending newer and blanker dark hours we are sitting on rue de saint germain i have counted my francs carefully we wait for the sun to fall it is the flaming height of paris golden hour the paid for moment of a lovely womensummer her cycle all paris is bright and clear we wipe dry our faces and smell the seine the winding streets appear rust brown and dry brownness is everywhere we are the blackbrown jewels found here loved and feared forgetful about what the case was so very very long ago only the healthy looking prostitutes and men from africas loins appear contented in the evening when we have tasted our fill in loneliness we shall drift back to our rooms strip laugh broadmouthed at the heat think of home our separate harlems of fun rejoice at our good fortune then sleep and hope to dream of places dark men and women poverty race hatred sweet waters our mothers humming intermittent spirituals a white man enters a door we dream heavy this man is our father killed and love singing his way through our lives an emasculated shadow pleased to be alive we shall grow to love him in our hate he is our father and our blood fathers are without genuine sons a short hour passes we arise and walk several miles the nerve center of paris is human life human possibility begins anew for us and this is the difference between a walk at home and a walk here anything can happen in europe at home you return to bare the bareness of empty closets and cheaply papered walls long bright cars outside kitchen smells of greens and blackeyed peas here then you are or want to be here is paris dreamed of your previous life blacked out no blackness here no nigger no postfreudian words to examine you and the burden of your sorrow becomes furiously free only the loss of a passport dare destroy you now we are still sitting on the rue de saint germain i have counted my francs carefully for the second time there is enough left for a round of vin i find difficult to pronounce i am still waiting for the sun to fall soon my guest will begin to drift away in paris one buys drinks for friends and strangers alike my hotel is located three blocks away for a few dollars a day i survive its aura of lunacy high school french has no meaning here only the language separates our souls it dawned upon me before leaving america that a language problem would exist and in many places throughout europe i would be alone i rather fancied the idea considered it a part of my roundtrip ticket as a tourist and potential expatriate the rules did not apply to me i thought in the new and exciting labyrinthines of the olde world i would be no more the stranger than in the last europeans prefer presliced bread to no bread at all but they can survive especially in paris on no bread at all bread served hot or cold round square oblong diced in america we failed to incorporate into the charter of european tradition we politely stole a concern for ingredients bread is bread man is alone we dare not mix our religion and historical experience with food nor anything else our faith is built into things god help us in europe especially in small villages bread is a way of life in america i had a number and size some few friends some bad ones some hard times i never supposed that europes mystique would descend upon me like an all cleansing angel and deliver me from paying my dues or experiencing my fate at the foot of her cross admitted i was naive one reads a thousand prospectuses before embarking i went one step farther and researched quite extensivelyeven to the point of reading literature exclusively written by men of color who came same as i looking for solidarity or any of the tools of communication that americas inhumanity fails to offer the black man nailed to her wall i hungered for bread the sun finally falls and i write quickly the gargon comes to add a franc to my check for it is past six oclock and the price of vin goes up incidentally have you tasted american bread lately the one bad odor in paris smells of money the rat race exists there tenfold paris is hell when hunger sets in the streets talk back to you children run through the alleys of your childhood mercy like existence precedes essence a first trip abroad can be termed hot or cold but always and always the king is dead you are free the strange thing about paris is that people do emerge from places one does not ordinarily expect people to emerge from they fall out of the woodwork africans africans i look about me now count them by fives we are located at the first table so to speak evening has arrived you can tell it by car horns grunts and groans by extra gargons quickly snapping on vests the lack of children in the streets above all the steady downpour of americans there are richlooking americans poorlooking ones like me more of them than any others the french are not unaware of us the poor ones we are all rich to them true to their hollywood legend there is no protestant face or jewish face or catholic face or negroid face the faces are parisian until you find out better i understand now and only as of this moment why proust and gide and longlost oscar wilde peered into paris limpid blue eyes only to find white pearls from limbo henry miller found real bread how can one hope to explain paris there is a point of demarcation that is all one could possibly hope to do with mere words with a camera she comes alive even then her pores tighten up we must come we must taste of her or remain unborn to our desires i am writing you all sorts of gewgaw which de gaulle knows you dont need to hear my intention was to fulfill a promise i made to you some time ago and to let you know that your poetry follows me as i go marching happily along was that a song i have a copy of annie allen with me at times she has been my manumission baldwin had bessie smith i have annie richard had mississippi the gargon cleans my table for the third time several au revoirs have been exchanged the others fled i am destined to pay an extra franc because this letter makes my day meaningful this evening much later on i look forward to hearing gordon heath sing you may remember him from broadway some years ago he runs a small club with just enough room for artistry with a voice worth much more cash in the states if things were not the way they are tonight promises to be my first early trip on other occasions i arrived too late or much too full of apathy a franc is worth twenty cents and the french have a way of not letting you forget what you are worth without their precious currency i enter my third month in europe and my last in francs i am thinking now of what i shall really think in the future about this longdreamedof trip it germinated in high school followed me like the hound of heaven through college not once have i asked myself how i really got here my salary and budget certainly didnt pull it off certainly both helped but most of the credit lies with that savage resource of guts that only a black boy in america gets a chance to use if at all admitted other minorities have a time of it also but a lot less conspicuous they see us we have learned how to live invisibly yes guts and nothing else but guts o father who are in guts mighty is thou name give us more guts guts for our souls guts for our dreams deliver our tarnished guts from weaker guts and give us enough guts to remake an old world or at least give us enough guts to influence the new one acoming hemingway had nada eliot old sweeney guts for us i stray again forgive me the gargon comes once more slightly irritated deux vins one for me and another to keep the table private do you really want to know what i think about europe have your gifted powers diagnosed my case well let me put it to you another way i dare not ask europa what she thinks about me anyhow to whom would i direct my question certainly not a fellow white american who doesnt know me at home never a european they know too many white lies about us now the ugly americans really prove true to form some negro gis are still requested to show their tails o tis true when i was in the united states army long before my private war i was stationed in georgia i remember my first day offpost proud of my uniform wanting to be noticed because in my pockets i had several white certificates telling me that i had completed without injury or disgrace boot training i knew something about the southland id been there before never like then a man just a guy in uniform without any serious qualms no racial bugaboos cluttered my mind i felt neither northern or biggity black nor white needless i suppose to say to you at least i returned a whimpering naked dehumanized speck of a man ralph ellisons theory of invisibility is one thing aloneness is another nobody really saw me too many soldiers in town little to do with color just too many damn soldiers in town we knew the price of southern coffee we could not buy but we assumed tea was in order color is often times an excuse used to accept defeat quite pleasantly how many black men do you suppose threw the towel in before the verdict reached an impartial jury i became indifferent like any good black soldier would do under similar circumstances during peace time where was the war i dont suppose there was enough misery for us in the world i cant forget that night a strange sense of similarity confronts me now too many of us wear our uniforms in europe they strip us bare and see our souls made of things cars toasters credit cards cheap taste and a profound ignorance of life and liberty far exceeding our wealth i am back in georgia now miller called paris a whore the native son called it salvation i can never call it home i have come to europe to see myself and one quick look is adequate one sees what the camera catches there can be no other freedom a private hell closed for me paris is dead i continue to live and grow paris is dead i arrived one hundred years too late in your poetry blackness rises above mere words we fools we cut our poems out of air in europe particularly in paris we move alone not by choice rather because of consciousness we are aware here the streets move with you her beauty startles you you who had never known what it meant to love a building a piece of stone a painting you who tried to be born loved but failed paris is dead paris is beautiful europe is free im too late in little rock the people bear babes and comb and part their hair parisians stare for hours at things made from clay and paint brick and papr greece lives on this side of the world people plant their souls in things things which have lasted through all the warweary shamed days things which are bound to rise again and again as long as the victims of compulsion and blood choose to survive emerson spoke the truth things rule us in america the parallels in human history bear our sufferings out europe refutes them and offers us her blueveined ancient body upon promise of freedom baldwin has said the road to paris leads home robert frost retorts home is where you go when theres no place else to go whats freedom a taste of bread i still sit quietly on saint germain boulevard memory is born in us perhaps it becomes us after our brief pause upon this massive universe i am quickly losing control of my good thoughts whats good a new age is being bom here i sit uneasy in the role of poet guilty of living the black life hiding my face losing out not even our best poems answer a black mans willing defeat i think of home her unpredictable shores and booker t lincoln washington jones riding the crest of her waves my thoughts conceptualize a bevy of nocturnal and wasted years i think of black men and women who gave up sold out for a home a car an easier role to play what about today how many shall we allow to survive when does the man become a man at what point does his woman shake off the sterile curse of imitation and materialism when does she fight for her children and fortify her man against our own torrent of ignorance and poverty shall we ever taste bread pasternak said gregariousness is the refuge of mediocrity i hate poetry tonight alas i hate poets and ash wednesday belongs to another world fools mere words cannot save us we need another buddha in little rock the people sing sunday hymns like anything with lemon tea and lorna doones for me europe has failed many others like myself shall cross langstons big sea come ashore wet find the road back home some i suppose shall succeed wherever we wander whenever we go as artist boy woman or manthe dream we have of america we take along only our return can return the dream of which we are ourselves the prophet has written the wicked flee when no man pursueth i dare not stay too many things are undone so i look homeward my angel is black we must survive our children must know the truth we must attempt to reach them paris is dead i return home after a long funeral hungry and in need of bread it was miller who called it the prime symbol of life and i am unaware that bread is not enough weve cooked in far too many kitchens to suppose that a panacea lies in flour what brings me home is the will to live beyond my countrys expectation of me and so the story goes on the poems bum flames i read from your little book everyday and i destroy my blues its good to be free temporarily my letter is full of holes please close them up with sympathy and blame those vacuums on my youth ignorance and new born freedom in at the height of the climactic year of the negro revolution the worlds attention was focused for the first time in history on an insignificant little town in maryland called cambridge several times the nation waited nervously caught up in a terrible tension for the city hung perilously on a thread of violence which like a lighted fuse connected to a series of vast ammunition dumps threatened to racial holocausts across the ignite land and at the center of the holdingas it werethe tension lighted match stood a tall angular handsome woman who looked like anybodys sinewy sister but who in effect was the centennial symbol of the emancipated negro woman and it was she who refusing to be mesmerized by logicalsounding platitudes put cambridge in the spotlight by insisting that freedom is not a commodity like a beef roast to be parceled out in pounds and ounces or sold at auction to bidders but a right granted all americans by god and the u s constitution now and forevermore for refusing to sell her birthright and that of ultimately all the people of cambridge and of this nationfor half a loaf of freedom gloria richardson won the enmity of racists and their numerous editorialists everywhere but she also won the everlasting gratitude of all those with vision enough to know that freedom cannot be compromised now a year after cambridge was first catapulted into the world limelight it is relatively quiet and comparatively peaceful there but all the people who in any way were touched by their towns moment of history know that neither the town nor any of them can ever be the same again the negroes however poor or deprived walk a little taller and considerably straighter knowing that they are men and women and that they now have power as well as dignity the whites whether rich or poor racist or otherwise understandperhaps for the first timethat cambridge is not alone their town that they must share its problems its responsibilities and its glories with all those people on the other side of race street in time of course only the archivists will remember gloria richardson those who come after her who reap the rewards of her labors will accept as their just due and rightly sotheir participation in the total life of their community such is the way of things and in sliding into a kind of obscurity gloria richardson will be taking her honored place in a long and illustrious line of negro women who have served their race and their nation above and beyond the call of duty indeed she is only one of a group of valiant leaders who in just the past decade have brought added lustre and importance to the deservedly vaunted image of the negro woman her sistersinstruggle include daisy bates the arkansas lady who led the nine little rock children through the long bitter violent seige at the high school where hate defied even the national guard but eventually surrendered to courage and the business ends of bayonets rosa parks a mild little seamstress with a motherly mien who made up her mind one morning that she was either a woman like any other or else she was nothing at all and when told to move to the rear of a montgomery alabama bus chose to put up her stakes and because of her decision launched the old capitol of the confederacy on its long slow painful journey toward becoming a decent place in which to live diane nash bevel a beautiful broth of a girl who understood as so few like her have ever understood before or are likely to understand again that every single human being in this country who calls himself a negro from insurance magnate to porter from almost white to blackest black is threatened and diminished by any act or law or ruse which arbitrarily withholds from any man any part of his rights as a citizen and as a man and who wrapped her beauty in sackcloth and plunged openeyed into the heart of the racial storm braving the fire hoses and the snarling dogs and filthy jails from nashville to jackson so that the oppressed might know that they are not forgotten and thatto borrow a wellworn phraseall they have to lose are their chains it has been said

they are free in the sense that they are unafraid in the sense that they know what they are doing and are confident that one fine day the nation that now resists their efforts to help it realize its

and along the way he had only one ally one helpmate without whom he would have perished this friend this lover this savior was his woman somehowthrough a strength of character and endurance which seem in restrospect more than human she managed to endow him against all odds in spite of a culture which deliberately demeaned him with a sense of selfrespect and dignity because of her the greatgrandsons of men who were owned by other men and who were never intended to share with their owners the joys and responsibilities of normal family life stand now as paragons of manhood these bright young men of surpassing charity who possess hope and faith in truly admirable measure have brought real meaning to an old and abused concept the concept of love to their country now and to the world they offer examples of how men of all faiths and colors and races may live together in peace and with honor they nobly carry the torch borne so long and so well by their women and why is the negro woman different how did she get to be that way why has her influence on negro men been so great and so farreaching why has her role been so crucial in the struggle for equality the answers to these questions lie in american historyin those chapters few historians dare write so damning and revealing are they of dark and secret places in the american psyche dr e franklin frazier the late author of the definitive book on the negro family helped to explain the negro womans role during the period of slavery the biological tie between the negro mother and her offspring was the only human relationship among the slaves that could not be disregarded altogether he wrote after emancipation when the whole social fabric of life crumbled and the very economic basis of negro existence was destroyed it was the negro woman often alone with her children but always aiding her husband when there was one who made the survival of the negro possible even when the negro men began to assert themselves for a brief period in politics but more especially in the negros independent church organizations and lodges the negro woman became the main support of the institutional life of the negro during the years of strife and struggle of negroes for rights as citizens or even to be treated as mere human beings when negro men were lynched and not permitted to play the nor mal masculine role in an american culture the negro woman achieved a position of dominance and dignity in the lexicon of southern folklore negro branch a popular proposition holds that only white men and negro women have ever been free the freedom of the white man of course was absolute the freedom of the negro woman on the other hand was interpreted in terms of her special role in the societyas a kind of omnipresent guardiangoddess both servant and mistress wetnurse and concubine possessor of a unique power born of an intimacy as terrible as it was tender the white woman mother of her race dwelled in the cloudy sphere of myth imprisoned by the proposition that she was pure while the negro man the black lurking shadow of conscience became the eternal enemy the living breathing hotblooded threat to the regions delicately constructed house of mirrors and to the white mans mastery of his own soul the white mans ascendancy in his own fantasy demanded the degradation of the black man and so it was it was left to the woman of this degraded man to rise to those heights forbidden him and this she did knowing in her great wisdom that the sons of her loins inevitably must rise with her however late or scarred she rose she became mary church terrell the stately district of columbia schoolmarm who at the turn of this century showed a whole generation of embattled young people how to carry the struggle

rich rewards it finds to the courage and determination of the negro woman so quaint really used to git i f tired of miss lucy your people are so quaint it was her allday study look like sometime i

dreamylike an say your people theyre so qu jes that quick miss lucy was gone you know sometime i think i really liked miss lucy but i does think she was quaint south when religious members of the slave community absented themselves from the sinful activities of the more secularly inclined however just as the jordan had changed in the minds of a great many negroes to something immediate and material so these rent parties were no longer sinful but vulgar or at least wasteful i can see my grandfather now making such a pronouncement instead of the fabled existential happy carefree negroes there were now some black people who were interested in what was around them and how to get to it the people who wanted the white mans god had made these same separations in the old societyi am bound for the promised landbut they had long been losing ground in the new cities negroes appeared whose promised land was where they were now if only they could save a little money send the kids to school get a decent place to live the further movement into america and this movement this growing feeling that developed among negroes was led and fattened by a growing black middle class the migration north was of course the main reason for the rise of a black middle class in america since there was in the north that space that the increasing subtlety of the paternalistic society allowed there was greater room for progress but even in the slave society there had been the beginnings of a privileged class of negroes the house servants were extended privileges that were never enjoyed by the majority of field niggers the house nigger not only assimilated massas ideas and attitudes at a more rapid rate but his children were sometimes allowed to learn trades and become artisans and craftsmen these artisans and craftsmen made up the bulk of the black freedmen at the beginning of the civil warthese house servants as i have mentioned were the first to accept the masters religion and were the first black ministers and proselytizers for the new god the christian church in slave times represented not only a limited way into america but as it came to be the center of most of the slaves limited social activities it also produced a new ruling class among the slaves the officials of the church the church officials the house servants and the freedmen were the beginnings of the black middle class which represented and represents not only an economic condition but as is true with any stratum of any society a definite way of looking at the society in which it exists the black middle class from its inception possibly ten seconds after the first africans were herded off the boat has formed almost exclusively around the proposition that it is better not to be black in a country where being black is a liability all the main roads into america have always been fashioned by the members of the black middle class not as products of a separate culture but as vague featureless americans i pointed out earlier why negroes in north america were able to adopt the customs and habits of the masters so much more quickly than their brothers throughout the rest of the americas but still another factor was that from the very beginning of afroamerican culture in north america there have always been negroes who thought that the best way for the black man to survive was to cease being black first it was the stench of africa these aspirant americans wanted to erase then the early history of the negro in america the african gods were thrown into disrepute first and that was easy since they were banned by the whites anyway as always the masses of black men adapted rather than completely assimilated appropriated rather than traded one god or one culture for another the freedmans bureau published none of the secular songs of the negro but only the religious songs and then those that were quite readily recognizable as pickups from pale white protestant hymns it was the growing black middle class who believed that the best way to survive in america would be to disappear completely leaving no trace at all that there had ever been an africa or a slavery or even finally a black man this was the only way they thought to be citizens for the creoles and mulattoes of the south this was easier there was a quickly discernible difference between themselves and their darker brother since it was the closeness of their fathers and mothers to the masters that had produced them in the first place many of the freedmen were mulattoes and many of the mulatto freedmen and gens de couleur even had black slaves themselves but the darker members of the fledgling bourgeoisie had to work out their salvations under much more difficult circumstances the real black bourgeoisie was always lashed irrevocably to the burden of color hence the hopelessness and futility of erasing all connections to the black society when it was always impossible to erase the most significant connection of all many freedmen had moved north even during slavery they made up the majority of the northern black middle class even after the emancipation the movement north brought not only the impoverished masses but also many members of the middle class some because they thought to make an even deeper entry into america some like the church people because they had to follow their flocks or they would be out of luck whole churches moved north and the first thing many of the poor negroes did when they reached that promised land was to pool their meager resources and set up their church again and get their preacher a good place to live the storefront church was a northern phenomenon simply because in the cities these country people found it was impossible to just buy some wood and build a church as they had done in the south and many churches such as the one my parents went to progressed as their members moved up the economic ladder in the industrial north from storefront or apartment to huge albeit quixotic structures the middleclass churches were always pushing for the complete assimilation of the negro into white america middleclass baptist and methodist churches strove with all their might to do away with any of the black appropriations of christianity that rural southern negroes had affected a white christianity was after all the reason for existence of these churches and their directors always kept this in their minds many churches split once they moved north because of conflicts that arose among the members as to whether they wanted the church black or white many of the new emigrants had to set up churches of their own because they were not welcome in the black middleclass churches of the north in the s in beaver falls pennsylvania where my grandfather and his flock moved from alabama they had to build their own the tabernacle baptist church when they found that they were unwelcome in the established black baptist church because they were southerners the black residents of beaver falls wanted nothing to do with the south and its terrible memories of slavery they would cut off their own people to have a go at america the morality of the black middle class was not completely the result of a spontaneous reaction to white america it was also carefully nurtured and cultivated by certain elements of white america behind a great many manifestations of the temperament of the black middle class sits the carefully washed wisdom of the early protestant missionaries who not only founded the black christian churches but also quite consciously instilled the postrenaissance religious dogmas into their new black congregations the educational philanthropies were also attended and shaped in their beginnings by these same missionary elements who sought to show the savage heathens how through thrift prayer and work they might somehow enter into the kingdom of heaven even though it might be through the back door the paradox and perhaps the crudest psychological and cultural imposition of all was the inculcation of this puritan ethos on a people whose most elegant traditions were the complete antithesis of it of course the poor and the unlettered were the last to respond to this gift but the strivers after america the neophytes of the black middle class responded as quickly as they could in effect the way to puritan protestant heaven only existed for the black man who could pretend he was also a protestant and a puritan when the supernatural goal of the society black and white yielded to the more practical positivistic ideals of industrialized twentiethcentury america salvation belonged to those who realized that the worth of man was his ability to make money the black middle class responded to this call as it would to any call that would insure it respectability and prestige and their concomitant privilege but religious or positivist the adjustment necessary for the black man to enter completely into a white american society was a complete disavowal that he or his part of the culture had ever been anything else but american the cruel penalty for this kind of situation is the sociocultural temperament of america today where the very things that have served to erect a distinctive culture on this continent are most feared and misunderstood by the majority of americans but the fact was that by the time of the move north and precipitated in part because of it the oppression the negro knew america capable ofhis indestructible bond with this countryand the space and light he saw it capable of producing sat dictating the narrow path most negroes could travel on their way toward citizenship for negroes the oppression was an historical imperative informing each response they could make to whatever situation the society proposed but their everwidening knowledge of the country and its most profound emotional characteristics made any withdrawal impossible even the poorer negro had moved to the point where he thought perhaps he might one day live in this country as a person of certain economic capability with almost complete disregard of the color of his skin this is a brilliant yet desperately conceived hypothesis but its validity has yet to be demonstrated however the moralreligious tradition of the black middle class is a weird mixture of cultural opportunism and fear it is a tradition that is capable of reducing any human conceit or natural dignity to the barest form of social outrage it is uncomfortably symbolic that there were some negroes absent from the rent and barbecue parties just as it is analogous of the social microcosm that at twelve oclock in the old tin type hall in new orleans around the turn of the century when the ball was getting right the more respectable negroes who did attend went home then bolden played a number called dont go a way nobody and the dancing got rough when the orchestra settled down to the slow blues the music was mean and dirty as tin type roared full blast it was not only the creoles purely political made social response to a negro music but the feeling of the black people themselves that there were things much more important than the natural expression of a vital culture in the north before the migration that hurled all the deepest blacks of southern negro culture into america at large the northern negroes had to a great extent secured themselves a leaky boat of security from these reminders of the slave culture most of the negro population in new york then around had either been born there or had been in the city so long they were fully acclimated they were trying to forget the traditions of the south they were trying to emulate the whites you couldnt deliver a package to a negros front door you had to go down to the cellar door and negroes dressed to go to work they changed into work clothes when they got there you usually werent allowed to play blues and boogie woogie in the average negro middleclass home that music supposedly suggested a low element and the big bands with the violins flutes piccolos didnt play them either one of the funniest and most cruelly absurd situations to develop because of the growth and influence of a definable black middle class in america is the case of black swan records black swan was founded and run by a negro harry pace during the early twenties it was the first negroowned record company in the country and it quickly grew into a moneymaker its success based to a large extent on the popularity of its star performer a young girl named ethel waters black swan also recorded numerous other blues performers and advertised its products as the only genuine colored record others are only passing for colored a wild turnabout but many negroes especially those in business brought pressure on pace to change his position since they thought that the job of a negro recording company would be to show how dignified negroes really were and of course blues were not dignified pace tried to use all kinds of other material that was not strictly blues for this reason ethel waters with her torchy pop style was a godsend but the popularity of the company waned because the audience to which the records were largely aimed did not care as much about the dignity of its musical tastes as the negro business com munity finally black swan was sold to paramount a white company which had no qualms about recording the rougher less dignified blues performers the space the city provided grew quickly vertical the idea of society or at least divisions within a social milieu grew more common among negroes the earlier mulattofreedmanhouse servantfield servant division that became so fixed within the slave society was of course broken down but the new strata forming within the free black societies proved to be equally as rigid the new society based its divisions almost completely upon acquisition reflecting and reacting to the changed psyche of twentiethcentury america in the black society the change was effected almost exclusively by the mass movement north and the openness of the new industrial culture the older stricter divisions of black society based on certain mythological characteristics of colorcaste and the importance of less menial positions within the slave culture were broken down because many field niggers and money men darkskinned africanlooking negroes could go into mr fords factories and make a day just like a white man the white societys need for negro laborers and the resulting scramble into the great northern cities smeared the caste lines of an older black society and began to form a sprawling bourgeoisie based on the pay checkan almost exact duplication of the way in which the earlier caste system of white america was debased but the white society still had some semblance of casteits first families intact although frequently as heads or captains of industry negroes could not become captains of industry and could never have belonged to any first families except perhaps as family retainers so it was the professional mendoctors lawyers ministerswho were the heads of the new black society and these people wanted more than anything in life to become citizens they were not ever satisfied with being freedmen or former slaves they wanted no connection with that stain on americas past and what is more they wanted the right which they thought they could earn by moving sufficiently away from the blacker culture to look on that stain as objectively as possible when they had to and to refer to it from the safety of the basitions of the white middle class they did not even want to be accepted as themselves they wanted any self which the mainstream dictated and the mainstream always dictated and this black middle class in turn tried always to dictate that self or this image of a whiter negro to the poorer blacker negroes the effects of these attempts by the black middle class to whiten the black culture of this country are central to my further discussions on the sociological significance of the changes in negro music but i think it might be useful here to consider also the effects this whitening had in other cultural areas i think it is not fantastic to say that only in music has there been any significant negro contribution to a formal american culture for the most part most of the other contributions made by black americans in the areas of painting drama and literature have been essentially undistinguished the reasons for this tragic void are easy to understand if one realizes one important idea about the existence of any black culture in this country the only negroes who found themselves in a position to pursue some art especially the art of literature have been members of the negro middle class only negro music because perhaps it drew its strength and beauty out of the depths of the black mans soul and because to a large extent its traditions could be carried on by the lowest classes of negroes has been able to survive the constant and willful dilutions of the black middle class and the persistent calls to oblivion made by the mainstream of the society of course that mainstream wrought very definite and very constant changes upon the form of the american negros music but the emotional significance and vitality at its core remain to this day unaltered it was the one vector out of african culture impossible to eradicate it signified the existence of an afroamerican and the existence of an afroamerican culture and in the evolution of form in negro music it is possible to see not only the evolution of the negro as a cultural and social element of american culture but also the evolution of that culture itself the coon shout proposed one version of the american negro and of america bessie smith proposed another swing and bebop as i shall attempt to point out propose still another but the point is that both these versions are accurate and informed with a legitimacy of emotional concern nowhere available in say what is called negro literature the reason is as terrifying as it is simple the middleclass black man whether he wanted to be a writer or a painter or a doctor developed an emotional allegiance to the middleclass middlebrow culture of america that obscured or actually made hideous any influence or psychological awareness that seemed to come from outside what was generally acceptable to a middleclass white man especially if those influences were identifiable as coming from the most despised group in the country the black middle class wanted no subculture nothing that could connect them with the poor black man or the slave literature for most negro writers for instance was always an example of culture in the narrow sense of cultivation or sophistication in an individual within their own group the negro artist because of his middleclass background carried an artificial social burden as the best and most intelligent of negroes and usually entered into the serious arts to exhibit his social gracesas a method or means of displaying his participation in the serious aspects of western culture to be a writer was to be cultivated in the stunted bourgeois sense of the word it was also to be a quality black man not merely an ordinary nigger early negro novelists such as charles chesnutt otis shackleford sutton griggs even though he was more militant pauline hopkins produced works that were potboilers for the growing negro middle class the books were also full of the same prejudices and conceits that could be found in the novels of their models the white middle class the contempt for the lowerclassed negroes found in these novels by black novelists is amazing and quite blatant and as robert a bone points out it must be understood at once that the early negro novelists believed substantially in the myth of anglosaxon superiority pauline hopkins writes surely the negro race must be productive of some valuable specimens if only from the infusion which amalgamation with a superior race must eventually bring chesnutts and griggss heroes were usually refined afroamericans as bone shows further in several of the early novels there is a stock situation in which a refined afroamerican is forced to share a jim crow car with dirty boister ous and drunken negroes the idea of the separation the strata had developed within the group the thin division of field hand from house servant had widened and the legacy of the house servant was given voice constantly in the work of the early negro writers as bone says when all the sound and fury of these novels has evaporated what remains is an appeal for an alliance between the better class of colored people and the quality white folks and an amen could be heard to that sentiment throughout the rising black churches of the north of course the negro novelist ceased to be so blatantly patronizing and disparaging of most negroes when the social climate in the country itself became more liberal no longer would a member of the negro middle class be idiotic enough to write as shackleford once did in his novel lilliam simmons she could understand why jim crow cars and all other forms of segregation in the south were necessary but she could not feel that it was fair to treat all colored people alike because all were not alike by the twenties spurred again by the movement of negroes to the north and the change that had made of a basically agricultural country an industrial giant thereby transforming the core of the negro population from farm workers into a kind of urban proletariat a great change also took place among negro artists and intellectuals even though they were still fundamentally the products of the negro middle class and still maintained rather firmly many emotional and intellectual ties with it the negro novelists of the twenties at least began to realize that the earlier attitudes of the black middle class were the most agonizing remnants of the slave mentality it was now that the middle class demanded through its spokesmen the novelists and the more intrepid educators at least equality it was the beginning of what was called the negro renaissance and the emergence of what alain locke called the new negro but if now the more cultivated members of the black middle class began to realize that the old stance of whiter negroes could not effect an entrance into the mainstream of american society these writers in fact rebelled against the entire concept of a slavish disparagement of the negro by negroes as a prerequisite for such privilege this rebellion still took form within the confines of the american middleclass mind even if those confines had been somewhat broadened by the internationalism imposed upon the country by world war i even the term new negro for all its optimistic and rebellious sound still assumes that it is a different kind of negro who is asking for equality not old rastus the slave there is still for all the race pride and race consciousness that these spokesmen for the negro renaissance claimed the smell of the dry rot of the middleclass negro mind the idea that somehow negroes must deserve equality the spirit of this renaissance was divided as an emotional entity into three separate and easily identifiable reactions corresponding to the cultural stratum of the particular negroes who had to interpret it the rising middle classspawned intelligentsia invented the term new negro and the idea of the negro renaissance to convey to the white world that there had been a change of tactics as to how to climb onto the bandwagon of mainstream american life the point here is that this was to be conveyed to white america it was another conscious reaction to that white america and another adaptation of the middleclass negros selfconscious performance for his ever appreciative white audience there was a loud sudden but understandably strained appreciation for things black by this intelligentsia the harlem school of writers attempted to glorify the lives of the black masses but only succeeded in making their lives seem exotic as literary themes it produced a generation and a tradition of lafcadio hearns the reproduction of a black america as real as the white america these writers seemed to sense as the norm was never realized a white man carl van vechten mechanized and finally straitjacketed a good part of the negro renaissance when he wrote the novel nigger heaven which many negro writers have never ceased to imitate for poorer negroes as i have mentioned before marcus garveys back to africa movement represented the renewed sense of race pride the concept of the new negro represented for the middleclass intelligentsia garvey thought and persuaded a great body of the negro masses that equality could never be achieved in the united states and the negro should seek to embrace his older truer african traditions and eventually set up an independent black state in africa although garvey ultimately failed his call to mother africa inspired thousands of negroes though of course the middle class would have nothing to do with him not only because it did not want to be associated with a movement that involved the poorer negro but also because any mention of africa only conjured up frightening visions of undigested tarzan movies the middle class reacted to the growing nationalism among poorer negroes and the intelligentsia by adopting a milder kind of nationalism themselves and even though most were startled at first by the kind of radicalism that the niagara movement which led to the eventual establishment of the naacp and people like w e b dubois represented they did begin to protest in earnest about jim crow and the brotherhood of man they eventually took over such organizations as the naacp aided by the dependence of such organizations on the philanthropies of white liberals and molded them to their own purposes but from the beginning when the black middle class began to realign itself toward an american from which they could ask equality instead of privilege they had oriented themselves as wouldbe citizens rather than freedmen or exslaves and this is the fundamental difference perhaps even the single line of demarcation separating the black middle class from the rest of the negroes living in the united states the middle class accepts the space the openness and or liberalism of twentiethcentury america as the essential factor of its existence in this country as citizens but when the recognized barriers to such citizenship are reached when all their claims to equality with the rest of america on the one hand and superiority on the other to their own black brothers seem a useless and not wholly idealistic delusion because in the end they are still regarded by this society as only negroes they are content with the name secondclass citizens this at least shows them with a foot in the door if somehow still having to battle to get the rest of themselves in always in behind the calm facade of white middleclass america for the black intelligentsia the term secondclass citizen was a meaningless hoax and the poorer negro never even considered the idea of citizenship as something that could be extended in this country to a person with a black skin the poor negro always remembered himself as an exslave and used this as the basis of any dealing with the mainstream of american society the middleclass black man bases his whole existence on the hopeless hypothesis that no one is supposed to remember that for almost three centuries there was slavery in america that the white man was the master and the black man the slave this knowledge however is at the root of the legitimate black culture of this country it is this knowledge with its attendant muses of selfdivision selfhatred stoicism and finally quixotic optimism that informs the most meaningful of afroamerican music my burdens so heavy i cant hardly see seems like everybody is down on me an thats all right i dont worry oh there will be a better day the most expressive negro music of any given period will be an exact reflection of what the negro himself is it will be a portrait of the negro in america at that particular time who he thinks he is what he thinks america or the world to be given the circumstances prejudices and delights of that particular america negro music and negro life in america were always the result of a reaction to and an adaptation of whatever american negroes were given or could secure for themselves the idea of ever becoming americans in the complete social sense of that word would never have been understood by negro slaves even after the emancipation such a concept would have seemed like an unamusing fantasy to most negroes since many times the very term america must have meant for them a place they dont want you america for negroes was always divided into black and white master and slave and as such could not simply be called america and so there have been since slavery two americas a white america and a black america both responsible to and for the other one oppressed the other the oppressor but an even more profound difference between these two americas has been their awareness of each other or the degree to which the one america is aware of the other the white america has never had more than a cursory knowledge of black america even during the days of the negro renaissance as i have pointed out the knowledge of black america obtained by white america for all the talk to the contrary was never more than superficial but the black american has always had to know what was on the white mans mind even if as a slave he had no full knowledge of what america really was the negros adaptation to american life has been based since the emancipation on his growing knowledge of america and his increasing acquaintance with the workings of the white mans mind the negro american had always sought to adapt himself to the other america and to exist as a casual product of this adaptation but this central concept of afroamerican culture was discarded by the middle class after the move north and the sophistication that that provided it was assimilation the middle class desired not only to disappear within the confines of a completely white america but to erase forever any aspect of a black america that had ever existed the separation i spoke of between the freedman and the citizen is basic to any understanding of the evolution of black america from a relatively homogenous social cultural and geographical unit existing strictly apart from white america negroes became a group of diverse americans forming a psychological chain that begins with a complete awareness of and dependence on what is now called a folk culture and moves to a completely antithetical extreme to those negroes who are completely dependent upon the culture of mainstream america it is a psychological chain much like a spectrum that begins at deepest black and moves easily into american gray there was a period of transition however when for the majority of negroes the chain did not stretch completely into gray america but the separation the cleavage within black america was beginning to be quite apparent the beginning of this cleavage within black america was demonstrated in microcosm in new orleans even before the mass exodus of negroes northward new orleans with its coexisting complex of social cultural and racial influences predated the modern postworldwari northern city in many ways french spanish english african and caribbean cultures existed simultaneously within new orleans and all were thriving within what could be called the black society there was already the extreme cleavage i have mentioned based for the most part on socioethnic considerations most easily verified by color the creoles gens de couleur and mulattoes existed both socially and economically as the more generalized black middle class was to do in later years they encouraged the separation between themselves and their darker usually poorer halfbrothers and they emphasized this separation as formally as they could by trying to emulate as much as possible the white french culture of new orleans the downtown people acquired most of the european instrumental techniques and disparaged the vocal blues style that raged uptown in the black belt but the repressive segregation laws passed at the turn of the century forced the light people into closer social and economic relationships with the blacker culture and it was the connections engendered by this forced merger that produced a primitive jazz the black rhythmic and vocal tradition was translated into an instrumental music which utilized some of the formal techniques of european dance and march music later the merging of the southern blues tradition with the musical traditions of the northern negro produced an instrumental music similar in intent to the early jazz of new orleans and when the instrumental innovators themselves began to be heard in the north the music jazz had already developed further aided by the architectonic and technical ideas of ragtime into a more completely autonomous music the important idea here though is that the first jazzmen were from both sides of the fences from the darker blues tradition and a certain fixed sociocultural and most of the time economic stratum and also from the white creole tradition and its worship of what were certainly the ideals of a francoamerican middle class also the negroes who hired the blues men into their dance and society bands in the north were ofttimes byproducts of the desire of negroes to set up a black middle class so were many of the musicians who were influenced by the dirty way of playing this meant that as jazz developed after the early twenties in this country it could only be a music that would reflect the sociocultural continuum that had developed within negro america from blackest black to whitest white the jazz player could come from any part of that sociocultural spectrum but if he were to play a really moving kind of jazz he had to reflect almost all of the musical spectrum or at least combine sufficiently the older autonomous blues tradition with the musical traditions of the creoles or the ragtime orchestras of the north and thus jazz could not help but reflect the entire black society such a thing as a middleclass blues singer is almost unheard of it is it seems to me even a contradiction of terms jazz as it emerged and as it developed was based on this new widening of afroamerican culture in the best of jazz the freedmancitizen conflict is most nearly resolved because it makes use of that middle ground the space that exists as the result of any cleavage where both emotional penchants can exist as ideas of perhaps undetermined validity and not necessarily as ways of life first there was after the emancipation an america then there was a north and after world war i even places and sets of ideas that were not american that was in one sense as far as the blues would go as a completely autonomous music the blues as a fully integrated american experience was what was called classic blues publicly as american performers the great lady blues singers of the twenties brought blues to a social and cultural significance that it never has had before or since the jazz people took over from there blues in its most significant form again returned underground into the house parties and black cabarets that existed in the new black communities of the north with all the wild unamerican abandon which was supposed to typify the premiddleclass negro society without the jazz players blues would have existed as an american music ie considered as such by the mainstream only during the time of the classic singers before their time and after it autonomous blues was the product of a subculture given the necessary social involvement with american culture negroes themselves would have drifted away from blues since it no longer was an exact reflection of their lives in america for the developing black middle class it was simply the mark of cain and just another facet of negroness which they wished to be rid of but jazz even with its weight of blues could make itself available as an emotional expression to the changing psyche of the modern negro just as in less expressive ways it made itself available to the modern american white man during the twenties when jazz was first beginning to be heard in the north and in whatever diverse presentations throughout america it was still in a period of transition the older blues people were still coming into the northern cities the classic singers were at their peaks and the newer city blues was also developing as the expression of a new subculture as well as the spontaneous piano music boogie woogie or the eastern stride piano style that was concomitant with it but the jazz players were also coming into these towns and a whole new generation of negroes was born into this transitional culturethe first generation with a preponderance of citizens rather than exslaves these were the people who had to decide what was to be done with blues and what weight it would have in their lives at the same time there were still a great many negroes who had known slavery personally or knew it as the emotional idea on which any experience of america had to be based all these negroes existed as black america the extremes were the rentparty people at the one end of black society and the various levels of parvenu middle class at the other jazz represented perhaps the link connecting the two if they were to be connected the verticality of the city began to create two separate secularities and the blues had to be divided among them if it was going to survive at all
my fellow americans v on yesterday i went before the congress to speak for the first time as president of the united states tonight on this thanksgiving i come before you to ask your help to ask your strength to ask your prayers that god may guard this republic and guide my every labor yesterday is not ours to recover but tomorrow is ours to win or lose i am resolved that we shall win the tomorrow before us so i ask you to join me in that resolve determined that from this midnight of tragedy we shall move toward a new american greatness our system has passed you have passed a great test you have shown what john f kennedy called upon us to show in his proclamation of this thanksgiving that decency of purpose that steadfastness of resolve and that strength of will which we inherit from our forefathers what better conveys what is best for america than this on saturday november when these great burdens had been mine only hours the first two citizens to call upon me and to offer their whole support were dwight d eisenhower and harry s truman since last friday americans have turned to the good to the decent values of our life these have served us yes these have saved us the service of our public institutions and our public men is the salvation of us all from the supreme court to the states and how much better would it be how much more sane it would be how much more decent an america it would be if all americans could give their time and spend their energies helping our system and its servants to solve your problems instead of pouring out the venom and the hate that stalemate us in progress i have served in washington years years yesterday i have seen five presidents fill this awesome office i have known them well and ive counted them all as friendspresident herbert hoover president franklin d roosevelt president harry truman president dwight eisenhower and president john f kennedy in each administration the greatest burden that the president had to bear had been the burden of his own countrymens unthinking and unreasoning hate and division so in these days the fate of this office is the fate of us all i would ask all americans in reverence to think on these things let all who speak and all who teach and all who preach and all who publish and all who broadcast and all who read or listen let them reflect upon their responsibilities to bind our wounds to heal our sores to make our society well and whole for the tests ahead of us it is this work that i most want us to doto banish rancor from our words and malice from our heartsto close down the poison springs of hatred and intolerance and fanaticismto perfect our unity north and south east and west to hasten the day when bias of race religion and region is no more and to bring the day when our great energies and decencies and spirit will be free of the burden that we have borne too long let us today renew our dedication to the ideals that are american let us pray for his divine wisdom in banishing from our land any injustice or intolerance or oppression to any of our fellow americans whatever their opinion whatever the color of their skins for god made all of not some of us in his image all of us not just some of us are his children this is our challengenot to hesitate not to pause not to turn about and linger over this evil momonet but to continue on our course so that we may fulfill the destiny history has set for us our most immediate tasks are here on this hill first no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor president kennedys memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil_rights bill for which he fought we have talked long enough in this country about equal rights we have talked for years or more yet it is time now to write the next chapterand to write it in books of law i urge you again as i did in and again in to enact a civil_rights law so that we can move forward to eliminate from this nation every trace of discrimination and oppression based upon race or color there could be no greater source of strength to this nation both at home and abroad as one who has long served in both houses of the congress i firmly believe in the independence and integrity of the legislative branch i promise you that i shall always respect this it is deep in the marrow of my bones with equal firmness i believe in the capacity and the ability of the congress despite the divisions of opinion which characterize our nation to actto act wisely vigorously and speedily when the need arises the need is here the need is now i ask your help i know we meet in grief but let us also meet in renewed dedication and renewed vigor let us meet in action in tolerance and mutual understanding civil_rights struggle i look toward a p one fact is unmistak ably clear the thrust u u jj emancipation will increase rather than decrease the immediate assessment against the backdrop of the summer of could easily be one that anticipates less activity because some measurable gains have been made in hunone relates directly to the other on thanksgiving weekend sncc workers gathered in washington to discuss the ways and means of bringing some measure of economic independence to rural negroes at a threeday conferencewell named for food and jobssncc workers from alabama mississippi georgia and across the south discussed techniques of fighting employment bias of fighting the political and economic stronghold racists have on the american scene and finally new ways to protest against this unjust system of segregation sncc workers who had been beaten kicked some who had been tortured and shot at gathered to discuss formation of an america where no man is hungry none jobless where no man beats another where no one goes to jail because he attempts to register to vote nineteen sixtyfour will see the beginning of a new political awakening among negroes no longer will urban negroes feel their votes are flowing downward into a machine and no longer will rural negroes be afraid to brave police clubs and guns to stand all day in line to register in the negro movement will become the peoples movement a movement for all the hungry all the poor all the voteless in we will remember president kennedys words a man must sometimes sit down for his rights in order to stand up for themdreds of individual communities as well as across the nation however closer scrutiny of the negro revolution will reveal that the awareness of his gains has only whetted his appetite for more gains and more quickly an ancillary force is the fact that whereas a year ago only a sprinkling of cities south and north had been involved in demonstrations picketing etc now there are nearly cities where under the banner of nonviolence some baptism of fire has taken place the negro as a community has increased his skill tremendously in quantity and quality the civil_rights legislation now before congress will feel the intense focus of negro interest it was born in the streets of birmingham amid snarling dogs and the battering of fire hoses it was fashioned in the jail cells of the south and by the marching feet in the north it became the order of the day at the great march on washington last summer the negro and his compatriots for selfrespect and human dignity will not be denied if a filibuster occurs the nation might well fasten its safety belt once the bill is written into law there will still be the matter of implementation state by state and community by community then of course there is the matter of wider use of the technique of selective patronage as popularized is at this moment an elaborate plan to broaden the base of selective buying in order that the power of the negro consumer market can be used as a lever to pry open the door to wider employment opportunities the negro has learned his lesson well if you respect my dollar then you must also respect my person the advent of monstrous automation coupled with the negro comprising the largest segment of americas semiskilled and unskilled labor force makes equal employment opportunities one of the priority concerns of the negro community in the innovation for this year will be largescale selective buying programs aimed at the giants in the consumer industry i do not foresee any widespread turning of the negro to violence this will perhaps be a glowing commentary on the success of the nonviolent method in bringing about social transformation that produces tangible results the last years record has demonstrated that nonviolence is more than pious injunctions to do good for evil it is also a practical technique that has maintained a sense of hope in the american negro community that america can realize the dreams of the founding fathers should compound the gains realized in in projecting the shape of things to comealways a perilous ventureone needs not only the guidance of the past but also a comprehension of the social economic and political factors fashioning todays patterns in no era of contemporary american life are these factors more in flux more erratic than in race relations the one definite thing that may be said is that winds of change along the civil_rights front are blowing throughout the nation theres no present indication that they will subside in by the end of it was abundantly clear that the two most powerful instruments for change possessed by the negro are the ballot and the dollar the problem confronting the civil_rights organizations in as the effective mobilization and utilization of these resources in the fight for freedom there will of course be supplementary activities but the main thrust will undoubtedly be political and economic the national association for the advancement of colored people has already ordered steppedup voter registration campaigns by its branches in every state in which negro citizens reside in sizeable numbers that is in every such state except alabama where a state court injunction still bars naacp activity the naacp is the only national civil_rights organization which has carried on a steady voter registration campaign year in year out since it has had roving staff members one working out of richmond va and one out of memphis tenn organizing and supervising voter registration drives in scores of localities to achieve the goal of maximum registration requires not only money but also thousands of volunteers to perform the necessary drudgery of doortodoor canvassing in local communities rallies and speechmaking are helpful but they are not enough alone to get additional names on the registration rolls important too is concentration on the goal of registration and the avoidance if at all possible of provocative sideline activities that may stir certain communities and result in publicized brushes with law enforcement officers but which do not actually add names to the voting lists the kind of civil_rights law that emerges from congress will in large measure depend upon how convinced members of congress are that we mean business as far as voting is concerned the earlier we get effective campaigns under way in the new year the stronger the law there is now no doubt that a civil_rights bill will be enacted in the question is how strong a law the goal of the naacps nonpartisan political program is the election of candidates committed to civil_rights irrespective of party label the votes the naacp seeks to mobilize will be for the man and what he stands for and not for the party the other major front on which decisive action may be anticipated in is the economic not only negro consumers but big business also are beginning to realize the potency of the races billion purchasing power properly mobilizedthis immense economic force can open up new employment opportunities for negroes at all levels exploration should be made also of the further mobilization of the financial resources of the race to provide capital for retail businesses industrial and manufacturing ventures distributing systems and financial concerns there will be intensified economic action in particularly in local communities there may also be calls for nationwide action against products the manufacturers or processors of which engage in discriminatory practices recent surveys reveal an increasing responsiveness among negro consumers to proposals for such action other important programs will be required in to stem the excessively high unemployment rate among negro workers these include legislation to stimulate the economy to provide public works and to institute a massive retraining program for workers displaced by automation discrimination against negroes in apprenticeship training programs and skilled employment must be halted either by legislation court decisions or direct action certainly publiclyfinanced construction cannot continue to bar negroes from skilled jobs abolition of such discrimination is a imperative in addition to political and economic action there will be important activities in other areas in the civil_rights struggle as the need arises there will be demonstrations to gain specific objectives the fight for open occupancy in housing privately financed as well as public will continue as will the struggle to eliminate segregation in education in nonsouthern states as well as in dixie the outlook for substantial civil_rights gains in is as of this writing more promising than ever before there is a new national administration committed to civil_rights legislative and executive action and with presidential elections coming up an enlarged negro electorate will be able to exert greater influence in the political arena an increasing number of southern cities having learned well the lessons of birmingham and jackson are prepared to make adjustments in accordance with constitutional requirements there is also growing awareness that the supreme courts antisegregation decrees cannot be permanently circumvented and above all the negro remains firmly determined to forge ahead unrelentingly in the struggle for full equality the year probably will be known as the i t year of the passage of the first civil_rights legislation accommodations provision i expect that the bill will be passed in the second session of the present congress it will also are beginning to realize the potency of the races billion purchasing power properly mobilizedthis immense economic force can open up new employment opportunities for negroes at all levels exploration should be made also of the further mobilization of the financial resources of the race to provide capital for retail businesses industrial and manufacturing ventures distributing systems

forge ahead unrelentingly in the struggle for full equality nineteen sixty three has presented a confrontation with every american citizen as to the dimension of the problem the intensity and the alternatives no american can now be indifferent the future of race relations both immediate and long range will be dependent upon the response to that confrontation rights bill is not passed at a much accelerated pace even if the bill is passed demonstrations will be necessary to insure its implementation and enforcement in the new year there will be several new emphases in addition to those of the past a drive will be made to broaden the base of support for the civil_rights revolution more allies will be sought from other minority groups and from sympathetic american whites the revolution will move into an important new stage of noncooperation with segregation and discrimination the demonstrations will continue to exhibit and show the depth of feeling on this issue which exists in the negro community to increase motivation and unity among our ranks and to spotlight the problems for all america to see but in expanded ranks and new allies will be urged in the words of thoreau to see to it that they do not lend themselves to the evil which they condemn in other words there will be selective buying on a larger scale than ever before investments will be withheld from institutions which subsidize and practice segregation the revolution will not be fully completed in but it will be moved a full measure forward i predict further that president lyndon b johnson in spite of being a southerner will prove to have convictions and feelings in behalf of civil_rights at least equal to any of his predecessors we will not always agree with him and will not approve at all times of his actions at such times we will of course say so but i expect him to be a positive force in the civil_rights situation rather than a negative one let us all be black together i am your child and yet i v alien from you you are comfortable educated negroes uninvolved in movements j mtu and that sort of stuff and you have made me comfortable well groomed soontograduatefromcollege but we are different as different as black and white this feeling of alienation came upon me when i returned to home and school in the north after a summers work with the student nonviolent coordinating committees voter registration projects in georgia and mississippi i left a place where people risked their jobs and personal safety so that they could vote and returned to one where the right to vote was uncontested and people wouldnt even try to develop significant black political strength i left a place where people shared food with me when there was not enough for their own families and came back to one where negroes have to be cajoled with the promise of a picture in the newspaper so that they will give to help their own people a place where social workers say you know we actually go out in the streets and talk to those people and i felt alone why what happened one answer has presented itself i learned in that summer of dirt roads pavement ends where the negro section begins jail demonstrations efforts to help people see that they had a right to vote and mass meetings that i am black while you in your minds are white i am black in that i am proud of my roots in africa and in slave america and in that i am involved in the fight for the wellbeing of black people you are white in that you live and operate within a framework of white values many of which are not applicable to the condition of our people most of us are pretty tightly bound to the negro race and to its progress or lack of progress some may escape into a white world by way of intelligence money or luck but most will remain bound together by the ghettos by customs by color like it or not at this point in time in history negroes and whites are not alike the differences go much deeper than mere color we are a different group of people we are not the economically stabilized socially developed group that isif we are to believe the sociologiststhe white americans whether we are to believe them or not is a color of another horse what is important is that this concept of what americans are has led to the adoption and maintenance of values which are not applicable to us we cannot be highly stable secure people when negro unemployment is twice as high as that for whites when counties in mississippi have less than two negro voters each when in greenwood miss negroes have no access to a public library when men make a day picking cotton in season and children are taken out of school to work in the cotton fields we are not this stable group and yet your values are those of such a group for example you have asked or will ask how can we insist that a man serve us at his own lunch counter the answer is that private property is inviolable only if the society is so highly developed that most property needs are taken care of this is not so for us right now people are preparing in mississippi in alabama to bcold and hungry because winter is here the value of the privacy of property cannot be strongly held by people in such a situation such a value must be generously mixed with the proposition that as long as what you have affects me and my serious need i have some influence to exert over it many of you are afraid to go to jail because you have built up in you a respect for law the respect is good but the laws being attacked were made without any consideration of you and are enforced to keep you down why should i respect a law whereby i could not even walk with nine people outside the negro section of albany ga there is another white value held by you which is of great importance at this point the term white must be qualified a strict division of black people and white people is not meant the reference to white values is to values of the large part of american society which is white that is that every man should go for himself this ideal holds well if most men are able to satisfy their needs but consider the fact that many men in our social group are not able to do for themselves in the first case the white case the social group can maintain itself and grow using the every man for himself value but in the second such a rule is senseless now in the light of our disenfranchisement in the south poor schools everywhere joblessness it is into this second case that we fall and the point is that the negro people cannot flourish and develop if we hold to the value that everyone should make it on his own that is a white idea appropriate perhaps for a white society certainly inappropriate for a black one we must instead make it a value to help one another continuously this may be taken religiously but that is not my emphasis the emphasis is on a more worldly point that you must become black a legitimate response to this cry of alienation is that one should expect to be alone when he becomes involved in a cause but the issue is not really the aloneness rather it is that we cannot afford its source your white values we must be black together if we are not to run this race in vain mister ambassador c t rowan is a yearold new frontiersman who for the last eight months has been the united states ambassador here when he flew into town last may he began a whirlwind round of what might be called total diplomacy carrying the message of america to as many finns as he could reach in the shortest possible time helsinki has been used to a more traditional diplomatic approach and mr rowan promptly broke all the traditions taking the capital by storm but he would have taken helsinki by storm in any case for carl rowan happens to be a negro in fact the news of his appointment had set all finland buzzing not because of any racial prejudice for none is evident but because of a curiosity about a race rarely seen here and so the press informed the nation on the rowans arrival that the ambassador and his sons are chocolate brown and that his wife is considerably lighter but it was soon apparent that the finns felt that color aside this ambassador was definitely out of the ordinary he went on a constant round of speeches travel receptions bull sessions bowling golfing and taking the steam with university students and others in the sauna mr rowan is convinced that as a spaceage envoy he should undertake anything that might help provide a broader understanding of america and what it stands for the usual career ambassador in helsinki quietly settles into diplomatic routine after the stripedpants procedure of presenting credentials and paying ceremonial calls upon fellow diplomats and finnish officials but mr rowans traditions are not from the world of diplomacy he was catapulted into his ambassadorship after years as a newsman and two as a state department custodian of press relations as deputy assistant secretary of state for public affairs hurtling into diplomacy with all the furious energy of a kennedy election campaign the fledgling ambassador crammed five major speeches into his first six weeks along with three forays into the finnish hinterland to pay official visits to southwestern and northern cities from the outset newspapers and magazines featured pictures of the ambassador of his wife vivien sons yearold carl jr and yearold geoffrey and miniature greyhound gomez many of the pictures were of diplomatic activity finns had never seen before his excellency was shown for example walking atop an iron fence with his boys or hunting through a neighbors back yard for a baseball while the lady of the house hung up the wash a popular magazine after his first week here ran a feature article headlined the most colorful ambassador in helsinkia headline that caused mr rowan to toss his head back in laughter at the end of his first month however he was happy to note that his whirlwind brand of diplomacy was beginning to be reported without reference to his race but he says even in that first month when finnish newspapers almost invariably described him as darkskinned he only rarely had any consciousness here of being a negro the few times that he did were when he listened to voice of america or bbc broadcasts on race riots in the united states or when he had to discuss them at news conferences he won admiration for declaring that he was not ashamed to speak of the riots even though they were a national disgrace he stressed that the negroes of america had made great progress in the last two decades and that they now had more government support than ever before at the same time finnish newsmen who had the opportunity to participate in a bull session with him were flabbergasted by his willingness to tell stories at his own expense about his experiences as a negro in the united states one that caused special astonishment was an account of mowing the lawn of the house he had while he was with the state department in washington a white woman driving a big car pulled up to hail him as boy and ask how much he charged his only pay for mowing the lawn he replied was the privilege of sleeping with the lady of the house mr rowan surprised helsinki in other ways as well he does not give the impression in closeup of an aggressive personality likely to make a fastpaced debut as an ambassador heavy set he seems to move almost languidly speaking with a slow drawl bearing the stamp of his native tennessee he seems much older than his years he says he grew old at an early age he was in his late teens before he set out from his redclay home town of mcminnville tenn where he had romped barefoot along streets filled with sharp stones these days he sometimes looks i i i ii speculatively at his two sons about the best dressed boys in helsinki and wonders if they will ever amount to anything for they have never had to go barefoot he left mcminnville with cents in his pocket carrying his clothes in a cardboard box his road led first to a summer job in a nashville hospital then to a negro college and it being wartime on to a united states navy officer training school as one of the first negroes to be admitted under what was then a new policy he was the only negro in a class of he says and that ages you fast but world war ii in which yearold ensign rowan served as a communications officer on two vessels in the atlantic turned out to be his big break it got me out of the race situation for it led to his move north he went on to win his bachelors degree from oberlin college in ohio his masters from the university of minnesota and a job with the minneapolis tribune on which he achieved acclaim for his reporting on the negro in the south and on social conditions in india and other asian countries his articles became the bases for three books he received honorary doctorates from simpson college in iowa and hamline university in minnesota attracting the attention of president kennedy he was appointed to the state department in february named ambassador early this year he came to helsinki determined to judge for himself whether there was justification for the suspicions often encountered in washington about finnish relations with the neighboring soviet union he was not content to let the usual circle of business and uppercrust finns and some other selected leaders dominate embassy functions in a bid to talk to as many finns as possible he is struggling to gain something of a conversational ability in the exceedingly difficult finnish language since most people in this farmerdominated northern country speak only finnish he said in an interview that he had nothing against the elite he and his wife like culture and good cognac as well as the next people he declared but he thinks that the revolutionary changes that the world has undergone in the last two decades have also changed the requirement of diplomacy making it necessary for the spaceage ambassador to reach the masses in a great variety of ways it is just as much an ambassadors job to go bowling golfing or to a track meet he said as it is to go to the endless number of teas and diplomatic receptions finns in general appear to be impressed and pleased with ambassador rowan and his accent on public relations one official has already compared him with john moors cabot now united states ambassador to poland who has been highly popular wherever he has served because of his insistence on meeting and discussing america and its ideals with as many people as he could managehere in the early nineteenfifties and subsequently in sweden colombia and brazil mr rowan has also made a deep impression here with his speeches which he writes himself aware though he is of finlands delicate position between east and west he deems it his duty nevertheless to express his countrys views without equivocation and so in a speech in which he decried the sovietled assault on the united nations he suggested that it had been mounted because of clear evidence that the uncommitted peoples these new members of the un have by and large exactly the same goals as do the people of the united states and the rest of the free world such remarks would scarcely seem extraordinary in the united states but to many finns accustomed to the increasingly careful finnish pronouncements of recent years they appeared a bit startling though welcome what does mr rowan hope to accomplish here he has no grand strategy but already his pattern of diplomacy is clear his is a mission largely to the finnish masses but he also wants to get on such a casual basis with finnish government leaders that he can telephone for an appointment just to chat and not only when he has official business to transmit the ambassador apparently can take partial credit for one of the most significant publicrelations triumphs the united states has ever scored in finland the outpouring of proamerican sentiment by the unexpectedly large and enthusiastic crowds that greeted vice president johnson during his september visit before leaving washington for helsinki mr rowan had pressed hard for more attention to finland by highlevel americans going abroad the johnson visit was said to be an indirect result of this in general besides trying to enhance if possible the already excellent finnishamerican relations mr rowan wants to be aware and make washington aware of any way in which the united states can act to assist the finns in achieving their fundamental goal of maintaining their independence this he said may mean doing nothing but for a man with a record of vigorous action doing nothing appears unlikely reminiscences of a white man for a long time it seems f the people of this coun try have listened to g what the white man carcsx said a bout the negro you got the feeling that it didnt make very much difference what the negro said about himself and of course no one cared what the negro said about the white now the tables appear to be turned whites and negroes alike are listening to what the negro says about the negro and what he says about the white as well they may not like what the negro saysthey may not even like to listenbut they have to listen and they do its possible that no one is really concerned about the experiences of whites any more about how and why they react to negroes it was this lack of concern that caused me to begin to do some thinking of my own experiences with negroes i began to wonder how typical they were and if i were to talk about them what they would sound like would they seem hypocritical or immature or prejudiced or oldfashioned or what at first i tried to think of significant things you know what vital impressions did i have from my childhood and adolescence but could only remember a few and in retrospect they didnt seem nearly so consequential but i thought id jot them down and mull them over a bit for example i recall that in college i debated whether to ask a negro girl out for a date it was a particular negro girl and she was very pretty but i suddenly decided against it because i realized i had thought of her as a symbol and not as a person a few years later when i did have my first date with a negro she wasnt nearly so pretty and the party was stilted and boring not because of her being there in any sense but just because it was a dull party and i never asked her out again because we just didnt click several years ago i was at a small gathering on a hot stuffy cleveland ohio night except for my date and myself and one white husband of a negro girl the guests were all negro a lawyer and his wife an urban league counselor half a dozen others we were sitting around some on the floor and a few in chairs drinking beer and munching fritos listening to some faraway jazz on the record player suddenly i became aware of a new note in the room a tone of hostility an edge of tensionid never felt this before the conversation had slid from the comfortable agreement on race relations and the unfair treatment by whites to a deep hurt resentment the talk had left its intellectual level and was crying out in anguish even the vocabulary had changed the speech was no longer crisply northern but was slurred and casual i recognized that my skin had been forgotten that the heat and liquor and generations of hurt had conspired to bring to the surface a side of my friends which i had never seen before which produced a strange feeling of confused guilt within me and made me unhappy in knowing that a door was barred to me for me it was a weird experience one which ive never been able to communicate in words to anyone who had not also experienced it i was looking into a deep abyss and could not see the bottom but i still knew that my friends were staring at me from that abyss and i didnt know how to meet their eyes the topsyturvy evening quickly righted itself and we were soon deep in a discussion of the city government but i never forgot the look into that abyss what am trying to say can any of you help me when i was in seventh grade i lived in a moderately wealthy long island community where negroes entered only through the back door and very few people ever thought about an alternative one day it was on the lawn of our house perched on a small rise and looking into a lovely green canyon that i had a furious argument with a temperamental redheaded friend named frank cummings frank insisted that negroes were as intelligent as whites and i insisted that he was wrong suddenly he shouted oh you stupid bastard and he jumped on his bike and shot away i guess i was a stupid bastard because i later learned that he was right but at the time i was confused and upset i cant pretend it was a major factor in my development but it occurred over twenty years ago and i still can recall the incident vividly i wonder if frank ever realized the chain of thinking that his furv instigated in the days when maids were a month every thursday and every other sunday off we had a regular girl my parents decided once to hire a negro girl and i hated her because she pushed me around like none of the white girls had ever done they got a second negro when the first left and this one was worse i swore to them at least as a sixyearold can swear that i hated all negroes and never wanted another negro maid did this early experience scar me from liking negroes forever i dont think sosomehow those girls just didnt belong to the category negro but to the category maid psychologists have frequently pointed out that actual contact with members of a group seems to determine attitudes less than the learning that occurs through the parents alberts father was a gardener for a familv near our home and the entire gang of fifthgraders played football together in a nearby park no one ever questioned alberts right to play with us albert was the fastest most agile and most likely to fumble and he was usually picked second or third out of the eight or ten of us who gathered together one day albert tried a takeout block he missed and rolled over several times then he began to holler and shriek and writhe snaking along the grass on his legs his thighs his buttocks his head everything but his feet he groaned and cried and yelled and the tears were streaming down his face anxiously we crowded around him trying to find out what he had broken his head or his leg finally he stopped his gyrations long enough to look at us through the gushing tears i swallowed my gum a moment later eight white boys and one negro boy were hollering shrieking writhing snaking along the grass other events stick out in my mind the first negro guest i had in my home when was a college freshman and how concerned we all were that he feel at home i hope he did a year later i happened to be hitchhiking near his home in chester pennsylvania late christmas afternoon i called him and was quickly invited for turkey leftovers the home was in the shadows of some immense mills dirty and noisy and as l hitched back to baltimore that night i contemplated some of the inequities of life hes a medical doctor now i recall taking a couple of attractive white dancers to a small cabaret in the negro section of cleveland a squarebuilt negro entertainer little and lithe did a dance to the most raucous music ive ever heard and the dance itself was about as subtle as a striptease well one of the white girls got up and started to dance with him one of those wonderfully spontaneous things where the sex symbolism was so obvious that it was almost too real to be symbolic the place went wild and a few dollar bills floated down to the floor along with a lot of small change we tried again two saturdays later but you just cant recapture those things the first negro girl i made out withthe front seat of my car on a dimlylit street in front of her house each touch carrying the fear that her father or brother would peer out the window it was just like the times i made out with white girls the reverend james hargett used to be in honolulu before coming to los angeles one afternoon when we were chatting in his office he told me that a local negro not one of his parishioners came to see him in great distress he told the reverend that supposedlydemocratic hawaii had many people with racial prejudices and that even a little old japanese lady turned him away violently when he was looking for an apartment to rent the negro a lightishcolored fellow said that he asked to see the rooms whereupon the woman muttered in pidgin no room hereyou cuttype man and she drew her first finger across her throat then slammed the door little did the poor negro know that he was not suffering from antinegro feeling but that he was mistaken for a filipino a group in hawaii which has a reputation for knifefights and sporadic violent killing the irony was pointedthis negro receiving discrimination because someone thought he was not negro karamu theatre in cleveland has mixed casts in its shows and the casting is frequently done without any regard to skin color sometimes this leads to gross miscasting such as the dark negro woman who played a swedishamerican housewife with a thick pseudoscandinavian accent ineffectually disguising her georgia speech but one of my favorite stories was told to me by an actress at karamu a lovely and lightskinned negro girl who played a romantic role opposite a somewhat darkerskinned man one evening after the show a heavily rouged middleaged woman approached her and said pityingly i think you did very well my dear but how can you stand to play a love scene with a negro man my friend retorted casually because im a negro woman when last seen the matron was scurrying to the parking lot we never even had a chance to tell her that the male romantic wasnt negro but a white but my favorite story was told to me by two friends who lived in savannah georgia for a year marianne had hired a cleaning woman one day a week a person she contended was both more intelligent and better educated than most of her neighbors after a couple of weeks marianne and clare came to respect each other and they formed the habit of eating lunch together along with the baby greg and fouryearold sheila after about six weeks of this sheila announced abruptly at the weekly lunch mommy janie told me clare shouldnt eat with us we shouldnt have a nigger at the table mariannes heart disappeared through her shoes as her face colored like the setting sun clare stopped eating suddenly looked at her plate sheila then turned to her mother mommy whats a nigger clare and marianne laughed so hard they almost collapsed but with different parents sheilas learning in prejudice might have begun in earnest i also remember ralph bunche speaking at my college graduation eugenes concern when he took his family to tennessee to teach a white man in fort worth who contended that the bible didnt apply to negroes because they werent human the negro physician who lived in my lilywhite cleveland suburb and his daughters who made the most of their high school the allnegro audience at karamu that laughed at the wrong parts of take a giant step and threw my cues completely off the acute fear of a friend when we doubledated to a cleveland blackandtan spot josh white his cigarette tucked traditionally behind one ear talking and singing with us until four in the ayem whats the purpose in all these disjointed vignettes nothing of significancenothing with the impact of the negro contacts with the whitesnothing of the drama of the sitins im just trying to tell you some of the things that happened to me these may be typical of the middleclass selflabeledliberal collegeeducated white perhaps they irritate you perhaps they amuse you perhaps they have provided you with a few noteworthy insights into me letter from an awol soldier i am a negro a gi i v and awol having lost some seventeen j pounds in weight after suffering a recurrent chronic back ailment coupled with longlasting headaches generally feeling rundown and weak and not being able to get a long enough break to somewhat arrest my condition i then went over the hill awol after two weeks of rest and recuperation in seclusion the headaches are gone and ive regained most of my weight my chronic condition is also somewhat relieved during the idle hours of the past few days ive had a chance to thoroughly analyze myself as an american negro soldier and what i see amazes me i remember sitting in a classroom one morning during basic training after having just heard about the sunday morning bomb killing of four young negro children in birmingham on the radio listening to a white chaplain and an officer literally stand on their heads preaching the justices of democracy how we must defend our freedom if we want to remain free how we should be willing to lay down our lives to protect our country and our way of life i looked at them and marveled i wondered to no end in complete amazement how white democracy can deny a black man nearly all the rights they put him in uniform to defend while at the same time expect him to perform his duties ungrudgingly to a country and a system which seemingly strive to deprive him of his dignity and i wondered silently if all the white people in america thought i should be willing to let them send me to germany with an ml rifle in my hands to stand ready to guard the white germans freedom and liberty with my life or willingly let them send me to vietnam to perhaps die in defense of vietnamese and so that the oriental there could live in freedom when either a vietnamese or a white german could come to the shores of free america grasp from me the freedom which i went to his homeland and died for he would then be more free than i who have lived here through years of slavery segregation lynching bombings discrimination patriotism and bravery through a civil and other wars and still i would be the hopeless rightless citizenless nigger at the bottom of the barrel contented but then i realized that there were few blacks in the class me being a rather dusty darkie im sure the sick disgust was quite evident on my face i wondered what the chaplain thought of my intelligenceif he thought i had any if he really thought id be willing to lay down my life for secondclass citizenship to prevent some enemy from taking it away from me and finally there being only a few blacks in class if he was at all aiming his talk at us we had quite a few of these orientations or brainwashing sessions as i secretly referred to them if a man is free and democracy is all the things they tell him it is and if he has lived it he will know it it would not be a necessity to constantly pound these things into his head at this late date if democracy meant everything to me they told me it does i would know it no one would have to tell me over and over again but then on the other hand maybe these orientations were aimed primarily at us darker ones many times i wonder about my shadowy future in america as a nineyearold child in the south i wondered i wondered when i went downtown with my mother to buy the weeks groceries why it was that we had to drink from a separate fountain one marked colored i wondered why we had to sit in a separate back room when she took me to see the dentist and why she called me back in anger when i went to peep through the divider at all the white people sitting in their section i also wondered why all the white people we passed on the streets looked at us that way and why my mother always dropped her head and would scowl at me for not doing likewise i wondered why we always went through the back door of the towns only drugstore and why i got slapped across the mouth when i asked mother why in front of white people she later explained apologizingly in a choking tone of voice we cant come through the front door son because were not white sensing the fright and hurt in her eyes i pretended to understand she patted me on the head and i held her hand tight as we walked back hometo protect her i thought from all the white people who wished her harm for reasons i did not understand and i wondered why my teacher punished me the next day at school when i refused to place my right hand over my heart lift my left hand and point it toward the flag pledging allegiance to it one nation under god with liberty and justice to all i was at a loss to explain to her why i refused but something within my young mind held me back i was not bitter then for i did not understand then but today i am alert aware observant and i understand yet i harbor no bitterness only sadness grief and a desperate confused longing to know who i really am i am not a communist nor a black muslim though i cannot condemn all of that black sects teachings but i shall never in all the days of my sanity believe that we negroes will be able to push all the white people back into the sea then get on their vessels and sail back to africa from whence the white man stole us and give this land he stole from the indians back to them i am not a member of the communist party so i take it im not a communist however i find it difficult and confusing to distinguish the difference between the definitions of communism and democracy i am told that under a communist system a man is told where he may or where he may not work a man is told where he may or where he may not go a man is told where he may or where he may not live a man is told with whom he may or with whom he may not associate i was bom black am still black was told and am still told that i am living under a democracy which is in complete contrast to communist teachings one would have to be of rather minute intelligence if he is black and is not puzzled by these definitions when applied to his daytoday existing if it seems that my mind is twisted and warped and i am an idiot i extend to you my most humble apologies but i was born in america in the little backwoods southern town of conway south carolina where racial discrimination and segregation kept me in the niggers place where each day meant a tougher fight than the day before to hang on to my pride and selfrespect where many a night my elders would pray to holy god that out of the coming of the black night would not commence a raid on our section of town by a group of white men who called themselves ku klux klan to remind us that their cruelty was our way of life because we were black and they were white that it was not so much for us to fear allmighty god but rather the allmighty white man if i am not yet ready for most of the human rights white people take for granted how then have they arrived at the conclusion that i am ready to serve in their army if i am told that my mere presence would lower the standards of their neighborhoods then it confuses me as to why my mere presence does not also lower the standards of their armed forces the question booming inside my mind now is not what the army will do to me when i get back for im sure ill receive whatever punishment white democracy will deem justified the question most frantically booming away inside my brain now is can i find the strength to serve a society which so boldly denies me most nearly all that which it says im obligated to preserve a champions lost ambition the day of the march on washington for jobs and freedom my thoughts turned back years to a day in when as sports editor of the baltimore american i met a herford for the first time uncle al was the manager of joe gans who died in and to this day still is rated the greatest lightweight champion of all time in boxing i visited with herford in his office and asked him why gans a negro was so deeply revered in his home town at the top of the south where negroes had little or no opportunity i had been in baltimore only a short time but already several boxing men had pointed out to me the open market where gans as a boy had scaled fish and shucked oysters the folly theater where he had his first fight and the goldfield hotel which he had built for negroes with his purse from a memorable round fight with battling nelson which he won on a foul at goldfield nev in these places were spoken of almost as shrines the manager went to his safe and dragged out several large scrabooks filled with clippings and pictures of gans career which we pored over let me tell you a story that will answer your question he said joe was every inch a little gentleman he never flaunted his position and the white people loved him for his humility baltimore went wild when he won the championship with a oneround knockout victory over frank erne at fort erie in telegrams of congratulation deluged us and informed us that a royal welcome awaited our return home with a band salute and street parade and a public dinner to follow as our train neared baltimore joe and i were seated opposite each other in a parlor car joe was wrapped in deep silence his sad expression even more doleful than usual isnt it wonderful joe i asked being champion and all that it means to have all of those folks enthused about you and all of the money you are going to make ill bet your mother is proud of you joe didnt say anything for a long moment then he said wistfully yes mr herford it sure is wonderful but do you know what im thinking what i asked that id give it all upthe money the fuss the championship everythingfor just one thing whats that i asked for a white boys chance in the world paradise lost and missiles fell upon g a v the earth days and nights and they g blotted out all swarm ing creatures and animals and birds of the air and fish of the waters and all mankind but two only mr sippi was left and the woman who was with him at the last bomb shelter on the earth now the woman was darkskinned and she stood in the front of the last bomb shelter on the earth and the man was whiteskinned and he sat in front of the last bomb shelter on the earth and because the skin of the woman was not white the man had enmity to ward her and he would not let her enter into the shelter for which he was the registrar he said unto her go to your own bomb shelter negra this shelter is for whites only but there was no other bomb shelter in all the earth for her to go to there was only one and it was segregated now the last missile on the face of the earth had been launched and even as the man spoke to the woman it was flying toward them from a distant land the men at that launching site had tried to launch another missile but it had exploded on the site blotting out the men and they had been the only living things left in that land and so it came to pass that the darkskinned woman and the whiteskinned man mr sippi the registrar were the only living things left on the face of the earth now there could have been other living things in the part of the earth where mr sippi was the registrar for his bomb shelter was a good bomb shelter and it would have given protection to those creatures who could have been in it for forty days and forty nights while missiles fell upon the earth but the shelter was in a part of the land where men and women were darkskinned and mr sippi would not let them enter into the shelter because it was segregated and so they were all blotted from the face of the earth the darkskinned creatures had had their own bomb shelter one for colored only and many had gone into it before the first missile fell it was separate but not equal and it had caved in on them and blotted them out even before the first missile fell now mr sippi was a smart man and that was why he had given up the name of governor and taken the name of registrar so that he could be close to a bomb shelter and he knew that the missile was flying toward his part of the land and that any living person inside the shelter would not be hurt but still he would not let the darkskinned woman enter into the shelter because of the color of her skin the woman said unto him oh mr sippi suh if you do not let me into the shelter the last woman will perish from this earth and only you will remain and then you will die of old ageit is possible suhand all mankind will be blotted from the earth mr sippi said unto her i will go to jail before i integrate this bomb shelter the woman wailed unto him oh mr sippi suh let us go into the bomb shelter where it is safe and cleave unto each other and multiply and give new fruit to this destroyed land you will be a second adam and i will be a second eve now when mr sippi heard the words of the darkskinned woman his enmity became so great that he forgot about the falling missile and fell upon her with fire flashing in his eyes and the demon in his breast he smote her until she cried out for mercy but he did not give her mercy he blotted her from the earth gods will be done he said and with his words the last missile fell on the last man on earth and blotted him out and the earth became again without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep all gods children almost tom morgan bent his t p lanky body and g switched off the little y portable radio there would be other news but none as vital as that first flash papa what does it mean morgan looked down at his twelveyearold son it means he said carefully that in the fall youll be able to go to the white boys school his lean hard right arm dropped protectively around the boys thin shoulders joey twisted his neck to look up at the satinyblack face so like his ownthe proud jaw the generouslymoulded mouth the liquid black eyes were tranquil yet alive with intelligence and deep thought had left its tracings on the high forehead joey searched the face but could find nothing to justify his disturbed feeling he shifted his sneakered feet uneasily but the nameless fear kept growing to hide it from his father joey dropped his face and pulled away from his fathers arm he crossed the bare floor of the small living room away from his father away from the radio away from the lumpy slipcovered sofa where his mother sat nervously rolling and unrolling a corner of her apron joey sat down in the old wicker rocker and set it in motion the room was divided by two panels of dusk creeping through the unshaded windows facing the fields and was quiet except for the rhythmical creaking of the rocker then joey spoke above it i dont want to go to the white boys school his fathers deep voice was studiedly impartial its more uptodateyou could learn more i dont care joey rocked forcibly youd be a fullfledged doctor in no time the rocking stopped four years ago joey had gashed his hand chopping wood a dignified man with a black bag had come to the house immediately the man had stopped the pain with a big needle then sewed the cut with small measured stitches as dainty as his mothers prizewinning embroidery then and there joey made up his mind to be a doctor his mothers soft voice cut through with hands still fingering her apron and cocoavelvet cheeks flushed with anxiety she said tom the new lawit doesnt say a boy has to go to the school if he doesnt want to does it tom sighed he could understand even though he didnt entirely share ellas distrust of whites he sank down on the soft beside her gently his powerful black hands reached over stilled the quivering small brown ones lifting them both into one palm and covering them with the other ella he said joey isnt obliged to attend that schoolnot according to the state law but this country has a more powerful law the rocker creaked as joey strained forward to hear the words were addressed to his mother but directed to him the declaration of independence continued tom rules that all men are created free and equal words words words exploded ella snatching her hands away from toms they dont mean a thing ella tom said slowly remember the day i got my promotion in the air force those words had meaning then didnt they ella stared sullenly didnt they persisted tom that was different she mumbled not so different her husband pointed out then i took a step forward now joey can help all our people take a step forward think what this will mean to our little alice when shes ready for school the room was gloomy morgan snapped on the table lamp at his elbow and looked across at his son you see that dont you joey youd be helping alice and others like her the boy didnt answer isnt that what a doctors supposed to do prodded tom help people joey nodded reluctantly sat silently for a minute then flashed a smile of singular maturity at his father i will change schools he said quietly the summer slipped away and with it much of joeys courage his mother had a pinched look and she no longer laughed as she had before every night long after joeys nine oclock bedtime he could hear her shrill tones mixed with the low angry ones of his father with each passing day joey got more mixed up one minute he dreaded the opening day of school the next he could hardly wait for it finally it was at hand an unusual september morning for the south frostbitten and windy it was hardly dawn when his father called him so we can have a little talk before you leave he explained joey didnt mind he hadnt been asleep the water in the scarred tub was icy but joey bathed thoroughly then dressed with great care he had to be equal at least from the skin out the kitchen was cozy and warm and joeys favorite breakfast was on the rickety table but he couldnt eat much and his mother ate nothing at all after breakfast with the wind whipping at the tiny window they got down on their knees ella morgan now oddly calm in a low sweet voice talked to the lord about her boy then tom said a few words they prayed a long time when they got to their feet joey saw that it was nearly time for the school bus he grabbed his cap and the presents from his parentsa shiny lunch box from his father a bright red pencil box from his mother he kissed them and started out the door his fathers husky voice called after him dont forget son were all gods children joey got on the school bus he was the only colored boy but the driver gave him a smile and a pleasant hello there joey sat down on the only empty seat next to one of the boys there was a snort of disgust as the boy untangled his crossed legs and lurched across joey in frantic haste to push out into the aisle from then on the fivemileride was a nightmare whispers scornful laughter and eyes that glared with hate at last the bus pulled up in front of the school through the window joey saw lines of people grownups girls boys some of them carrying signs his legs stiffened so that he could hardly get down the bus steps as he stalked through the crowd they pushed hooted and waved signs in his face joeys blurring eyes couldnt make out the words for some reason all he could think of was his fathers line were all gods children joey wondered back in the little house ella morgan watched the clock when it was past the hour for the school bus she consulted her husband hes probably riding home with somebody we know tom suggested or maybe he decided to walk you know how he loves to walk the afternoon deepened at dusk tom rose abruptly ill go and meet him as his loping stride carried him out of sight ella slipped to her knees to pray she couldnt leaping to her feet she flew out the door and down the road she had been running a long time when a station wagon pulled up at the wheel was josh brannon the white man from the big house on the hill he peered out curiously anything wrong mrs morgan hysterically ella gasped out the words with great kindness josh helped the trembling figure into the station wagon now he instructed cheerfully you catch your breath little lady well find that boy of yours they raced along the dark road suddenly ella shrieked the car screeched to a stop at the side of the road on his knees was tom morgan in front w of him was a small still form josh brannon had only to glance at tom morgan to know the man was in shock he was staring blankly at his boy ella screamed piteously as she rushed at her child brannon pulled her away and felt for a pulse it was faint but joey was alive tenderly he gathered up the little figure and called sternly to ella and tom this boys got to get to a hospitalhurry ella pulled her dazed husband into the station wagon as the doctors carried joey into the emergency room brannon put his arm around ella and led her to a bench joey will be fine he said but joey wasnt fine joey morgan was dead the doctor told them death had come from a welldirected rock thrown with such force it had crashed halfway through the skull ella was stunned dead she kept repeating you mean joeys gone and wont be back you mean hes not here that hes in heaven brannon fought back tears yes he said im sure hes in heaven but brannon was wrong joey was not in heaven not quite at that moment he stood before the pearly gates his name had just been given to the recording angel who went to tell st peter its joey morgan reported the recording angel age twelve st peter looked down the pages of the golden book you must be mistaken he said it couldnt be joey morgan the recording angel insisted i just talked with the boy cording to the book a doctor joey he spelled his name for me morgan was to be welcomed here st peter looked bewildered at the age of one year after he thats very strange he said ac discovered the cure for cancer by mike thelwell mitch came out of the cool dimness of the bar and started down the block to the bus stop the city heat which seemed sticky and grimy was reflected off the pavements scarcely tempered by a slight breeze which was itself hot and dusty beer always relaxed him and he walked loosely jauntily with an athletes grace full of confidence in his own youth and power he came up to the bus stop with a casual arrogance hardly noticing the people loosely grouped around he thought of the letter in his pocket the committee has voted to make available to you a year in europegoddamn the spook halfback isnt doing so bad all you had to do was to learn to manoeuvre in their world speak their language his hand went automatically to the back pocket of his jeans for the book which he had found as necessary a part of the use of the transit system as the token the book was by some white psychologist who had probed into the psyche of an old tribal chief in south africa and seemed to have been shocked to death at the levels of conscious disguised and subliminal hate that his probings had disclosed and him a psychologist too mitch thought sourly the white mans innocence syndrome again such incredibly childish and outrageous naivete serves him right what in hell else did he expect he found the book a trifle obvious unless of course you were ofay in which case you could be discomfited by the africans image of yourself and your world mitch knew that he wasnt really reading the book that while his eyes leaped over the words his mind was detached he became aware that he was in fact brandishing the book it made a symbol because of the angry bold words of the title and the corrugated black face at once barbaric and pathetic which adorned the jacket the picture of the chief with his collapsed untidy old mouth which even bitterness couldnt firm up and his ancient and murderous eyes was startling strange how fidgety people could become when confronted with anything real like hate and death or any symbol of these things its like white americans when confronted with anything negro that wont fit the accepted justifications and myths maybe it is just because they have been too insulated too wellfed have been made to feel too fraudulently secure entombed and comforted in the pink and white pastel blandness of their white society for too long that a thing like a snarling black face can disturb them mitch thought and closed the book the knowledge that he himself was compensating projecting being smug feeling superior was amusing hell he had every right to his own prejudices and resentments like everyone else he let his glance deliberately and overtly challenging rove over the faces of the people around him at the bus stop the usual city groupthe same gray armoredup faces and the same shabby perpetually soiled look that the nonaffluent members of the affluent society seemed to wear like a membership badge in some secret organization that existed for the perverse pleasure of giving the lie to the societys assumptions mitch noticed with some disappointment that nobody appeared affected by his defiant glanceand such arrogance in the gesture too like a flamenco dancer or a matador and no one noticed so remote and tired they seemed so damned remote and tired each one turned in on himself completely caught up in the closed backreaches of his own concern the community of the city hah how mechanical somehow listless and enervated they were mitch found himself changing position quickly and impatiently as though by doing so he could assure himself that he was as yet undefeated and vital and that there was a force an energy in him that would not let him be still he recognized his posturing for what it was and grinned sardonically at himself you shouldnt have to prove it baby you dont have to prove a thing whats it bouf said in the blacks they arent really white but shades of pink and yellow and grey he began to amuse himself by staring openly at his companions to see how accurate that pronouncement was that little man christ hes bright yellow probably takes the sun at coney island with a fat shapeless wife and a horde of kids on sundays and two little boys discussing da movies in adenoidal brooklynese they were colorless their faces marked by an urban pallor a girl in her early teens standing slightly knockkneed her braced teeth chomping on a wad of gum her hair in curlers stood gazing vacantly at nothing she was whitish and pink in streaks and patches mitch noted and in a few years she will probably be beautiful or at least chic from nine to five anyway until she gets married then back to baggy shorts and daytime curlers then he saw the woman she was tall and wellfleshed with a strong wellformed face mitch looked into her frank gray eyes and looked away surprised she had actually seen him actually looked at him this sudden and totally unexpected contact surprised him he retained the image of rounded womanly arms a simple sleeveless cotton dress belted at the waist like an ancient greek tunic and light sunstreaked blond hair preparing himself he allowed his eyes to move methodically across the group until he was looking directly at her the sunlight shone off her hair and dress and she appeared strangely clean her face untouched by makeup she returned his gaze from eyes that upset him by their unexpected serenity he realized grudgingly that she was not to be easily reduced to selfconsciousness and he returned to looking at his book she is he thought a wholesome looking woman but it isnt the neuter kind of sterile wholesomeness that madison avenue uses to sell its beer and cigarettes no its something more personal a fullysexed carnal cleanness that is altogether outofplace among such soiled looking city people he tried to engross himself in his book but he could not forget the alert liveliness of the womans eyes oh well i guess some of us manage to retain some humanity he thought yet for some reason the womans tranquility jarred him she defied the neat compartments into which it was his habit and his defense to fit and therefore dispose of all white people hell they were either smug deluded and completely out of touch with their own existence or hyperanxious and neurotic this woman clearly did not fit into such categories his reflections were broken by a new sound introducing itself into the steady drone of the street noises a little negro man very drunk who might have been years oldthe signs of his drinking showed too plainly in the destroyed facewas babbling at the woman youre a nish girl ah like you dont you like me have a drink now he was leaning on a signpost precariously close to the woman offering her his flat bottle half full of a vellow wine mr here baby have a drink he insisted dribbling saliva youre a nish girl lets have a drink uh a tense silence held the crowd for a minute nobody seemed to want to look at the drunk except for two little boys who were grinning two middleaged women were now a part of the crowd mitch hadnt seen them join the group but somehow they had become conspicuous backs stiff stringy necks bristling with a suppressed yet communicated outrage they stared up the street with their lips moving silently yeah mitch thought disgraceful disgraceful what is the world coming to i agree with you you old hags the drunks voice was growing louder its initial wheedling intimacy beginning to harden into anger mitchs first impulse was to laugh the woman was so much taller appeared so much stronger than the wasted little drunk that his approving almost condescending youre a nish girl was funny but it wasnt really funny oh well maybe she is his girl mitch thought snickering at the absurdity of the idea and if she isnt its like the man said tis a consummation devoutly to be wished it wasnt working the mental wisecracks did not relieve the embarrassment he felt growing and his anger at himself for feeling vulnerable and compromised by the actions of some drunken negro he didnt know fed his discomfort the woman was behaving rather well he observed with a twinge of resentment she had pulled herself erect stepped away from the drunks breath but she had not lost her composure she caught mitchs glance and her eyebrows arched in a tolerant whatcanido expression which whatever it was supposed to do only succeeded in crystallizing mitchs anger he jerked his eyes away furiously dont look at me bitch im not involved he wanted to say the other people at the bus stop were stubbornly maintaining their detachment nothing was their business yeah but what are they thinking the slobs heres food for all the prejudices you want and need so badly to cling to mitch thought something to go home and tell your friends about and cluck over and to remember on the day i come into the neighborhood the drunken monotone continued ranging in a pathetic burlesque between courtship and rape at once threatening and cajoling youre a nish girl dont you like me the drunks mind seemed finally to register the snickers of the two boys a humiliating testimony to his own presumptuousness and ineffectuality his voice grew louder his stance mockmenacing and he tried to introduce a note of toughness into his voice he appeared to want to walk away but now that the incident had become public he seemed unable to do this or to accept the rejection that only his drunkenness could have disguised as less than inevitable he tried to threaten not gonna ask you again gawddam have a drink he waved his bottle belligerently ish good stuff i tol you we kin have fun dont you like me stop it you stupid sonofabitch mitch thought stop it you are giving them excuses still he felt an unreasonable compassion for the little man if only the bitch seemed threatened how goddamn composed she is he found himself wishing that it was night that the area was secluded that the drunk was niggerbig razorscarred and evillooking what would happen to her goddamned miss ann composure then he thought and yet she was reacting with unusual patience leave her alone man dont do this to yourself to her hit her rape her anything but stop that goddamned whining stop begging not like that man not like that and you white woman be disgusted or uncomfortable or best of all afraid but not so damned unreachable at least recognize his existence some other way call a cop even another headwhipping in the basement of some precinct wouldnt scar the poor drunk as deeply as this public evidence of his own futility then hed be a threat or even a pestsomething to be stamped on but he would have broken in he would be something the drunk was trying to be mean now his voice grew louder and he caught the woman by the arm desperately trying to be tough to evoke some reaction but in his bleary eyes were tears maybe from the dust and glare maybe from shame at the absurdity of his role watching him mitch knew sickly that this was no new role for the little man the woman gently disengaged her arm from the drunks grip and walked to the other side of the bus stop nearer to mitch she managed as she did this to give the impression that she was acting more for the drunks protection than for herself the drunk stood gaping at his empty hand then removing the cap from the bottle took a long drink letting the wine run down his stringy neck he stood in the middle of the sidewalk shaking his head and noisily clearing his throat there was a look of foolish drunken bewilderment on his face as he stood there blinking and now mitch saw that his late victim was looking at him with concern disgust he thought angrily or anger thats what you are supposed to feel not pity its way too late for your pity way too late for that oh hell if he starts again i should stop him she doesnt deserve to be molested and embarrassed still he knew and was confused by the knowledge that had the drunk struck her hed have been outraged he would have stopped him and been truly sorry and maybe even felt a little guilty but he would not have been sickened in quite the same way oh goddamn this messedup schizophrenic rubbleheap of a society this stupid screwedup accumulation of inherited guilt and hate and endless retribution for that poor conflicted ineffectual drunk incapable of being lover or defiler destroyed denied full growth and in his warpedness not even malignant enough to evoke disgust what is left him and the woman why did she have to be embarrassed and me caught in the middle between them mitch looked at the drunk a shabby forlorn figure now as he stood outlined in the glare ten yards away isolated when the drunk passed his hand over his face his eyes cleared for a moment and mitch felt the physical presence of vulnerability and sadness that somehow shone from his eyes in a sudden moment of clarity it passed and he was coming over to the group again mumbling and slobbering his face set in lines of drunken stubbornness the sunyellowed little man saw him coming and a look of hesitance flickered across his face then apparently reaching a decision he started toward the drunken negro oh a defender of white womanhood too mitch muttered now where does this little schmuck think hes goingto set things in their proper perspective aloud he said easy pal just stay where you are ok and he caught the wouldbe knight reassuringly by the arm his grip as strong as he could make it and he noticed the man wince as he checked his movement mitch wasnt sure why he stopped the man except that it was action a way of declaring himself but he felt certain that the man was grateful at being spared any involvement above all mitch did not want the drunk to swallow another defeat and at the hands of such a seedylooking little white man he stepped deliberately in front of the blond woman then his back almost touching her making it impossible for the drunk to reach her he folded his arms and pretended to read scush me man gotta see someone mitch pretended not to hear the drunks voice grew angry as he became aware of what mitch was doing ah said outta ma way man whats the matter anyway oh oh im sorry sir excuse me mitch did not move whaddya tryin to do man who do you think you are anyway the drunk sounded really indignant now suspecting that mitchs action was telling him that he was making a fool of himself triggered the first anger that mitch had noticed in him mitch realized that he was glad to see this change it was a hell of a lot better than the shamed halfservility halfanger of a few moments before he felt a fierce compassion for the little man yet he knew that he would hit him if it became necessary now whos defending white womanhood he thought bitterly and something close to hatred rose in him for this woman who had done nothing but be white and desirable man dont do it please dont do it i dont want to have to mitchs voice was low insistent almost a whisper for some reason he did not want the woman standing just behind him to hear it was very important that she did not dont do what what are you talking about the drunk demanded with drunken truculence outta mah way jes who the fugg do ya think ya are he was obviously finding in mitch a more legitimate object for his wrath mitch wanted to throw his arm across the thin shoulders to lead him away and to say be cool man im with you dont do this to yourself dont do it to me like we stand together man lets forget it instead he stood in front of the little drunk feet spread arms folded feeling his face harden and his eyes growing hostile the bus was stopping behind him he heard the doors open and people entering the drunk looked past him and something much like relief reflected in his eyes to be immediately replaced with blustering anger he started to speak and mitch cut him off mister he said im not sure what i did to you but im sorry i really am he tried to make his voice and manner convey diffidence if i can only give this cat back something he thought the drunk contemplated the sudden capitulation blankly for a few seconds scarcely able to hide his surprise and confusion mitch wondered how long it had been since anyone had thought enough of the derelict to be scared of him youre lucky the drunk growled jus never try to be so lucky again youre one real lucky young punk messing wid me hah he punctuated the last phrase with a jabbing finger thanks thanks sir mitch said as he stepped into the bus through the window he saw the drunk point a final warning finger in his direction before turning away poor screwedup little guy probably feels real tough now mitch found a seat and immediately riveted his eyes to the book he couldnt shake the engulfing sense of personal loss and of being somehow diminished himself excuse me her voice was clear but hesitant i just wanted to thank you for she broke off when mitch shook her hand from his wrist and levelled into her eyes a steady hostile stare i hope you dont think i did you any service miss their eyes locked for a short time and mitch wondered does this broad think im going to apologize for the drunk does she think i did it for her cant she understand that it might have been for the drunk or for me or even for the goddamned race but not for her he felt like the betrayer of some vaguely understood bond his mind groped frantically for the word the gesture some way to establish clearly to her and himself that he had acted only out of a desire to save something of the drunks pride to keep him from another encounter with the white mans jail but he could only glare into her earnest gray eyes under the seething inarticulate fury of the glare she flushed slightly and lowered her eyes somewhat appeased mitch continued the pretense of reading scowling down at the book mister i think you might not have understood and what might i not have understood miss he stared at her again that and her voice faltered again before his mute hostility that ii think i understand i dont blame him oho she understands he thought what the hell does she understand a generous compassionate tolerant white woman well shes either too late or too early who in hell needs her compassion or understanding hope she chokes on it dont you think you should blame him miss no man has the right drunk or otherwise to molest a woman or is his case special the woman looked astonished no no she said i just mean that well that it wasnt his fault it wasnt mine either oh lady how could anything be your fault i dont know what you are talking about mitch rudely changed his seat asking himself as he got up now what the hell are you mad about now james baldwin the writer i am the man i suffered i was there runs the quotation from whitman that introduces the reader to james baldwins second novel giovannis room then what did he bring back and if suffering can be said to have a depth how deeply did he suffer the answers are to be found in his books and more recently in his meteoric rise as a public figure i know these questions in an article on a writer printed in a writers journal could be answered very simply if somewhat evasively by merely listing baldwins accomplishments in the field mentioning a few anecdotes about his personal life and quoting a handful of his multitudinously pithy sentences this would be a relatively harmless albeit academic approach and the result would be appallingly innocuous at best a kind of childs garden of james baldwin at worst the deadly list of a pallid bibliographer or a landscape architect i choose a more personal track in the hope that with luck i might accidentally succeed in giving the reader a little of the feeling of the man i suppose this is to venture into a nomans land to move out precariously beyond the wire and to hope however naively that whatever fire i may draw will be badly aimed my point of departure is some years back in denver before i met james baldwin although i knew and greatly admired his work which at that time consisted of two novels go tell it on the mountain and giovanni s room and two collections of essays notes of a native son and nobody knows my name his powerful third novel another country was nowhere in sight except for a few oddments scattered throughout the quarterlies and the vitriolic yet loving indictment of america the fire next time hinted at in small asides in most of his essays was not as yet a glint in anybodys eye that time in denver at which i have chosen to begin i was sitting in a grubby bar drinking too much beer and smoking too many cigarettes the piano player who sometimes blew a sweet coronet and dug around in the bass of the piano accompanying himself with his left hand had just launched into a blues of his own composition his name was kenny whitson he wore an auburn goatee short cropped hair and his eyes were very bright and intelligent he sang a little off key in a flat nasal voice you got to lissen to yousef ever time you talk if it aint the truth brother then turn you back and walk i was struck by these blues and writing about baldwin now with three novels and three collections of essays to his credit a collection of short stories to be published this fall and also his first play it seems to me that if these blues were meant for any living writer they were meant for him he does listen to himself painfully im sure and carefully sifts out as much truth as he can get hold of and nobody not even the very saintly gets a full dose he listens sounding himself and his rage and pain his courageous hope and loving concern all the seasons of his emotions are lucidly contained in his straightforward and gracious and aristocratic prose a prose without peer in contemporary english and graphically embodied in nearly every national magazine from mademoiselle to life to the cover of time we have a visual record of the man and his passion during his grueling whistlestop stumping for the congress on racial equality core baldwin has had the audacious tenacity to explore and attack two of our most sacrosanct totems sex and color and if he has like any writer approached his subjects with a revolutionary attitude still he has written about them with all the tenderness integrity love and courage befitting his care for america his concern for its destiny and future there is no easy way for americans to think about the subjects of color and sex because americans are used to thinking about both topics only as americans the only way we can think and we are an odd race whether the opiate is religion or sex gin or beer lsd or hallucinatory mushrooms we always find an excusecalling it a reasonan alley in which to hide or a diaper with which we gird our barely controlled loins we wear armor when we should go naked when silence is all that is required work because leisure causes anguish and fall asleep when labor is demanded all this is not meant to suggest that americans are somehow more stupid or less enlightened than say the french the swedish or the japanese rather as baldwin has pointed out innumerable times i want to suggest that no matter what your particular country may be there is always the special and unique problem of having to reevaluate the institutions of your land in terms of yourself not in the terms laid down by society as constituting your self social institutions and rules are i suppose always normative but when they become sacred and totemic they are totalitarian and dictatorial and what makes the initial venture in the examined life another country entirely so difficult and dangerous and often fruitless and destructive is that when one comes to criticize the totems of say sex and color one is immediately confronted with a seemingly insoluble dilemma you discover you are thinking in precisely those terms which the cause of your enquiry has already rejected as inadequate but this is if i understand him the journey baldwin has invited each of us to undertake the unexamined life is not worth living i conceive of my own life as a journey towards something i do not understand which in going toward makes me better he wrote in nobody knows my name i conceive of god in fact as a means of liberation and not a means of control and in the fire next time he returns to the concept of god grown totemic in the intervening years if the concept of god has any validity and any use it can only make us larger freer and more loving if god cannot do this then it is time we got rid of him james baldwin is a thin short man he is in his late thirties his face is a long oval his lips thick and broad and his two front teeth are divided by a gap his mouth is as conrad wrote of kurtzs voracious and his eyes are lively protruding from his head as if squeezed out by their thick lids it is his voice that surprises you at first then it is his concentration and the passion with which he delivers his sentences he speaks softly as if off the top of his soft palatte his rs come out as ahs his os with an aish sound and his face is softly composed almost maleable in its expressions but hard and determined from listening to himself he speaks easily and clearly and he is always willing to say that he hasnt an easy answer to that one or that his interlocutor is confused the terms are wrong we cant talk clearly about that yet and his face may break into a broad warm smile or he may laugh with a visceral ebullience peculiarly his own he is a beautiful man and a very brave one and a writer we should all be proud of especially when he presses our faces into slops of our own making in one of his finest essays a love letter to norman mailer called the black boy looks at the white boy baldwin makes a distinction marking out the difference between mailer and himself that will later appear as one of the fundamental axioms of the fire next time there is a difference though between norman and myself in that i think he still imagines he has something to save whereas i have never had anything to lose or perhaps i ought to put it another way the things that most white people imagine that they can salvage from the storm of life is really in sum their innocence it was this commodity precisely that i had to get rid of at once literally on pain of death i am afraid that most of the white people i have ever known have impressed me as being in the grip of a weird nostalgia dreaming of a vanished state of security and order against which dream unfailingly and unconsciously they have tested and very often lost their lives this essay caused an apparently irremedial rift between mailer and baldwin time and again mailer has snipped at baldwin in print baldwin has never replied the split came over baldwins criticism of mailers white negro the maileresque portrait of the american hipster and existentialist somewhere in the rebel albert camus wrote that every act of rebellion expresses a desire for order and a nostalgia for innocence and mailer and baldwin mutually enjoy the rebellious existential stance both are concerned with the same issues but their divergence is so radical and drastic that it often seems they inhabit altogether different worlds where baldwin is religious in some fundamental rockbottom sense mailer is romantic where mailer has gone into the penumbra of experience where he has traveled to the very edge and lingered too long and been wounded perhaps fatally baldwin has moved from the outskirts of the city into its epicenter and made his uncomfortable residence in the groundzero of the american heart consider the difference in the ubiquitous figure of the white negro mailer has come to terms with atrocity by romanticising it out of focus his hipster is white with a black soulwhich is junky the essence of hip his hipster lives we are told continually with the terms of death his benighted unconscious stamped with a limp metaphysical version of the extermination camp and the possibility of thermonuclear destruction that fire next time and his hipster is concerned with transcending the maddening mechanism of time of kicking it entirely and entering what cummings called the one hell of a universe next door the only example of such transcendence mailer has produced is sexual orgasm in short whether mailers effort is a brave one or a useless one his nipsterthe salvation of this cancerous worldis sadistic anally erouc an orgyhunter murderous and benumbed to such an extreme point that his only source of real pleasure lies in committing sexual atrocities but wnen atrocity becomes thus palatable and sweet however romanticised and apologised for one has produced the monstrosity of an intellectual buchenwald where true to their penultimate calling mailers hipsters are the guards at the outermost periphery of experience giggling in their towers and clutching their machine guns like a young lover his new bride necrophilia is not a way to come to terms with death and a romantic abstraction of the ghoul or necrophile is neither very hip nor very existential the pity of all this is that a fairly competent talent is wasting itself by merely reveling in the signs of a creeping putrefaction he diagnoses all around himself the american bedroom has become a private concentration camp baldwin said talking quietly on the themes of color and sex and sexuality sexual morality and sexual responsibility is one of the biggest themes an american writer can undertake its part of his responsibility as a writer an obligation to himself i suppose i put it in this way because america at least in its conversation comes on as so sexually enlightened and sophisticated well it simply isnt true baby in giovannis room a novel ostensibly concerned with a doomed homosexual relationship baldwin explores the notions of responsibility and morality in the beginning of the novel david meditates on his life with giovanni and on giovannis imminent death on the guillotine people cant unhappily invent their mooring post their lovers and their friends any more than they can invent their parents life gives these and also takes them away and the great difficulty is to say yes to life this and a few other sections from giovannis room have been recorded recently on calliope records on the back of this record there is a short illuminating quotation from the new york times in which baldwin states his attitude toward writing i think i really helplessly model myself on jazz musicians and try to write the way they sound i am not an intellectual not in the dreary sense that word is used today and do not want to be i am aiming at what henry james called perception at the pitch of passion in giovannis room and his third novel another country baldwin comes close to realizing this desired perception another country explores the problems created by color and sex in the lives of eight new yorkers it is written in a straight thirdperson narrative style and its hero and protagonist is a woman ida scott she is the only character in the book that baldwin simply presents to the reader unlike the other characters baldwin never analyzes ida revealing her motives and weaknesses to the reader encapsulated in several paragraphs ida reveals herself and she moves through new york like a fallen angel waiting for its wing to heal she has no delusions she is aware of her need for love and she is equally aware of the limitations imposed on her solely because of the color of her skin even this knowledge does not cause her to live or love resignedly she is to use an archaic phrase courageous and unlike the doomed giovanni or david ida also wounded and betrayed is still able to say yes to life without having to lick her wounds she has not made a peace she lives in a world of wartorn emotions and has come to terms with her world perhaps because she is such a stride forward for baldwin idas strength is in fact so great that she has forced life to come to terms with herself the virtues represented by ida scott become moral and philosophical principles in baldwins latest and most controversial book the fire next time fire is part autobiography part doomsday prophecy and part exhortation the spirit of rebellion camus writes in the rebel can only exist where a theoretical equality conceals great factual inequalities and the rebels most persistent gnawing question is is it possible to find a rule of conduct outside the realm of religion and its absolute value this is one of the basic questions posed in fire and in terms of this searching query the factual inequalities of the racial situation are brutally unmasked god gave noah the rainbow sign no more water the fire next time fire is a tough grim book its message is love and what gives the book its body and sinew is baldwins personal experience as an american negro incarcerated in harlem a ghetto in which he was set down to perish simply because his skin was black the details and symbols of his life constructed and preestablished for him long before his birth this is the more grisly aspect of a functioning totem and harlem in baldwins eyes is a kind of unguarded extermination camp in which the victims undo themselves because they have allowed themselves to believe what the man whites has said about them it is one thing and not an easy one by any means to be an american it is entirely something else to be both american and black yes it does mean something something unspeakableto be born in a white country an angloteutonic antisexual country black once we have learned to love each other then according to baldwin we shall no longer require the negro as a symbol and a scapegoat an essential ingredient in filthy jokes and a pornographically murky symbol of sexual prowess but if we refuse if we continue to hold the negro in abeyance the result might possibly be disastrous if one is permitted to treat any group of people with special disfavor because of their race or the color of their skin there is no limit to what one will force them to endure and since the entire race has been mysteriously indicted no reason not to attempt to destroy it root and branch this is precisely what the nazis attempted their only originality lay in the means they used it is scarcely worthwhile to attempt remembering how many times the sun has looked down on the slaughter of innocents i am very much concerned that american negroes achieve their freedom here in the united states but i am also concerned for their dignity for the health of their souls and must oppose any attempt that negroes may make to do to others what has been done to them whosoever debases others is debasing himself that is not a mystical statement but a most realistic one which is proved by the eyes of any alabama sheriffand i would not like to see the negroes ever arrive at so wretched a condition italics baldwins throughout this piece i have often compared baldwin to camus this comparison i believe is apt and precise baldwin like camus before him is staking his life on life itself and without the help or hindrance of religion he is looking for human nobility and grandeur in a world that is possibly heading toward selfdestruction nobility graciousness courage candor and bravery are pretty unhip concepts sin love and guilt have been laid to rest on the analytical couch and the spirit of rebellion has been totemised into managerial conformity but in the strong pen and compassionate heart of a small wiry relatively ugly man called james baldwin a kidnapped pagan we have a voice that embodies the dilemmas of our epoch in the same way that camus represented ourselves to us perhaps if the bones roll right in the future america will be very proud having produced a black replica of camus at this point i suppose all one can do is offer baldwin a few prayers the groundzero of the heart is far more dangerous a place to sit than the nomans land of the mind by robert baram after almost a century of blissful indifference only rarely jolted by an unavoidable headline the civil_rights story has made the front pages the american press failed to sense the big story until the sharp barbs of the news were so painful and so persistent that even a naive high school newspaper reporter would have been forced to react it was difficult to ignore the separate but equal ruling of the s the klan and its cross burnings made an occasional paragraph and the brutal lynchings managed to find their mark in the columns but only when the historic supreme court decision occurred did the members of the fourth estate begin to dig beneath the headlines and a couple of paragraphs until the sitins autherine lucy little rock and james meredith even the flurry had begun to subside in many a newsrooms apathy file one cannot point to ralph mcgill and his atlanta constitution and proudly shout there by the omnipotent journalism gods stands the mighty press it would be as inappropriate and inaccurate to picture mississippis governor ross barnett as the prototype politician the inexcusable fact is that the american press one can generalize in this instance waited stoically and in situ for the civil_rights story to come to it rather than going out aggressively and courageously to meet it it was so easy to locate irrespective of ones point of publishing even in our shiny makebelieve world of sports it was not the writers with their unique space and language prerogatives who brought jackie robinson and his brilliant afroamerican counterparts to the national pastime this small but significant act was written and produced by a quietvoiced retirementyears figure named branch rickey who some eight decades after appomattox smashed the long tolerated colorline in baseball true one could point to the finelypenned stories of the magnificent jesse owens and his championship efforts in the olympic games in then nazi germany but even then before and after the same sports writers were mentioning the negro leagues and some of their nonpareils more as gestures of curiosity than of shame or perish the thought to crusade they couldnt hide owens and his super achievements in the face of the socalled super race but it was easy to write off the other outstanding athletes of his race the willie mays hank aarons larry dobys and ernie banks of that era merely could look longingly at the minor and major leagues frustrated and ignored even in new england the press was supine new england where the underground railroad had flourished where william lloyd garrison and his liberator had championed the cause of slaverys abolition where humanitarian row stood mutely but majestically on brattle street and its environs the reverse freedom riders and some effective public protests finally have stirred editors to awakening and to action in june of this year the very able and respected associated press news analyst james marlow commented in one of his columns the great flurry now by the government churchmen mayors businessmen and others to speed up desegregation raises an embarrassing question for white people north and south why didnt it happen sooner the government and some churchmen mayors businessmen and othershad been moving but at a snails pace to end racial discrimination but negroes had to force on them the realization they hadnt done enough fast enough it is not irrelevant that marlow failed to include his own profession in his righteous denunciation even thoughtful and concerned journalists of marlows high character tend to view the responsibility of the press from the inside looking out only occasionally do its members take that exceedingly difficult look from the outside looking in and then they do so privately some correctly note that the american newspaper world has been no more the procrastinator in its belated recognition of the civil_rights issue than the other three professional estates this is the weakest and most cowardly rationalization of all the press is not a vast complex of community house organs designed to attack critical issues only when the management or the establishment feels that such action is inescapable a responsible press is obligated to move unhesitatingly into the arenas of controversy and calamity irrespective of whose oxen are gored surely one of the big stories within the civil_rights story itself was the escapism of members of the legal profession the teaching profession the religious and those of industry and government all of whom refused to use their special training and influence to tear the cancer of bigotry and inequality from the breast of the nation but where was the trenchant pen of the editor the cutting unrelenting coverage of the reporter the challenging paragraphs of the columnists the driving inspiration of publishers reporting of the civil_rights dilemma has been and still remains to a great degree highly sectionalized in style and in content hodding carter hazel brannon smith and recent pulitzer prize winner ira harkey jr join with georgias ralph mcgill and a handful of others as beacons in a sea of southern despair the three mississippi editorpublishers are not necessarily what one would term integrationists but they have at least had the courage to report the civil_rights story without a builtin hominy grits chittlins and chess pie bias they have shown unwillingness to move with the mob in the middle of red neck country in the face of economic sanctions very heartless and effective ones too the vilest of insults and the loss of lifetime friends their respect for the realities of the news in concert with mcgill little rocks harry ashmore and a select few have shown that the pages of the press may indeed be used to report fully and with fairness even in the terrifying face of hatred and fanaticism many southern editors and publishers are quick to point to the insipid or complete lack of birth control news reporting in northern newspapers this comparison is used as a rationalization for their own inadequate and myopic coverage of civil_rights although they are unquestionably correct about the spinelessness of most northern newspapers when the subject of birth control is whispered the analogy is as worthless as a chocolatecovered syllogism two ugly editorial wrongs make nothing right in life or in journalism more guilty than most have been our fabled columniststhey of the crystal ball set the rearvision mirrors the magical sources and the supernatural ouija boards where were lippman reston lewis jr lawrence the alsops and so many of them during the recent generations even these the socalled elite you classify them according to your own preferences touched the civil_rights story rarely followed it through not at all missed entirely in many cases in unwitting concert with the more bourgeois members of their journalism dailectic there is a tragic touch of stubbornness within the heart of the story of the press failure one finds that a great many members of the press are as unwilling to admit their belated awakening as the segregationists are unwilling to concede that a society that terms itself democratic cannot tolerate a slave system de facto or de jure one highly regarded magazine editor said to me i think that the american public was slower than the press on this one and that the press has pushed as hard as it could in view of audience interest which is always an inhibiting factor thus the old and battered canards are again put to useaudience interest and the slow american public slower than the press when editors talk that kind of drivel in it is not difficult to understand why this number one american story withered so long on the communications vine our newsmen cannot claim sudden awakening almost a quarterofacentury ago there were some highly regarded american reporters who recognized that the pressure cooker of civil_rights history in our nation was in danger of exploding a number of the nieman fellows at harvard university in the late thirties gathered regularly with some negro students to deliberate and discuss that subject among the harvard members of that exploratory dialogue was then law school grad student and currently usia legal counsel samuel allen allen recalls that the newspapermen concluded even then that civil_rights was americas priority news beat william lloyd garrison was saying that almost a century earlier he recognized the newsworthiness of the story and reported it in undiluted doses suffering the manhandling of a boston mob who found garrisons unrelenting jabs at their conscience most unpleasant civil_rights was and still is for many who prefer comfort and security above all an unpleasant subject the kind one would prefer to push aside or camouflage despite their special responsibility above that and beyond that of their readership the members of much of the press have subscribed to the same brand of escapist philosophy and immorality some of the northern newspapers have editorialized a good deal but close scrutiny reveals a fascination for afghanistanism as they point their aroused editorial anger at their southern neighbors ignoring the de facto segregation in their own natural circulation area were journalism a religion of orthodox character there would be a long and somber line to the confessionals for the great majority absolution would be highly unlikely to most new yorkers today to whom the word means anything fort greene means the fort greene flouses the largest public housing project in the city which stands between downtown brooklyn and the brooklyn navy yard to the eye it is mostly negro though the official figures show that a fifth of the apartments are occupied by whites and another fifth are occupied by puerto ricans it would probably surprise new yorkers who recall stories of gang fighting in the fort greene area to discover that above the housing project in a little park stands one of the major monuments in the city it commemorates the prison ship martyrs of the revolution and was designed by the great architects of new yorks age of elegance mckim mead white who also built the university club the columbia university campus the nyu hall of fame the pennsylvania station and the brooklyn museum this monument contains a great central column standing amidst urns and eagles a magnificent staircase down which one may approach the project a comfort station designed like a greek temple which puts the utilitarian structures of mr moses to shame from the site one may view the entire housing project and a good deal besides all this provides a rather grander setting for gang rumbles than they usually find it does not pay to extract too much symbolism from the accidental coming together of a mostly negro housing project and a great monument erected by an earlier city and yet one does not have to force the symbolism because between the new york represented by the monument and the new york of the housing project there is a close intimate link historical irony makes the elite of that older new york and the poor negroes of the project both for the most part protestant indeed more han half the protestants of new york who are only a quarter of the population are colored and since the work of the city is so often divided along religious lines it means that the old elite and its institutions churches charitable societies hospitalsoften find they have inherited a special responsibility for the negro fort greene is rich in symbols bordering the park to the south stands the huge bulk of the brooklyn technical high school one of the specialized high schools of the city system which have often served as the first step in the economic and social advance of many boys from earlier immigrant groups it is the potential bridge between the project and the monument numbers in the city had negroes there had been an increase of in ten years coming after an increase of during the s during the s the white population of the city dropped by almost a halfmillion the new york of was oneseventh negro see table new york of course is not alone in this great shift in population in deed it has a smaller proportion of negroes than other great northern cities in chicago was per cent negro philadelphia was more than onequarter negro and cleveland and detroit had even higher proportionsboth per cent new york is so enormous that even large population changes affect the proportions slowly in newark for example which is a city of the negro population increased by between and and newark became onethird negro but the kind of change that transforms a city the size of newark is for new york only a neighborhood shift the negro population is younger than the white though not as young as the puerto ricans thus it forms a higher proportion of both the school population and the juvenile delinquent population for demographic reasons alone there are of course other reasons why there are more negro juvenile delinquents in the next decade owing to the fact that about threetenths of new yorks schoolchildren almost all white attend parochial and private schools the negroes and puerto ricans will together exceed the rest of the public school population the negro population is still in large part new to the city in half of the entire nonwhite population of the city above the age of had come from the south these americans of two centuries are as much immigrant as any european immigrant group for the shift from the south to new york is as radical a change for the negro as that faced by earlier immigrants the negro immigrant has not had the good fortune of arriving with useful skills and strong institutions nor has he found a prosperous wellorganized negro community to help him the negro community in the city is indeed an old one but age has done nothing to prepare it to meet the problems of mass migration in before the first decade which saw a sizable migration from the south new york had negroes less than per cent of the population negro writers who remember that antebellum new york negro would often write about it with something like nostalgia but in those days aside from a tiny negro upper class of minor government employees and professionals the community consisted almost entirely of domestics laborers waiters unskilled workers negroes accepted an inferior place in society and in this inferior place despite the existence of distinctions of class and status poverty was matterofcourse and segregation was universal this group could do little for negroes coming up from the south and from the west indies during the first war the negro population increased rapidly in it was about per cent of the population in the s mass immigration from europe came to an end and the negro population of the city more than doubled the migrants poured into a new york in which they could not eat in a firstclass restaurant go to a firstclass hotel or get a job in the white world aside from some specially reserved government jobs above menial labor and yet the city did offer a large variety of jobs at pay much higher than negroes could get in the south and as important it offered harlem a more exciting and stimulating environment for negroes then than any other place in the country segregation helped make harlem alive it is hard to envisage as one walks the streets today with the buildings forty years older and the population greatly changed what harlem was like in the s in those days negro entertainers and musicians were a rarity on broadway and one had to go above th street to find them because of the unbroken pattern of segregation harlem included everyone in the negro communitythe old tiny upper class the new professionals and white collar workers the political leaders just beginning to take over the old political clubs the artists and entertainers and writers as well of course as the domestic workers the laborers and shady characters writing in james weldon johnson described a harlem few of us would now recognize but he helps explain the enormous attractions of new york even though the city did not offer the advantages of jobs in heavy industry available to negroes in chicago and detroit in nearly every other city in the country johnson wrote the negro section is a nest or several nests situated somewhere on the borders it is a section we must go out to in new york it is entirely different negro harlem covers one of the most beautiful and healthful sites in the whole city it is not a fringe it is not a slum nor is it a quarter consisting of dilapidated tenements it is a section of newlaw apartment houses and handsome dwellings with streets as well paved as welllighted and as wellkept as any in the city the question inevitably arises will the negroes of harlem be able to hold it will they not be driven further northward residents of manhattan regardless of race have been driven out when they lay in the path of business and greatly increased land values harlem lies in the direction that path must take so there is little probability that negroes will always hold it as a residential section this makes strange reading today it made strange reading only ten years later when another major negro writer claude mackay wrote a book on harlem ten years of depression had been for the negroes a disaster that almost rivaled slavery mackay quoted estimates that per cent of the population was on relief per cent held wpa jobs dependent on casual labor and household service without salaried jobs without businesses harlems residents suffered far more from the depression than any other part of the city white workers knew what it was to go two or three years without steady work but a case of special distress in the white world was the norm in the negro world harlem became more frightfully crowded than evereven though there were high vacancy rates in adjacent east harlembecause the population was so impoverished the negro population continued to rise through natural increase and migration but much more slowly than in the s in on the eve of world war ii it stood at with the war a new period in the history of the negro in new york city began the age of harlem as the seat of the negro renaissance and of depression misery drew to a close as new areas of negro settlement in brooklyn the bronx queens and the suburban counties were opened up and rapidly increased the war created a new new york for the negroesnew in the kinds of neighborhoods where they lived the kinds of jobs they held the role they played in politics and social life and in their image of themselves and their relation to other groups central in this transformation of the negro position was a revolution in the level of income that was typical and in the kinds of jobs that became accessible leadership politics intergroup relations whatever the situation in other communities the negroes of harlem and other new york communities are deeply involved in politics they register and vote in substantial proportions their newspapers keep up a continual flow of political news they are active in club membership and in the support of political leaders clearly politics is seen as an area in which to advance the interests of individuals and the group what do negroes want out of politics what everyone else wants jobs on all levels from the most humble to the highest recognition and prestige and the advancement of group interests it is perfectly clear on the national level what policies are necessary to advance group interests but new york is not washington and not the south there is no insuperable problem in getting almost any law or policy against discrimination in almost any area adopted and in getting it enforced the issue is will it really be helpful if it is a matter of getting the right to register and vote or integrating the restaurants political activity can be clear direct and effective but there are no such simple political objectives left for negroes in new york there are already laws against discrimination in employment and housing and while their administration can undoubtedly be improved the agencies that enforce them the city commission on human rights and the state commission for human rights have negro heads or high officials and negro staff membersthere is not much more to be done along this line the board of education actively tries to integrate the schools there is no discrimination in higher education there is probably no discrimination in restaurants and hotels it is hard to see how it could be maintained in the face of the influx of african emissaries and officials the committee on civil_rights in manhattan found in a sampling of east side restaurants in that more than twofifths were discriminating it rechecked in and discrimination had dropped to per cent since it has had only five reports of discrimination and it now considers this problem settled and the main problem to be housing in new york city it seems there are no easy problems any more or easy solutions the improvement of the negro economic position requires such complex and farflung operations that it is hard to see how it can be made a simple political issue it involves such matters as retraining the unskilled better education all along the line stronger motivation so that people will take advantage of retraining and education opportunities changing the structure of new yorks economy changing the role of the unions even if new york were to adopt a minimum wage of an hour the effect might well be to increase the level of unemployment among negroes to a midwest level rather than to improve their general economic situation in housing as in wages and employment the need is for radical policies that make improvement in the situation in general and these are not particularly attractive to negro political leaders in the city or any others for that matter they do not urge that lowcost and other governmentsupported housing be restricted to vacant land sites which is the one sure way of increasing the overall supply of lowcost housing in the city such a policy would mean that they preside over areas of decaying slums while their supporters escape to greener fields instead one finds the popular program of attacking landlords for inadequacy of maintenance proposing ever harsher measures to enforce good maintenance demanding more frequent and more severe inspections by city agencies these are worthwhile policies but to concentrate on inspecting a declining and aging stock of lowcost housing does little to increase it or to deal with the conditions that make it possible for landlords to get high rents for crumbling apartments the kind of political courage that would be involved in tracing out the real impact of rent control on different groups in the city is simply not heard of in american politics in effect there is little public discussion among those active in city politics of policies except in response to the most blatant scandals there is certainly no more than this low average of discussion among negro political leaders there is probably less in recent years the emphasis has been on political jobs all good things are scarce and involve conflicts and on the question of the proportion of jobs in city elective and appointive posts held by negroes we find rancor and bitterness and strains on old political alliances and allegiances there is nothing really new hereevery new group tries to get the nominations and jobs it feels it is entitled to and these are always more than the older groups which fought their way up to a certain proportion of jobs and nominations in the past feel the new group has a right to but who is to determine what is the right proportion congressman powell in demanded that negroes should get per cent of the jobs in a democratic city administration since per cent of the enrolled democrats in manhattan are negro he said they held only per cent of high political postscommissionerships board memberships judgeships even so negroes are doing better at getting political jobs in new york than anywhere else in the country chicago having about to negroes has only three negro judges new york having about negroes has seventeen judges two supreme court justices one general sessions judge four city magistrates three domestic relations court judges six municipal court judges and one city court judge this comes to just about per cent of the judicial offices in the city in addition in new york city unlike chicago many negroes hold administrative positions at the cabinet and subcabinet level whatever the strains in politics the clubs and committees form one of the most important arenas in which the people of different groups meet and test each others feelings and capacities and powers new yorks politics serves much more as such a meeting ground than its business certainly more than its formal social life and probably as much as its cultural life new york has good race relations and it has been helped in this by a number of factors the city does not have politically powerful neighborhood homeowning groups electing their representatives to the city councils to fight the spread of the negro community and the taxsupported expansion of social services in any case the city council in new york is weak it is the board of estimate dominated by officials elected by the entire city electorate and the mayor who wield effective powerand these are far more susceptible to the city wide negro vote the important role of culture in the city means that talent and genius have a status which transcends group membership and which is not found as commonly in other american cities and then the remarkably varied group life all through the citys history means that all the groups have been somewhat mellowed in their attitudes toward other groups and that new yorks irish and italians are probably somewhat more tolerant in their outlook than irish and italian groups in other cities this mellowness is aided by the large proportion of jews who traditionally and probably because of their traditional lack of power have learned to eschew violence and favor negotiation and conciliation and liveandletlive policies and yet within this context of overall good relations it is just in relations with the jews despite their generally liberal outlook nonviolent temperament and their similar experience as a minority facing problems of discrimination that an observable level of tension has recently developed it would be easy to exaggerate this tension sensitive just as the negroes are and also timid and vulnerable jews inflate small incidents then contributing to our awareness of this tension there is the fact that the jewish community supports as italians and irish do not professional organizations devoted to good intergroup relations this means that any sign of tension immediately becomes the focus of specialized professional concern sometimes from several different jewish groups and is rapidly brought to the attention of leaders in the jewish and negro groups and appropriate governmental agenciesscad coir the police the mayors office the governor perhaps so it is easy to exaggerate the degree of tension that exists between negroes and jews and yet it exists its existence at all is paradoxical and since it also involves to some extent the somewhat frayed relationship of the negroes to political liberalism in general it is worth examining to begin with antijewish feeling is endemic among negroes as professor kenneth clark and novelist james baldwin have at different times observed in the jewish magazine commentary because the negroes keep bumping into the jews in front and ahead of them expanding into jewish neighborhoods in manhattan the bronx and brooklyn less so in queens negroes become the customers of the many jewish shopkeepers that have remained behind they become the tenants of the jewish owners of property whatever the personal qualities of shopkeepers and landlords negroes are thus often in contact with jews who are making a living from them the tension between landlord and tenant in new york and particularly landlord and lowincome tenant is in any case extreme and it is understandable that it takes very little for it to become tinged with antisemetic feeling but in addition to this large range of unfortunate contacts the negro also meets the jew as an employer this is likely in a city that is onequarter jewish the likelihood is increased because of the heavy jewish concentration in the citys small manufacturing in garment factories in small plants assembling electrical products toys and novelties plastic products and the like the negro operative in lowwage jobs is likely to find he has a jewish employer once again here is a situation in which a natural conflict of interests can be interpreted in group terms and is likely to contribute to the strengthening of traditional stereotypes of jews to boot the negro is even likely to find in many of the new york industries in which he is employed that the union has a jewish leadership and jewish staff and he resents this thus in the lowwage laundry industry a negro and puerto rican working force is represented by a union whose top leadership is jewish the worker does not know nor perhaps is it relevant that these men may have built this union at great sacrifice twenty and thirty years before all he knows is where his dues are going and who is on the payroll there is one particular form of negrojewish conflict which is too important not to mention trivial as it may appear and that is the large number of negro women engaged in domestic labor for jewish housewives many of these contacts have produced good relationships but they have also led to the feelings of exploitation and resentment that are almost inevitable in the masterservant relationship in a democratic society one can hazard the guess too that the democratic ethos of jewish lifewhich explains why jewish waiters are the worst in new york probably also helps to make many jewish women poor employers of domestic help the democratic camaraderie of the jewish housewife with her negro servant alternating with the uncomfortable haughtiness of someone not used to a servant might both tend to create more resentment than the steady formal relationship maintained by housewives with a longer tradition in the use of domestic help perhaps too the liberal jewish housewife feels guilty in relationship to her negro servant and this too might lead to the complementary feeling that the guilt is justified in any case it is interesting that one study which has gone into this matter shows a stronger feeling of antisemitism among negro women than negro men and the authors suggest that this masterservant relationship may be the cause even the middleclass negro often meets the jew in a situation in which one is formally an inferior the other formally a superior as negroes move into the governmental agencies which are one of the most important areas of employment for the upwardly mobile they come into contact with all the groups that have preceded them but in particular they come into contact with the group that got there before themjews vho in the s entered government service in large numbers this means that the negro schoolteacher now often works under a jewish principal that the negro social worker very often has a jewish supervisor the top social worker james dumpson commissioner of social welfare is a negro on the whole these relationships between teachers and social workers whose training and work tend to develop a high degree of tolerance and insight have been productive of some of the healthiest and most satisfying interracial relationships that one may find anywhere nevertheless the relationship between inferior and superior in a hierarchy is inevitably tensionproducing and the conflict between different people is always subject to interpretation in group terms thus the dissatisfaction over social services for negroes and in particular the fact that they are run by whites and do not give sufficient jobs to negroes often takes the form of complaints against jews and jewish agencies an inevitable byproduct of the distribution of wealth teachers doctors and social workers in the city for example under a banner headline they let them die the amsterdam news reported on february dr raphael gamso the new superintendent of harlem hospital admitted to the amsterdam news that he ignored dr aubrey maynard director of surgery when he permitted resident doctors from mt sinai to enter harlem hospital and pick out a number of negro patients whom they carried off to mt sinai for experimentation what actually happened was that service at the city harlem hospital almost collapsed as a result of a shortage of physicians and mt sinai a jewish voluntary hospital agreed to take a number of cases it seems to have selected over dr maynards protest some of the more interesting ones a month later the amsterdam news attacked the higher horizons program and in particular its director daniel schreiber and its reporter wrote while the program experiments with negro children there is a dearth of negro teachers connected with the program particularly at the administrative or policy making level amsterdam news march disproportion in wealth and power introduces a hazardous element into the best relationships our latin american neighbors who know us so well and in so many ways seem capable of turning in the twinkling of an eye from friends to enemies so too in the case of negrojewish relationships the good relationships cannot help but be affected by the disproportion in power whatever the good will on both sides just as in underdeveloped countries governments insist that the foreign investor take on a certain proportion of native employees so have the political organizations of harlem insisted that the jewish storekeeper have negro employees and so too they now demand that he use negro salesmen they lack only the ultimate power of expropriation but if they did jewish and other white business might fare as badly in harlem as the american investments in mexican oil or in cuba we can press our colonial analogy a bit further for if the jews in an earlier parallel to colonialism may be seen as exploiters they are also paralleling the later development of colonialism those who help and assist the deprived group this role is if anything more exasperating than the former one negroes know that in new york jews play a disproportionate role in pushing for the kind of policies that help negroes it is true that these policiesfair employment practices fair educational practices fair renting practiceshad their origin on the agenda of jewish organizations at a time when they were as important for jews as they were for negroes but the fact is that as times changed as they became more definitely policies in which jewish selfinterest was less clearly involved jewish organizations with their rich resources in money staff and contacts continued to press for them very often negroes were drawn into these activities and while they played an important role the largely jewish liberal organizations pushing for these policies soon became aware of the very different levels of participation organization and moneyraising capacity in the two communities james wilson tells the story of the most effective of these organizations which had their origin in the activities of jewish liberal civil_rights agencies the fight for an open occupancy ordinance in new york city the bill banning discrimination in housing was led by the new york state committee against discrimination in housing nyscdh it was created largely at the instigation of the leading jewish organizations in new york in after the failure of a court attack on the stuyvesant town antinegro policies four major state laws and two new york city ordinances were passed in large part due to the efforts of this and related organizations white primarily jewish groups have been the most important single factor in the committee from the first an effort was made to involve negroes in its work and a sizeable number of prominent negroes have played important roles and occupied top positions most of this negro support has come from the ranks of negro professionals who are officers or executives of other organizations public and private with an interest in housing some important white leaders of the committee however wish in addition for negro grassroots support those who work together in such organizations represent part of that alliance of liberal and minority forces which has played such an important role in the city for thirty years but on the other side there are the grassroots elements who are relatively distant from such activities and the press and political leaders who talk to them and it is as easy to arouse resentment and prejudice against a more advantaged group that is being helpful particularly if there are other contributing factors as against another that is more distant more powerful and more hostile finally there is and again the colonial analogy is helpful the central problem of political representation jewish and of course nonjewish too political leaders who have for years represented neighborhoods that have changed to negro and puerto rican occupancy have discovered that regardless of their votes in civil_rights and other issues the negros want the job for themselves it is against this background that the exposure in of borough president hulan jacks connection with a jewish real estate developer and his trial for accepting a financial favor from him was particularly exasperating for it so happened that it was the crusading new york post that uncovered this relationship in the course of a longextended investigation into public policies affecting housing the new york post had a jewish publisher a jewish editor and a large jewish readership it is also true it has the most distinguished negro reporter in the city it had the only negro columnist on a nonnegro newspaper and a large negro readership but all this did not matter the post became the villain of the case of what was referred to darkly as the plot to drive negroes from public life and it was implied too that it was a liberal and jewish plotin view of the prevailing political outlooks in new york a jewish plot would have to be a liberal plot and vice versa meanwhile about the same time the longdelayed trial of adam clayton powell for income tax evasion came up even though jews had little to do with this and even liberals had little to do with it the threat to the top elective jobs which negroes held touched such sensitive spots that this was irrationally also considered part of the jewish and liberal betrayal of the negro and indeed there is a strong element of rationality in the irrational amalgam for whatever the attitudes of liberals on civil_rights in new york city they are tied up with good government forces represented best by the jewishowned new york times and a large part of the negro community will not feel very sympathetic toward those who search out every example of financial gain from public office while no leader in the group will openly favor illegal gain it may seem unfair to negroes that their representatives in public office do not get the gains from it that members of other groups have in the past alas times have changed and it is harder and harder to make anything from public office in any case whatever some negroes thought privately about hulan jacks dealings with unger hardly a voice was raised against him everyone supported himeven the ministers now admittedly everything we have to say to explain negrojewish relations is also true to some extent of italiannegro and irishnegro relations and yet there is less feeling expressed against the irish and italians perhaps for many negroes subconsciously a bit of antijewish feeling helps make them feel more completely american a part of the majority group there are probably other irrational bases for this antijewish feelingantisemitism is a complicated thingand yet the special tieup of jews with liberalism is certainly important but political issues as well as personalities symbols and the fate of private attempts at gain do play a role in the developing tension between negroes and liberals despite the fact that the battle over civil_rights is a regular occasion for northern liberals to match themselves against southern democrats at national political conventions negroes cannot help feeling that liberals do not quite do enough the liberals are part of the same party that includes the south as well as most of the new york negro voters and are always open to the charge of holding back in the fight for civilrights bills how much of ones time and influence should one devote to this issue how much else should one let go from the negro point of view whatever time and effort one devotes are hardly enough what this means then is a steady strain between the liberal and the negro which can often become quite bitter the bill of complain then is that the liberals frame the negroes they dont put up enough of them or give them enough recognition they dont fight hard enough for civil_rightsin fact they hypocritically fight just hard enough to get negro votes and the reaction has been a new rise of negro exclusivism and nationalism the feeling that negroes have to go it alone and should trust no one but themselves and the idea that any disinterested common action with democraticminded whites for public policies to improve the condition of negroes is an illusion an extremist element has been a permanent part of northern negro life since the s it has recently rapidly increased in strength stimulated by frustration over the south and the rise of independent african states the nation of islam black muslims and similar groups are not likely in view of the much higher level of education and sophistication among negroes today to be anywhere nearly as successful as marcus garvey was in the s more important however is the adoption of this exclusivist feeling by a wide range of negro leaders publicists and intellectuals this development has been as rapid and sudden as the leap in the number of independent states in africaand the two phenomena are not unrelated the impact of twenty independent negro states all with representatives at the un in new york is already striking and while some of the africans are patronizing the beauty parlors of harlem many american negroes going the other way are discovering that they can leave their hair unstraightened there is quite a difference between the subtle and complicated early essays of james baldwin on the relationship of negroes to america and his writing in scarcely less subtle but envisaging the possibility of a much more radical divorce of the negroes from white america than he had earlier contemplated there is an even sharper difference between the subtle and somewhat amused treatment of african nationalism in lorraine hansberrys play raisin in the sun and the passion of her advocacy of african and american negro nationalism in there are obviously many types of exclusivism and even so this is only one part of the spectrum of opinion to be found among negro leaders a philip randolphs american negro labor council organized in is exclusivist but it exists to exert pressure on a labor movement from which he does not wish if possible to isolate himself the leaders of the national urban league and the naacp and core resist the exclusivist trend and still include many whites though the proportion of whites in leadership and on the staffs declines as men of ability and training in the negro community grow more abundant these organizations still represent the old negroliberal alliance the local naacp branches in new york and elsewhere include few whites and are far more exclusivist in their outlook and the gap between them and the new nationalist groups is not so great it is to this grassroots nationalism and exclusivism that adam clayton powell and the amsterdam news appeal here when an attack is made on liberal allies the assumption is that they are not allies at all but enemies what the future of this exclusivist outlook and feeling will be it is hard to say but it does not seem that it can be more than a temporary tendency no group or interest gets very far alone in american politics particularly in new york city there are too many groups too many interests for anyone to adopt the attitude that its strength its numbers require little cooperation with and accommodation to others whatever the psychological satisfactions of the present mood it is doubtful that it is the way to get gains for the negro community in jobs in influence in prestige or in practical policies one can reject white standards of beauty one can devote oneself to the study of african history and culture one may support the policy of african states there will be more and more of this and this is all to the good but africa and nationalism and exclusivism will have as little to do in changing the conditions of american negro life as israel and zionism have to do with the conditions of american jewish life emigration is only for the few the problems are here and they must be solved here and the main impact of the nationalist mood sincere and passionately felt as it is will be to serve more flexible politicians and leaders in getting gains and concessions we have indicated often enough our feeling that negro communal organization is weak and insufficient to make much impact on the great needs of the poorer and disorganized part of the community as oscar handlin wrote in his study of negroes and puerto ricans in new york the ability of new groups to develop an adjustment that would assure the individuals involved a healthy creative life depended both on the nature of the hurdles to be surmounted and on the resources available for doing so the hardships of the negroes and puerto ricans arise from the fact that the hurdles are unusually high and the resources unusually meager one must read the negro new york newspaper with its regular appeals to the community to raise pitifully small sums for the local y or other institutions to discover how fantastically difficult it is to raise money in the negro community handlin points out that when sydenham hospital was integrated it also shifted from a voluntary to a municipal hospital two sets of institutions manage to raise money those fighting segregation and for equal rights naacp nul core though they raise less than they need and much of that comes from whites and the negro churches in the negro communities of new york as elsewhere in the country it is difficult to underestimate the importance of the negro churches when one says negro church it is possible the image of the storefront sect stomping and hollering taking outlandish names and twisting the common heritage into strange forms still comes to the mind of many whites it is not these churches that we speak of though they of course exist are important in the lives of the people involved and are also of some weight in politics we have in mind the large institutional churches in wellequipped buildings with various group activities with associated social services with a large membership and a prominent minister these churches which elsewhere in america for most groups and for most vital areas of concern are fifth wheels are in colored america and in colored new york in the center of things and they play a role in politics that the churches of no other group can aspire to or would dare to it is not unimportant that adam clayton powell new yorks first negro congressman is a minister that gardner taylor the only negro member of the new york board of education in was also a ministerand that both men lead particularly large churches baptist claiming members it is also not without significance that milton galamison former head of the naacp of brooklyn and one of the most prominent figures in the fight to desegregate schools is also a minister of a large church presbyterian james h robinson of the presbyterian church of the master ran for borough president on the liberal party ticket and was spoken of as a successor to hulan jack there are other ministers who play some role in politics and the new york negro minister is in general far less cautious in indicating his preferences from the pulpit than the white minister the negro newspapers regularly devote a great deal of space to church activities and report on the politics of the national denominations in the greatest detail in and there was a bitter struggle going on in the national baptist convention for leadership between gardner taylor of new york and j h jackson of chicago it was headline news in the negro press it is not untypical of negro church politics that after a wild convention in the matter ended up in courtbut the court refused to take jurisdiction this battle involved the fundamental question of the attitude of the church to the new militancy of negroes in south and north but the main point to notice is that it is not often that an issue that is as central as this to a group becomes the basis of struggle in white denominations when j h jackson was victorious in one of his first steps was to remove martin_luther_king from a position in the baptist organization we have magnificent descriptions of the old fundamentalist storefront church in literature for example james baldwins go tell it on the mountain and we have good sociological descriptions of these churches no one has yet described the negro middleclass churches which seem often to make up for the loss of fundamentalist fervor by becoming as heatedly involved in the secular political struggles that affect negroes it is this kind of church that is rapidly becoming the dominant type of church we find as part of the middleclass development among negroes that the same social changes that have made the city church a problem for white protestants may begin to make it a problem for negroes members are beginning to move away from the areas in which the big churches are located to the suburbs the church becomes to some degree the institution of an absentee membership and new ethnic elements move into the neighborhood around the church with no relationship to it and just as the white churches long ago had to consider what to do as their neighborhoods changedand the majority sold out and followed the membership with a few remaining to serve a peculiar function as city churchesso we find some negro churches considering the problem of a new puerto rican group around its doors here and there in brooklyn and the bronx negro ministers are beginning to think in terms of a mission to the puerto ricans just as some white churches are finally beginning to think in terms of a mission to the surrounding negroes and just as conservative members of the white protestant churches find it hard to think in terms of a universal church open to all so do some negroes used to the comfortable community church the only institution that is entirely theirs find it hard to envisage bringing in puerto ricans but the mere fact that negro churches must begin to think in these terms shows to what an extent they have become part of american protestantism participating in its intellectual and theological development and its problems gardner taylor has served as head of the protestant council of new york j archie hargraves minister of brooklyns nazarene congregational church became secretary of the board of home missions of the congregational christian church in since the same factors affect them that long ago made their impact on white protestants one may see the signs of the time when secularization and specialization will affect the negro churches as they affect the older protestant denominations and when these churches will be less flamboyant but also very likely less influential the day will come in the negro church when the minister is not wealthier than his parishioners and at that time the minister will not wield the influence that he does today interestingly enough even the development of elijah muhammads temples of islam suggests the change in negro religion and politics it does not have the flamboyance of either marcus garvey or father divine it emphasizes traditional virtues as do all storefront churches no smoking drinking women but less because these are sinful than because by saving his money and devoting himself to his business the negro may make himself wealthy and successful this is indeed a nationalist and racist movement but it is surprising how much of horatio alger there is in it tooand that reflects a great change in the negro community elijah muhammads young men remind some people of fascists and yet they wear dark business suits and are proud of their selfrestraint and their discipline the temple of islam service an admirer of the movement tells us is sober and restrainedonly handclapping greets a point well made thus even the most extreme of presentday negro movements suggests the extent of the shift to middleclass patterns and the power they now possess in a community of a million people one can see pretty much what one wants and this is as true for negroes as for any other group one can see the large mass of problems that are high up on the agenda of city government and civic groupscrime delinquency the breakdown of family responsibility and one can see the increasing numbers who achieve middleclass status and for whom the only problems are those created by the prejudiced and discriminatory behavior of others one can see demagogic selfserving leaders in politics and church and civic activity incapable of seeing any problem except those created by the white man and one can see an increasing body of competent leaders very often professionals on the staffs of private and public agencies quite up to facing directly and squarely the problems of the group and who yet give no ground in their insistence on equality one can see the huge ghetto concentrations and one can see the ever larger areas of integration in work civic activity politics housing one can dole out an evenhanded justice saying on the one hand there is this on the other that and it is true among a million people there will be enough examples for any argument and yet how do we cast the final balance how do we envisage the future here there are no agreedon scales there is only the judgment of those who try to see the whole picture in the light of past history and to discern future trends our own judgment is that in the north a new phase in negro leadership must begin the era of the leaders who sought accommodation to an exploitative white world has come to an end everywhere even in the south the era of the leaders of protest has been in full swing in new york for a good twentyfive years though it has only recently arrived in the south its achievements in the city have been great but it is now entering an era of diminishing returns and because there are as a matter of fact few additional gains to be made in new york city by protest the protest leadership shows a tendency to become irrational shrill and ineffective the situation in other citiesfor example chicagoand in the south is entirely different but the worst of it is that important tasks necessary ones on the agenda of american negroes are shirked and ignored these are tasks that conceivably no one but negroes can do it is probable that no investment of public and private agencies on delinquency and crimeprevention programs will equal the return from an investment by negroled and negrofinanced agencies it is probable that no offensive on the public school system to improve the educational results among negroes will equal what may be gained from an equivalent investment by negroled and negrofinanced groups and an increase in the numbers of negro teachers and principals it is possible that no effort to change the patterns of the negro lowerclass family will be effective at a time when the white family is in disorder when strong families of whatever kind native and ethnic show signs of disintegration but if anything can be done it is likely that negro agencies will be far more effective than public agencies and those of white protestants succeeding the period of accommodation then and the period of protest one can detect the need for a period of selfexamination and selfhelp in which the increasing income and resources of leadership of the group are turned inwards and already a few voices are raised to make just this point this is the argument that john h johnson publisher of ebony and jet suggested at the convention of the national urban league ebony it should be pointed out is itself rather more selfhelp oriented than the protestrooted negro newspapers and its circulation in new york is probably greater than that of the local new york weekly negro community newspaper the amsterdam news this is the argument of carl t rowan the distinguished negro reporter in an article in the saturday evening post everywhere in america the argument can be met by the counterargumentlet the white world reform itself first even in new york one can say this and most negro leadership does but the question is whatever the origins of the burden on whose shoulders does it fall and how can it best be overcome
by rev c eugene askew recently i was asked to be a part of a tv panel on the subject should one vote for political candidates who profess no religion in a prebroadcast discussion of the topic at home my children rendered their verdict that one should vote for political candidates with no religion only if they happened to be the best qualified candidates it seemed perfectly obvious to us that our elected leaders should be those who best represent the total interests of all their constituents certainly a candidates religion is to be considered as one aspect of the data about him as long as one remembers that this aspect is only one part of the data it seems to me that one should approach in a similar fashion the question would i want my daughter to marry a negro the same answer should be given by white parents to this question as should be expected from negro parents to a similar question would you want your daughter or son to marry a white boy or girl the answer to both questions if one really has the happiness and welfare of ones child at stake should be only if he or she will make the best husband or wife among the available choices this discussion is not an academic one for me i have one son age and daughters ages and our family is an unusually happy and closelyknit one whoever marries one of four children is in a sense going to be marrying our family whether he likes it or not children in the united states do not always or even usually select mates according to their familys desires but i do not believe that any of our children will be permanently and happily married except to someone who in a reasonable way has the approval of i the other four children the choice of their friends therefore is a matter of continuing family interest furthermore the time of dating and courtship is not far away and in all likelihood will occur partially at raciallyintegrated colleges and universities the philosophy i and ideals of our family will be the primary influence we shall have upon our childrens actions in those crucial years therefore i repeat the question asked in this article is not academic it is a matter of great personal importance to every member of our family more than that however it is a matter of religious and social importance to people everywhere there are many religiously and socially liberal people both black and white who admit privately that integration and its foundation stone the belief in the brotherhood of manwill inevitably lead to the possibility of more racial intermarriages but they ask why disturb the progress being made in other areas of racial relations succeeding generations will not find intermarriage either a social or an emotional problem each individual will be accepted for his own personal worth in marriage and in all other areas without reference to color still others both black and white insist that what the negro wants is an environment that will produce freedom of movement and occupational educational and economic opportunities given this environment he will not either desire or seek intermarriage i cannot agree with either of these opinions although i am more in sympathy with the former segregationists in my judgment are entirely correct in contending that integration will inevitably lead to more racial intermarriage although i believe there may well be less sexual exploitation of the negro race and less illegitimacy quite likely negro young people may come to respect themselves more and act accordingly than has sometimes been possible in the past there will be no real and permanent equality until we quit thinking in terms of skin color if people really are equal why should the color of ones skin make a difference in marriage i can find no satisfying scientific or religious reasonsonly social and economic prejudices since social customs change slowly except under revolutionary conditions it is highly important that we get used to ideas which normally have to precede actions furthermore it is not only a matter of what the negro wants if the equality doctrine is valid then why should white boys and girls be denied the privilege of marrying some negroes who may have more to offer as marriage partners than some white boys and girls i am quite certain that some negro parents would not want their children to marry my children and viceversa even if other social prejudices in our environment were eliminated but where negro and white families do find compatibility there is no logical reason why their offspring should not marry across racial lines if all men really are brothers what i am now saying to the general public i have been preaching directly and indirectly for over years if i am not to be guilty of that ancient religious custom of giving lip service to one set of doc trines while actually living by another then i must not now reverse myself when the basic issues about equality brotherhood and love are on the verge of becoming personal in a way they have not yet been i must not encourage other people to do what i am unwilling to do myself fortunately however although as a native southerner i was reared in an environment actively opposed to the thesis of this article i find no difficulty in advocating intermarriage for my children nor will this article come as a shock to them they have been taught to discuss all issues openly and fully in an attempt to discover what is true and right for each particular situation they are being taught the pros and cons on both interracial and interreligious marriages and they know their mother and father love them and will love their mates whether those choices be white negro catholic jew atheist protestant hindu rich poor or previously married one should be able to work for ones convictions and to oppose bigotry effectively and courageously without ignoring the need for understanding of those whose opinions and actions differ from ours some people of this present age will never be able to face the problems presented by intermarriage our children however would think of a racial intermarriage except for present social complica tions as they would think of any other marriage they have been trained for the world of tomorrow where men will learn to live together as brothers or else live under authoritarianism or not at all our youngest daughters middle name is lakshmi the name of a hindu goddess deliberately chosen to remind her and her generation that the world no longer can afford racial religious and national prejudices several years ago i served three years as the minister of a racially integrated congregational church in new york state one of our young people there came from a fine religious family which was constantly growing in its view points recently this girl an attractive brilliant and talented graduate of an outstanding eastern college for women married a struggling ministerial student with an oriental heritage this was not surprising to my wife and me nor was it surprising to see the understanding way the girls parents leaders in their community reacted to the marriage a small town new york girl does not ordinarily marry an oriental boy especially when such a gifted girl could go on to further education and a promising career of her own but the girls marriage and the reaction of her family were logical results of her familys depth and her own training her church had prepared the way with its own inclusiveness of all races and of widelyvarying opinions several families including ours in that church used a dental clinic where white technicians worked for negro dentists with an apparent acceptance of the situation as entirely normal and right nevertheless there are always dangers in any marriage outside the group of ones peers religiously racially culturally nationally and financially pioneers in changing established social customs always pay a pricesometimes an exorbitant onefor their defiance of the status quo all priests rabbis and ministers to the best of my knowledge urge caution in such marriages sometimes partly out of bigotry but usually out of primary concern for the young people involved all of us are somewhat suspicious of and prejudiced against what is unfamiliar to us at best permanent and happy marriages are hard to come by as is evii denced in the high divorce rate and the large number of continuing but loveless and problembesieged homes even if young people themselves are able to surmount the barriers of picking mates from different backgrounds their idealism and daring is not always shared by their families parents do not have the advantage of the sexual aspect of love in judging their childrens mates and adjusting to them and as far as sex is concerned there is no guarantee that permanent satisfying sexual adjustments will be made in interracial marriages more so than in other more ordinary marriages many young people discover after marriage that the sexual compatibility they supposed they had is not the reality they had expected either through their rosecolored idealism or their possible premarital sexual relationships the problems of sexual adjustment can be serious indeed with the added complications of intolerant relatives in particular and society in general and the day will inevitably come when one has to face up to the psychological scars and other social punishments ahead for the children of intermarriageschildren never fully accepted in either negro or white circles i would like to urge my children also to be aware of possible confused values within themselves when i was a divinity school student in the early s i occasionally heard of some white girl who had granted small sexual favors to negro boysfavors which she would not have granted to white boys it is not the purpose of this article to compare present day sexual behavior of young people with that of my generation either favorably or unfavorably but whatever ones standards are and whether one is black or white those standards should not be lowered in one area in order to demonstrate ones ideals in another area this too is discrimination for example our family did not go as patients to the abovementioned dentists because they were negro we went because we believed that they were the best available dentists in the area if we had thought available white dentists did superior work we would have used them no matter who said we were prejudiced so i will be disappointed if my children date andor marry negroes merely because they are negro i also hope they will seek to find suitable dates andor marriage partners among young people most like themselves religiously culturally economically nationally and racially but if our children and circumstances decide otherwise my wife and i hereby pledge love and understanding to them their mates their inlaws their friends and our grandchildren it is going to be easier in the world of tomorrow for racial intermarriages to succeed but easy or not should our children decide to marry interracially we will be proud of them for their contribution to social conditions that must come in time life among white liberals these fierce days j nr v of combat between ii negroes and segregationiss t itle at tention is given to questionable white liberals while many liberals are truly on the level there are some who deserve closer scrutiny for it is imperative that negroes learn how to recognize and weed out liberal impostors just as it is important that genuine white liberals know how to behave when in the company of negroes understand me i have nothing whatever against white liberals it is only that they do not know quite how to stay in their proper places of course some of my best friends are liberals and i have watched them at close range from coast to coast while i found particularly useful the usual approaches of social anthropologists touring primitive tribes and similar aggregations i do not intend to subject the reader to the rigors of scientific anthropology suffice it to say then that while white liberals proved to be a rather mongrel breed they did fall into discernible categories ii any wealth of data poses the problem of just where to begin but let us start quite arbitrarily with the roving inquirers this species appears to be motivated more by a nosy streak an insatiable curiosity about the negro race than by any true devotion they consist of two distinct divisions those who know more about the negro than the negro knows about himself and those who only recently discovered that negroes actually exist one special faction of the negro encylopedists or the iknowyounegroes variety is the hep cat liberal or the groovy strain these amateur anthropologists delight in conversing with negroes in slangjive and are benignly pathetic in their endeavors to dance and twist and monkey in the manner typical of the negro masses being mainly middle class however they are much too inhibited to master the easy grace of the majority of negroes who are not middle class but this does not prevent the groovy liberal from becoming when in the company of negroes quite allnegro or alltoonegro the moment in fact that they hear the sound of a jazz note or blues tune or the gospel wail of mahalia jackson they automatically close their eyes snap their fingers and stomp their feet in superficial ecstasy at the same time they overwork themselves in the effort to acculturate to negroes and expect too often that negroes are obliged to return the compliment then there is the knownothing type parading as innocents who knew not even that negroes were dissatisfied with secondclass citizenship until the outbreak of the sitin demonstrations other inquiring liberals aside from expecting you to know each and every negro who ten years or so ago chanced to lunch with them in hong kong or casablanca corner the first negro in sight and set him up as a walking opinion poll they expect onthespot answers to queries about negro thoughts and feelings on every subject imaginable from what negroes think about lady bird johnson down to whether negroes really like watermelon and chitterlings ill a contrary variety of the behindthescenes liberal is the twofaced or sneaky liberal who quickly liberates himself from obligations of liberalism in the face of white ostracism only recently i was entering my apartment building trailing some distance behind a middleaged white couple and their daughter the gentleman held the door somewhat unnecessarily for it required a very long moment until i rushed to reach the door in order to honor his exceeding courtesy i thanked him and decided to check my mailbox which was soon discerned to be empty and so i followed the threesome to the elevator unbeknown to my liberal doormans wife wouldnt open the door for anybody else what is this she joked seriouslyhumorously in contempt the gentleman noting my presence tried desperately to inform her of the same while coyly brushing off her remark later however when we were alighting together from the elevator the woman herself attempted to hold the door for me also belonging to the insincere variety is the surreptitious liberal known otherwise as the piggyback or parasitic liberal they are generally fulltime exponents of nonracial causes however noble but failing to attract significant numbers of whites to their movements set out to capture negro discontents as last ditch substitutes piggyback liberals are in other words what might be called liberalswithacause this brings us to another burdensome bunch many prominent nonetheless in the negros protest movement mind you i speak only of a minority faction the big brother division or the umpiring liberal who really seeks to control or constrain negro rebellion while feigning to incite it one species of this genus is the good will liberal who acts as a selfappointed ambassador between whites and negroes the good will liberal counsels negroeswhatever he may say to whitesagainst going too fast and when once there is the faintest sign of progress in some sphere of race relations he breaks out in glowing glee tooting a gabriels horn of selfglorification only last year this tribe virtually took over the negros celebration of the centennial of the emancipation proclamation with much more intensity than the average negro displayed in all fairness however many were kind enough to invite negro leaders and preachers to sit on platforms during ceremonial programs and dedications to preside over closing benedictions and strut along in the chesty strides of cocksure parades many umpiring liberals predictably include scaredycat characters who operate often unconsciously on the ifyoucantlickemjoinem psychology functioning to dampen the negros discontent once when the first wave of college sitins was underway in the winter of a negro student leader from alabama state college in montgomery stopped off on a tour at the university of chicagos ida noyes hall to tell of his experiences at one point in the questionandanswer period a white liberal classmate of mine stood up and asked if white students would be able to take part in a proposed regional confab why yes said the negro student after a long and thoughtful pause of course you can take part but we would ask you please not to take over the conference this remark brought laughter and applause from the other liberals present iv on the other end of the continuum mind you are the sincere but equally onerous the overly familiar liberal or as some call them the boon coons no sooner than boon coon liberals are accepted as associates they fall victim to an inclination to leap over the wall of mannerable social distance they display disarming frankness on subjects normally taboo in the present day however unfortunate that may be between the racial groups in this country the cruder type for instance delights in a repertoire of colored jokes more sophisticated varieties of familiar liberals to indicate that they are so little prejudiced that they could themselves be regarded as negroes may remark come on out to california with me you could use a tan this species of the justplainnegro variety have no qualms about knocking the slats out from under a negro friend in order to conspicuously let down their own hair but probably the most disturbing are liberals who overdo the first name bit too prematurely not only that they also usually shorten the first name to some threeletter variation while there is nothing wrong with this on the surface it does imply a pretentious relationship between white liberals and negroes which too seldom exists in fact let us behold a bolder subdivision of familiar liberalsthe partycrashing character these liberals may drop by unannounced for the first time in months leading a pack of friends and relatives from distant points to show off a pretended closeness to negro intellectuals sufficient to allow such random droppingin once in they are likely to saunter over to the refrigerator or bar and remark loud enough for their white companions to hear nate you mean you dont have any of my favorite beer or to their companions can i fix you a drink marge bill pete sue chuck usually however they and their friends are hungrier than they are thirsty somewhat similar to the partycrashing liberal is the omnipresent strain who not only open your door with the rising sun but stay on so long that a negro host may choke back an urge to call the national guard robert kennedys marshals and the naacp to have the stayinner removed even excuses such as well ive got to go to a meeting now usually have no definite effect oh go right ahead never mind me the omnipresent liberal simply says i want to hear some ray charles anyhow ill just fix a sandwich and relax until you get back whereupon the negro host goes out to the nearest bar for the stiffest drink he can afford while faking away the hours necessary before returning to endure the unshakable guest the most likeable of all species of the boon coon liberal is the lovelorn variety lovelorn liberals can talk of little else but their inestimable love for negroes in general but the maid or the janitor in particular deprived of affection in the cold anonymity of their own white modern civilization they fall back on a compensatorytoo often phonyfondness for negro individuals others are simply bored and searching for distraction from routine such characters are intrigued by negroes mainly as objects of diversion and taboo quivering with guilt over the negros plight lovelorn liberals are given to masochistic rites they gather with similarly afflicted middleclass negroes to engage in marathon testimonials selfrighteously confessing to bygone prejudices now turned to love these guiltridden liberals place on negro companions the burden of supplying free a sort of interracial psychiatric couch during liquor and discussion one liberal broke down bawling in guilt and remorse but no sooner than he was in the presence of whites he became as dryeyed as a desert cactus and appeared as though nothing had ever happened but despite such problems of hypocrisy as the foregoing i have concluded that the true failure of white liberals rests on their incapacity for effecting negro equality they seem unable to do much more than negroes to correct the racial situation therefore the challenge facing white liberals especially in the years ahead will be the necessity for social dexterity in order to keep pace with new standards or changing requirements of liberal behavior the in the civil_rights crisis the th anniversary of the emancipation proclamation was celebrated in a most unusual way this momentous event in mans tortuous struggle for freedom and justice was not marked by a worlds fair and monuments of steel and concrete symbolizing mans rededication to the attainment of the ideals of justice and the preservation of democracy for all men in fact there were few formal ceremonies there was no dancing in the streetsno parades and no flamboyant patriotic speeches and certainly there were no rhetorical proclamations from politicians seeking reelection white america seemed curiously embarrassed by this centennial and sought to cloak its awkwardness with an uneasy silence negroes however chose to make the year of confrontation rather than celebration it was in this year years after the emancipation proclamationthat negro americans insisted that the unfinished business of human freedom and dignity promised years ago be delivered a century of broken promises cynicism and cruelty culminated in an eruption of impatience anger and revulsion against continued hypocrisy in place of ceremonies there were sitins in place of the free spending at the fair there were selective buying campaigns in place of dancing in the streets there was the march on washington we must be free by this goal was not fully realized during ten years after the supreme court school desegregation decision less than per cent of negro children attended desegregated public schools in southern states the majority of negro children probably over per cent in northern and border states are still required to attend predominantly negroor de facto segregatedschools the stark facts are that the supreme court decision has been honored more through the evasion of tokenism has been ignored completely in those communities in which negroes do not take the initiative in obtaining even token compliance and the few if any cases of good faith compliance with courts decision to desegregate american public education the selfdefeating anachronism of white schools and negro schools remains a part of the vocabulary and way of life of americans the majority of american whites continue to resist the negros demands that he be included within the total fabric of american democracy in both the north and the south negroes are systematically discriminated against by labor unions and employers in their quest for jobs and economic security through an effective conspiracy of banking and real estate interests negroes are confined within deteriorating and dehumanizing residential ghettoes negro children are not only still required to attend segregated schoolsbut these schools are still educationally inferior they spawn functional illiterates by the hundreds of thousands and contribute to the perpetuation of the cycle of personal damage community pathology and group ineffectiveness these general and fundamental problems of economic residential and educational discrimination and deprivation which make victims of negroes throughout the nation are compounded by special burdens imposed by the southern states it is difficult for any reasonable person who has not been distorted by american racism to believe that in the seventh decade of the th century there are states in the united statesthe leader of the democratic worldwhere negroes are denied the elementary democratic right to register and to vote for those who are to represent them in the halls of government although a criminal conspiracy of state officials and others deny the negro the right to vote in these states he is still required indeed compelled to pay taxes he must assume all of the responsibilities and obligations without the rights privileges and protections granted to white citizens this is a mockery of democracy this is selfdefeating cynicism this is tyranny the context within which this moral venom could exist includes an accepted pattern or rigid petty blind cruelty which demands that a fellow human being be denied ordinary courtesies in places of public accommodationsand that he be humiliated or assaulted if he seeks to enjoy conveniences which any white american can take for granted if he is able to pay for them the human degradation and tragedy inherent in this constricted view of mans responsibility to his fellow man is matched only by the tragic irony of otherwise intelligent sophisticated senators trained in our best universities and concerned with profound moral issues in our society when they are not defending a racist way of lifetrapped by the level of their constituents into making filibustering spectacles of themselves the racial crisis of has been described by many words probably the most frequently used word was the word revolution this is a dramaticbut a misleading term revolution usually connotes the use of weapons or some violent or military approach to social and political change in addition the term revolution usually demands some basic changes in the economic social and political system the negros demands on his nation do not meet these requirements he is not seeking any fundamental or radical changes in the american economic political or social system he is merely asking to be brought within the existing system he is conservative he is accepting the american system he is identifying with the american ideology and is insisting that the american protestations of democracy be taken literally seriously and be inclusive of him if he is not included american protestations of democracy and moral leadership cannot be taken seriously by anyoneincluding americans if the negro succeeds he will help to strengthen america if the negro fails the fatal moral weakness behind the facades of american military and industrial power and verbal democratic posturings would be revealed before the world the year therefore was a year of revulsiona year of confrontation of hypocrisy it was the year when the patience of the negro came to an end it marked the end of pretense and an increased crescendo of demonstrations and ultimate risks the negro went for broke he stated the issues of human dignity and human equality with such starkness that the american people and all of the people of the world were no longer able to misunderstand them it took years before the american people could prepare themselves for an honest dialogue on the issue of racebefore negroes and whites could face the awesome respon sibility of honest communication between the races american racism like other forms of superstition was based upon the deep primitive passions pretenses and distortions which seek to protect and perpetuate ignorance in the delusions rationalizations and wishful ideas of whites and negroes were torn away revealing terrifying truths of barbarity conflicts ambivalences and discrepancies between liberal words and irrational fears within the same person this was the year dogs fire hoses and electric cattle prods were used on human beings by other human beings this was the year when superior white men in the uniform of law enforcement officers had their feet on the throats of inferior negro women this was the year when medgar evers was shot in the back because he loved freedom enough to insist upon it this was the year when negro children were killed while in the church of god in the city of birmingham but this was also the year of james baldwin and a major breakthrough on the american conscience the drama of reached its climax on august when thousands and thousands of negroes and whites marched on washington to proclaim the paradox of continued faith in the ability of the american system of democratic government to provide the immediate remedy for their long standing grievances by their presence their discipline and their morale the leaders and participants asserted their faith that their goals could be obtained without major violence and bloodshed time will tell whether this was a realistic appraisal of the resilience and moral potential of our government or a childishly naive wishful thinking a significant clue as to which of these is correct might come from the actions of the senate of the united states on the civil r i rights bill which is now before it the negro in america has demonstrated that the civil_rights struggle cannot be stopped short of its goals by white segregationists he has faced and accepted all of their subtle and flagrant forips of cruelty and has remained unafraid and stolidly insistent indeed each act of cruelty and barbarity seemed only to intensify the negroes willingness to make whatever sacrifices are demanded for total equality the significant fact years after emancipationthe fact which should have destroyed a key stereotypeis that the negro was not afraid he has no weapons and therefore could not repeat the idiocy of seeking to obtain moral ends by the immoral means of killing his fellowman he has only the choice of insisting upon living with the full dignity of a human being or dying with dignity because of his insistence in waging his battle for freedom the american negro has only the weapons of courage the power of his personality and the moral and ethical validity of his cause there is however no guarantee that his demands for justice and full equality will prevail no one can yet say with certainty what are the limits of human barbarity or how corrosive of the positives of the human spirit is the cancer of pervasive racism william faulkner in an anguished honest expression of his own frailty published an appeal to negroes in a national magazine around or not to push their demands for equality too far because they would then cause the whites of the south to mobilize for a counteroffensive and if this happened he faulkner would have to get his gun and go out in the streets of mississippi and shoot down niggers fortunately this spectacle of one of our nobel prize winners involved in this type of barbarity was not necessary before his death recently we have seen liberal whites in such northern communities as new york boston philadelphia and chicago organizing themselves to protect the sanctity of their neighborhood schools it might be of some comfort to note that these organizations in these northern communities insist that their activities are not to be interpreted as antinegro or as prosegregationists but one does not know how deep beneath the surface are the furies of irrational racist fears and hatreds this is a calculated risk which the negro must take if he dares to challenge the racial status quo his chances of escaping the fate of the jews in nazi germany may be good only because america does not have a tradition of ruthlessly efficient authoritarianism and continues to insist upon the verbalization of the democratic ideals the dangers to the fulfillment and consolidation of the goals of the civil_rights movement appear to this observer to be more insidious ones than those which are available to the racists or the segregationists if the promises and goals of this movement are to be achieved then certain problems will have to be faced and resolved what follows is merely the attempt of this observer to identify some of the more obvious and subtle problems with the hope that this might stimulate serious discussion among responsible white and negro civil_rights and civic leaders these observations are offered not in the spirit of carping criticism but with the desire to contribute to increased effectiveness and positive resolution of an urgent national and human problem the civil_rights demonstrations of the last few years which culminated with the aweinspiring august march on washington were most powerful and dramatic methods of calling attention to the negros predicament in the united states these demonstrations were part of the world revolution against white supremacy colonialism and other forms of arbitrary and unjust use of power to subjugate or dehumanize human beings the american negroes desire for freedom and justice will and must continue until these goals are obtained but the momentum and dramatic impact of direct action nonviolent demonstrations will decrease these demonstrations appear to be more difficult to sustain psychologically than are military operations because they do not have the same pattern and total context of psychological reinforcement found in a sustained military operation the individuals involved in these demonstrations must also tend to the daytoday routine of living they must work and take care of their families these demonstrations are psychologically exhausting the more they are used the more they tend to become routinized and reach a point of diminishing returns in terms of impact and effect the positive value of these demonstrations can be conserved only if they are not permitted to become diffuse and unrelated to specific targets and goals and are engaged in for their own sake or as a form of emotional catharsis or blowing off steam it would be most unfortunate if these demonstrations became a form of bread and circuses which provide an outlet for negroes but did not deal with the basic social economic or political problems this would not only be a dissipation of precious human energy but would also be a cruel hoax in this regard one could look with suspicion on the tendency of some white political officials to join some of the more respectable demonstrations and the equally disturbing tendency of some negro leaders to embrace this type of surface but skillful neutralization of a protest movement another danger which threatens the future effectiveness of these demonstrations is the tendency to use them as vehicles for the projection of the egos and personal ambitions of local and wouldbe leaders of negroes these individuals who often do not have the responsibility for the effective functioning of a complex organization can assume postures of militancy and make flamboyant statements which appeal to the crowd without regard to the realities of implementation they need not concern themselves with such mundane things as planning strategy and followthrough it is enough that they have an arsenal of words and are adept at namecalling and are ruthless in their ability to ascribe nefarious motives to anyone who disagrees with them the most successful of these wild cat civil_rights leaders attempt to use the technique of demagogic intimidation of the more responsible civil_rights leaders to the extent that they are permitted to be successful they are serious threats to the effectiveness of the movement the potential anarchy of this situation is analogous to a military organization in which a corporal is permitted to intimidate or countermand the orders of a general if this type of disorganization and lack of discipline is permitted to develop and grow an important weapon in the civil_rights struggle will become a farce and unrelated to the resolution of the basic and serious racial problems serious thought must now be given to the problem of determining under what conditions certain techniques and demonstrations will be used this should be done not because these demonstrations will anger or alienate white friends this argument is unacceptable to thinking because white friends who are not angered by the injustices but become angry at attempts to remedy them are rather peculiar and clearly useless friends furthermore that type of white friend and admitted enemies are more likely to be angered by appropriate and effective use of demonstrations rather than by inappropriate and ineffectual ones the student sitins freedomrides and bus boycotts were successful in the south because these methods dealt directly with desired objectives they were clear and focused and directly dramatized a specific injustice the selective buying campaign in philadelphia is an example of effective protest because rev leon sullivan and his associates organized it masterfully pinpointed his targets was able to sustain and follow through on his demands and was able to measure directly the degree of his success the following would seem to be reasonable criteria for determining whether a boycott is or is not an appropriate technique to be used when it is directed against a product rather than a service when the economic damage or inconvenience is clearly to be borne by the proprietor rather than by the boycotters when the goals and demands are clear and obtainable when the action can be sustained until the demands are met when there is minimum inconvenience to persons who are not responsible for the injustice given these criteria serious consideration should be given to the use of the boycott technique in dealing with the problem of education there might be times when the boycott of schools is the most effective method of dramatizing and calling attention to longstanding educational deficiencies and illsbut this objective can be attained most effectively if the boycott threat is not abused the possibility of eroding the moral strength and power of the civil_rights movement is greatest if civil_rights leaders permit themselves to be caught in the trap and rigidity of militancy for its own sake given the fact that the negro in america does not have military economic and numerical power with which to wage his war for unqualified equality he must rely upon a cold calculating use of intellectual and moral power he cannot permit himself to be shackled to gestures postures slogans and oversimplifications he must be free to deal with the realities and he must be tough minded as he seeks every advantage in a war of maneuver and propaganda irrationalities emotionalism and rigidity in the name of civil_rights goals are no more acceptable than the irrationalities emotionalism and rigidity of racism the fight for racial justice is essentially the fight for the ascendancy of reason and logic over ignorance in man having said this candor requires one to say also that it is ironic to observe that more often than not it is the more irrational and emotional appeals and demands which are responded to positively by those in control of political power and educational institutions it raises a serious question on the value of a trained and disciplined mind when one is forced to observe that logical and reasoned arguments for social justice are so frequently ignored while the threats of the demagogue are responded to should our colleges and universities seek to become relevant to the realities of social change by giving courses in the theory and practice of demagoguery the civil_rights crisis in america has now itself reached a stage of crisis the passage of a meaningful civil_rights bill by the united states senate is mandatory the symbolic significance over and above the practical and realistic imperatives for the passage of this bill without emasculating amendments is indicated by the catastrophic despair and frustrations which will erupt in the negro people if this bill can be killed by a small cynical group of senators this irrationality can elicit terrifying irrationalities in the negro people but the crisis in the negros demands for full equality as american citizens involves the additional dimension of the need for comprehensive planning and strategy if these goals are to be obtained actually rather than merely symbolically this would seem to be true even with the passage of a strong civil_rights bill the negro organizations and groups are now required to address themselves to the difficult task of planning and implementing a comprehensive and coordinated strategy this strategy to be efficient and successful must involve the creation of effective coordinating machinery which has the responsibility of making decisions on specific objectives delegating responsibility to appropriate groups and agencies and evaluating performance and effects of action and if need be exerting discipline or exercising some controls over inefficient uneconomic or ineffectual activities certainly a comprehensive and coordinated plan and strategy must necessarily include decisions concerning the priorities and the energies to be expended and the methods to be used in eliminating racial discrimination and segregation in the key areas of education employment housing voting and citizen rights and responsibilities public accommodation a general appraisal of the present level of civil_rights activities would seem to suggest that it could be made even more effective through systematic programs for the gathering of information and intelligence public education and evaluation of effectiveness of techniques and programs it is increasingly clear that the civil_rights movement has received the maximum support that one could reasonably expect from the federal courts obviously there will be cases brought before these courts in the future but the basic legal decisions of these courts clearly establish the fact that race is not a relevant criteria in the enjoyment of the rights of american citizens it might be necessary however for the negro to explore and utilize the technique of using taxpayers suits to prevent southern states from using public funds to perpetuate directly or indirectly any form of racial discrimination and segregation the executive branch of the federal government within the past three years seems clearly to understand the gravity of the racial crisis in america there is little doubt that president lyndon b johnson shares completely the goals of the late president kennedy and has been using his extraordinary political skill and the power of his office in seeking rational and democratic resolution of these issues it is imperative however that negro and white civil_rights groups continue their vigilance in seeing that anyone who occupies this high office in the future continue this pattern more effective ways must still be found to influence the legislative branch of our federal and state governments so that they are more sensitive and responsive to the moral practical political and international imperatives of this issue a summary of the positives and the negatives in the present civil_rights crisis would seem to highlight the following as clear gains within the past two years religious groups have become more seriously involved in action geared toward the elimination of racism in our society the activities of the national council of the churches of christ in america and the intensified activities of the catholic church together with the clear commitment of the organized jewish groups have contributed significantly to the awakening of the dormant conscience of the american people there is also evidence that business and industry are now beginning to understand more clearly that it is not to the interest of the capitalist system to have onetenth of our nation underemployed and restricted from the consumer market in spite of the moral and ethical aspects of the civil_rights struggle the factor of the artificial reduction of the gross national product which inevitably results from racial discrimination in america may turn out to be the most pivotal determinant of change the vitality and growth potential of our economy may well depend upon the capacity to change old patterns of attitudes and behavior and make it possible to exploit constructively an underdeveloped area within our own nation one is reminded of gunnar myrdals recent observation that at this period in history practical economic imperatives and american idealism have converged on the minus side one still is confronted with the fact that american labor unions reflect for the most part a racial rigidity which is inimical to the national interest and of course is detrimental to the interests of organized labor this paradoxthis blindnesscan only be selfdestructive therein probably lies the hope for change continuing evidence of the pervasive moral apathy and political cynicism in the american mass culture must also be counted as a most significant negative in appraising the possibilities of serious success of the civil_rights struggle if the practical imperatives for constructive change were to be controlled by the chance and possibilities of profound moral conversion in the american people there might be cause for pessimism pragmatism rather than ethical and idealistic insights might be our only basis for hope in summing up it is possible that we cannot answer the question posed in the title of this paper with any degree of certainty whatever answer is offered might reflect only the wishes or the cynicism of the particular observer there seems to be no clear guarantees of unalloyed success of the civil_rights movement on the other hand it would be irresponsible to assert the certainty of failure or the perpetuation of hypocritical tokenism as the accommodation to the lack of any basic commitment to freedom and justice to this observer this is neither a time for hope nor for despair rather this is the time for realistic difficult and if necessary painful reappraisal planning and effective action negroes and whites who are deeply concerned about the future of mankind the future of our nation and the significance of the democratic idea must now redouble their efforts to be effective we now know that there is really no easy road to the attainment of social justice this is a tortuous and taxing process we cannot now settle for the form without the substance we cannot settle for the slogans without the actual demonstration of change to do so would reveal the moral emptiness which is the antithesis of social health and national vitality zambias prime minister the result of orderly elections on january missioneducated kenneth kaunda is destined before the end central african his united naof the year to join the list of african heads of state as prime minister of northern rhodesia which on december shared in the demise of the tenyearold federation with tional independence party successful in capturing control of the legislature assembly kaunda and his government now assume many of the responsibilities of governing the soontobe independent nation though for the present britain will retain control of external affairs independence is scheduled for some time during the yearold kaunda has been the driving power behind the march toward independence in northern rhodesia which he prefers to call zambia an intellectual and a firm believer in the power of nonviolence he possesses an eloquence of word that fascinates his african listeners he was born in the remote lubwa region where northern rhodesia borders nyasaland and tanganyika his father david one of those splendid nyasa tribesmen whose restless energy makes them the workers as well as the wanderers of central africa had come from nyasaland to serve as an evangelist for the church of scotlands mission in lubwa his mother a devoted servant of the church brought up her two sons and two daughters in what to her was a foreign land serving meanwhile as matron of the girls boarding school kenneth the bright boy of the mission school went away for further training as a teacher returned at the age of to become headmaster of the boys boarding school at lubwa had he stayed on there miles from the industrial life of the countryit is unlikely that he would have made the transition from teaching to politics but in he became a welfare assistant at the nchanga mine in the copper belt a move that marked a turning point for both kaunda and zambia in that year he says he experienced the full shock of industrialism the color bar and racial prejudice for the first time he found himself treated not as a person heard himself referred to as a kaffir a munt kaunda then turned trader buying and selling old clothes cycling hundreds of miles in the remote areas around his old lubwa home at the same time he was serving as an active propagandist for the african national congress becoming national secretary in even while he was fervently advocating freedom for zambia he was studying gandhis tactics in india which fascinated him as pointing the way to freedom without bloodshed ironically the basis for the prison sentence imposed on him in was his reading of seditious booksamong them an indian book about gandhi for all his gentle nonviolent approach kaunda has since been very sure where he is going in politics he split with his friend harry nkumbula because the african national congress party seemed to him to be compromising with the europeans then he formed his own united national independence party dedicated to a policy of one man one vote and to what kaunda calls a colorblind society as he told a public meeting sponsored by his party at kitwe in may we assure the nonafricans of their rightful place in this country by way of adopting a bill of rights we favor no racist policy and no oppression of one race by another will be tolerated we believe there is enough room in northern rhodesia for all people who wish to make this their home there is room for both private industries and partly controlled industries the only thing we shall ask of private industry is to feed the profits back into northern rhodesia to help develop more industry furthermore if we are going to build a healthy nation it is important to elevate the living standard of rural africans if kaunda harbored hatred in his heart during the years of his work for independence for zambia it was for the central african federation as governed by sir roy welensky for him as for many other africans the very term federation signified a trick devised by the white manin this case britain to perpetuate his rule in central africa when i talked with kaunda in his london hotel room on his visit to britain something over a year ago i found him not overtalkative at first but as we conversed he relaxed and showed himself to be a man whose smile flashed instantly when a word or idea struck him pleasantly he proved quick to reply in general conversation but mild withal i sensed why both friend and enemy refer to him as kenneth the hurt he suffered when he first encountered discrimination and prejudice in the copper country went deep but it apparently did not leave him with resentment in heart or mind obviously he looks on every human being as a person be he black or white in our conversation it became apparent that kaunda was a man of deep purpose convinced that his nonviolent methods would succeed he acknowledged that in the past he had contravened the law by calling unlawful assemblies like other african nationalists he is proud of his record as a prison graduate now that responsibility has come to kenneth kaunda perhaps sooner than he had expected when he was leading the fight against the federation the question faces him can he hold in check the wilder spirits of his party and persist in his policy of nonviolence will he be content as prime minister to govern in uneasy cooperation with nkumbulas more extreme congress partisans and with europeans now comes the test of statesmanship kaunda of zambia has many friends who are convinced that the answer to such questions will be yes and that he will be a real leader in the new life of central africa was teddy roosevelt a friend of negroes everyones attention was directed toward the national leader as he spoke on the racial crisis we believe that this country will not be a permanently good place for any of us to live in unless we make it a reasonably good place for all of us to live in our cause is the cause of justice for all in the interest of all one could easily assume that this statement was made within the last few months and could only question whether the speaker was john kennedy or lyndon johnson actually the words were spoken by theodore roosevelt as he addressed his friends of the progressive party in more than a half century ago although the murders marches and bombings of recent months have made the national racial crisis a matter of greater urgency and importance than ever before and have caused it to occupy increasingly more time on the agenda of the president the issue is not a new one to occupants of the white house it now seems timely significant and of historical interest to consider how other chief executives have dealt with the problem the historical background of a current day news event is always of great interest but beyond that it provides insight and understanding with respect to the present situation volumes have been written about lincolns attitude toward the negro and the liberal policies of franklin d roosevelt remain fresh in the memories of millions practically unknown to the general public however are the views and actions of theodore roosevelt with respect to this issue although a republican he was like john f kennedy a harvard graduate and was a young vigorous twentieth century occupant of the white house president theodore roosevelt had been in office scarcely a month when he became embroiled in a racial controversy by inviting famed negro leader booker t washington to dinner at the white house the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the question of possible future appointments in the south the incident would have gone unnoticed except for the fact that in accordance with customary procedure washingtons name was placed on the white house guest list when the reporters saw it the matter quickly snowballed into a national incident that haunted roosevelt for years t r was taken completely by surprise as he had had no idea the event would cause such loud repercussions referring to the tuskegee leader in his voluminous correspondence the indignant president said he would have washington to dinner just as often as he pleased and that i respect him greatly and believe in the work he has done i have consulted so much with him it seemed to me that it was natural to ask him to dinner to talk over this work and the very fact that i felt a moments qualm on inviting him because of his color made me ashamed of myself and made me hasten to send the invitation although the dinner had no noticeable effect on the north it put an end to all of t rs hopes of winning support for the republicans in the south the comment of the new orleans timesdemocrat was representative of southern reaction when mr roosevelt sits down to dinner with a negro he declares that the negro is the social equal of the white man roosevelt further revealed his feelings for booker t washington by laughing uproariously as he related to friends a true story about the negro leader it seems that a florida colonel as he had shaken hands with washington had said he was very pleased to meet the greatest man in america washington had protested that president roosevelt was the greatest the colonel had then objected strongly to this referring to t r as a demagogue because he had dined with washington although washington announced his support of taft during the presidential campaign of due to the fact that t r had condoned the seating of allwhite delegations from three southern states at the progressive party convention roosevelt continued to hold washington in great respect and admiration when the tuskegee leader died in roosevelt called him not only the most useful and distinguished negro in the world but also one of the most useful and distinguished americans of any race it should not be concluded however from roosevelts treatment of booker t washington that he was totally unbiased even though he accepted as equals those few negroes who at that time had become well educated articulate citizens and leaders he nevertheless revealed many times through his words and actions his belief in the inferiority of the negro race as a whole furthermore it must be remembered that to respect booker t washington as an individual was one thing but to support his philosophy was hardly to be a great liberal for washington believed that if negroes concentrated on education and character development whites upon seeing the progress that had been made would then grant them full civil_rights this view would understandably arouse little sympathy among todays more sophisticated negro leaders on the evening of august occurred an incident which subsequently revealed roosevelts racial views in a much more questionable light on that night a group of armed men shot up the town of brownsville texas killing one person and wounding two others since negro soldiers had recently been assigned to the brownsville post enraged white citizens immediately blamed them for the crime military investigations seemed to confirm that the negroes were responsible but it was impossible to fix the guilt on any individuals and all steadfastly maintained their innocence because of the persistent silence of the troops the inspector general of the army recommended that all three companies be discharged without honor although they included men with records of service ranging up to twentyfive years president roosevelt after studying all reports of the investigation decided to discharge all the troops the act of punishing all for the crimes of a few would have been enough to have aroused much criticism and resentment but to make matters worse roosevelt did not make public his decision until the day the congressional election in which the republican party was successful in retaining control of the house of representatives aside from the poor timing of the announcement the president maintained over and over again that his decision was in no way influenced by the fact that the troops were negroes and that he would have acted in exactly the same way had they been white he had a difficult time however in convincing negroes and many broadminded whites that his decision was free from racial prejudice the controversy was still raging more than two years later when a bill was introduced in congress to extend for a year the time limit within which the president could reinstate any man who was proved innocent this bill had roosevelts support but on the opposing side was senator joseph foraker of ohio who introduced his own bill calling for reinstatement of all the troops forakers famous april oration presented a strong case for the theory that shells used by the troops during target practice had been stolen by brownsville residents who then shot up the town themselves the president had earlier dis missed this theory as absurd but after forakers speech he ordered another investigation a few of the negroes were subsequently reinstated but the case was never completely settled the new york times seriously questioned the wisdom and fairness of roosevelts action in the brownsville case and seemed to sum up the feelings of many intelligent persons the final result is the absurdly inadequate punishishment of the guilty and the tremendously unjust punishment of many who were innocent of the crime another method of investigation with more patience and skill might easily have brought all the facts to light and resulted in evenhanded justice to all concerned time after time in answer to charges of racial prejudice stemming from the brownsville decision t r cited his political appointment policy as evidence of his belief in judging each individual on his merits as a man without regard to the color of his skin indeed he appointed a number of negroes to high positions but his successoi in the white house william howard taft was convinced that such a policy had not advanced the negro cause since the presence of negro appointees in the south was bitterly resented owen wister close friend of roosevelt felt as taft did that the president did not understand how deep were the wounds inflicted during reconstruction when t r appointed negro physician william d crum to the position of collector of customs at charleston south carolina the senate refused confirmation in the face of a storm of protest from charleston citizens refusing to give in roosevelt kept crum in office by interim appointment in a lengthy defense of his action t r told charleston banker robert rhett that it seemed to him that on the rare occasion when a negro proved to be qualified his good citizenship should be rewarded roosevelt touched off still another controversy in his handling of the indianola mississippi affair when an educated negro doctor arrived in indianola and began to take away negro patients from the lowest white doctors the whites by mob action forced not only the negro doctor to leave town but also mrs minnie cox who for some years had been the negro postmistress the leading citizens of the town who greatly respected mrs cox deprecated the mob action but did nothing to stop it instead of sending mrs cox back under an escort of federal troops roosevelt simply closed the post office thereby forcing indianola citizens to go five miles to the next town for their mail southern newspapers went into hysterics over his action calling it part of his plan for negro domination and miscegenation t r was at a loss to explain the southern mind two months after the indianola incident he remarked in a letter to owen wister that the same fools who turned mrs cox out of office were now depositing their funds in her husbands bank and also had him as one of the directors of a white bank those who would like to classify roosevelt as a white supremacist could find support for their case by quoting his lincoln dinner speech to the republican club in new york during which he spoke for preservation of what he called the high civilization of the whites and pointed out that civil privileges should not be confused with social privileges a far different thing they could cite his paris speech at the sorbonne where he spoke of inequalities in moral development and in social capacity they could also cite one of his letters to owen wister in which he clearly shows prejudice against negroes i entirely agree with you that as a race and in the mass they are altogether inferior to the whites on the other hand those who see roosevelt as a great liberal far ahead of his day can also quote from his lincoln dinner speech in another part of which he pleaded for the treatment of each man according to his worth as a man and in conclusion of which he made the following sincere statement i be lieve in this country with all my heart and soul we shall go up or down together and i believe that we shall go up and not down because i have an abiding faith in the generosity the courage the resolution and the common sense of all my countrymen they can cite his praise of the negro troops beside whom he served at santiago and they can point to his efforts to establish in the progressive party a more enlightened negro policy than that which characterized the two older parties in spite of these inconsistencies both in word and in deed it is difficult to see how anyone who has studied roosevelts speeches letters and other writings as well as what historians have said about him can doubt the sincerity of his desire to aid the cause of the negro although theodore roosevelt is today considered one of our greatest presidents seldom did he have the support of the majority of the people as he attempted to make some headway in dealing with americas race problem the victim of a steady barrage of criticism time after time he acted courageously in an effort to do what was right surely roosevelt would have applauded last june as president kennedy eloquently told congress why a strong civil_rights law is imperative in this year of of the emancipation centennial justice requires us to insure the blessings of liberty for all americans and their posteritynot merely for reasons of economic efficiency world diplomacy and domestic tranquility but above all because it is right planning ahead there is an old english saying fifteen shillings income fourteen shillings outgo security fifteen shillings income sixteen shillings outgo disaster translated income americanese you just cant spend more than you earn without getting yourself into a financial rut while youte working its easy to shrug off worries of the distant days of retirement when youll have to live on your social security benefits but when you are retired it is too late to start worrying then about what you could have accomplished earlier in life to assure financial security in your twilight years its a fact that many men enter the state of retirement with no more preparation than if they were going on a long weekend vacation then when they encounter the familiar problems boredom a place to live inadequate finances other problems those bright golden years not only become a little tarnished but with little to do after a lifetime of progress and activity they feel that they are not needed these are the men who die early rough talk yes but so true lee nashem an estate planner says i have seen many persons retire with success and achieve a happy comfortable existence others fail both in providing a comfortable life for their retirement years and in properly providing adequate security for their families life after or at the age of your retirement can be a vital period of enjoyment with new interests a sideline business perhaps new friends more time for hobbies and a time when the everyday financial pressures are not present nashems advice is to start retirement planning at an early age he says it is during your more productive years that you should start planning point towards a specific date and work towards it where would you like to live how much will be needed per month could any of present hobbies be turned into incomeproducing ones in later years actually this is just a jumping off point from here you must study your assets what is your current insurance and what will it be worth at retirement what can you expect to receive as social security benefits what can you expect in the way of a company pension what will all of these items amount to per month at retirement a budget must be worked out for present living one that allows you to live comfortably yet provides for some savings an advancement in your present job may increase your income but it could help you the rest of your working days if you only spend part of the increased salary and learn to put some of the increase away surplus funds should be invested and not kept under the mattress banks are the safest form of investment but the yield from savings accounts is small compared to other forms of investment bonds preferred stocks mutual funds and goodgrade common stocks can provide increased income and appreciation of capital as the companies grow and prosper a letter to any member firm of an established stock exchange will bring literature describing stock investments and explain the complexities of investments life insurance is an excellent means of providing a splendid safe sure retirement nearly all standard plans even ordinary life policies have annuity options an annuity form of insurance gives the largest guaranteed life income from any sum of money and if you are worried about inflation you can purchase a variable annuity one that doesnt guarantee your retirement income but pegs it to the purchasing power of the dollar at the time of retirement if your present policies were purchased to pay off mortgages in case of your untimely death to provide money to a widow and children or for childrens education you can cash in on all of this at your retirement by using the options provided in the policy and turning the cash values into an annuity ask your insurance counselor how to do this other hints for keeping your financial house in order buy in economic quantities patronize stores with cash operations avoid overbuying and spoilage dont buy overly ornate or fragile things wait for sales of standard items take advantage of postholiday sales dont buy stocks on hot tips pay cash wherever you can to avoid sales charges buy only from reputable merchants who stand in back of the merchandise and be wary of getrich schemes your income tax return is another place to save valuable dollars many taxpayers lose money because they dont know the proper form to use or the deductions to take a reputable accountant or lawyer can help you cut down on taxes by showing you how to take advantage of tax deductions retirement should be based on a timetable in the thirties you should think about increasing your income the forties are a time for sending the children off to school a time to consolidate your financial position and learn how to manage money properly by the time you reach fifty you should have your retirement plans finalized you should review your investments are they bringing in the yield you counted on is your hobby that you thought to be incomeproducing really going to produce any income at age sixty we come to roundup time a review should be made of the breadwinners will advice should be sought on estate planning all important papers should be kept in one place so that they are easily accessible all during your years proper medical attention was a necessity but now it takes on new importance care must be taken to watch for danger signals and the doctors advice should be followed as to diet and exercise in a stepbystep planning of your retirement you should have consulted legal financial and investment counsellors but you yourself must have done some research so that you can qualify as a financial handyman learning the sound handling of money is important for you are the one person most interested in your own financial welfare why do some retirement plans fail some fail because of lack of foresight others because of the inability to understand the simple rules of finance actually retirement security is not hard to come by millions have done it it requires thought and a real interest in having few worries at retirement remember your retirement from your job or business is only another way of saying that youve retired to a new life how much you enjoy it will be up to you a balletomane at a bullfight an aficionado im a q a good cook j in fact im the sort of partisan of la corrida who applauds the bull which of course is no way to win friends and influence people in spain i learned that the dangerous way at my first bullfight when the brave toro routed the matador and sent him fleeing most unvaliantly over the wall i sat there shouting and clapping with unrestrained glee only when my own voice floated back on a wave of dead silence did i realize that my delighted laughter was a faux pas all eyes in the stadium turned on me and in that uncomfortable moment i fully understood the savage lust for blood and guts that underlies the spanish passion for bullfighting but while i find bullfighting as bullfighting as boring as last nights beer i think bullfighting as ballet is as warmly stimulating as this evenings cool champagne aficionados go mad with rapture when witnessing a languid veronica or illusive chicuelina or a triumphant remate but take that ton or so of bruising beef out of the arena and what have you got movements as pure and symphonic as any ever conceived by diaghilev and though balletomanes for some baffling reason have not yet discovered the fact the most skillful matadors take the art of ballet into spheres unplumbed by giselle or the sleeping beauty of the matadors harvesting the oles on the iberian peninsula at seasons start luis miguel dominguin ranked as primo don so when the great dominguin condescended to appear in the plaza de toros at palma de mallorca in july just before the two gorings that laid him up toward seasons end my love of the dance dictated that i beat a hasty trail to the boxoffice to assure myself an unfettered view i splurged on a ticket pesetas that represented four missed meals to record the occasion for my dull and imminent old age i took along a borrowed motion picture camera it was all worth it i was sandwiched between a taciturn german and an effusive englishwoman mucho calor grunted the german in spanish complaining of the heat oh i hope all the blood wont make me ill gushed the englishwoman these people obviously were not attuned to the spirit of the coming danse macabre it is said somewhat maliciously that manana is catholic spains true religion and that only the bullfight begins on time whatever the merits of the first claim the latter can hardly be disputed promptly at six then the band broke out the gates flung open and the paseillo began a pageant straight out of the middle ages out pranced the proud beautiful stallions bearing officials as elaborately festooned as the swiss guards at the vatican behind them in time to the bands ancient martial music strutted the three matadors as slender as dior mannequins as richly plumed and as proud as peacocks attending the matadors marched the battalion of toreros and picadors no less elegant than their superiors in their brilliant silk tights brocaded jackets and pastel hose only a philistine could think of this gorgeous army as other than a splendid corps de ballet the procession ended the gate of the toril went up and a raging black bull stormed out snorting stamping a villain more magnificent than any the covent garden stage ever accommodated the illusion was perfect the animal seemed duly fierce but i wondered at its size memory sometimes beguiles but it seemed that my grandmothers guernsey had been at least as big in keeping with the inflexible procedure of this classical drama the army of matadors toreros and picadors ganged up on the bull teasing and taunting it with capes stabbing it with spears leaving steeltipped darts dangling in its shoulders in and out of the arena the assaulters ran fleeing behind barreras taking refuge on the backs of horses throwing up their pomaded heads jutting out their tightly bound behinds exciting mob scene really and then dominguin the stadium exploded as this great man this idol this prince of torerosthe man who had challenged the great manolete and seen his aging rival meet oblivion on the horns of a giant miura years earlierswaggered out to the center of the arena fresh assured luis miguel twirled his cape lured the lethal horns past his thighs past his fanny ole ole ah it was lovely nijinsky himself could not have pirouetted more gracefully glided and turned with more poetry the bull roared stamped foamed at the mouth so hot and weary and weak from his bleeding wounds that his knees buckled as he charged but charge he did again and again all but falling on his face a heartrending pas de deux but caught up in the beauty of dominguins line and grace it was possible to ignore the brutes cruel suffering it was even possible momentarily not to admire its dumb courage dominguin warming to his art ran through his repertory of grandstanding tricks he stood a defiant sylph a foot from the nolongersodeadly horns he knelt in the bloodsoaked sand seized the horns and shouted into the dazed brutes ear the fans were ecstatic they went wild then the hero faced his public handsome aloof smiling the prelude to the final act man against exhausted brute a pase natural a pase de pecho ole ole standing straight and imperious dominguin ordered his muleta and sword and then breathless silence man and beast faced each other on the edge of the moment of truth muleta in his left hand gleaming estoque raised in his right hand luis miguel struck a classic pose all grace all poise all valor then swiftly lightly executing a swansmooth jete he drove the steel blade into the solid hulk of valiant flesh somewhere behind me a female voice shrieked and a fainting body tumbled heavily in the stands i think im going to be sick groaned the englishwoman i drew my legs away from her i was wearing my last pair of summer trousers i was grateful i wasnt the man sitting in front of her it was over the toreros swept in and lifted dominguin to their shoulders and bore him in triumph around the arena a shower of flores sombreros and botes rained down from the stands luis miguel luis miguel screamed the crowd tu el primero tu el maestro suddenly impulsively i began to clap and cheer my applause blended with the mad ovation but i wasnt acclaiming the primo don of the ballet of blood and sand alas that spell was broken a team of horses dragged the body of that defeated beast across the arena and in spite of everything i was applauding the dead bull by arna bontemps the years w e b du bois spent at fisk university as an undergraduate left a lasting impression on him and on the college this was clearly apparent when he returned to the campus in may of to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of his class graduation and to receive belatedly the phi beta kappa key his college had been unauthorized to grant in his own time in the course of academic rituals a moment became grave with memories seventy years seventythree years to be exact he had come up the hill from the nashville railroad station in a horsedrawn carriage with poetry on his lips and laughter in his eyes an hour or two later a bell rang and he joined the rush to the dining hall confronted there by a glorious girl he suddenly lost his breath her name was lena calhoun and we now know that she was the grandmother of lena horne in any case a decade later after new york and boston berlin and paris du bois still remembered her as he confessed in one of his essays as the most beautiful girl he had ever seen naturally when he became editor of the school paper she was one of the students he invited to submit a contribution she consented and in due time he published her first literary effort an essay on the subject babies his college days like the rest of his long life are thoroughly often delightfully documented if we cannot account for every golden day of that happy period we can certainly account for every month we know for example what a fearful bout he had with typhoid fever in the autumn of his first year and the nickname the students gave him when pale and thin he was able to get up and resume his activities we know when he began to grow burnsides and something about the impression this made on his classmates and we can follow through his columns his articles stories and editorials in the fisk herald the awakening of his interests and the budding of his thought oddly enough the quality that stands out in his earliest writing is humor he was a laughing boy and he enjoyed nothing so much as poking fun his column sharps and flats while it ran was devoted to nothing else and one discovers as a sidelight that even a joke told in dialect didnt bother him when the point it made was sharp and valid in fact one of the things du bois cherished in connection with his attendance at a southern college after his new england upbringing was the exposure it gave him to the richness of negro folk expression as well as folk experience he treated it all gently sometimes lovingly in his youth du bois formed the habit of celebrating his birthdays by writing little testimonials to himm self as it were i am striving to make my life all that life may be he stated in one of these if this strikes us as a trifle serious in one so young so ostensibly carefree we may wish to recall that he was born just three years after the civil war that the span of his life was itself a kind of documentary of the first years of negro freedom that these personal memos were in an odd sense annual reports on the rise and progress of his race in america it was as if he watched the unfolding of a play within a play the drama of his own career within the epic of his people it was as a college student apparently that he acquired his lifelong fondness for allegory as a literary form and became impressed with the power of the symbol time and again as a campus writer and later as editor of the crisis the files of these publications reveal he produced in this genre pieces which never failed to make their point and some of which as his posthumous abc of color shows can stand very well as literature his use of the symbol however has little if anything to do with the socalled symbol mongering of some schools of literary criticism to him the symbol was a weapon of unmeasured capability in the nonviolent struggle against oppression this was as true of the symbolic act as of the word we dont have to be told what he wished to signify when he named the niagara movement or when he selected harpers ferry as the place to hold its second and crucial meeting and we may be equally sure that his use of the parable the symbol the allegory though not always so obvious not always explained did not necessarily end with these it may therefore be worth our time to read further references to life behind the veil ran through du bois early essays like a refrain anticipating by more than half a century the serious and provocative point about the negros invisibility in american life that has intrigued the best of our younger writers in this present decade his statement about the negros twoness growing out of the racial situation is echoed today as ambivalence and treated by a younger generation of writers as a discovery but it has not been stated more clearly than it was by du bois in the atlantic monthly in but he no longer needs these acknowledgements of our esteem we would do well to merit his carnegie hall feb a mission and a mule the photograph of scotty smith on this page is not very flatteringit was taken as he spoke of his experiences as a core worker in rural mississippibut almost everything else about the young man is deserving of commendation except that praise is the last thing he wants what he fervently desires first of all is that the negro people of this country become aware of the plight of their fellownegroes in the rural south and the ghetto north and then become concerned enough to do something about it as he sees it the fate of both the race and the nation are riding on the consequences of what happens in mississippiand the souththis summer smitty was in chicago pending appeal of a six months sentence plus fine which he drew in canton mississippi for disturbing the peace the charge grew out of his efforts to persuade the principal of a negro high school against punishing students participating in civil_rights activities scotty has been arrested before for his exploitsranging from encouraging frightened negroes to register to vote to distributing food and clothing to those who have dared to assert their desire to vote and have been fired from their jobs and banished from their homes as a resultand chances are very good that he will be arrested again but arrests intimidation and harassment are not likely to deflect him from his course like so many of those astonishing young people who have dedicated their youthful energies to bringing a measure of light to the morallydarkened south scottys determination has a mystically endearing fervor he confesses that he wants to return to college for the remaining two years of undergraduate study but an encounter with the degradedbut spiritually indomitablepeople in mississippi diminishes the urgency of both his own selfinterest and future right now this work is my life he says i love the people in the south their depth of spirituality and their great potential even their poor simple way of life scottys immediate motive in leaving madison county mississippi for chicago was to appeal for funds food and clothing for the hungry and dispossessed negroes in the delta once these people decide to opt for a genuine role in the civic life of their towns or counties they expose themselves to all the terror and viciousness the racists can muster they must move furtively meet clandestinely disguise their true feelings scotty an old hand now at eluding and frustrating the police who know him and will haul him in on any pretext they can think of gallops about the back country on an old mule using barbwire shears to enter the farms of friendly negroes without being observed the message gets through and the people gain courage scotty says he is most inspired by the simple fraternalism of the people who share what little they have with victims of the kluxers and the white citizens councils passing the word on until food clothing and funds are found much will be needed during the long hot dangerous

dave dennis lynch street jackson miss by dudley randall do you ever wonder what your barber is thinking when he cuts your hair or shaves you besides being artists of a sort we barbers are men of a thousand personalities talkative when you feel like talking respectful when you express an opinion silent when you want to be quiet we meet people of all types and talk to infants and octogenarians beggars and bankers cops and criminals but do you know what we are really like underneath our mask of politeness while you relax in the soft chair soothed with our hypnotic hands and the suave smell of balms and oils you unwittingly confess things to us and expose the secret nooks and crannies of your souls we know what goes on in your mind but do you know what goes on in ours as you lie helpless under our hands wielding the razor there was a man i had shaved for years i began shaving him when the first soft down appeared upon his cheeks and his skin was healthy and glowing after i had shaved him he would smile into the mirror and exclaim what a shave what a barber you are i would have a thrill of pride at a work of art well done i shaved him the day he appeared in his best suit to be married and the morning he came in disheveled after being up all night when his first child was born i enjoyed watching him mature and take on the responsibilities of a job a wife a family but somewhere along the road he began to falter his responsibilities were more than he was willing or able to bear he failed in his duties then he flouted them his hopes flickered out he became bitter and quarrelsome his friends avoided him his wife left him and took the children with her he was burdened with debts he began to drink his firm cheeks became flabby often after he had spent a wild night i would work over his strained face and look with regret into his bleary eyes i had liked him at first but now i began to dislike him he became repulsive to my touch i wished that i didnt have to shave him but it was a necessary job as he insisted on putting up a front to the world and having his daily shave i tried to avoid shaving him but he would always be there demanding his daily rite from me alone as if he were ashamed to have another barber touch him the shaves i gave him now were not so close and clean as they had been but he would only glare into the mirror with a spiteful word and come back for another shave the next morning sometimes he would not even care how he looked but would stagger into the street without even inspecting my botched job gradually i began to hate him i began scheming of little ways to hurt or disfigure him a slip of the razor here a little nick there where it would be the most conspicuous he would swear when i cut him or frown into the mirror and snarl what a butcher you turned out to be but still he demanded his daily shave his badge of respectability to flash on the world at last i began to loathe him it was then that i felt the temptation often as i scraped the keen steel over his chin i reflected that a little slip a little pressure of the wrist would cut his throat and end his miserable existence as i looked into his puffed features i imagined how they would look with a wide red gash in his throat but i thought who am i to take a life only god has the right to take a human life i wondered why i hated him so much god how i hated him i hated everything about him i hated him more than my worst enemy knew that possibly there were excuses for his degradation but i hated him anyway and the temptation to kill him remained persisted i thought about it all day and dreamed of it at night the vision of his red cut throat became my fetish i could hardly wait for the morning hour when i would shave him and feel his throat under my fingers his throat where like an artist i would carve my masterpiece one morning when this wretched creature was under my hands i could resist the temptation no longer with a quick deft motion i drew the razor across his throat some lastfractionofasecond feeling of pity or of fear perhaps made me lighten the stroke the wound was wide but not deep and did not prove fatal for the doctors tell me i will live by john s flannery got five of em i y tt it told sam as we flat ni nosed against the shop window gazing bigeyed at the ship inside the bottle and he says he wants that one more than anything in the world it must cost a lot sam said turning toward me with the whites of his eyes sparkling against his blueblack skin not so much i answered nonchalantly meanwhile futilely clicking the two nickels in my jeans pockets man told jim fifteen dollars i jist might buy it for him for his birthday next month the white areas around the brown pupils increased in diameter where you gonna get fifteen dollars oh i got some saved i told my pal as we reluctantly backed away from the window and proceeded toward the annapolis waterfront a block away besides i could probably make enough to buy it before his birthday thats almost a month off we wandered in silence looking at oyster boats and people listening to the mansworld talk and taking care to stay out of the paths of the bigger folks wed learned long ago that two tenyearolds dont attract much attention unless they get in somebodys way besides we were sort of fixtures there and on the academy grounds fishing in the severn river running errands for the shopkeepers shining shoes for the midshipmen and coming out pretty good when the middies threw pennies for luck to the indian statue tecumseh on their way to exams but we couldnt count on tecumseh for a while and there were plenty of other kids some bigger which made it bad in competition for the few jobs without admitting it to sam i knew that it would take better than average luck to make up the difference between the five or six dollars worth of coins in my mason jar at home and the fifteen dollars to get my brother jim that ship in the bottle she was flying the danish flag and grandpa jensen had talked denmark to jim and me ever since we could listen jim wanted to visit the old country so bad he said it hurt and next summer when he turned he was going to ship out on a freighter and get over there he said if he had that ship in his collection waiting wouldnt hurt as much we sat on a camel and dangled our bare feet in the oily green water listening to it lap against the waterdarkened wood sam dug a handline out of his pocket found a hunk of mashed plum near a fruit stand and baited up the rusty hook he lowered the green fishing line optimistically into the water and sat watching the cork sam fished every day and didnt catch much when he did he took it home and his ma cooked it for his supper even if it was a fish three inches long guess they didnt have much and sam said he didnt have a pa today his poor luck was holding or mashed plum wasnt a good bait and hunger ended our vigil before he had a nibble i about wore the two nickels out rubbing them together watching the bobbing cork then i decided they had to go lets go get something to eat ill buy it didnt take any time for sam to coil the wet line and shove it in a pocket of the oversized denims we walked to the fruitstand where the man let us pick out two bananas from a bunch for one of the coins when we hurried on to a shop where penny licorice whips and peanuts used up the rest of my allowance we sat on the curb in the warm sun and gobbled up peanuts licorice and bananas in no particular order then silently tried to forget that we were still hungry sam finally said formally thank you next time i get money ill buy i knew he would but i knew it might be a spell before he could he continued seriously right now i think ill help you get some money to buy that bottle of ship for mister jim its gonna take more than one person to get that much in the month you got we launched our project with all the enthusiasm two tenyearolds could muster and hunted for jobs it didnt work except for a dime one man gave us for cleaning fish for him then one day sam let it drop in a try for a job that were tryin to get enough money to buy mister jim tommys brother a bottle of ship for his birthday the shopkeeper threw back his head and laughed a long time then made the negro boy explain what a bottle of ship was sam told the whole story the shopkeeper listened and asked me why i wanted to buy that present i told him all about my big brother and he put us to work we cleaned out a storeroom for him and burned a bunch of old boxes and trash we got a quarter and a request to come back day after tomorrow we didnt make any money next day but we didnt spend any either cause a restaurant let us haul out their garbage and gave us each a hot ham sandwich for doing the job the chef even let us eat it in the kitchen where great kettles were steaming when we went back to the shopkeeper hed apparently been talking up our project we swept the place out for him got a second quarter and were told to go over to mr wilsons there we swept some more and were sent to a poolroom that needed a real sweeping plus some trash hauling magazines and newspapers that had been accumulating for several months sam was ecstatic man the way were going were gonna have enough money for mister jims present in no time his eyes would light up every evening when wed count the money then rush to the shop to see that the ship was still in the window one night after a particularly successful day we stopped just before splitting to go to our homes tommy said sam you dont i have to go into your bank at home id mentioned my savings there by next week well have enough to buy that bottle but half the moneys yours i started sam interrupted no it aint you been buying the lunches and besides i want to be in on the giving this is the most fun i ever had workin we let it go at that saturday before jims birthday mr schmidt at the fish market called us hear you boys need money for a special project he said with a twinkle in his heavilytufted round german eyes well ill give you whatever more you need up to three dollars if youll get me a bushel of softshell crabs here come back here he stopped us in our tracks and asked if we might need any special equipment we had everything but bait he gave us a quarter to buy some meat for the crab lines and we raced to my house grabbed a dip net and two lines and charged on to a special spot along the severn river we had a halfbushel by noon and a bushel by midafternoon we each took a handle and started off past high red brick walls toward the market singing happily at the top of our lungs we were crossing a small park when three teenagers stopped us what you kids got hey they been catching crabs by golly you guys are smart for tenyearolds hey jim come here and see what these kids got a figure got up from a group squatting along the curb some distance away and sauntered over our way i was relieved it was my big brother jim he recognized me too and hastily dropped a cigarette in the grass along the sidewalk i didnt know he smoked he walked up and said hi punk what you up to i told him we were making some money he wanted to know what for we gonna buy sam began who asked you nigger one of the others said but i will you shut up and let jim talk to his brother you little black jim whats the matter with you how come you take buttin in from a nigger yeah you turnin into a niggerlover like your brother one of the others joined in looking challengingly at jim jims face got red he turned on me you dont have to run around with him he turned and looked at a scared boy thats better jim give em hell this from a big leering blond jim sams my friend i pleaded besides we were just try in now dont tell me about your dealings with a nigger i dont know whats gotten into you all the white boys in town and you have to play with a jig he looked disdainfully at sams clothes soiled from the days crabbing and i saw something a look in his eyes that i couldnt remember seeing before you have to pick a dirty one at that one of the other teenagers moved closer maybe we ought to teach the nigger a lesson about running around with white boys lets start off with this he pushed sam over another boy who had crawled up and knelt on all fours behind my friend i kicked the kneeling boy in the stomach and the one whod pushed sam grabbed me better tell your kid brother to scram jim i yelled frantically until jim shook me and said get your butt home and stay out of this he gave me a shove somebody get one of those big crabs i heard him say as i started running for home and help well teach this little coon how to catch one by the claws i ran panting into the house and upstairs there wasnt a soul there i yelled at the neighbors house and nobody came out there wasnt anyone to help i thought about dads duck gun in the closet then remembered he kept the shells locked up i thought about a butcher knife and figured i couldnt beat that gang even with two knives by this time i told myself theyd probably let sam go anyway i prayed he wasnt hurt bad then i went out on the porch and got a box i took it up to jims room and put his five ships in bottles carefully in and carried them downstairs into the front yard i went into the shed around back and found a hammer i lugged it and a big rock out front beside the box and went to work methodically id set a bottle on the rock holding it by the neck id swing the hammer and shut my eyes to keep out the flying glass id next hammer the ship to splinters when i finished the five i went upstairs and got the bank i brought it down and worked on it with a hammer it gave after nine solid hits and i began to pick up coins with what i had in the pouch sam and id bought in the dimestore i had enough i was picking up the last scattered pennies when the gate creaked and i figured id had it i expected to get hit in the head but a gentle hand on the shoulder caused me to whirl in surprise it was my dad his sympathetic eyes cut away my fears hello young feller i hear you had a bad day mr wilson heard and saw most of what happened in the park and broke it up just when it was getting rough on sam hell be all right hes with his mother now well have a little talk with your brother tonight youve done a pretty good job of making him sorry already though his eyes surveyed the bits of glass thread and wood then fastened on the badlymangled bank looks like you were about to spend some money mind if i go along i shook my head and we walked through the quiet cobbled streets we came to the shop with the ship and i glanced in the window it was gone i raced in the door and shouted at the shopkeeper where is the ship wheres the ship that was in your window ive got to have it easy young man the whitehaired owner said winking at my father i heard a couple of young fellows were after that and i just put it in safekeeping wouldnt want the wrong persons to wind up with such a prize he reached under the counter and set the bluishgrey bottle in front of me shes a real dane and one of the last of her kind i counted the money automatically and pushed it across the polished wood then i picked up the bottle and with dad still silent beside me walked to sams house a sunburnedwhite framehouse with paint peeling and a broken screen on a side window we stepped on the creaky front porch and dad knocked sams mother came to the door kerchiefheaded a pained look in her eyes she didnt ask us in dad spoke i want to apologize for the actions of my older son somewhere along the line i failed and i want you to know im sorry he stepped back and i got my chance can i see sam please no the darkskinned woman said working hard to keep an impersonal tone to her voice sam dont want to see you hes learnt his lesson and will stay away from white boys from now on it shook me but i remembered the ship then will you give this to him i held out the bottle she took it without a word turned to go in the house hesitated a fraction of a second then continued into the dark interior i stood blankly gazing into the house then dads hands reached under my arms and lifted me i cried on his shoulder every step of the way home george moses horton slave this poem an impassioned plea for freedom was written by a negro slave who called himself an illiterate genius he addressed the poem to horace greeley and the famous editor published it in his paper the new york tribune george moses horton born a slave in northhampton county north carolina was characterized by dr collier cobb in his book an american man of letters as a slave who owned his master a poet ignorant of the rules of prosody a man of letters before he had learned to read a writer of short stories who was published in several papers simultaneously before the day of newspaper syndicates an author who supported himself and his family before authorship had attained the dignity of a profession in america this slave poet who styled himself an illiterate genius was the first writer in north carolina to support himself from his writings his book of poems the hope of liberty was the first book by a negro in the south george moses horton was born in slavery in north carolina about the property of william horton when he was about six years old his master moved to chatham county about eight miles from chapel hill the seat of the university of north carolina the young negro boy though he could not read or write began composing poems in his head these poems were composed to the meter of hymns he had heard in church hortons third owner and master hall horton the grandson of william horton allowed the young slave to travel the eight miles from the plantation to chapel hill to sell farm products the students at the university had a habit of amusing themselves by forcing the slaves to make speeches for the laughter it invoked the pranksters were greatly surprised and pleased when horton declaimed in original poetry all eyes were on me and all ears were open the slave poet later wrote and hence my fame soon circulated like a stream throughout the college the university students soon commissioned the young slave to compose love poems which they sent to their sweethearts back home since george horton could not write he dictated the words and the students wrote them down he received from to for his poems on the theme of love the following is a specimen of one of his earlier efforts which was dictated before he had learned to write the slave poet was to a large degree selftaught as revealed in his autobiography on well nigh every sabbath during the year he related did i retire away in the summer season to some shady and lonely recess where i could stammer over the dim and promiscuous syllables in my old black and tattered spelling book after studying spelling for some time horton taught himself to read at first he studied portions of the new testament later he studied miscellaneous poetry and the wesley hymns but the one person who taught the slave poet most about poetry and literature was a novelist from boston mrs caroline lee hentz mrs hentz had come to chapel hill as the wife of the professor of modem languages and she brought with her from new england a curiosity about slavery when the renown of the slave poet reached her ears she asked to meet him in her first novel lovells folly mrs hentz appended a note concerning horton saying that i have often transcribed stanzas which he would dictate with quite an air of inspiration and have marveled at the readiness with which he would change a verse or sentiment which was objected to as erroneous in expression or deficient in poetical harmony though familiar with the best classic works belonging to the fine libraries of the university he had not been taught to write a legible hand and was obliged to be indebted to others for embodying the dreams of his muse one of hortons poems that mrs hentz particularly liked was printed in her book lovells folly when mrs hentz left chapel hill it was necessary for the slave bard to secure another sponsor this was none other than the leading personality on the campus dr joseph caldwell the president of the university of north carolina dr caldwell initiated a campaign to purchase the slave poets freedom he interested some influential people including james k polk who had graduated in the class of by this time hortons owner had come to realize that he had an unusual property and the price asked for the slave poets freedom was very high since the money could not be raised the plans for hortons emancipation were forgotten and horton arranged to hire out his time that is he paid his master from his poetry money which he got from the students for the privilege of leaving the farm and living in chapel hill when he was unable to sell his poems to the students he worked either as janitor at the university or returned to the plantation to toil in the fields george horton never gave up his hope for freedom as is shown in a stanza from one of his poems that was composed shortly after the plans for his emancipation fell through on july at raleigh joseph gales and son issued hortons book of poems the hope of liberty this book was the first book ever produced by a negro in the southern states and it aroused much interest the preface of the book was the first instance in which the general public had been informed that a talented slave poet was in their midst george who is the author of the following poetical effusions is a slave the property of mr james horton of chatham county north carolina he has been in the habit for some years past of producing poetical pieces sometimes on suggested subjects to such persons as would write them while he dictated several compositions of his have already appeared in the raleigh register some have made their way into the boston newspapers and have evoked expressions of approbation and surprise many persons some of whom are elevated in office and literary attainments have now become interested in the promotion of his prospects they are solicitous that efforts at length be made to obtain by subscription a sum sufficient for his emancipation upon the condition of his going in the vessel which shall first afterwards sail for liberia george had heard of liberia and had often expressed a desire to go there he believed he could live a freer life and exercise his literary abilities to a fuller extent in liberia he wanted to be of greater help to his race and felt he could do it better there one of the best poems in the hope of liberty volume was entitled on liberty and slavery which also expressed the slave poets longing for freedom one of the men of literary attainment who became interested in the slave poet was horace greeley another who became interested in hortons poetry was miss mary youngs cheney from connecticut who taught school at warrenton north carolina miss cheney who later married horace greeley sent the famous editor the poem that begins this article it was a plea for freedom and is printed in its entirety at the beginning of this article the publication of the poem in greeleys famous new york tribune created some interest especially among the abolitionists but the enthusiasm soon waned and greeley himself lost interest in the slave poet only this one poem was published by the renowned editor and thus the slave bard lost his greatest opportunity for gaining his freedom the book of poems the hope of liberty was not a financial success and this left only one man for hope in gaining freedom this last patron dr joseph caldwell the president of unc died in and with his passing all hope of being a free man faded for the slave poet after the passing away of dr caldwell horton spent the savings he had accumulated for his anticipated trip to liberia on drink he began to beg the university students for money and began to write verses telling of the sickness and distress of his family in order to obtain money he would go from room to room in the dormitories and read these verses to the students always he would close with an appeal to lend a helping hand to the old unfortunate bard george horton became very bitter after all plans for his emancipation fell through and he wrote the following poem entitled the slaves complaint the old unfortunate bard lived on in the village of chapel hill for years after the publication of his book the hope of liberty in general william tecumseh sherman entered north carolina on his return from the march to the sea one day in the spring of one of hortons slave friends came to his shanty and reported seeing a large group of soldiers on horseback horton knew that these were cavalrymen and he made his plans to escape to their lines he went to his master hall horton and asked if he could carry some produce to the village he was granted permission mr horton was not aware that union cavalry was in the vicinity george then loaded his produce in a bag and slung it over the back of an old horse that his master had managed to keep through the four years of the war he headed for chapel hill until he got out of sight of the plantation and then urged the old horse in the direction his friend had said the union cavalrymen were located night had fallen as george arrived at the northern picket lines being unaware of how an army with sentinals operated he rode into the lines and failed to halt when he was challenged the pickets started firing and the old poet leaped from his old horse and lay on the ground this act saved his life george started to sing an old spiritual in a loud voice and the sentinels knew he wasnt an enemy he was allowed to come into the lines of the union cavalry and at the age of about he was free at last the old poet soon began to write poems for the union troops to send home to their sweethearts just as he had written love poems for the students at the university of north carolina his work came to the attention of a union officer captain will h s banks captain banks took horton to philadelphia and helped him in the publication of his final book it was entitled naked genius and was published in october in the preface captain banks stated that it would be offered to the public as one of the many proofs that god in his infinite wisdom and mercy created the black man for a higher purpose than to toil his life away under the galling yoke of slavery shortly after arriving at philadelphia horton was considered as quite a celebrity he was invited to speak at many meetings of people who were interested in poetry soon horton lost the bitterness he had known previously when his freedom was denied he was able to compose in a light vein as in his creditor to his proud debtor life in the city of brotherly love proved to be not so easygoing as in the sunny south for the illiterate genius the people of philadelphia soon lost interest in the negro bard and the naked genius was forced to seek means other than writing to earn his livelihood fame is such a fleeting thing that george moses horton the slave poet died about almost forgotten by all black mutiny go below and get some bread and throw it to the niggers captain ferrer roared believing the slaves hungry as he spoke to antonio the cook the mutineers emerged from the focsle shouting brandishing sugar cane knives they were not hungry for bread but for freedom through the rainy mist appeared cinque the bold insurgent leader his blade swished through the air striking the captain

to put in finally they dropped anchor off culloden point near montauk dressed in silk loin cloths and blankets some of the men went ashore with spanish gold doubloons they purchased supplies from the nearby residents captain henry green of sag harbor who had read newspaper accounts of the vessel of suspicious character sighted off sandy hook and had heard whisperings about the black men with the gold doubloons ventured down to the beach with a company of his men through banna cinque asked if the country had slaves no captain green answered this is a free country any spaniards here banna asked captain green shook his head for four hours the men talked banna interpreting as best he could and cinque using sign language cinque offered to give captain green the schooner if he would sail them to

decide only whether the men were slaves or free the amistad case grew enormous in stature the spanish government demanded cinques extradition great britain which had allowed naweli the interpreter a leave from his ship asked leniency gibbs countersued montez and ruiz charging false arrest newspapers loved the rich human interest of the story and sent their best correspondents to cover the trial when the jury handed down its decision cinque and his men were freed but the government prosecutor appealed for almost a year while the case awaited a date on the u s supreme court calendar cinque and his men were held in a small jail in westville conn they were allowed a fair measure of freedom and local people taught them some english reading and writing almost daily the newspapers reported on their progress by february the case had at last gotten to the supreme court the eminent expresident john quincy adams was the defense attorney the supreme courts decision came quickly cinque and his men were declared not to be spanish subjects and hence ineligible for extradition further the court ruled that they had been enslaved in violation of the spanish decree of which prohibited slavery the captives were set free dismissed from the custody of the court and ordered to go without delay cinque returned to mendi land to his wife and three children soon afterwards he died there in today there is a mural at talladega college talladega alabama commemorating this historic freedomfighter i am a black muslim i and proud of it proclaimed cassius clay the new heavyweight boxing champion of the world and a lot of us were shocked no matter that young mr clay has yet to prove that he isnt in the words he himself applied to floyd patterson a cheese champion no matter that he won boxings richest most coveted crown because his opponent couldnt raise his left arm no matter that cassius is an unlettered overgrown boy no matter how you slice it mr clay is a karat celebrity one of the best known negroes in the united states and his public announcement that he belonged proudly to a fanatical negro supremacy group inevitably raised many hackles among the white majority the black muslims it is true represent a tiny segment of the american negro population all of the most respected negro leaders have disowned them some using extraordinarily strong words but that doesnt make the muslims go away theyre here quite probably to stay the black muslims despite mr clays naive statements to the contrary have no connection with the religion of islam they arent in fact any more muslim than the shriners their platform advocates black supremacy arguing that black is black and white is white and never the two shall meet ironically they share this belief with the diehard white supremacists both arguing that negroes and whites werent intended to integrate negroes have nothing to gain the black muslims argue everything to lose from associating with whites all whiteled efforts for civil_rights they say are a waste of time meant only to delude negroes to my knowledge no responsible leader white or negro considers the muslims seriously as a social or political force for one thing elijah muhammed malcolm_x and their associates are blandly vague when it comes to charting specific courses of future action except for immediate policies and postures they have little to offer the negro and most negroes are far too leery of the primrose path to buy another patent medicine just because the medicine men are black but the black muslims have a message for all americans unfortunately it doesnt seem to be getting through to many of us the muslims are a kind of symbol of the new negro mood a mood widely shared by negroes who laugh to scorn the muslim movement itself the new mood says this is the end of the line we want our rights now and please dont do us any favors the people who may be the most disconcerted by this new mood are the white liberals the friends of the negro those who have been on the firing lines for many years some since the early new deal days are especially rattled by the hard realism of the negro attitude not many years ago negroes appreciated the efforts of whites to gain their rights for them sometimes they were even grateful twenty years ago when i first encountered the racial justice firing line myself there was a were all in this together camaraderie between negroes and the whites who were battling alongside them the economic and social acceptance of negroes or even a negro by a group of whites or a white organization brought a warm glow in both groups those were the days when negroes and their white friends took unconscionable pride in the achievements of marian anderson ralph bunche and especially jackie robinson even then of course the winds of change were beginning to blow in the midforties an elderly white clergyman and i grudgingly sat up all night on a miserable train because hotels in the town where we were addressing a brotherhood meeting would not accommodate the third member of our trio a negro minister the two of us would have closed ranks with the latter more graciously if he hadnt been a thoroughly disagreeable man who wore his race like a badge and who all but dared us to yield our comfort to the principles we professed while this angry young negro may have temporarily arrested the cause of brotherhood in two white men of good will he might also have taught us that his rights were just that and not privileges today the negro has stopped being grateful for things that belong to him by right things which he has been illegally denied since the emancipation proclamation one hundred years ago and if they dont bristle like rednecked southern hill folk when they hear the expression of a finally emancipated negro attitude the white liberal champions of the negro can hardly be blamed for feeling a little like parents when they learn their grown children are no longer dependent on them perhaps not many negroes are as baldly aggressive as the comedian who purports to run a rentanegro service for people who want to have an integrated party but the humor in this jibe doesnt reflect the wry amusement that many negroes feel when they watch the lastoneinisadirtyword scramble of the white johnnycomelately integrationists novelist james baldwin who is as typical of his generation as the courtly a philip randolph is of his has no qualms about rubbing the noses of the friendliest whites in the dirt of longdenied opportunities not long ago mr baldwin took television viewers with him while he toured san franciscos harlem preening strutting and muttering phrases that blended jeremiah and the new yorker without benefit of monosodium glutamate baldwin bitingly typified the new negro mood when one of the people he questioned gave a disen chanted reply to a blunt query the little novelist would cast down his eyes sagely and mutter the kind of cocktail party apostrophe so often mistaken for the spark of genius mr baldwin did nothing for the negro image neither did the less gifted negroes he interviewed some of the latter like cassius clay espoused the black muslims others told of their encounters with white mens justice and white mens jails several spoke crudely one was obscene and his obscenity brought a shrill giggle from baldwin the churches took their lumps in other candid comments white viewers could help themselves to reactions anger shock fright indignation sadness disgust surely no favorable white reaction was likely negro public relations must have suffered terribly i wondered how many white viewers felt shame shame because white greed and exploitation and intolerance had created among the negroes the same need for demagogues that that other depressed group the old south feels shame for white policies that for generations kept negroes in social and economic bondage that reduced negroes to hatinhand gratitude for white favors that shouldnt have been favors at allbut rights if he had a choice of white reactions this program would arouse mr baldwin and i think most negroes would probably prefer to see shame but chances are he wouldnt much care the american negro has very nearly stopped looking for white approval he is probably more indifferent to such approval than most whites are to the approval of their fellow whites and he is certainly more indifferent to white approval than he is to the approval of his fellow negroes the new solidarity of the negroes is only indirectly the child of ghetto life the latter is a cringing huddling together for selfdefense the new negro solidarity is a proud defiant and for the first time in american negro history a joyful thing the negro long ago put away his banjo and removed the cleats from his dancing shoes in the last decade he has also served notice that the niceties of brotherhood week will have to wait at least until he has the rights that our constitution describes as godgiven for the rest of us the medicine may be increasingly bitter as we wake up to the fact that demands are replacing requests we may not like sitins and boycotts and picketingwe may in fact be right in arguing that these tactics do more harm than good but we have forfeited our right to argue the point by our centurylong foot dragging on negro rights short of widespread bloody violenceand please god therell be none of that we cant even resist much less stop the march and ultimate triumph of the negro rights movement it is truly an idea whose time has come and its much much too late in the day for christmas baskets the steps to freedom a dreadful quiet is beginning to settle over the recently tumultuous civil_rights scene here in america it is an ominous quiet which seems to be issuing from the depths of the broken hearts the frustrated dreams and the dashed hopes of those most affectedthe american negro it is like the calm which precedes the most deadly storm it is as if those long dead have returned momentarily to the play of life to set the stage for some subsequent savage act which will send many new souls to join them in the long cold corridors of the misty unknown it has long been known that it is the nature of man to not only be free but to struggle against all forms of oppression whether it be religious political moral or immoral the negro in america has been morally and politically oppressed for over a century and like the many generations of man before him he has been and is struggling against that oppression and its effects he is for example evolving with certainty in the same direction as did the oppressed people of france during the one hundred years immediately prior to bastille day on july the fact that he is outnumbered by approximately nine to one in population will neither halt nor slow the impetus of his forward thrust for it is as certain as death itself that man must reach out for freedom even in the face of overwhelming odds and inhumane treatment the entire history of mans inhumanity to man reveals that freedom for those oppressed evolves from the public reaction to four basic phases or steps in human behaviour they are in order first cooperation with the oppressor secondthe persuasion of or the reasoning with the oppressor third coercion and threats against the oppressor and fourthviolence bloodshed and death the negro in america today has come to the climax of the third step for nearly two hundred years as slaves and later freed slaves his father and his grandfather cooperated with their oppressors in the vain hope that at some future date their sons and daughters would be able to walk tall in the land as free men and women but this has not come to pass for the sons and the grandsons of the slaves are still not free even though they themselves have been pleading withand attempting to persuadethe sons and grandsons of their oppressors for nearly fifty years many reasons have been advanced as the basis for the continued subjugation of the black man in america some students of human behaviour state that economic competition and drives toward individual security causes the whites to continue to cling to the advantage handed down to them by their slaveholding ancestors others blame family conditioning and tradition that is to say that the son is conditioned within the family to hate what his father hates and to love what his father loves if the father contends that black is a sign of evil then no amount of logic and reason can make the son think otherwise there are other philosophies too numerous to mention here except to state the simple fact that the more accustomed one becomes to oppressing someone else whatever the reason the stronger becomes the feeling of selfexultation and selfworship that grows within him and that the longer these feelings exist the more difficult it becomes to even think of relinquishing them that then has been and still is the conscious or subconscious position of the white man in america today it is the position of the socalled liberal as well as the john bircher and it is the position of the poor white man as well as the rich it was because of these tenacious viewpoints that the disgusted oppressed negro population launched what is popularly known as the negro revolt this writer would prefer to call it the transition to the step before the revolt inspired by the courageous stands taken by a few outspoken negro ministers in the racehating south the dejected negro all over the country took heart and began to look upon themselves with pride the embers of their dying hopes once again began to glow and from that feeble spark a few great writers took their pens and fanned those embers into a blazing flame baldwin lomax and others reached to the heavens with brilliant words and phrases and sounded the clarion call of freedomfreedom uplifted exultant and rededicated negroes of all ages and from all walks of life began to march side by side with whites who felt their urgency and to sing the songs of liberty in the north in the south in the east and in the west they sang they picketed they demonstrated and they marched into the face of vicious dogs and danger into fire hoses and furious oppressors and into the dark jails thus in glory began the third act or more definitively the third step toward freedom this was the coercive phase the large dissenting crowds the loud dissenting voice the pulse of poverty throbbing in anticipation of the better life to be the eager surging forward motion of that part of the nation which had long been held back but now beheld the light of freedom within reach these were the determined two hundred and fifty thousand people who gathered in the nations capital on august and demanded release from bondage this too was the anticlimax the desperate appeal to bring the play to a happy conclusion this was the final bid for the goodwill which never came for those who would oppress still do and those who hate for the sake of hate itself have still not changed their minds indeed they have stood their ground nothing has changed except perhaps that the subtle discrimination which existed before the great march is subtler still and now as the curtain prepares to fall on act threethe flame dies and the stage grows ominously still all that is left of the great anticlimax are the children playing in the ashes of what was once a brightly burning flame in the wings stand the ghosts of john brown of medgar evers of john fitzgerald kennedy and of many morewaiting patiently to set the stage for a long and bloody act four should act four begin there is no doubt that the black man will perish in america for he has neither the means the numbers nor the methods to pursue his goal with arms this fact within itself would not be so terrible men have died before in order that their children might go free if a man is not willing to die for his principles then either his principles are not sound or the man himself is not worthy of holding them the curse of black slavery still lies heavily over the rocks and rills of america it hangs like an ominous cloud over the highest mountain and it creeps like an odorous vine through the bright valleys of wisdom and truth tainting the christian church warping the nations children and twisting the minds of even the most knowledgable men that we must rid ourselves of this pestilence before it destroys us has long been known and were it not for the awesome expectation of the eventual fulfillment of the prophesies it might well be that the blood of the american negro is the only blood that is whole enough to wash the stain away the problem however goes deeper than that and the implications contained within it are heavy enough to shake the very foundations of the earth this then is a prophesynot just a mere conglomeration of words it is a prophesy accompanied by a prayer that the fourth step in the american negroes fight for freedom will never be taken for if this bloody act in the play begins the spark from it will ignite a holocaust that will destroy not only the white man but the population of the entire known world it will be the beginning of a conflict the likes of which has never been witnessed by mankind true there have been wars and rumors of war since the beginning of time several years ago a writer for the new york times noted that in years of recorded history there have been years of war and only years of peace these wars no doubt were fought in many lands for many reasons but never in the history of man has a war been fought merely on the basis of color yet should the american negro be forced to take the next step and take it he will for there is no turning back and thus provoke his end this is the type of war that the world will become engaged in the black brown yellow and the red men three fourths of the worlds population long dissatisfied with the treatment afforded them over the centuries by the white men of the world have for years been banding themselves together on these common grounds and all of the american millions poured out to them under the name of foreign aid has not been enough to halt this trend nor has it been enough to buy their love the rising nations of africa invariably join the causes of asia castro of cuba is spreading his influence over all of latin america including mexico the gateway to the united states france who claims her heritage from egypt and africa is wooing the darkskinned people of asia africa and latin america japan and the far east have joined hands and the fearful dragon of red china is rattling its chains so hard that white russia our former bitter enemyhas fearfully jumped into bed with us and with our allies missiles and nuclear fission are no longer the exclusive possessions of the two great powers and there is enough fire power around in the rest of the world to also blow us off the face of the globe while we are busy blowing someone else up it is of prime importance then that the fourth step in the american negroes fight for freedom be forestalled this is not to say that he should not have his liberty for certainly he must it is merely stated here that the curtain for the third act should not be allowed to fall until the act itself is brought to at least a workable conclusion this can only be accomplished by a miracle of concessions that must be made by both the american negro and the american white man they must first of all together concede that there is a cultural chasm of approximately one hundred years between them and they must combine in their efforts to bridge this gap before it is too late by holding the negro back or standing on his shoulders the white man has amassed most of the wealth in america and all of the power that wealth brings with it by allowing himself to be held back that is to say that by not fighting and dying for his rights in the first placethe american negro has put himself into a cultural position that will make the acceptance of freedom most difficult for him when it finally comes let us therefore not be naive to fully integrate is to eventually assimilate and amalgamate how can two groups of people amalgamate without conflict if their levels of culture and understanding are at opposite poles the problem now before us is how to unbrainwash those who have been thoroughly brainwashed and how to erase the bitterness and disillusionment of one hundred years in a few short months it will not be an easy task but it must be done the cultural gap between the races in america created by the slave trade and its after effects must be quickly closed and forever sealed if we are to survive as a nation difficult though this task may be it can and it must be done the fortunate white man who has profited much from this dilemma created by his ancestors must now spend some of this money to pay for vast social work programs retraining and educational projects aimed at the betterment of not only the unfortunate negro but the unfortunate white as well he must pay this bill because the negro has not been allowed to profit and can not afford to pay the negro meanwhile must take inventory of himself and gird for his new role in society no longer will he be considered as just a boy he will be considered as and he must assume the role of a man willing and able to assume his full share of the responsibilities that accompany the rights that he has fought so long to acquire when this is done the bright glow of liberty will again envelope this land and our children will walk hand and hand together in its glow setting an example for the rest of the world to follow
enriched history for the white man he milling process j r destroys the vitamins ii and sucks the minerals out of our tlour for years this resulted in malnutrition in families whose diet centered on bread rickety spavined pimply or otherwise defective bodies were the consequence only when the millers accepted the simple suggestion of some genius that they put back what theyd been taking out was this source of social evil stopped the restored product was called enriched flour honest white scholars have most of them come to agree with what negro scholars have long known for many decades reaching back prior to the turn of the century the school subject that was taught as american history wasnt that at all the vitamins of the contribution of the negro to our nation and its heritage and the minerals of the truth about race relations were carefully removed the effect of the resulting mental malnutrition has been devastating to the negro it was destructive of his sense of personal worth of selfrespect of identityexcept when through family traditions or by benefiting from the single virtue of a segregated college he learned some of the truth to the white it was a calamity it contributed largely to a corruption of the spirit rickety and pimply mental and spiritual attitudes were the effect of the bleached history product through the years an awakening and fighting talented tenth has promoted a subject which for lack of a better name has been called negro history w e b du bois and carter g woodson were the founding fathers of the fight until very recently the work of exploiting their breakthroughs was confined within racial channels it was almost exclusively the negro writer editor reader and student who obtained the benefit the result was separate and not very equal it was not the true american heritage the isolated presentation of the story of the negro in america was as incomplete in its own way as the story of america without the negro short of the day when the integrated story would be told two incomplete tales were better than one the average american public school has continued to teach the standard bleached product devitalized at best in its absence of reference to negro achievement and participation in american life poisoned at worst in its falsehoods and distortions concerning the role of the negro in such epochal periods as the abolitionist and the reconstruction eras this is a problem and an evil that has not been sectional moreover during a period when under the pressure of the negro revolution the moral climate has improved somewhat there has been little mitigation of the faults of the past in professor lawrence d reddick wrote for the journal of negro history a study of southern u s history texts among his findings the place and development of the negro in the national life since the granting of freedom and citizenship are ignored almost completely these authors usually depict the negroes as pawns passive instruments in the hands of others during reconstruction in dr lloyd marcus compiled for the antidefamation league a study of the treatment of minorities in texts the achievements of living negro americans are mentioned in very few books american negroes are portrayed for the most part in the eras of slavery and reconstruction what comes through in most books is a stereotype of a simple childlike superstitious people thus what professor reddick saw in the southern school textbooks of the s was found by the bnai briths researchers to be true on a national scale in lacking in the adl evaluation is one critical fact that the reconstruction sambo stereotype is the product of gross falsehood the cumulative result of a libel on a whole people gross falsehood is a strong phrase not lightly used by one trained as an attorney to be careful in the choice of words but it is not my own it is the phrase of professor arnold rose coauthor with gunnar myrdal of an american dilemma as a sociologist whose principal concern has been with the problem he has studied and evaluated most u s history writings in an effort to get at the roots of bigotry and prejudice in our land he focuses his attention on this issue in his essay in the new book that he edited assuring freedom to the free and how does it happen asks professor rose that most white americans believe this gross falsehood it happens because their teachers teach it in the public schools and the teachers learned it at the teachers colleges and the teachers colleges got it from the professors at the great universities the professors got it not out of scholarly researches but out of the postreconstruction apologies for the south written by negrohaters now a gross falsehood is just another way of saying big lie and those of us who are old enough to remember joseph goebbels know that hitlers masterpropagandist preached and practised the doctrine that a falsehood repeated often enough can enslave the minds of men those whites whose image of the negro is derived solely or primarily from what they have learned in school histories are vexed and perplexed today taught all their lives to believe in the stereotypes that were created to justify separation and inequality they find themselves suddenly preached at and told they have been wrong youve got to be taught to hate and fear ran the song in rodgers and hammersteins interracial hit south pacific youve got to be carefully taught should it surprise us to find that some whites resent moving over and making room foror even extending a friendly hand tothose they were taught to hate when an individual is libeledthe victim of a malicious falsehoodthe law requires retraction or compensation or both what is the remedy for decades of libel against a whole people belatedly educators are coming to see said time magazine commenting on the district of columbias new separate supplemental pamphlet for school history classes the negro in american history that it is high time to desegregate the teaching of u s history not only is it high time it is too little and too late french statesman georges clemenceau is supposed to have said that war is much too important to leave to the generals the need for remedying the misteaching of american history is too vital to leave it to the schools and the teachers the educators have failed us they have bequeathed to us three generations of white americans whose many variants of the question why are they pushing so fast betrays their ignorance of their own heritage as much as it does their utter lack of moral sense there are various schools of psychiatry today differing theories as to how mental illness should be treated most agree that the important objective is to cause the patient to develop insight into his character structure something most effectively accomplished by reexamination of ones early life so that one can get at the root of false beliefs about himself the psychiatrist strives to demonstrate the contradiction between the way a situation actually was and the way the patient thought it was between the way the patient was behaving and the way he thought he was behaving the irrational rejection of human beings because of the shade of skincolorphobiain the united states is the greatest case of mass mental illness in the worlds history it cannot be cured by laws alone nor by simply saying that what was right yesterday is wrong today who is there to do this job that the educators have made necessary this is the hardest part of the fight as the negro revolution moved into its decisive phase loren miller correctly pointed out that freedom nowtoday is a slogan that implies rejection of the dogma that racial reforms must await a change in the hearts and minds of men what the militants have missed however is that those hard hearts must be moved and those warped minds cured there is nothing sensational glamorous or exciting about history the ambitious or publicityhungry leader sees no percentage in it they debate in their press releases about the resistance the white backlash the need for new toolsand give little attention to the importance of the freedom writer to consolidate the grains that the freedom rider has achieved what is needed as a weapon to win the negro revolution is an adult education program of unimaginably vast proportions its content should neither be called negro history nor constitute merely that there is a hidden american heritage to be unearthed that can enrich us all few white americans know the magnificent life story of frederick douglass one can return again and again to his writings and find a lesson for today but the culturally deprived american has not been told of wendell phillips either or been given his magnificent insights into the nature of the relationship between capital and labor one perceptive theologian prof a j heschel has likened the phase of the negro revolution to the crossing of the red sea by the israelites there still remained ahead of them the hardships of the wilderness the israelites murmured against moses in the desert and said what shall we drink for there was no water in the same fashion the negro will justly cry out after a civil_rights bill is passed what shall we eat we want adequate education decent housing proper employment there are lessons as to how these problems can be solved in the enriched history that we must all learn the vitamins and minerals that have been removed include not merely the contribution of the negro to our heritage few know the lives and teachings of such great and nearforgotten americans as theodore parker the brook farmers and the other radical reformers of the abolitionist era or john boyle oreilly john peter altgeld and the populists not all of whom became racists of the later nineteenth century the great lesson to be learned is that a war on poverty cannot be waged from the top the poor and the men and women of conscience of the middle class must unite in political action if the causes of poverty are to be removed understanding the past said arthur schlesinger jr can be the key to the future the past is never dead says one of william faulkners characters it is not even past the present condition of the human race is solely a product of its history if that condition is to be changed for the better it can be effectively done only by beginning with a reexamination of that history we must find out what really happened as the psychiatrist says to cure ourselves from the sickness that comes from what we have been deluded into thinking was our past when dr w e b du bois wrote the declaration of independence of the third american revolution the resolutions of the niagara movement of he said the battle we wage is not for ourselves alone but for all true americans some of the white trash of the north who have been revealed in the last few months will never understand this there is some folks said louis armstrong once that if they dont know you cant tell em but most americans can and will come to learn that the negro revolution is their own cause after they have relearned their history and cast aside the myths and stereotypes they learned in school will they understand they are not merely doing something for the negro when they ally themselves with him the battle for justice to the negro in our history is but a part of the battle for justice to the whole truth in our history when that is gained ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make ye free f for balt i m o r e gaines the announ cer intones its the seventh inning of a sunday game at tiger stadium in detroit a solidly set negro jogs out to his position peers at the sky and adjusts his sun glasses gaines whos he one fan asks another a shrug some substitute they use him against lefties once in a while i think the second fan was right he would also have been right had he added and aint that something tommy davis a negro was the national leagues best batter in clarence choo choo coleman also a negro was the worst with a resounding average of and that is far more significant it is seventeen years since jackie roosevelt for teddy robinson suited up for a game of ball where an apartment house now grows in brooklyn quite likely there are high school seniors born on that cloudy april day in to whom allwhite baseball belongs with prohibition suffragettes and the depression they know such things once were but why bring up that ancient history to a fan a bit older than seventeen observing the passage of the seasons from a threatened st louis cardinal player strike against robinson to a st louis cardinal lineup with bill white curt flood and bob gibson taking the field the interesting thing is this negroes of varying abilitiesstars almoststars journeymen and shortlived flops have come in played and hung up the routine flowthrough is under way celebrating the fact that colored athletes have achieved the inalienable right to be ordinary and even mediocre big leaguers twas not always thus hardly years after robinson quite literally changed the complexion of the game a negro ballplayer had to be decidedly better than good if he couldnt make it big and quick not for him the luxury of a fairtomiddlin batting average and a seat on the bench at big league pay whats more he was expected to comport himself at all times and under all provocations as a colored little lord fauntleroy toward the opposition and his majesty the umpire robinson seven years after retirement from the game a poor second in the national most famous jackie sweepstakes bore much of the initial brunt of baseballs social progress a lonely figure swinging around the allwhite circuit at phiadelphia boston new york chicago pittsburgh cincinnati and st louis he would wryly tell friends coming out to the game youll be able to tell me by my number of course they were also able to tell jackie robinson by his electrifying skills with bat glove and flying feet managing to win rookie of the year honors while in the frightful pressure cooker of pioneering must be one of the sports accomplishments of all time two years later he was voted most valuable a tightlipped performer out of agreed necessity at the start by the time he finished he might also have been voted most voluble the real jackie robinson had stood upoutgoing aggressive proud sometimes irritating but rarely dull now three years older than the uniform number he dramatized jackie is portly and quite gray though unmistakably jackie robinson with quickly intense small features nearfalsetto voice and pigeonlike gait many may have already forgotten the characteristic way he went out in a welter of headlines and conjecture after the season he was traded by brooklyn to the giants about par for the course in the business of baseball never exactly noted for unwavering devotion to its stars black or white once their usefulness wanes babe ruth was sluffed off by the yankees to the boston braves ty cobb was sent from tigers to as tris speaker from indians to senators dizzy dean from cards to cubs and so it goes baseball owners are less sentimental than baseball fans and usually wealthier just as new york fans were becoming intrigued by the thought of grizzled old number facing his old team in a crucial game grizzled old number said the hell with it and became a youthful food chain executive more recently and more quietly finished was larry doby first to make it into the other league though somehow rarely thought of as a symbol six years younger than robinson this brooding outfielders career was cut short by leg muscle in juries which are no respecter of stereotypes about special kinds of muscles beneath black skins there were no big articles about dobys decline and fall nothing summing up the kind of athlete the big leagues second negro had been even at his best there often seemed in the press boxes a feeling of disappointment about larry the tendency was to think of him as one who never fully realized an extravagant potential his temperament it was said hurt him unlike robinson he did not have the ready catharsis of giveandtake articulativeness and sometimes carried his real and fancied grievances into the dugout as a private weight yet a glance back at larry dobys record makes it pertinent to wonder if the mixed judgments were not tinged by the now happily disappearing double standard in which a negro was always expected to be exceptional after all here was a youngster who jumped directly from the haphazard negro leagues to cleveland batted over as a key regular on a championship club in his first full season and made the allstar game five times in when cleveland won a record games doby led the league in home runs and runs batted in hit into only seven double plays and was a superlative defensive center fielder for games black or white introvert or extrovert thats a lot of ballplayer robinson and doby these were the first the special ones starting the long overdue process of taking the quotation marks from around americas national pastime partly because of what they went through with so much fortitude lineups included not only the scintillating likes of willie mays elston howard henry aaron tommy davis maury wills orlando cepeda frank robinson willie mccovey juan pizzaro earl battey vada pinson bill white etc etc but the aforementioned choo choo coleman a yankee substitute named hector lopez and journeyman parttimers such as pumpsie green felix mantilla jake wood bob perry and joe gaines not to knock the latter group like ranking the astronauts its all relative nobody in this highly exacting craft who makes it to the big leagues is an oaf with three thumbs but within the high context of the lands best ballplayers the greens and mantillas are brothers in ordinariness to lesser lights in whiter epidermis perhaps the paradox of progress to mediocrity can best be seen in the growingly varied caliber of those who have joined jackie robinson and larry doby as negroes who once were big leaguers george crowe muscularly owlish parttime first baseman and pinch hitter jim pendleton who never quite cut it after a good start ray noble and charley white a couple of commonplace catchers who moved up but couldnt stay there bob boyd smalling stylish fielder who set no worlds afire at bat bob thurman a not quite benchwarmer in fact you name a particular type of ballplayer and by now theres likely to be a negro big leaguer or former big leaguer to fit the description like the highly touted minor league prospect who is too much and cant miss but does pitcher humberto robinson who came to the eager milwaukee braves in from an astounding season with jacksonville where he led the sally league in victories percentage earned run average shutouts strikeouts and what have you the collegiate bonus beauty who fizzles in the big time earl robinson plucked off the university

union of r south africa is noted for two products both rockhard and apparently durable though one product is synonymous with wealth while the other is the embodiment of evil the products are diamonds and apartheidthe one a brilliant jewel the other an ignominious political plot the diamonds provide the countryand much of the western worldwith riches which in the way of that world justify whatever else is done to make the riches possible and apartheidwhich means simply racial discrimination on a grandiose scaleprovides the white rulers of the country with the endless supply of cheap black labor needed to dig the diamonds from the earth in recent years however parts of europe africa and the united states have been exposed to still another product from south africa a woman with a talent as firm and dazzling as a diamond and invested with all the bittersweet soulfulness bred by the struggle against apartheids dehumanizing forces she is zensi miriam makeba and her brilliance is a match for any diamond since her arrival in the united states in miss makeba has appeared on numerous television shows toured the country in a series of concertswith harry belafonte and aloneand entertained in a range of night clubs from the cozy village vanguard in new york to the plush san souci in las vegas there was nothing quite like her then and there is nothing to equal her now she is absolutely unique as all great performers must be and yet paradoxically there is nothing unusual about her consider she is small of staturepetite reallywith large expressive eyes a crown of short unstraightened hair and a pleasant but unpretty face her voice is soft and low altogether feminine but also otherwise unremarkable one has the impression thatin a crowded roomshe might slip unobtrusively into the background and that the other people in the room might leave her there she seems that shy and retiring and that deserving of respect but once she takes the spotlight she is transformed she seems to literally grow in size the dark eyes flash with fire and the voice flows out all honey and steel and crystal following miss makebas opening at new yorks blue angel a few seasons back time magazines hardbitten critic was disarmed the closecropped woolly head and the sleek white fifth avenue gown come from different worlds but the combination has a charm and a grace of its own he wrote in a ballad she maintains the clean classic phrasing of a church singer she can be roguish in a west indian ditty about a naughty flea and she can make a chilling lament of a warriors retreat song indeed she is a magician with moods within moments she can set her audience laughing leave them awed into silence or bring them close to tears audiences are particularly delighted with her click song a tonguetripping number in which she employs the incredible soundswithinsounds which her people the xhosa pronounced khosa consider routine click song is really qonqgonthwane but it seems few people other than the xhosa can do it justice zensi miriam makeba was born march in prospect township one of the allblack settlements surrounding johannesburg her father was a schoolteacher and her mother worked as housemaid a job young miriam also later took she attended the kilmerton training institute in pretoria for eight years but dropped out and went to work with her mother when tuition could no longer be paid although she had been singing at school church and at weddings funerals and benefits for years it was not until she was that miss makeba was invited to join an established group of singers the black manhattan brothers she was the lone girl with men the group toured the rhodesias and the congo as well as south africa but it was mostly rough going the bus often broke down she recalled and after the first five months i was crying all the time but they kept telling me the show must go on we always managed to get there on time her reputation grew however and she was soon making records and appearing in revues then she was cast as the female lead in the musical king kong based on the life of a local prizefighter and she was on her way the musical did not have easy sledding for it was opposed by racists and banned in some cities still it managed to play in south africa for eight months it was the first time a production written by an african had ever experienced such success and london was interested for months miss makeba had longed to go to london thinking that in england she might earn real money and perhaps achieve the fame routinely denied black entertainers in south africa she had applied for a passport and after nearly two years had received it during the run of king kong american producer lionel rogosin had spotted miss makeba and he offered her a singing role in a movie he was shooting surreptitiously the was movie entered back africa venice come in the film festival and on the strength of her performance in it miss makeba was invited to venice she was permitted to leave south africa meanwhile rogosin screened his film for steve allen who offered to feature show and miss makeba on his nightclub owner max gordon was persuaded to book her except for flights back to england and africa kenya and tanganyika not south africa she has not been home since but south africa remains home her beloved country makeba confesses thatand miss someday there she wants to go home again not now because as she says down if you arent white you may be a star but youre still a nothing and miriam makeba is certainly something a new era in race rej lations ushered in at birmingham by a peo pies revolution demands that a major national effort be made to prepare the negro masses to use the rights being won for them such a program is urgently needed because attainment of civil_rights will not secure equality for negroes a program of preparation must go handinhand with desegregation efforts if the problem of secondclass citizenship is to be solved once and for all a negro alliance for progress could be the answer until recently most southern whites have pretended to believe that negroes were satisfied in their status and the majority of other white americans have been either apathetic or indifferent to the negroes plight recent events and incidents have caught the whites ill preparedwith no plan to direct the coming changes toward equality of status for the most part negroes have been engaged in assaulting the crumbling walls legal and other forms of segregation and discrimination keeping their gaze fixed on the operations or giving moral and financial aid to the cause but organizations devoted to the moral cultural and intellectual standards have been sadly neglected now through direct action negro leaders have succeeded in getting the whites to listen they must seize the opportunity to prove that they are not only striving to change a social order that excludes onetenth of its citizens but to construct a better order which encompasses freedom and justice for all negro community leaders should begin at once to organize socialwelfare programs in every negro community in the nation to help the disadvantaged masses all along the linein every department of public life the problem is of great magnitude but leaders must perceive the need and face up to the task now inasmuch as negroes have been subjected to an inferior status for hundreds of years the federal state and local governments should assist them in bridging the gap into normal american society because of the tremendous breadth and scope of the problem and the need of national direction the federal government should set up a negro alliance for progress it should train people as if to serve in the peace corps the trainees should be prepared to go into the city ghettos and slums of the nations cities to work at the grass roots of the gigantic problem they should help negro leaders perfect community organizations the object of which would be to give the negro masses purpose motivation and incentive to better their lot community chapters of a negro alliance for progress should be widely based to form its official family negro leaders must reach out into the communities for representation from as many institutions and organizations as possible a negro alliance for progress organization must operate in a community center its finances must come mainly from participating organizations and from private donations but the federal government should contribute to the maintenance of the staff especially the experts coordinators to help in the overall operation the work of the organization should be carried on through a number of departments and committees there should be an executive officer in each community organization the alliance would have such departments as education civic affairs family life child care and recreation all workers would give volunteer service its professional help would be drawn from teachers social workers college students and retired people since education is the surest way out of the slums special stress must be put upon this phase of the alliance basic instruction should be given in reading arithmetic and english for those who cannot profit by attending the established adult education schools operated by city school boards training of this kind is urgently needed by unemployed undereducated adults and young people many of whom are school dropouts such training will prepare them to acquire the skills needed to compete in the job market in this connection the alliance can give the individuals counseling and guidance about the type of training they need to secure technological employment and about the places to get such training counselors should also make a determined effort to get dropouts to return to school an alliance could promote trips for youth to cultural centers of interest and familynights at the center workshops and discussion groups on housing employment and education should be sponsored there should be a concerted effort through committee work and clubs to combat a feeling of helplessness futility and resignation that pervades the negro slum and ghetto communities especially in the nations big cities efforts must also be made to build a spirit of pride and high personal standards of honesty integrity and responsibility in view of the fact that voting apathy exists to great extents in negro communities a feature would be to build up in the masses the incentive to vote voterregistration drives would not be the answer the negro masses must be imbued with the knowledge that voting is not only a part of their civic responsibility but it is for their own selfinterest as well the alliance should sponsor a cooperative child care center staffed by volunteers the services of many ablebodied women whose only reason for not working is caring for one or more minor children should be utilized as there are many homes in the negro community where boys in particular who need a father are growing up without one the alliance could sponsor a big brother guidance program in which men of good community standing would take the responsibility of guiding a boy that is offer him an adult male to learn from the negros social problems are mostly lack of adjustment to city lifethe demands of a cold impersonal environment according to the census per cent of the negro population live in cities ninety per cent of the nearly million negroes living outside the south live in cities especially in the big industrial cities of the north and west an important function of the alliance would be to help them alleviate the conditions of a harsh environmentrestore their selfrespect and confidenceby helping families as well as individuals to become oriented and assimilated into the community for example the writer has personal knowledge of a family of eight who moved to a neighboring city from the rural south last year this man and wife whom i shall call james and mary smith not only found some of the problems they had hoped to leave behind but new and more complex ones for three months they were obligated to live with relatives in an already overcrowded tenement apartment at the end of that period james smith who has only a fourth grade education found work as a laborer with a construction company he immediately moved into a fourroom substandard apartment of his own in the same slum area the four school age childrenjames jr sarah frances and annie attended the overcrowded ghetto schools after two months james sr was laid off from work the family is now on welfare aid a community alliance organization could bring this family into its selfhelp program by getting the father to take its basic training it would prepare him for a jobtraining program which would enhance his chances to get skilled or semiskilled employment in the meantime the alliance could also assist him in finding a job which he could perform thereby getting the family off relief it could give the family assistance in getting more adequate housing the wife mary through the homemaking classes of the alliance would be helped to become a better and more economic manager of her household as she has finished elementary school she could give assistance at the childcare center there she would be taught how to handle groups of children and how the program is maintained in this family which serves here as a demonstration of many the local alliance could give yearold james jr the additional counselling which he so badly needs he has been sent home twice from school for misbehavior and is becoming a problem both to his school and family he could through the alliance be found an afterschool job which would assure him that he is a needed and useful person the lack of such assurance is the cause of much of the delinquency among negro youth he could be brought into the recreation program of the alliance through membership in a youth club of his age group and the alliance could provide sponsors to get the three schoolage girls into youth clubs this family has not joined any church an alliance sponsoring them would provide a welcome for them into a church of their choice if the family has no choice the family sponsor could introduce them to representative members of community churches in this manner they could be helped to become a churchgoing family with new ideals and aspirations it could through the family sponsor get the father and mother each to join an alliance committee and to participate in other community activities in this manner all families such as this one in need of assistance would be helped to solve their problems there are to be sure some very successful programs being conducted in a number of cities for underprivileged youth the majority of whom are negroes these programsnew yorks new horizon the phoenix arizona career clubs the banker district in st louis the hunters point training project in san francisco and those in some other citiesaffect only a minute fraction of negroes who are in dire need of special help they do not even touch the lives of hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged and restless negroes trapped in the slums of u s cities automation is upon us negroes who are below average in education and training are going to find it increasingly harder to meet the requirements of tomorrows job market there must be a massive allout effort made to prepare these underprivileged masses to take advantage of present and future opportunities the proposed negro alliance for progress would not be a duplication of government programs designed to assist negroes most negroes must get training of one kind or other before they can take advantage of the manpower training program the alliance could conceivably come under the national service program called for by the president and now before congress in any event besides providing an opportunity for the masses to prepare to enter the mainstream of society the alliances committees could gather valuable data for federal state and local governments the information could then be used to determine what kind of aid should be provided to maintain an effective program while a negro alliance for progress to be persuasive should be in the main selfhelp community programs with federal help and direction there are many ways in which state and local governments can assist they can provide facilities subsidies vocational training and help with juvenile delinquency programs to mention a few to operate the proposed alliance will entail cost but it will be a paying proposition which would more than compensate for expenditures made in reduction of welfare checks unemployment compensation and juvenile delinquency moreover preparing negroes to take their places along beside other americans in the producers and consumers market would expedite a change for the betterall along the linenot only in the cities but in the whole nation in all probability there will be opposition in some quarters to any such program as the alliance calls for it will no doubt be attacked as a proposition to give negroes special treatment if this is the connotation negroes have been getting special secondclass treatment for years to the tune of billions and to the detriment of the nation and all concerned the cost to help the negro bridge the gap between his subculture and the main american culture will be a small fraction of what it is costing to keep him in his secondclass status negro leaders should however ponder the statements made by professor james q wilson of harvard in his book negro politics negroes he says are the object rather than the subject of civic action things are often done for about or to or because of negroes but they are less frequently done by them there is a paucity of leadership among the cultured and materially privileged negroes some even disdain the masses with the apparent attitude of why should i worry i have it made these privileged people should be reminded the more privilege one has the greater his responsibility and the spirit of the time and the revolution is group elevation not individual advancement if the negro would be free he must invest in his own future negro leaders must devote more time and attention in reaching the hearts and minds of the masses and the local communities are the places to begin by addressing themselves to this aspect of the problem leaders will be giving impetus to its resolution the achievement of which history may well record as the greatest social accomplishment in this century although it is the negro leaders imperative duty to take the initiative through community programs to prepare the masses for assimilation into the nations social fabric it is not their duty alone white community leaders must also assume their responsibility and cooperate to resolve the problem for it is not just the attitude in the negro community that must be changed the attitude of the whole community must be changed this is societys problem a united community is the need it is the duty of all white community leaders to work to change the attitude of their own raceconvince them that social political and economic equality are the rights of all americans that the resolution of the problem means complete equality finally the hour has arrived for all americans to make a judgment not only is the negro cause an understandably just one american democracy is on trial before the world and the wave of the future is freedom for our own security and that of the free world the problem of equal status for the negro must be solved we dare not do less portrait of a child first saw letty when irr i observed some classi es for blind children in the public schools as a college assignment letty was a blind negro child of a twin and the twin brother was blind too letty was large for her age and appeared to be a teenager there was no father in the home and the family was on relief letty had just resumed talking after two years of silence by being blind she had been able to start school at years of age but she had stopped talking when she was she continued to attend school during her silent two years following directions and doing the assigned school work but would not answer questions or talk to anyone at home or at school neither the school psychologist nor a private one were ever able to determine why she stopped talking and just as suddenly resumed talking again before letty stopped talking the mother sent her to school neatly dressed but after the speechless period no one in the home evidenced any concern with her appearancethe most rudimental phases of grooming being neglected when she again talked the speech was different too it was so guttural and southern or dialect that it sounded stereotypic during recess some of the sighted children liked to surround letty and get her to talk as they found it game and funny she enjoyed being the center of attention and declaring to her young audience that she wanted to be a preacher she would praise god and quote the scriptures at length if a teacher was near such actions were at once interrupted and the child was encouraged to just walk around the school yard if she didnt want to play the first saturday that i did volunteer work at the recreation center there were handicapped children busily and noisily taking part in a variety of supervised games and activities i was surprised to see letty and her twin brother as they were the only negro children in the group together with other volunteers and a staff person i was assigned to accompany a group of youngsters to the childrens playground in golden gate park we were to be the guests at a picnic lunch there as we were the largest group taking an outside trip this saturday we were able to use the volkswagen bus for transportation in our party were two children confined to their wheel chairs and blind children including letty on arrival at the park we found ourselves the project and guests of a rainbow girls chapter they and two of their mothers were holding tables for us in the picnic grounds near the merrygoround the drab wooden tables had been made festive with colorful paper tablecloths napkins and paper decorated with a circus motif there was even a large sheet cake topped with a candy merrygoround in the center there seemed to be an unlimited supply of sugar cookies all kinds of decorated cup cakes iced soft drinks and a huge container of frosty punch the children had brought lunch bags from home and upon being seated letty hunched over the table and tore open her lunch bag with her face buried in the folds of the bag she wolfed down the meagre unbuttered meat sandwich a wizened green apple and an unwrapped candy bar when she finished before many had barely started she wiped her nose and mouth with her coat sleeve when a napkin was again placed in her hand it was used vigorously as a handkerchief and dropped on the lawn in the small silence that followed a rainbow girl set a plate of cookies in front of her and placed a cup of punch in her hand the cookies being greedily and hastily eaten were replaced with others the staff person having postponed her lunch to help with the needs of the children stood up and announced loudly the rainbow girls are treating us all to rides on the merrygoround i have tickets for everyone lets you and i go first letty nah letty answered ah just want to stay here and have a conversation and eat was implied as she was hungrily and thirstily gulping a bottle of pop the staff person then asked me to take two of the blind boys over to the slides that is their favorite spot and they can almost be on their own there just watch that they wait their turn in line they are so eager they sometimes push ahead of other children and fights start they dont want the other children to know they are blind and resent overt help before she finished talking the two were off tuning and found the slides with no guidance from me when my small charges and i came back from innumerable rides on the merrygoround as well as the slides it was time to clean up and leave letty appeared not to have moved all afternoon and was still wearing her heavy coat she was eating a large slice of the sheet cake the rainbow mothers had already packed up their picnic things and were sitting on either side of letty quietly listening and talking with her and occasionally patting her on the shoulder as if in encouragement of her talking as the rest of the children and volunteers gathered there was a final cup of punch for everyone it took us a halfhour to get startedsome final rides on the merrygoround to use up all the tickets trips to the rest rooms folding and rearranging the wheelchairs so no one was too uncomfortable and then finding an empty lap for a small pair of crutches while one of the volunteers held the child when we reached the center the children tumbled out of the volks wagen and those who could hurried into the building as if following some previously outlined plans as we tied the straps of the wheelchair bound children above the hubbub i heard lettys deep voice demanding where is mah record and mah chair i told ya not to move them as the children wheeled themselves through the doorway i followed the sound of lettys plaintive wrangling voice i found her in a room that i hadnt entered before it was easily the most spacious and lightfilled room in the building and it had been planned to take advantage of the splendid view of the ocean across the highway the ocean waves were frothing against the beach and it seemed odd to see them so near and not hear the surf as there was even salt spray on the huge picture window that extended the length of the room here is your record on the machine and your chair letty a volunteer stated letty drew her chair up as close as she could to the juke box and the room was suddenly filled to the overwhelming with the sound of ray charles singing you dont know me letty started rhythmically rocking back and forth back and forth in perfect time with the music she was completely relaxed and lost in her thoughts and her face was ecstatic after the record had played over and over her twin tried to push another button on the juke machine but letty vigorously pushed him awaynot once ceasing her continuous rocking movements it seemed by unspoken agreement that the machine was lettys province as none of the other children ventured near it had been a chilly and gray day but now the sun was splintering the heavy purple clouds clustered above the ocean and there would be a warm orange sunset on the horizon i heard my name called as the children were being assigned to cars to take them home some of the parents were arriving to pick up their children and others were being driven home by volunteers just now arriving although we only had three youngsters in our car we were the first scheduled to leave as we had the farthest to go above all the commotion at the crowded exit the clank of braces refolding and storing wheel chairs last minute typed directions being distributed and the childrens now tired and querulous voiceslettys blaring record dominated the air as we drove away i wondered who was calling for her but letty will be alright i thought she possesses the true dignity of childhood she is undefeated the negros stake in africa the american society ra of african culture was j i f founded upon the assumption that there exists a core of common experience a skein of common values and a common identification which unite men of culture of african descent there is no implication in this assumption that there do not exist other areas of experience other sets of values and other feelings of identification which bind the feelings of people who are of african descent to those who like them are also americans to those of similar occupations or similar status or to those who share similar taste in music or literature or even a similar interest in africa indeed i doubt that there is a member of this society who is not also a member of one or more organizations composed of people of varied ancestral origin founders and members of amsac are not believers in the mystique of race or blood nor do they believe in ethnic or racial exclusiveness they simply face the fact that a common fate involving certain historic disabilities has generated certain common problems and common responses to those problems all of which have led to a universe of discourse to use a somewhat sociological phrase popular in the s among peoples of african descent so they have joined together to carry on the dialogue among themselves and others talk always leads to action and that is why we are all here tonight of course not all people of african descent care to face these facts or to give a reaction to these tacts those of us who have wanted to face these facts have attempted through this organization to give institutional expression to what we feel are common values common experiences and a common universe of discourse with those who do not care to face these facts and give them institutional expression we have no quarrel but also for our own action we make no apology in a country where polish people make their identification as polishamericans some jews as jewishamericans and some italians as italianamericans there should be neither surprise nor fear at finding those who make an iden tification as lroamericans there is nothing more american than this pluralistic conception of american identity the only time that anyone really feels that hyphenation is a threat to national unity or national welfare is in time of war and i hope we are not going to have a war with the new emerging africa i shall return to this problem of identification again before i conclude my remarks but at this moment i should like to comment briefly upon the origins of this society because this is one phase of the question of whether panafricanism is a myth or a reality amsac came into being because there was a society of african culture that is there is an american society of african culture because there is a society of african culture without the word american in front the society of african culture came into being in france in but its origins are to be found in a remarkable group of french negro intellectuals which came together in paris after the second world war the core was a group of west africans but from the outset the group included haitians malagasies and other individuals of africa south of the sahara one american negro richard wright was a member of this group among its patrons were some of frances most distinguished social scientists and men of letters whenever two or three intellectuals are gathered together they always think of a magazine or journal this group was no exception and presence ajricaine was born in from the outset the pages of this magazine were open to contributions from men of all races some of its best contributions have come from men like jean paul sartre and andre gide and albert camus who are not men of african descent but whose insights were welcome in the journal by men of culture of african descent this being the rather elegant french phrase used for persons of the rather elegant society men of culture of african descent but also from the outset it was concerned with what aime cesaire and leopold senghor had dubbed negritude that perhaps indefinable and intangible something which the folk as well as the intellectuals in africa and negroes in the west indies were thought to have in common and what was this negritude every time i mention the word negritude i begin to hear duke ellingtons in my solitude in my mind and think that somebody should set to music in my negritude but what is this negritude first a passion for similar types of music dance and graphic and plastic art forms which exist in what i call the panafrican aggregate second a soft and resilient rather than a hard and mechanical approach to life third a deep resentment whether expressed or unexpressed over subordination to white people during the four hundred years of slave trade and the subsequent structuring of caste relations here and in africa this was the reaction which sartre in his essay black orpheus calls antiracist racism and to which cesaire once gave a marxist interpretation antiracist racism was not viewed as an evil thing but as a quest for dignity a yearning for respect and an assertion of worth it was viewed dialectically as having been brought into view by its opposite which is aggressive exploitative racism and the whole concept of negritude assumes in its dialectic that antiracist racism is destined to disappear in some higher synthesis the american term integration sometimes implies this remote future in short negritude was thought of by this group as something to be proud of not something to be ashamed of about five years ago a group of americans of african descent were invited to join in the dialogue to come to paris for confrontation to see if they too had negritude there was never any doubt in the minds of the french intellectuals that the americans had it one african poet senghor had written of the softening effect he thought the negroes had had on new york he thought that harlem had put the hard oil on the mechanical life of new york and all of them had caught the tones in american jazz in countee cullen in langston hughes in alain locke and w e b dubois and in the folk and traditional and artistic productions with which they were acquainted by the time the confrontation was over amsac was born it was not a painless birth the recognition of the reality of the existence of negritude among afroamericans as well as francoafricans did not mean that the two groups saw eye to eye on every issue this is one of the major points that i would like to make the feeling of a common identity does not necessarily mean that those involved always get along or always agree on everything i think that within the framework of this international operation this fact has been rather obvious nobody has tried to conceal it if you will look at the introduction to africa seen by american negroes you will see a note there by the french editor who says that there were some members of the presence africaine group who werent quite in favor of dealing so closely with the american negroes not because they didnt feel an identity but because they felt the americans were agents of imperialism this must have been one of the extreme marxist fringes of sac we have no extreme marxist fringes the society of african culture in paris which had such fringes had to make a decision and as a result the fringe group was slapped down this volume came out and there was a strong statement that we do accept the idea that american negroes as well as haitians west indians and others form a part of this group so although there may be disagreement on details and even on issues in this broad fraternity they are not serious they are disagreements within a framework of agreement the continuing association between amsac and sac is itself a testimony to the reality of the ties however much some people may try to talk those ties away or to brainwash them out of the minds of american negroes some of these people well mention later it is interesting to note that the first institutionalization of ties between the scattered bearers of negritude was at the level of an interest in art literature philosophy and other cultural realms it is perhaps significant that this was where the first cementing of ties was madeon the level of high culturenot on the level of politics or on the level of interpersonal relations i think we ought to bear in mind that relations between africans and afroamericans occur on these three levels political cultural and interpersonal these three ought to be kept separate in our discussions they may not be of equai weignt or value at any given moment while the african intellectuals in the french tradition were empnasizing culture other men of african descent were seeking to find unity around a framework of political action we must first examine this group briefly just as we might call the sac and amsac develop ment cultural panafricanism so might we refer to the other phenomenon as political panafricanism these of course are not watertight compartments but they help us to channel the flow of history for our purpose this evening dr w e b dubois is often referred to as the father of panafricanism and in recent years has received honors in africa as such all of us know of his four attempts to convene effective panafrican conferences between the first world war and the depression his work illustrates my meaning when i say that these are not watertight compartments dubois is most often thought of as having given expression to political panafricanism i attended a dinner given for dr dubois at the academy of learning in ghana a few months ago he was honored as the father of panafricanism i was rather surprised that the chief justice of ghana sir arku korsak in introducing dr dubois said that he was not interested in dr dubois political significance my first awakening to the meaning of africa and to our own potential dignity he said came when i was a student at sierra leone and we all read regularly the column as the crow flies which was published in crisis magazine in the s now nobody on this side thought that the future chief justice of ghana in a small cottage in sierra leone was reading dr dubois column but this was the first thing that he said in his intro duction so here was the cultural side of panafricanism at work not wellknown is the fact that the first conference with the name panafrican was really convened in london in by a west indian lawyer named sylvester williams the tradition has now become set so we come to think of the conference set up by dr dubois as the first one new world negroes took the initiative in trying to mobilize negro intellectuals in the fight against two things colonial oppression in africa and discrimination against negroes and other people of color wherever it existed but they had no mass base and the time was not ripe for effective action these were the pioneers american negro intellectuals on the whole have failed to treat seriously the most powerful segment of the panafrican movement prior to world war ii i refer to marcus garveys universal negro improvement association and the african communities leagues i think any objective person looking at the world of negro intellectuals would ask why the biography about garvey wasnt written by a negro black moses was written by a white man i think the flamboyance of marcus garveys insistence on one god one aim one destiny and that you should have a black god and black angels and a black jesus christall of this has been a rather painful episode in american negro history for negro intellectuals who tend to wince a bit at it and believe that garvey was a bit of a buffoon we may be ashamed of garveys black masses walking down the streets of harlem with their plumes but some of the african leaders are not they tend to link the names of garvey and dubois as parts of the same historic stream one of the most vivid memories i bring home from ghana was the convening of the all african peoples conference in december leaders from all over africa were there and at the last session dr nkrumah began his speech by saying we are so glad to see so many of our friends from the new world here with us i think i am quoting him precisely before we were conscious of our own degradation it was they who raised the banner of african liberation in the new world i want to mention especially marcus garvey and dubois this was before the assembled group of agitators who were going out to liberate africa and the statement was made by nkrumah and he named these two people equally significant i suppose is the fact that the first ghana steamship line was called the black star line garveys ships never got across but ghanas ships do manage to get around i am sure that marcus garvey would be turning over in his grave one of his weaknesses was his antisemitism and the first black star line was a joint operation of the zim navi gation company of israel and ghana but we often forget the weaker side of our panafrican symbols in the same way that this happens in other parts of the world i am watching the process by which the emphasis is being put on dr dubois as father of panafricanism with an attempt to say well we dont buy his devotion for the soviet union and eventually that will be forgotten as a part of the tradition assuming that africa does not fall into that orbit in looking back at these two predepression movements garveys and dubois i think we cannot understand the emergence of either of them unless we face the fact that there was a basis among the masses in america the west indies and africa that made both of them possible there would have been no panafrican movement led by dubois there would have been no marcus garvey movement had there been no apperceptive mass which nourished and sustained them there was an identification with africa as a land of ancestral origins which was already there despite all the stereotypes and distortions and all the existing unpleasant realities of contemporary africa and that apperceptive mass is still there i grew up among rather ordinary and common folk who exalted the glories of ethiopia in the past who talked constantly of egypt as being our country which started civilization and who believed that someday princes would come out of ethiopia and it would stretch forth its hands unto god most american negroes probably grew up putting pennies into the church basket which were supposed to go out to some missionary in africa we dont forget that the early denomination included the african methodist episcopal church and similarly named churches this is evidence of a kind of identification one of the early negro organizations were known as the african society i have a theory that the word african began to drop out after the american colonization society was started in the hope of getting negroes forcibly or persuasively back to africa at this point it was probably safer just to drop the word african and use colored if you talk too much about being an african maybe someone will ask you why you dont go back there the point that i have been trying to make is that there was a time when there was an acceptance of the idea of african origins and at the mass level it persisted through the years nobody has ever dealt adequately with the sentiments in africa with regard to the american negro in doing research on panafricanism last summer i found that when the congress of british west africa was started by the famous casley hayford to unite the colonies of british west africa he mentioned in the inaugural speech that on the other side our people have formed an organization called the unia and they have some ships and will probably be coming over here to the gold coast soon we ought to get prepared for them he said he was for strict constitutional action and he said that they may not know how we run things over here and we have got to teach them how to be constitutional here was a serious acceptance of what was supposedly going on on the other side and of the idea that one ought to get ready to welcome garveys ships which never got there the depression years were years when racial solidarity was either subdued or assimilated in the international communist movement all of us remember the concept of the black belt republic and the expression of negro protest in marxist idiom but we must not forget that this was also a period when the comintern made strenuous efforts to mobilize the black masses in africa and also made its worst blunders during the first four years of the thirties perhaps the most energetic person involved in this attempt to get africans into the communist movement was a man from trinidad who had already joined the movement i refer to george padmore who ran the negro worker and was supposed to be lining up africans for the cause of the soviet union some english friends still think that george padmore was a communist influence on dr nkrumah although padmore broke with the communist movement in this break was a very important one because having broken with the communist movement but also having learned a lot while he was in it padmore and a group of west indians began in london to organize the socalled panafrican federation and between and they kept up much agitation around hyde park in london in about nkrumah arrived in london knowing no one and he met george padmore in nkrumah padmore and others convened the fifth panafrican conference they had dr dubois come over as a symbol of panafricanism the movement was for the first time beginning to receive mass support because these were africans mapping out their own destiny this is considered a turning point in the african liberation movement when decisions had been made at the conference the men decided to return home to their native lands with the idea that the first of them to liberate his own country would call the sixth panafrican conference this was taken as a vow between the men as soon as the conference was ended george padmore went to ghana to serve as the adviser on african affairs others of that conference also went back to ghana because they felt that they should all work from that base in december of it was nkrumah who called the sixth panafrican conference under the title of the all african peoples conference dr dubois was unable to attend but his wife was there to read his speech which advised the nations to look to the east and to reject the west little attention was given to this advice however it was agreed that regardless of his political position dubois was still the symbol of panafricanism all of the nine independent states of africa attended that conference and the nature of that conference has great bearing on our central topic panafricanism myth or reality it is a reality in terms of the limited aims which it set for itself the conference first popularized the term african personality differing from negritude african personality was an interesting concept in the first place padmores definition of what is an african becomes anyone is an african regardless of race creed or color if he acts right that is if he believes in one man one vote and in economic political and social equality one of the other slogans at the conference was the sahara no longer divides us it unites us half of the delegates were not black africans they were from libya tunisia morocco and egypt padmores version of the african personality meant that on the political scene we will stick together on all issues involving africa the african nations have set up at the united nations a working arrangement with a rotating chairmanship and regular caucuses until the time of the congo crisis i dont think there was any crucial issue involving africa over which the group split this was the african personality demonstrated through a show of the political presence of africa i consider this a very important turning point because now there develops a new definition of panafricanismwhat i call residential panafricanism not racial panafricanism this begins to pose problems for those who were panafricans what weight shall you give to the uniting of black people in the west indies africa and america as compared with the uniting of all people on the continent of africa panafricanism now has two sides to it one is that all negroes must stick together the other is that all africans must stick together whether they are negroes or not now i dont think the older people have at all rejected the first aspect one of the most moving scenes that i have ever witnessed was the funeral of george padmore when the funeral oration was delivered by dr nkrumah some of the tribalists in the area said that they didnt want a strangers ashes put in sacred land this made dr nkrumah fighting mad and he said in his oration that this man had to me that indescribable relationship which exists only between brothers from this very spot his ancestors may have been carried off across the ocean while their kinsmen stood by weeping we have brought his ashes home and put them to rest where they belong this was the old panafricanism when there was great emotional stress on west indian african and american negro solidarity but i think that the new concept is becoming the dominant one and as it becomes the dominant one we must reconsider what part the old one will have what is the role of the west indian and american negro auxiliaries if one may call them that in the political phase of the african struggle i would say that until the congo crisis the racial concept of panafricanism had reality as you know with the emergence of the new african states africa has become divided into three really big blocks the casablanca five ghana guinea mali egypt and morocco which consider themselves militant neutralist and which supported lumumba a rather conservative group and a group that floats in between we have to realize in structuring our relationships with africa today that all africans no longer think alike once independence comes there will be ideological groupings and that same complication which attends our relationships in the united nations it seems to me that in our country there is a certain fear about the identification of negroes with africans a fear among both negroes and whites yet this is a time for sober analysis now that this whole matterwhether or not racial panafricanism should still be preservedis open to question the whole problem of how to relate ourselves to the new kind of residential panafricanism is here our task has not been made easier by the publication of a couple of articles which i think have tended to confuse not only american negroes but the general public about this particular problem there is fear in america about negroes intense interest in africa and i think these articles have tended to increase the fear and uncertainty in africa what they call the equivalent of this is the propaganda for balkanization or for dividing and conquering to use a cliche from agitators i might state that do not think it was accidental that these articles appeared at the specific time that they did i refer to the article in the new yorker may by harold isaacs and the one in the reporter june by russell b howe the feeling for a need for such articles was in the air in certain circles there was almost a kind of inevitability about the appearance of these articles if the american journalistscholar and the english journalist had not written them i have no doubt at all that someone else would have written them i speak with such assurance on this particular subject because of a personal experience about a week after the eruption of the american negroes in the united nations during stevensons speech i received a long distance phone call from new york it was from an editor of the reporter who asked since i was just back from africa if i would do an article for the magazine he claimed that there is great concern in many quarters over the way in which american negroes are tending to identify with africans and that an article of some sort should show the american negroes once and for all that these africans dont care anything at all about them and that there is really no kind of tie between them i asked him who had told him to come to me and he mentioned a couple of american negro leaders who had said that things are getting out of hand that some american negro ought to write an article o get this thing straightened out and that the american negros identification is with america and not with africa i begged off on the truthful grounds that i was very busy and that an article of this sort required a kind of study that i did not have the time to give to it i cannot say whether messrs isaacs and howe received similar invitations i will admit however that my paranoiac suspicions were aroused when i read these words in the fourth paragraph in isaacs article the outburst of some negroes in the gallery of the united nations security council in new york during the lumumba demonstration in february at least served to make more people aware that american negroes are experiencing their own kind of confusion over the events in emergent africa it is a peculiar and painful confusion cutting to the core of what negroes think about themselves and about their place in american society and in the world everything is changing in their universe those winds blow not only across africa forcing upon them all kinds of new conceptions and selfconceptions and among these are new ideas and emotions about africa itself the hitherto remote and rejected ancestral homeland the gallery demonstrators were merely an extremist handful but at some point these new stirrings touch all kinds of people in every part of the american negro community as i said my paranoiac suspicions were aroused only one of these articles the new yorker piece merits any serious discussion for it was written by a seriousminded exjournalist now attached to an international relations research program at a large and influential academic research institution he is also a man whose devotion to the cause of social justice and civil_rights is beyond dispute i treat his article seriously as to the other gentleman mr howe i only hope that those in positions of power and influence in america will be as skeptical as i am contemptuous about anything that he has to say on this issue the writer in question is a young man who has traveled widely in america and africa he is witty and to some peoples taste charming but quite unable to evaluate facts and weigh them he was declared persona non grata in ghana for repeatedly publishing unverified news as fact at the all african peoples conference in tunis where he represented the sunday times he published an article stating that mboya had said he would never give an invitation to george padmore to come to a conference because he didnt believe in outside negroes interfering in african affairs i interviewed mr mboya the following summer in kenya and he stated that he had never said anything of the sort whether he did or not i dont know but at least this is the kind of mischiefmaking that makes i think howes articles suspect he then went over to the neighboring state of togoland and became a speech writer for mr olympio because he was feeling vindictive about ghana and if anyone wants to check up on what i call very bad reporting read mr howes book black star rising over africa you will find more errors per page than in any other similar book some of the errors fall on the side of what i call claimtheworld american negro history this is simply an unreliable person but one who can do a great deal of harm isaacs for instance stated in his article that he thought the liberians and dr nkrumah didnt want to accept a negro ambassador howe said that nkrumah told him on independence day that he didnt want a negro ambassador then mr howe goes further and says that it will be doing a disservice to the negro to africa and to the united states to send any negroes to africa it would be a disservice to all three he then suggests that we should be guided by the experience of all the missions in africa which never used negro missionaries supposedly because they knew africans didnt respect negroes and therefore could not be converted by negro missionaries now this is the kind of thing we are confronting today i said that i was going to treat mr isaacs article seriously and i will try to do so within a few minutes this article has not only set off widespread discussion among all american negroes who are intelligently concerned with africa but is also being used i am told by those in washington opposed to having negroes in diplomatic posts it is being used to bolster the argument that negroes are a liability in diplomatic circles i read and reread the article weighing the facts cited and opinions expressed trying to catch the nuances and trying to imagine its impact on various groups of people here in america and in africa my own conclusion about the article is that i dont think that it had the intent that howes did but it probably has had the same effect and i am hoping that the author will do a back to africa part ii and make it very clear that he repudiates russell howes position and that he doesnt like the use to which his article is being put what else would i have to say about the isaacs article one is that i feel that so perceptive an observer and so diligent an interviewer as harold isaacs should not have missed the point in so many places and misunderstood the nuances in so many situations it may have come partly just from his not having stayed around long enough for those interviews in africa if anyone interviewed me in ghana at midday he would get quite a different reaction to africa than he would at in the morning because by midday would be hot and tired therefore it seems to me that this matter needs a much more prolonged and deep analysis than was given to it just one other small matter isaacs said that africans scornfully reject the term negro because they think it represents something lowly or unworthy this supposedly leaves the black brother from america confused and resentful this is just not true the term negro is used by the west african pilot all the time the term is used often there so this kind of statement comes from not being fully acquainted with the scene the other main difficulty in the article is that it overgeneralizes what i miss throughout the article is any sensitivity to the complexity of differentiations within africa itself instead there is a tendency to generalize about how africans feel toward american negroes which africans where in what status positions and having what political orientation these are questions you must ask in dealing with the attitudes of africans toward american negroes in ghana today most negroes tend to lean to the noncommunist socialist left they reject negroes propagandizing for capitalism on the other hand other negroes are roaming around and developing intimate and warm relationships the question turns on which negro is being reacted to and who is doing the reacting thats the greatest weakness in this particular article maybe isaacs can afford to ignore the complexity of this problem in a short article for a presumably sophisticated american audience it really isnt fair to them or to the subjects that the author does not explicitly admit he is oversimplifying for our society to ignore these complexities would be fatal for amsac to ignore them would be to jeopardize the success of all our efforts and leave us as confused as some of the people whom isaacs interviewed in the future course of our individual and collective relations with africa we must be crystalclear about the nature of the reality we confront i think that we need to start with the proposition that the question that matters to amsac is not whether some american girls are having a rough political orientation these are the bands or whether some africans dont like the word negro or whether most american negroes suffer from cultural shock after being in africa for a few weeks or even whether a wellknown negro social scientist was invited to the homes of his african colleagues nor should we be particularly concerned about whether anyone in africa appreciates our efforts the question that really matters to amsac is first a power question do the leaders of the newly independent african states those in power at the moment wish to sustain friendly relationships with amsac if they do ultimately the educational forces which flow from these relationships will reeducate a population and reduce some of the attitudes referred to above i think that the answer to this question is that some of these leaders do some of them dont and some dont know anything about amsac but this nevertheless is a crucial question the next crucial question i think is what do we want to do in africa regardless of how visitors get along at the personal level therefore i go back to the three levels there are political problems but political panafricanism is not amsacs problem at the other end i dont think the question of interpersonal relationships is primarily our problem our problem is at the level of cultural relationships this is a matter of relationships between groups and groups and this gives us our broadest approach to africa cultural panafricanism is not a myth it is a reality nobody denies the cultural ties and everyone is interested in implementing exchanges of artists and books etc therefore our problem is relatively easy the problems of individuals who go out to africa are not easy in this respect there is a certain amount of truth in isaacs observations but the point is missed that these personal problems are not the crucial matters in africanamerican relationships i could recount the same kind of problems faced by africans educated in england who went home and had the task of keeping first second and third cousins from moving in on them these are individual problems and each individual is going to have to fight them out himself before us there are some signposts and to my mind they are these first the oldtime sentimental panafricanism is a feeble and slender reed on which to lean all other things being equal color helps but the other factors must be equal i dont think my students in africa could have cared less about my color they were only concerned with the university of londons exam if a white or green person could have helped to get them ready to make an upper first they would have wanted him if a negro couldnt help them to get ready to make an upper first they wouldnt want him but vhere other things are equal on a personal level i think the feeling would be in favor of having a negro around in my case the institution had been there for twelve years they didnt have an african head of department and i was the only colored head of department so i was showing the flag whether anyone liked me or not was irrelevant i was the one splash of color my students might have hated me on a personal level but until they get a good man ready to take that post they would rather see in it a west indian or american negro this may be a part of our fate a part of what we are supposed to do to accept the lack of the warm interpersonal relations and still do the job which africans need done at this particular moment i should like to conclude my remarks by reverting to that illusive and tantalizing subject of our quest for identity in africa today this takes form in the shift from tribal to national solidarity and in the quest for identity as an african we in the united states arent the only people who have a problem of finding an identity and if anyone thinks that panafricanism is a myth look how the votes run on boycotting south africa africans may disagree on everything else but when it gets down to the crucial tests the votes go twentyfive solid so when you ask whether panafricanism is a myth or reality find out in respect to what issues the american negro has a problem of reconciling his citizenship status and cultural heritage with the fact of being a negro this does not merely mean being black because being a negro doesnt have much reference to skin color in the united states the new african definition of panafricanism which includes white africans from tunis is like the virginia definition of a negro anybody with an ascertainable trace of negro blood so you now have white africans in africa and white negroes in the united states again this is not just a matter of color i feel that panafrican identification lends powerful support to successful individual and collective adjustment of american negroes do not consider it escapism to make this identification i say this because i do not share the optimism of those who feel that the trend toward integration will mean the disappearance of negroes as a group in the us or the distintegration of negro institutional life even if this were desirable for all there are going to be black people designated as negroes in the us for a long long time to come along with brown and fair people with enough telltale traits to mark them as being of partial african descent and by law and custom here in america partial means whole marry a person from the white community and as soon as the baby comes along that baby is over in the negro community so for those who intermarry their children are going to be colored children negro afroamerican and not white africans and other negroes who come here from abroad are going to have to share our fate to a great extent they may get special dinners such as the ambassador of sierra leone got the other day but for a long time to come not only are we going to be identified as negroes but africans are going to be sharing a common fate with us while theyre here what we are heading for in america i think is a social structure like hawaiis and not like brazils i am always interested in how we hold up hawaii as a great example of good race relations in hawaii ethnic groups have not disappeared there are many ethnic groups but nobody is ashamed of being in one people are tolerant of each other and if you intermarry you pick which side youre going to be on this is quite different from the brazilian situation where there is some emphasis toward the attainment of one big brazilian race and particularly toward the eradication of all evidences of african culture thats a part of what integration means in brazil eradicate the blacks oy marrying with them get rid of the color then quickly get them educated and get rid of this african survival system i dont regard brazil as any paradise for one who has respect for his africanism now we can either accept such a prospect or we can deplore it try to evade it or if we are light enough try to pass out of it since most negroes arent light enough to do that as are some who prefer to identify with the whole i am for accepting our negritude for trying to inject new meanings into the word negro and for discovering new appreciations for aspects of african culture i am in favor of all of us africans west indians american negroes and our white allies fighting together on all fronts the political front the cultural front and even fighting the battle of the interpersonal relationships this gives us the satisfaction of knowing that we are not fighting alone if we take this position i think we will build strong personalities we shall produce individuals who have the aspirations of the poet claude mckay a west indian who lived and wrote in new york one of his poems that i like very much reflects this attitude of accepting our negritude of becoming a part of the great panafrican fight by anita r cornwell the afternoon was about v r i gone and amanda i stonecutter wondered she could finish iron mg her last bundle before it was time to start supper it was friday and she liked to finish up before suppertime so she would have the week end to do her own chores then a sudden noise from the back porch pulled her head up and she saw her husband rushing through the door waving the evening paper you see here manda them fool kids done gone and got throwed outta school he shouted we told hal not to hang round them troublemaking demonstrators yet there he was leading the pack for a moment she stared at him then slowly cut her iron off and came to gaze at the newspaper spread on the kitchen table i heard the news on the radio she said finally they didnt give names but deep in my heart i guess i knew hal would be in it some where she sighed sitting down her legs suddenly too weary to hold her up he was one of the main ones its right here in the paper jim declared pounding the paper vigorously mr allen showed it t me and he said hal ought not to come back as haycroft aint gonna stand for that mess amandas face turned a dull gray as the blood drained from it they never did like hal them white folks here didnt theyll be laying for him now thats for sure she said in a flat lifeless tone which seemed to deepen the look of sadness in her eyes then anxiety and an overpowering sense of utter helplessness propelled her to her feet hugging her folded arms tight against her narrow palpitating chest she wandered up into the living room and stood at the window halfexpecting to find a mob already gathered in the front yard jim what are we going to do she asked suddenly turning to face her husband who had followed her into the crowded boxlike room hes nearing twenty they wont let him get away with the things he did when he was growing up dont upset yourself manda he began and she knew by the set of his mouth that he had news of some kind that he hadnt told before mr allen lent me money and i telegramed it to hal i told him to go on up to new york to be with his sister helen till this thing blows over youyou think hell do that she asked hopefully jim nodded his small round head bobbing like a top hell listen hes older now manda he knows people here dont want things all stirred up his wishful thinking and the placid look on his childlike face were almost too much for her to endure and the feeble ray of hope struggling in her bosom quietly expired as the scattered veins of fear darting through her body converged into the hard lump which settled in her chest she leaned one bony elbow against the peeling window frame and wondered in silent desperation what would happen to the other children if their eldest son came back and started offending the white people who nowadays seemed more easily provoked than ever finally shaking her head as if to clear away some dense fog she turned from the window to see that jim was already comfortably stretched out on the couch i guess id better go start supper before the children come she said trying without success to suppress another weary sigh out in the kitchen she lifted the halfironed shirt from the board with tired workknotted fingers and for a moment she stared at it with blurred eyes a white shirt a white mans shirt in the eyes of her country she was only a black woman who took in washing she was not supposed to have problems or feelings to care about those problems she was expected to be a workhorse not a mother who loved her children who worried about their wellbeing then relaxing her fingers the shirt dropped into the basket and she took the board down she would have to finish the bundle after supper now and jim could take it by mrs baines on his way to work tomorrow morning then yawning and stretching jim entered the kitchen i reckon id better set this out he said lifting the wicker clothes basket and taking it out to the back porch she watched him moving stiffly like a tired old man and marvelled at the swift cruel passing of time the children had always kept her so busy she had never had time to wonder whether the years were good or bad even when hal was about ten and started his fighting campaign to reform the world her hands were plenty full for the twins mike and ike were only five and annie ruth just a baby then at long last with the help of the good lord and rev mills the kindly old minister who had baptized all the children and mr waterman the principal who had once taught jim hal finished high with honors and a scholarship and she had thought the problem solved for good when he went off to florida to am i but now here he was expelled in his senior year and only god in his heaven knew what was coming next what came next the following day in fact was hal himself just as they were sitting down for the noonday meal he strolled into the kitchen plunking his suitcases down onto the freshly scrubbed floor saddened but not surprised amanda quickly looked at jim who for the moment was ashy white and quite speechless but not the children they whooped for joy and rushed to embrace him their conquering hero home in person you got th wire jim finally asked sure pop i got it hal grinned tossing his cap onto one of the suitcases but i figured what the hell harlem can wait ill liberate mississippi first the children whooped again and amanda felt rather than saw jim sag in his chair then hal came over and bent down to kiss her youre looking great mom he said but his eyes wondered if she understood why he had acted contrary to his fathers command and to her utter despair she knew her own eyes assured him that she did understand but oh how her heart ached for him food was forgotten as the twins told hal about the special assembly yesterday when mr lacker their new principal warned them not to start that sitin bit in haycroft if they wanted to stay at good old booker t high the handsome mobile face quivered with emotion as he began pacing the floor yeah i am very well acquainted with the educated uncle tommies he declared wait go slow it takes time they cry joining hands with their great white brethren to quote from that venerable script someone wrote coming back from lincolns funeral well im here to tell you that crap is from squaresville theyve got to get some new material sure a lot of us got thumped on our behinds and kicked out of school too but we have started something and they aint seen nothing yet just wait till we hit that second thrust theyre going to realize were shooting for the moon not just for the front of the bus jim stared in speechless fascination and the twins whistled and banged the table with fists and silverware annie ruth ran to hal and hugged him again and again while amanda holding her throbbing head tight in her hands frantically prayed dear god please send him north or shut him up before its too late news of hals homecoming spread around town like an epidemic and a few of the more curious souls came to see with their own eyes first on the scene was one of amandas insurance men harry bicker who ordinarily collected on tuesday jim had gone back to work and the rest of them were still in the kitchen listening to hal tell about the sitins in florida when harry bicker came back and right off hal wanted to know what was wrong with the doorbell but amanda hushed him up and took harry bicker up front but hal followed them staring at the white man while he collected his money and marked up the book then after his hasty rather nervous departure hal turned on his mother why dont you pay those vultures by mail every week here they come a pack of whiteshirted hyprocrites it would kill one of them to sit next to you at the drug store counter yet theyre living off us just as sure as buzzards picking a dead mans guts then amanda as impetuous as he in many respects got angry too whyd you come back if you hate it so much here you know what its like why you think you can change em annie ruth followed by the twins came in then and hal flopped down into a chair his mouth clamped shut and amanda tightlipped and boneweary put the insurance book back on top of the mantel and was heading back to the kitchen when the horn started blasting out front she froze and for a moment dead silence prevailed as they stared at one another knowing that none of their colored friends had cars and if they did they wouldnt blow quite like that but annie ruth the youngest and therefore the least frightened jumped up and ran to the window mama its mis baines she said turning to face them you want me to run out and tell her daddy took her clothes this morning ike the taller twin looked at his mother why cant she come in here if she wants to see somebody mike snorted shes scared a little color might rub off on her and shell lose ninetenths of her privileges man shut up amanda snapped but the little tableau was not lost on her she realized the twins were only trying to impress hal but she also knew they were apt to keep trying as long as he remained home somehow she had to get him out of town and suddenly the thought came to her that perhaps god had sent lucy baines to help her standing beside the new blue convertible amanda glanced at mrs baines somewhere between her thin upturned nose and her long ducklike neckline and wondered how it felt to be white and therefore right envy was not in her heart but the rank taste of fear fouled her mouth by now she was most adept at ignoring the fear for it usually erupted when a white face ventured too close vaguely she knew it sprang from a rockbed of hate and she resented the hate even more than she did the fear god didnt put man here to hate she thought despairingly but what were you to do when people pushed you to the ground and kept you there till you were dead and buried then her eyes strayed into the pale blue eyes of lucy baines and she saw fear there too it was only a flash but amanda caught a glimpse of it and she knew she couldnt ask mrs baines to help with hal for if lucy baines was scared then she hated too finally amanda realized mrs baines was saying something about odd jobs for hal to keep him out of further trouble and she nodded her head grinning the foolish grin that was expected of her she promised to talk to hal about the work but he probably would be going away soon helendid mrs baines remember helen who useta help her out after schoolwell helen was looking for hal to come up to new york to visit with her any day now back in the house amanda motioned for hal to follow her out to the kitchen where she told him what mrs baines had said and what she had said to mrs baines but hal would not be compromised mama he began patiently i know they dont like me here because i dont grin like an ape when they come sneaking around well im not an ape and im not going to act like one hal amanda interrupted sharply how can you have so much education and yet be so dumb you cant fight a whole town and neither can you change it by agitation theyll just be waiting for you to start something now why your head so hard boy he backed away from her as though she had struck him throwing his hands toward the ceiling all right so im an agitator so i want to look up at the sun and go where every man but one with a black face can go in his own country is that so wrong look at that barry roth who came here from germany years ago he practically owns the town now a jewhating nazi can have the country but i have to stand up to eat a lousy hamburger at the bus terminal you think thats something to grin about you think i ought to run up to new york and rot in harlem and call myself a man is that what you want amanda clutched at his swinging arms you are wrong to stay here and get yourself killed she cried what good would it do answer me what good would it do hal but he would not answer her perhaps he could not he was flesh of her flesh blood of her blood but not of her generation and through her tears she watched as he finally left the kitchen and retired to his old room upstairs at the back of the house where he stayed for the rest of the day banging away on the portable typewriter helen had given him when he finished high several times she had a notion to go back there to try talking with him again but since she had no real plan formulated yet she decided to wait until she had one at church next morning amanda found it virtually impossible to concentrate on the sermon more than once she caught herself up sharply as rev thornton pounded the lectern bringing enthusiastic amens from the congregation the children sitting in the pew ahead of them were somewhat more fidgety than usual but jim sat quietly beside her moving not an eyelash then her restless eyes fastened on the tall lanky man pacing the pulpit he was young not much older than hal and amanda realized now that she had never really felt comfortable in his presence he reminded her of mr lacker the new principal in manner more than looks the town had certainly changed she thought ruefully the old faces gone replaced by bright eager young men in dark gray suits and buttondown collars they always had the right word at the right time but somehow she felt they were lacking in many of the old virtues rev mills or mr watermaker would have taken hal aside and maybe talked some sense into his head but these new people were different they were probably afraid of a boy who talked too much they seemed more interested in hanging onto a job than going out of their way to risk hanging from a tall strong oak and who was she to condemn them leaving the tiny red brick church smiling and nodding at friends evading their questions concerning hal as best she could amanda walked along beside her silent husband more heavy of heart now than when she left the house but she attributed this more to the restless wanderings of her mind than to any defects of the service then when they reached home and she saw the sheriffs car parked out front she thought already god is punishing me for not listening to his word in church sheriff osborne and his deputy young timmy updyke who had once received two black eyes from hal for calling him a nigger got out of the black mudstained vehicle as they came up amanda looked at jim and saw his face turn whiter than either of the two other men then seeing him scared like that her own fear left her and she reached out to take his trembling hand in hers timmy said nothing in fact he barely looked at them but amanda felt the antipathy in him and the way he fingered his night stick in a sort of unconscious caress while his dull gray eyes stared out into some eternal void chilled her to the bone she knew that if they didnt soon get hal out of haycroft timmy updyke would see that they carried him feet first to the graveyard reluctantly amandas eyes moved on to the sheriff who was now saying what he had come to say in plain good old mississippi english and even before he had finished jim was vigorously nodding his head and promising up and down that hal wasnt thinking o starting no trouble heah in haycroft no sir not hal the sight of jim grinning and bowing tore amandas heart and she could have vept knowing that somewhere in the house hal watched wretched with indignation but god must have heard her plea for he did not come out to intervene they waited until the car disappeared around the corner in a faint cloud of dust then went into the house to find hal sitting in the living room staring at his feet propped up on the piano stool he nodded to them but made no mentioned of the sheriffs visit and somehow his silence was more disturbing to amanda than any of his long speeches had ever been and while she and jim changed their clothes upstairs her searching mind finally landed on the same old question should they all move north the subject was first discussed when helen was bom and they had rejected the idea agreeing that the north was too crowded with people and covered with cement everywhere and no place for children to grow up in as the tall buildings blotted out every last drop of gods good sunshine later however she came to realize that most important of all a child needed a good emotional climate but jim was rooted now and too removed from reality to think clearly about troublesome situations nevertheless she did voice the question once again jim was about ready to go downstairs but he stopped near the door and surprised her by not flying off the handle what would happen to us up there manda he asked his eyes squinting in the little face which had screwed up like that of a worried child then he answered his own question relief probably im near fifty with not much education he came back and sat on the bed his small yet powerful workstained mechanics hands spread upon his thighs i reckon relief aint no worse than this though all these years hearing hal shoot off at the mouth i wouldnt listen cause i knowed he was right i wanted to be a man too when i was his age i didnt like looking at the ground and grinning like a fool every time mr charley walks by they do something to your insides here and when you gets to be as old as me its like walking round dead it was such a rare thing him unburdening himself like that until amanda in the midst of rebraiding her hair hardly knew what to do then she let the long braid fall and moved forward her eyes seeing what they had not noticed in many a long year a man a human being with hopes and fears yet a longing to live in his own way and for the moment hal was forgotten as she reached out her arms to her husband by eleven oclock monday morning amandas first wash hung on the line swinging under the hard october sun which climbed toward high noon and she decided to take a break and look in on hal an idea had popped into her head earlier that morning and the more she thought on it the better it seemed to her they had a cousin in atlanta and if she could persuade hal to go there he might keep out of trouble and also finish his schooling it was risky for they were sittingin there too but anything was better than having him stay in hay croft she dried her hands on her apron as she trotted up the back steps her mind suddenly urging her feet to move faster if hal were around tomorrow when all those insurance men came anything might happen he never had liked them or they him at the foot of the stairs in the living room she rested one hand lightly on the newel post and called up to him uneasy when he did not immediately respond she walked part way up the steps and saw his door standing wide open fear clogged her breath and she dashed up the remaining steps so fast her slippers nearly threw her on the foot of his bed she saw a worn pocketsize new testament and in the center was a stack of neatly typed papers edging over almost furtively she bent down to read the top sheet and now i sit me down a novel by harold lawson stonecutter so thats what hes been typing she thought in some confusion but about what she wondered slowly picking up another page which she started to read this is the day tom thought as he stood at the window idly exam ining the withered branches of the dying peach tree while another part of his mind remembered how it had been back at collegetown you were scared to death sitting there with the snarling mob at your back every hair stood out on your neck and you prayed like crazy asking god to give you courage enough not to swing at one of them then peace came as renewed strength flowed through your trembling body and you knew god was with you in the mirror you saw the contorted faces filled with ignorance and you knew they were the lost souls then you prayed again asking god to show them the way he turned from the window a slight smile on his face as he knelt by his bed then finally he got up got his cap and left the room this was the day suddenly amanda gasped holding her throat as if about to strangle hal she cried softly oh hal how could you blindly she fled from the room down the steps and out into the bright sunlit day yet she knew it was too late even as she prayed with every breath in her body even as she heard the screeching sirens in the distance she knew it but she kept on running and calling his name the role of the negro writer in an era of struggle itre most successful pot lemicist of this it eration is a boysized genbugeyed negro named james baldwin ivory towerist vs activist the role of the negro writer in an era of struggle by hoyt w fuller who despite it all wants desperately to be known as a good novelist in a decade he has produced three novels and while the most v i f elill vvvvavxy james baldwin invests energies in seeking truth in work and life recent one another country was a bestseller none of them has received the sort of critical praise the author would like for his fiction on the other hand mr baldwin has published three collections of essays gained for him the wildest critical acclaim ever accorded a negro writer in this country two of these volumes nobody knows my name and the fire next time also have been bestsellers and the third which in fact was his first published work of nonfiction notes of a native son has been rushed into print again to capitalize on the authors sensational popularity mr baldwin is quite pleased with the reception of his books of course both because it means the reading public is receiving his message and because it means financial independence for him but he will readily admit that his personal ambition remains to be fulfilled he wants to write novels which will draw from nonaxegrinding critics the lavish kudos his nonfiction already has earned following publication of another country in mr baldwin undertook a series of lectures and public appearances which took him to major literary centers across the country his face and his statements became familiar in newspapers magazines and journals then in november the new yorker magazine published a long rambling extraordinarily searching essay by mr baldwin which literallyas well as literarilyshook up the american reading public that essay of course is the meat of the book the fire next time which was rushed into printa few weeks following the appearance of the magazine suddenly organizations and literary and socialconscious groups all over the country were clamoring for the writers attention every newspaper and periodical of any significance whatever published news or reviews about him and his books and time magazine put him on its cover the television networks brought him before their cameras and it became a common sight to see the small intensely alert figure with the great eloquent eyes solemnly setting forth his con cept of the american failure and the american future on the nations tv screens he was interviewed and taped and even recordings of him talking and reading became bestsellers core beckoned and he went launching forth on a physically exhausting national tour to deliver his message in person while bringing in badly needed funds for the vital work core is performing and finally the u s attorney general called and then came calling and in a remarkable session which may have no parallel in history the negro writer who five years earlier was unknown to all but a few discerning readers was telling the man who then sat on the right hand side of the president of the united states that negro americans have reached the end of their endurance and that hereafter they would be in no mood to accept anything short of their full rights as citizens of this country that done the little black writer hied himself off to puerto rico and again took up his typewriter to finish his play blues for mr charlie he was he explained a writer really not a politician and it is a writers duty to write nevertheless in taking valuable time away from his work to become a civil_rights activist mr baldwin demonstrated most dramatically whatfor him at any rateis the black writers role in this era of struggle it is a role which many great writers of the past have played one such was voltaire the th century french dramatist and philosopher whose attacks on religious fanaticism and political injustice twice landed him in the bastille drove him into exile and it has been said helped to bring about the french revolution another was thomas paine the american patriot whose pamphlets fired his countrymen to action in our own revolution this is a role then which involves commitment of the writer to the noblest of human values which demands of the writer as artist that he dedicate his skills to the proposition every man has the right to be free in pursuing such a role the writer serves as disturber of that spurious peace which is arrived at through the degradation of some men he seeks to move the uncommitted to positive action on the side of freedom and he exhorts those who are numbed by oppression or blinded by bigotry to turn their eyes and their energies toward that which is true and just and which is both balm and sustenance for the human spirit it would seem that the black writer himself a member of a group struggling to rise from the morass of degradation and apathy and neardespair would find such a role tailored to his peculiar specifications naturally however there are those who hold different views of the black writers role in thisor anyera of struggle particularly if that struggle is racial in the chorus of general praise which has greeted the articles and declarations by james baldwin for instance there have risen strident and discordant voices lashing out at mr baldwin in what masqueraded as a review of richard wrights posthumous novel lawd today exlife magazine correspondent arthur shay branded the writer an oedipal wreck and cried has nothing changed in the quarter century separating wright and baldwin doesnt the american dream now include some negroes in an attack on the two negro writers which bordered on hysteria the critic expressed dubious sympathy for his black compatriots the american negro has had an extraordinary run of bad luck in his literary spokesmen mr shay wrote supremely ignorant of the fact that he spoke only for white people they go mute with rage expatriating themselves from the theatre of their anguish as richard wright did they retire to some dark olympus of the spirit as james baldwin is doing and issue warnings like mail order seers mr shay conveniently forgot that richard wright was in rather distinguished company in expatriating himself great and sensitive souls have been fleeing the american nightmare for generations and they have included henry james ezra pound t s eliot gertrude stein and ernest hemingway to name a few and even so narrowvisioned an observer as mr shay ought to be able to discern by now that james baldwins warnings may have come just in time to deflect a national cataclysm partly because of them persons in authority from the white house down to community churches have been making an extra effort to put our national house in order mr baldwin never said the fire was inevitable what critics like mr shay really find so hard to bearapart from the indignity of having to listen to negroes making demands rather than pleading for mercyis the refusal of negro writers to accept the crumbs of tokenism for the whole loaf of freedom doesnt the american dream now include some negroes he asks and the inference is of course that negro writers ought to be celebrating the advances that have been made rather than endlessly complaining about remaining injustices there are after all marian anderson and ralph bunche these critics consider writers like james baldwin as dangerous as well they should although they rarely have the candor to state just what the writers are endangering after taking a series of editorial potshots at mr baldwin in his chicago tribune magazine of books column world almanac editor harry hansen admitted his irritation at the negro writer although his reasons for discomfort were singularly unconvincing mr baldwins way of talking is doing the negro writer some harm he put it displaying a sudden and touching concern for the welfare of negro writers it remained for national review editor william buckley the darling of the rightwing to state as only the rapiertongued mr buckley can state what was on all these critics minds baldwin is an eloquent menace mr buckley wrote in his syndicated column going on to equate mr baldwins indictment of white american society with adolf hitlers indictment of the weimar republic and karl marxs indictment of capitalism we need to improve mr buckley conceded speaking for the white race simultaneously we need to reorder more generously our relationship with the negro race and to reject out of hand the preposterous and suicidal counsels of the negroes most inflamed spokesman it may not be too much to assume that mr baldwin had he read mr buckleys assessment of him would have been highly complimented no selfrespecting black man could desire the approval of a man who would express even his guilt in such racially patronizing terms and that ultimately states the problem and defines the protagonists the problem concerns human freedom and dignity and those who believe in it have joined battle with those who do not it may be that some black writers being only human and therefore frail can stand aside and pursue only their muse but in this era of struggle as in all the others which have preceded it such men are not easy to imagine by conrad kent rivers the valley of death is t ll v spread before us but i we swallow our bitter ss sb dosage of lift and move ignorantly toward the hereafter one knows and scarcely knows what to expect one black hereafter is as good as a white one i had to kick their law into their teeth in order to save them each person blighted by darkness broods heavily and carries the business of hate inside like giant cobras carry their venom to alien bodies we are indeed things of dry hours the whole mess of blackness is a spit in the eye of our so called christian society a dryness is upon our house and no black man in america really owns one we have lived the life of impostors and now we must reckon with the broken spirits of our children who through their sectional marches and rides have saved us from everlasting shame in the eyes of free men everywhere save home bom in alabama bred in illinois he was nothing but a plain black boy so we go into drug stores and lunch counters displaying our painted black faces while cockroaches chase the babysitter and we declare our middleclassism wear the mink pay twice for a loose fitting store bought yes sir suit kid the kids negroes whats a negro her body is a honey bowl whose waiting honey is deep and hot what ever happened to those fun loving dancing happy people ones not a man ones not a woman grown gwendolyn brooks is a prophet and a brooder her poetry ranks with the best produced in this wild untamed country one might call her a disciple of truth she speaks of a time and country and people not easily found in the verse and prose of her peers her collected poems intensify all the known and unknown vicissitudes of negro life in america her song is too sad and delicate for the ears of white america but by sheer technique she has managed to capture a few catchers in the rye her song is too pointed and studied to awake the amateur reader among her race the high and mighty read eliot and those facile minded lows read dunbar and the rest she is alone and i fear she knows it beneath the strict didactic tones of her verse there is nothing seeable save a heart full of love and controlled hate and fantastic nostalgia hung up in the mouth of deaths life ill never forget the summer before i was married how needlessly i worried about so many things all the usual difficulties expected of a new marriage were not enough for me i had heaped imaginary problem upon problem until i felt i would be crushed by the load i fancied myselfan inveterate country girlconstrained to city slums for life unclaimed by my family shunned on every side by those around me of course my worries were not completely without cause i grew up in an allwhite environment by the time i was in high school there were a few negro students attending the university in my home town but i knew no more about negro life than the snatches of news and gossip i had overheard from my uninformed and sometimes biased associates as i went through two years of college and began working i made friends from many sections of this country and some from abroad who helped liberalize my cultural outlook even among most of them however i was encouraged to look elsewhereamong my own kind for love and happiness perhaps it was because so few believed that i could make a success of an interracial marriage that spurred me on but i became determined that love was more important than a whole worldful of opinions i began to read every book and article i could find on the subject of negrocaucasian intermarriage integration education culture etc i even found articles by children of these couples which aided me considerably since most people hold the view that these children suffer intolerably naturally i had a firsthand source of information to which i could turn at any time i needed it he never spared the truth in telling me what i might expect from one group or the other i think my greatest lesson came when i was introduced to some of his negro friends for it was here that i discovered that they like he were just ordinary people some became very dear friends while others were as obnoxious to me as some other folks i know during my associations with these people have noticed no difference in subject matter intelligence morals or any other stigma that is thought to be characteristic of the negro i found each person must be judged for himself not as a member of any group though all this may have been known by some for many years it was all new to me the more i learned the more confident i became i reached the conclusion that the only way i would ever know what it was to be the wife of a negro was to become one the day we exchanged wedding vows i was no longer afraid i looked forward to the future with hope courage and pride and i knew then as i do now that i would always have them no matter what trials should come my way looking back on all of this now seems like remembering a dream we have encountered none of the problems i had imagined true we are sometimes stared at and some people go out of their way to be friendly but among the people we know we are just another couple i sometimes wonder what life would be for me if i had let anyone change my mind during those fearful unforeseen years we are so happy now enjoying life together thrilling over the accomplishments of our small son and busy carrying out plans for today and all the tomorrows that we will share my people is the enemy deception is more humiliating than rejection exploitation is more inhuman than exclusion indifference is more emr bittering than open hostility condescension is more provocative than hate the estrangement of the races in the north is more volatile more apt to explode into violence as far as i can discern than is the segregation of the races in the south the alienation of the races in new york city or chicago may turn out to be more calamitous than whatever happens in jackson or birmingham for negroes in the urban north revenge may seem sweeter than equality and violence more decisive than patience and both more honorable than the tolerance of further appeasements and postponements of course i say this out of my own experience in new yorkin harlemand from a good deal of contact with the people of the ghettos of some of the other northern citieschicago boston and detroit especially but i assert it also in the perspective of some exposure to and experience in the south during the years i lived and worked in harlem i had occasion to visit the south a good many times sometimes in mississippi and in louisiana the southern visits involved legal cases but there were also trips to georgia south carolina virginia florida and arkansas to lecture at law schools and colleges and to visit some of the churches of the south there were opportunities to give legal counsel to those involved in the sitins and freedom rides and other demonstrations both in the south and the north indeed i myself was involved in what must have been one of the original sitinsback in when i was in college in maine some of us had observed that negroes were not served at a certain hotel and that discrimination existed and was practiced in some other public accommodations although it must be said that the issue was hardly noticed publicly in maine because there were comparatively few negroes in the state there was however discrimination in some places against french canadians who had migrated to maine a bill was introduced into the legislature that condemned racial or ethnic discrimination and sought to establish a commission against discrimination several of us were working for the bills enactment one day the legislator who had sponsored the measure a man of french extraction came to see us to report that the legislation had almost no chance to pass since there was so little public interest in the issue after long discussion it was decided that three of us would go with a negro to the hotel which barred negroes and ask to be served it was arranged in advance that the legislator would be dining in the same hotel that evening and would have with him a newspaperman the expectation was that we would ask to be served and as had been the custom in the hotel be refused we would protest and the legislator having noticed the incident would intervene in our behalf while the newspaperman took photographs and got a story the publicity of the incident was supposed to enhance the prospects for the passage of the bill at the appointed hour our party arrived at the hotel and went into the dining room the senator and the reporter were halfway through their entrees after we had been sitting at the table for several minutes we noticed that the waiter had gone to speak to the manager we could not hear their conversation but soon the waiter came and asked to take our order we had to order something of course ironically we had already eaten at the college so sure we were that the hotel would not serve us among the four of us we had only about five dollars so the unfortunate senator ended up paying the checkfor our second dinner of the evening that was the result achieved in this pioneer sitin it is against the background not only of harlem but of a bit broader involvement than that that i conclude that the decisive front in the racial crisis in america is the urban north and not the south i have immense admiration for the restraint dignity and resourcefulness of the civil_rights movement in the south but the case remains that the immediate and stated objectives of that movement in the southern jurisdictions are goals that have already been substantially achieved in the northern cities at least so far as court decisions and legislation are concerned and also to a significant degree so far as integration in public transportation hotels restaurants and the like are concerned these things were attained in the north for the most part in the years after the second world war and what is to be seen when one looks now at the northern city is what happens after these legal rights and remedies which the southern demonstrations seek to win have been won the northern city in other words is setting the precedent for what is in store for the southern cities once the legal struggle to vindicate the civil_rights of negroes has been concluded and if in the days that lie immediately ahead the relations between the races are not somehow resolved peacefully then the whole nation is in for an ominous and dreadful holocaust let no man take comfort in the racial troubles of the northern cities least of all any white man from the south any more than any white northerner can appease his conscience or rationalize his indifference by the racial strife in the south no man is made innocent by the mere culpability of another man the lost frontier harlem had considered itself for a long time to be the pioneer negro community not only in the united states but in the world that seems a not unjustified pride after all new york city had been the place where the great succession of peoples of different tongues nations religions and customs had come and found albeit after patience and travail mutual accommodation a general acceptance and a share in the prosperity culture political power and common life of the city new york city represented the hospitality of american democracy to each man and to all men surely the american negro migrating from the south and the west indian negro immigrating to the continent could find here if anywhere welcome opportunity dignity and hope surely the negroes of new york would become and be here the pioneers of their race an example and encouragement and enhancement to all negroes everywhere this pioneer psychology in harlem was fed for years by the accumulation of civil_rights laws and statutory disclaimers of racial discrimination by the ceremonial use of negroes in public affairs by the praise of social equality for negroes heard in the churches downtown by the integration although here it was from the outset the most obvious economic necessityof public transportation and accommodations by the gradual if begrudged inroads of negroes into the lower echelons of public and quasipublic employment by the notoriety that some few negroes achieved in white society particularly in athletics and entertainment harlem was the leader so long as the african nations remained largely colonial harlem was the pioneer so long as the south remained segregated but now under the impact of the events in africathe emergence of the new nations there and the increasingly decisive power of africans in the united nationsand with the disruption and accelerating disintegration of southern segregation harlem frets over its destiny harlem wonders whether it has lost its pioneer initiative and suspects that every achievement of negroes in new york city and every opportunity of negroes in new york city is illusory or fraudulent or guileful no wonder a few years ago legislation was enacted in new york city barring discrimination in private multipledwelling units a law much celebrated by the local politicians as a milestone for negroes and other socalled minority groups in the city yet few negroes look for housing outside of harlem without encountering discrimination in one guise or another and even where the discriminating circumstances are such as to legally justify filing a complaint the procedure for administration of the law is so cumbersome as to be of practical consequence in only a handful of cases the new construction and renovation of housing in new york have been an efficient instrument of segregation the east side of manhattan for instance from yorkville to gramercy park is more effectually segregated today than it was fifteen years ago because the vast reconstruction of that sector of the city has made the rental or purchase of housing beyond the means of most harlem negroes yet at the same time i have been offered an apartment in yorkville for pretty much whatever you want to pay by a landlord who wants to keep the building white and if a negro family wants to move out of harlem and to queens say and purchase a house there they will find that the banks are helping to resist such moves by charging both the seller and the buyer placing fees in order to merely receive a mortgage application insofar as negroes disperse in the city both the negroes and those willing to sell housing to negroes have to pay a penalty for it the effect of factors such as these despite the legislative denunciations of discrimination is to induce the formation of new ghettos for negroes in the places in the bronx or queens or brooklyn or beacon or newburgh to which negroes move from the harlem ghetto as the negro population increases new harlems are spawned which suffer the same isolation from the rest of the city that the old harlem has known for more than a half a century housing is crucial of course because of the vicinity of neighborhood life and the importance of neighborhood institutions in the city if housing is segregated then there will also be and is de facto segregation of schools hospitals political clubs taverns stores and churches even without other considerations that favor segregation in education religion politics and the likewhere slums have been displaced by public housing projects in areas like harlem the people have often been exploited by private businessmen to take advantage of the ignorance of people with regard to their rights one of the common frauds is the furniture dealer who visits a family which has been accepted for public housing to inform them that a prerequisite for moving into their new apartment is that they have new furniture such transactions typically result in the commitment of the family to a heavily mortgaged purchase of furniture of indifferent or inferior quality with such small installment payments that they pay many times over the true value of the goods and are lucky if the furniture lasts as long as the payments of course default in the payments entitles the seller to repossess the property ironically many of these sales based upon misrepresentation are foisted on families who have been admitted to public housing because they are good rent risks that is because they have a stable if low and steady if insufficient income some could in fact qualify for credit in reputable downtown department stores but as in the case of shopping for food are reluctant to leave the neighborhood feeling that their business is unwelcome in the white stores and fearing rejection because they are negroes if they apply for credit negroes have too much and too long been not only the victims of such charlatan businessmen but also have suffered exclusion both from employment in and ownership of business enterprises even within the ghetto this is the situation which gives rise to efforts to boycott liquor stores furniture stores and other businesses in harlem itself and to campaigns to buy black during the demonstrations of the summer of in one section of the city protesting discriminatory hiring practices of a certain restaurant chain in which scores of arrests were made it turned out that the strongest opposition to the demonstrations within the business community of that section was the crime syndicate the businessmen of organized crime were distressed by the demonstrations because they caused a substantial increase in the numbers of policemen assigned to the area and thus made it more dangerous and difficult for drugs to be peddled and for the numbers racket to operate it is also likely that the syndicate fears integration in business because it might eventually require admitting negroes to the rackets as well as to legitimate businesses the sanction invoked by the syndicate to line up the opposition of businessmen and others in the area was to threaten to call in and collect loans made by the syndicate to otherwise legitimate businessmen who might be ready to go along with integration in public accommodations stores and the like or take hospitals not long ago i had a negro client who had taken her child one sunday to a public playground the child who was five years old fell at the playground hitting his head on the concrete surface a few blocks away there is a private hospital related by the way to one of the churches the mother took her child there and after waiting nearly an hour in the socalled emergency reception section was finally interviewed by a doctor who explained that the mother would have to take the child to a public hospital since she could not afford care at this institution and since thats what the public hospitals are for actually of course the private hospital could have been reimbursed by public welfare for any care given to the child although at rates set by the welfare authorities rather than by the hospital administration the nearest public hospital was four miles away so after having been turned away the mother took the child there walking part of the way and going by bus part of the way since she had no money for a taxi after a further wait at the public hospital the child was examined and it was found that he had suffered a serious injury which might permanently disable him the doctors say that if the child had received prompt attention the consequences of the injury would likely have been much less serious the mother in the case worked as a domestic she told her employer about the matter and he in turn reported it to me it seemed likely that the reason the child had not been admitted to the private hospital was either because the family was poor or negro or most likely both the mother however refused to make any formal complaint against the doctor and private hospital because as she explained she had no hope whatever that she could prevail after all why should she a negro expect to be treated fairly or humanely by the law any more than she had been by the private hospital and besides the prosecution of the complaint would not heal her child while the matter was being discussed i called a friend of mine who is a reporter on one of the major new york newspapers one which professes a great concern for human rights told him what had happened and suggested that it might be worthwhile publicizing this incident to call attention to discrimination in the private hospitals of the city but he said that the incident was not newsworthy and that his paper received as many as a dozen reports a day of similar cases its only a story for us he said if the kid dies or if the injury is really grotesque one of the uglier incidents which was thought to be newsworthy happened a few years ago in harlem a babyjust over two years old developed a high fever and his mother a negro took him to a public hospital the interne who examined the child told the mother that it was a minor respiratory intection and prescribed some medicine the mother took the child home administered the medicine but found in the next day or two that the fever did not abate they returned to the hospital this time a different interne was on duty and he sent the mother and baby to the tuberculosis ward saying that he suspected that this was the ailment testing there indicated that it was not and again the mother and baby were discharged after having been given some additional medicine three days later when the babys fever and discomfort persisted the mother for the third time went to the hospital waited her turn and while the child was being examined by the doctor it died an autopsy subsequently established that the child had died not from a respiratory infection not from incipent tuberculosis but from an infection caused by the bite of a rat thats the sort of story that makes the newspapers and that is the sort of incidentalong with the playground casethat causes many negroes to conclude that they can expect little care from hospitals or at least little competent care in short in virtually every sector of the citys lifehousing education and medical care in business politics and employment in the welfare administration and the enforcement of the lawnegroes still suffer discrimination and segregation despite the legislative disclaimers of discrimination and the public promises of the politicians the tragedy and irony of harlem is that while negroes have been lost in fondness for the image of harlem as the pioneer for all negroes harlem has remained the place and symbol of persistent if sometimes subtle discrimination excluded from the housing politics lawful protection commercial enterprise common culture education economic opportunity sanitation and free access characteristic of the rest of the city and taken for granted by the white people downtown the great affront to harlems pioneer destiny is that harlem still exists the passion for revenge this is no report by the way about the extreme racists within the negro community about the black muslims or the black nationalists although both exist and increasingly thrive in harlem and in the other great urban ghettos of the north and they are by no means to be dis counted or underestimated indeed as far as the muslims are concerned they are well financed some say with funds from the arab sourcesand apparently they are congenial with the white racists of the american nazi party at least i myself have seen some proof of their association with the american nazi but these extremiststhe muslimsseem to have made a fatal tactical mistake in their attempts to exploit the unrest and frustration and sentiment for revenge among american negroes especially in the north they have required their adherents not just to hate white men though that is their central doctrine and essential aopeal they also require that their members renounce their relieious inheritancewhich in harlem is either the gospel tradition in protestantism or in the case of west indian immigrants roman catholicismand embrace the indoctrination of a new and strange and unfamiliar religion which incidentally bears little truthful resemblance to historic islam and to further submit to the discipline and rigorous piety of the new faith with respect to practical behavior from day to day the muslims have made hate too complicated and difficult and much too contingent upon a peculiar moralism to become a movement that receives mass support or so it seems to me simply as an observer yet there is no doubt that the central emphasis of the extremistslike the muslimsin the negro communities of the north upon the simple hatred and rejection of white men because they are white men has enormous and increasing appeal among the negroes of the city ghettos the great danger for both negroes and whites is that some leader will emerge who will turn to his people and preach a blunt doctrine of hate and revenge because the ground has been so well prepared by extremists of both races it will be difficult to organize longsuppressed emotion and legitimate grievances into a powerful movement if that comes to pass the peaceful demonstrations in the streets will cease and the revolution will become an insurrection if that does happen if there is a violent and bloody calamity perhaps white men will then recognize that the incumbent leadership of the negro revoltnotably martin_luther_king with his great dignity and discipline and restrainthas been the best friend of white americans both in the north and the south each day of diehard indifference of white people in the north each day of diehard segregation in the south invites disaster by making it more difficult for the negro leadership favoring and practicing nonviolent protest to maintain its leadership the nonviolent demonstrations have after all been going on for about five years on a significant scale and reached a climax in the march on washington in august of if from these demonstrations there is not some tangible result to which the present negro leadershio can point it may be expected with certainty that the patience of negroes will be exhausted and they will turn to other leaders and to other tactics and turn from seeking redress of their grievances to taking revenge for the indignities they have suffered through three hundred years of slavery and segregation no account is given here of the extremists in harlem but the danger is that harlemalong with each of the little harlems of the nation is driven to extremity one sign of how much racism tempts negroes is the degree to which some leaders among them who are not muslims or nationalists feel constrained to imitate and recite racist doctrines some of the statements of congressman adam clayton powell reflect this change in the mood and militancy of harlem i recall for another instance attending a rally in harlem some time ago protesting police brutality one of the speakers was a certain negro minister whom i know well and who has been very moderate it happens that this man is of very fair complexion and could easily pass for a white man when he began his speech he apologized for his light color whereupon he was booed by the crowd he persisted in his apology and said that though he was light he knew the full burden of being a negro in america more booing he changed his tactic and launched into the most provocative and virulent racist speech i think i have ever heard advocating among other things black supremacy and resort to violence to oppose the violence of the police this time the crowd was with him he had sensed the depth of their hostility and had appeased it but there is a sequel to the incident after the rally i went to greenwich village where i had a date to have a drink with a white student who had just returned to the city from a freedom ride in mississippi as we sat in the restaurant who should come in but the minister who had given the racist address at the rally and guess who was with him a white girl the important thing so far as i am concerned is not the duplicity of the ministerthat is a problem he must live with all alonebut rather that he had felt that black supremacy and revenge had become so much the spirit of harlem that he had to identify with it he tried first of all to do that in his pitiful apology for his light skin and when that failed he succeeded in gaining the crowd by outdoing even the professional racists in harlem a particularly ominous sign of the extremisties of negro animosity is the emergence in the open of negro antisemitism it is a complex phenomenon and one which has as far as i can observe been spawned over a very long time part of the picture is a sense of the uniqueness of the negro cause as such and a reluctance among negroes to identify their cause with that of other minorities not only the jews but also for example puerto ricans this sentiment much prevails in spite of the historic interest of the jews in america in the civil_rights of all citizens and in the case of the puerto ricans in spite of their common problems negroes do not want to be lumped together with other minorities but there is evidence of particular resentment at being associated with the jews one reason for this is the direct competition now between negroes and jews in politics in new york in the succession of migrations and immigrations of the different ethnic groups there has been a succession to political power that roughly parallels the order of the immigrations for a while the germans were politically powerful but they were displaced by the irish and the irish in time by the italians as the dominant group but in this succession the jews did not receive their turn they were not welcome in politics although their numbers justified political recognition it is only comparatively recently through the device of a third party with preponderantly jewish leadership and membership and through the socalled reform movement in the democratic party that the jews have received something like the political recognition and patronage status that their numbers and social and economic influence would have brought to other groups long since the problem is that the jews have belatedly emerged in great strength in city politics at just the time when the negro demand for political power and patronage has become insistent consequently the two minorities which have suffered the most harsh discrimination in city politics are now in the position of competing with each other for political power and patronage rather than being united in a common political cause but politics is not the only cause of negro antisemitism there are unfortunate instances in which negroes have endured illtreatment at the hands of individual jews a typical instance is when tenants live in slums where the landlord happens to be jewish i have had two cases where the landlords of abominable slums were rabbiswhich hardly improves the image of the jews in the eyes of negroes the fact is too that some of the furniture dealers who have victimized negroes moving into new housing have been jewish and this further feeds antisemitism even the substantial philanthropy of jews for the civil_rights struggle and their sincere sympathy for the plight of the negroes are greeted with suspicion and resentment who are they to speak for us is a common form which this hostility takes nobody but a negro can know what it means to be a negro is the sentiment which rejects identification on the part of jews with the negro cause yet the overriding reason for negro antisemitism as far as i can discern is that it is some awful emulation of the antisemitism so long prevalent and so unyielding among middle and upperclass white protestants and catholics for generations these citizens who have been ascendant in american society have made antisemitism a mark of social and political status something which while it seldom took the form of open persecution was and still too much remains an accepted attitude and practice insofar as this is the basis of negro antisemitism it places white christians in an excruciating position on one hand they must now stand beside the jews and share with the jews the hostility of negroes toward all white people but at the same time they themselves are authors of one form of that very hostilitythe antisemitism of negroes which imitates the antisemitism of white protestants and catholics such is the economy of judgment in any event now it is at least in the open no longer latent and snide and festering but brought into the open by the boycotts of jewish merchants in harlem the rent strikes against some jewish landlords and the attempts to integrate some unions and industries that have heretofore been predominantly white and jewish now that it is in the open perhaps it can and will be dealt with in a way which both affirms the uniqueness of the negro and the grandeur of the negros struggle and also in some way works a reconciliation among negroes and jews and white christians the spirit of revenge which stalks the streets of harlem and the other urban ghettos is one which increasingly regards any association in public between negro and white as suspect as a guilty association one which calls into question the loyalty and racial pride of the negro one in which the negro is thought to be tempted or intimidated or cajoled or purchased into some compromise of his integrity and identity as a negro an event like the censure of a philip randolph the distinguished leader of the american negro labor council and virtually the patriarch of harlem by the executive council of the aflcio for his exposure of racial discrimination in the unionsthe proof of which has been amply documentedabets the suspicion that when a negro tries to negotiate or collaborate with whiteseven those who protest most that they are liberalshe must either betray himself and his people or suffer humiliation even the word negro is dropping from usage in favor of the term black man in order to express the pride a man who is black should have in being black and the disdain that black men should have toward white men there was a time for example when prostitution in new york involved supplying negro girls to white patrons from downtown and when some brothels in harlem catered largely to white customers those days are gone a negro prostitute does not have white customers any more no matter what the price because to associate with white people is a disloyalty to her race and people and their cause just as much ior a prostitute as for any uncle tom in politics or the churches the intensity of the rejection of association with white people apparent among negroes should be enough to put to rest the red herring in the civil_rights crisis regarding intermarriage the fact is bluntly that most negroes hate white people when there is as there will surely be integration in public life in americahousing and education and politics and jobs and public accommodationsthere will not suddenly be a great increase in marriages between the races at least i have detected no greater interest in the subject among negroes than among whites and why should there be much interest in the subject nobody is interested in marriage in the abstract marriage is a personal issue and decision and it remains that with respect to marriages between the races if marriage in a serious and responsible sense is being contemplated the intermarriage issue is empirically baseless and where advanced as an obstacle to the right of negroes to be received and welcomed as citizens in public life represents a gross irrational and stupid vanity on the part of white people and it is aptly the subject of ridicule i know a seminary professor a native white southerner who is a strong advocate of the negro cause long before the present crisis he was an eloquent and effective witness in the south for civil_rights he has a very attractive daughter eligible for marriage he tells me that he is invariably asked after giving a speech in support of civil_rights what he himself would do if a negro proposed to his daughter his stock answer to this query is to say first of all i would ask him whether he was a protestant a catholic or a jew or to show how ridiculous this intermarriage issue is from another point of view i recollect recently being in the south and meeting an elderly negro gentleman he as it happensand as is the case with many negroes of slave ancestry in this countryhad a white father asked one day by a white southerner about this he replied that he indeed had a white father the conversation was overheard by another negro who after the white southerner had departed approached my friend and said tom dont you ever ever do that again dont you ever admit to a white southerner that your father was a white man you tell em that it was your mother who was white in other words intermarriage when posed as an abstract and impersonal issue is irrelevant to the civil_rights of negro citizens there is no serious evidence of any significant interest abstractly and impersonally in intermarriage among either whites or negroes whereas there is plenty of evidence of the slavery era having fostered many many interracial liaisons and later on evidence of negro prostitution for white customers so let the specter of intermarriage be put to rest the issue it really raises is the sexual ethics of white men outside of marriage both in the days of slavery and in the days of the traveling salesman and let two people fall in love and marry if they are given the gift of love even though they be of different races though they be different in any other way they will have and probably will continue to have for a long time more difficulties than most marriages in this society but the issue then is not so much societys as theirs and if under the burdens which this society adds to any interracial marriage they survive and prosper as man and wife and as a family that only enhances the dignity and maturity of their love it is in anv case no reason to oppose or deny any negro his place and his prerogatives as an american citizen ironically though the passion for revenge is active and i fear increasing within the negro community especially in the urban north that which has subdued and controlled this passion is the same thing which in the end mav be the proximate cause of vengeance and violence what has mainly quieted the advocates of violence and counseled extraordinary restraint in the negro revolution has been the leadership crisis within the negro community itself if any proof were needed which none isof the profound humanity of negroes it is supplied by the infighting and pettiness and personality conflicts the competitiveness an throatcutting within the negro establishment itself they are just like white people scrapping and fighting and destroying each other in all this maneuvering and internal struggle for leadership of the negro revolution the rest of the nation has gained some time to acknowledge and respond to the revolution but now that time is running out and if the negro leadership crisis among core naacp sclc the urban league the student movements the black racists and the remaining uncle toms is not resolved then racial chaos is urely in store for america the masses of negro people have at last been moved they will not wait long for a leader nor dally about who the leader is they will move by themselves if need be without a leader and the revolution will become an insurrection they are tired they are frustrated they are angry they are impatient they are aggressive they are ready for a leader buti thinkthey are also ready to go into the streets without a leader all by themselves as other men have had to do from time to time to defend and vindicate their own humanity the depths of estrangement if one looks today at the cities of the north where the decisive struggle in the negro revolution is taking shape the conclusion is inescapable that the estrangement between the races in the north is virtually complete despite the northern civil_rights legislation despite the commissions on human rights despite the ceremonial presence of negroes in public life despite the liberalism of many white northerns despite good intentions and naive sincerity racism has not been exorcised indeed racism increases it not only becomes more evident and intransigent among white people as negroes press their claims with greater vigor and determination but latent in negroes it begins to emerge and flourish among them the truth is that in the years since the beginning of substantial migration of negroes from the south to the northern cities and of the immigration of negroes from the west indies to the northern cities there has been precious little honest honorable or significant communication between the races the platitudes of tolerance it turns out conceal the practice of discrimination for the american idea of tolerancethough it be less vehement than south africas apartheidis after all a generically similar doctrine of racial coexistence the promises of acceptance freedom and society in the northern city have not been validated in education jobs housing politics or the equal protection of the law everything seemed fine for many years but the condition of that tranquillity was the acquiescence of negro citizens in a secondclass status and a ghetto existence separated from the comforts mobility and opportunities of life in the outer city the platitudes and promises the liberalism and benign intentions of northern white society during the last fifty years in which the negro migration to the cities has taken place mean little when it remains true to this day that eightyfive per cent of all negroes in metropolitan new york for example live in one or another of five neighborhoods which are virtually entirely black and in consequence send their children to black schools worship in black churches dine at black restaurants attend black movies theaters and in all the ordinary facets of community life associate almost entirely with their fellow negroes the main contact with the white people for the multitude of northern negroes has been when some negro has left harlem to go to workas a domestic in an east side penthouse as a sanitation department employee to collect the waste of the rest of the city or to wait on tables in a downtown restaurant which seldom has a negro customer to scrub the floors of empty offices late at night to sell body and dignity to a white businessman for a night or to entertain white people in a club or bar of course in all this time some negroes have made the grade and have achieved a certain acceptance in and access to white society some have made it as has been earlier mentioned by becoming quislings only a few have made it without that humiliation one is dr anna arnold hedgeman despite the eminence she achieved it is constructive to see how she constantly had to resist being used by white society dr hedgeman began her professional career as a school teacher in the dark regions of mississippi but later after some years of community work in the midwest moved to new york where she was an executive with the harlem ywca engaged in a multitude of efforts to raise the educational occupational and cultural level of harlem long before the present sitins and demonstrationsindeed before some of the leaders of the present negro revolution were bornshe and others including a philip randolph were engaged in trying to qualify negroes for jobs in urban society and then in trying to secure jobs for them the reason the major department stores in new york have negro salespeople today is a credit to anna hedgemans pioneering work twenty years ago from her baptism in teaching and community work she went to washington as the executive director of the national council for a permanent fair employment practices commission she led the effort to enact legislation to make the wartime fepc permanent president trumans support of this legislation motivated mrs hedgeman to campaign and to raise funds from negroes across the country for trumans reelection in as a result she was appointed assistant to oscar ewing the head of the federal security agency mrs hedgeman later returned to new york city was an assistant manager in the first campaign of robert wagner for mayor of new york and after his election was invited to join his administration it soon developed that this was an invitation to become an uncle tom it was an invitation to have a negro presence adorn the city administration but not engage in any serious work or exercise any significant influence on the policies of the administration three different jobs were offered to mrs hedgeman one was a post already held by a negro she refused this on the grounds that it represented no gain for her people or recognition for her if she simply replaced another negro in a position that had already been allocated to negroes in accordance with the de facto ethnic quota system which prevails in so much of new york politics then she was asked if she would become a seventh deputy police commissioner again replacing a negro mrs hedgeman had no specific qualifications for such a position and would have been consigned there to a merely ceremonial role she would have no part of that in spite of the salary prestige and publicity to be gained by accepting finally she was tendered an office in the mayors cabinet which she did accept in the mayors cabinet in new york there are several positions of ministers without portfolio often acting as trouble shooters in city affairs reporting and directly responsible to the mayor without going through departmental channels in practice these offices are dispensed in a way that insures the ethnic balance the mayors administra tion needs to attract and hold support from the various ethnic blocs in the citys voting population in appointing mrs hedgeman mayor wagner may have felt especially inspired for here he had a representative of three of the citys neglected minorities mrs hedgeman was not only a negro but a woman and a protestant the day of the inauguration came and with suitable fanfare the cabinet was sworn in it was not long before mrs hedgeman discovered that she was not expected to show up at city hall or to maintain an office there her function was to decorate occasions when it seemed important for the image of the administration to have a negro or a woman or a protestant or some combination thereof on the scene even after being sworn in as assistant to the mayor she was again unsuccessfully offiered the police assignmentan inept attempt to relegate her to a nominal and vassal role there was some consternation at city hall in the davs and weeks that followed because of mrs hedgemans insistence that she wanted to be a functioning working member of the administration not a ceremonial occasional officer it became clear that she was not interested in patronage for herself but in accomplishing something for her people eventually as might have been predicted anna hedgeman resigned from the wagner administration her life of authentic concern shows her to have been a pioneer in the present civil_rights demonstrations which have now forever established that negroes will no longer be appeased by promises platitudes and nominal recognition it was anna hedgeman who years ago had foreseen before almost anyone else either black or white the gravity of the estrangement between negroes and whites in american society especially in the urban north one afternoon she said to me very few negroes and white people are in real communication with each other those of us who can and do speak honestly as you and i do must keep in touch and help others to learn the quality of communication necessary if the races are to be reconciled this will be very hard and will become more difficult as the crisis deepens but that just makes it all the more important that we keep in touch i remember not long ago spending hours on the telephone receiving calls in turn from some of the negro leaders in the civil_rights struggle and then from some of the white church leaders who had somewhat belatedly and somewhat suddenly become committed to direct action in the struggle the calls were distressing because they showed how radical the estrangement of the races is even perchance especially in the churches there were two sorts of calls on the occasion that i recollect one kind came from white ecclesiastical officers who reported that the churches had decided to enter into direct action in support of the civil_rights of negroes but they wanted to know whether this or that negro was the one with whom to discuss the matter the other kind of call came from negroes who having received inquiries from the white ecclesiastics wanted to know if they should bother to meet with them because they were not really sure that those who had called them could be trusted and they wanted to know if i trusted the white people who had been involved in such overtures this is not only proof of how wide the alienation between the races has becomeit is not even widely known who to begin to try to talk withbut it is also evidence of how fragile and inadequate the avenues of tolerance and humanism are for serious and candid communication between the races i remember also this is another type of example being invited more than two years ago to lecture at columbia law school on the racial crisis in the city especially as it pertained to politics i spoke before an audience of bright young white law students they listened to the lecture i thought in a rather sullen way the burden of the lecture is the burden of this chapter of my bookthat one who becomes somehow immersed in some of the visceral and brutal realities of the racial crisis cannot escape a premonition of chaos and imminent disaster what i had to report that night was later to become the substance of an article race religion and revenge published by the christian century in their issue of february pages to gave the speech and said i trust what as nearly as could figure out as a white man was and is the truth about the relations between races in the northern cities when i finished there were a lot of comments from the law students they fell roughly into two categories the first alleged that i had been too harsh and pessimistic about the relations between the races in america and these assertions were documented by the experiences of some of the students themselves such as the fact that several of them had been exposed to negroes in new yorktaxi drivers and waiters and the likeand had been treated by them in these situations with civility and courtesy after further discussion it soon became apparent to the students that the casual contacts they had experienced with taxi drivers elevator operators waiters and so on did not constitute significant nor even honest and honorable communication with negroes in the city so that line of attack on my paper was abandoned the line which took its place was much more revealing they said in effect well the trouble with you stringfellow is that you have lived so long among them that you have begun to think like they do their objection finally as far as i could comprehend it was that i by living and working those years in harlem had somehow ceased to be a white man or at least had lost the capacity and authority to speak as a white manthrough i suppose overexposure to negroes if that be the case let it be all this time i had thought that there is something unique about being a human being something which transcends all of our human differences and diversities whether of race or age or class or profession or sex or wealth or whatever and if it must come to pass in the agonizing tensions and fears which characterize the racial crisis that any white man regards meor any one of a number of other white menas traitors to our race m and heritage then let that be it can only prove how deep and pathetic the estrangement of the races has become in this society so fond of boasting of its democracy and regard for humanity the estrangement is almost complete the proof of that is in the socalled white liberals of the north as much as or perhaps more than in the white segregationists of the south for these white northerners in the professions of liberalism toward the negroes suffer from a mentality which still assumes that white men retain the initiative in the racial crisis and that white men have and should continue to have the prerogative of determining the pace of the negros emancipation and the terms of his reception into full citizenship what do the negroes want they ask not discerning that this very question embodies the essence of white supremacy even though perhaps it be a more subtle and more genteel white supremacy than that characteristic of the irrational and crude segregationists of the deep south that questionwhat do the negroes wantpresupposes that what the negroes want is for the whites to give as if in this society the whites retain some right to dispense to the negroes or to anybody else what is theirs by birthright and citizenship and in truth by their common humanity white men have no authoritylegally or morallyto rule upon any demands of negroes white men have only to acknowledge and honor at last the same civil and human rights for negroes that they treasure for themselves yet the condescension among northern whites is still conspicuous and one might add obnoxious it is in its own fashion much more embittering and provocative much more incitive and diehard than the rabid traditional and sometimes pathological racism of the south it not only assumes that whites hold the initiative in the resolution of the racial crisis which is a fantasy since the initiative has now conclusively passed into the hands of the negroes as the past few years attest but it also still treats participation by white citizens in the civil_rights struggle as a good causeas a cause that ought to be supported by people of principle and conscience just as aid to refugees might also be supported with time and money or just as the work of the united nations might be upheld with words and occasional actions the only thing is that this is no good cause not at least in the sense that refugee assistance or apologetics for the united nations may be the negro revolution is no ordinary charity to which enlightened whites should give their donations and their names the negro revolution is rather an authentic revolution in which the whole prevailing social order of the nation is being overturned in the face of three hundred years of slavery segregation discrimination and de facto racism throughout the country every important institution in the public life of the nation education employment unions churches entertainment housing politics commerce investment welfare transportation public accommodationsis immediately affected by this revolution and this revolution will not spend its course until every such institution surrenders to its objectives the only real question is the means by which the inevitable integration of american public life will take place peaceably or violently realistically or obstinately today or tomorrow this is no good cause in the conventional sense of the term and to treat it as suchas so many northern liberals still dois in itself condescending and stupid how then should white people especially those in the north treat this issue first of all they must surrender their prerogative of decision first of all they must face the fact that the real decisions determining how the racial crisis will be resolved are for the negroes to make first of all they must give up the idea that they have and should continue indefinitely to have the prerogatives of white supremacy first white people must die to that mentality by suffering the hostility and rejection of negroes and by risking their lives and the future of this society in the hands of the negroes that is the preface to reconciliation between black men and white men
why i fight for america in the wake of the emmett till slaying in august the question was first asked me by a german taxi driver as we sped along the autobahn in his country during december of that same year a womans refusal to move to the rear of a bus in montgomery alabama made the world sit up and take note it also made me a target for the question as asked by a spaniard in barcelona in when nine childrens efforts to enter school created chaos in a city when pictures ol a negro minister being kicked by segregationists in little rock glared from billboards in paris a frenchman asked me the same question news of the freedom rides did not stop when the busses did the same news traveled on to foreign countries the sitins walkins and standins were launched in the states but like long range missiles their impacts were heard in distant lands when a lone negro braved hostile crowds to register in a southern college federal marshals were not the only ones who watched so did the world now as i stand on this little race is engaged in a constant struggle a great fight to secure first class citizenship but our fight is not a lawless one it is protected nay precipitatedby the laws of our country the constitution the bill of rights and all the rulings that combine to form the just laws of the land the very freedom for which we are fighting springs from those laws and those laws give us the right to fight it is then only fitting and proper that we should serve in the armed forces of our country for there are those of us who must make contributions to the higher cause so that all the other causes will not lose their meanings i am making my contribution i fight to protect those laws during my brief travels i have found that men of all races can live together in peace i recall the times when i have had friends who were like brothers though they were not of my race those friendships cause me to think that brothers are not always of the same blood kith and kin but are sometimes born in the minds of men who live together in strange and foreign lands my prayer is that such births will occur in the minds of my countrymen that we all might reach the scale where the chords of our living will blend into a harmony that sings the greatness of america i fight because i feel that my prayer is not in vain and i stand on this little pacific isle with that feeling growing stronger each time i look westward towards my home by wyatt t walker the basic approach of v the nonviolent revoluj tion will not change it will be marked by increasing frequency and intensity of activity it is already evident that the south will not be the chief focus of activity the entire nation will feel the brunt of nonviolent forces demanding freedom now the south will see most of the activity focused on schools and public accommodations the norths activity will center chiefly on employment and housing in no event will any form of discrimination go unchallenged it has become remarkably clear in the national community that we have a problem a few months ago race relations was only the concern of a small minority and a handful of agitators significantly that which was kindled in birmingham amid fire hoses and police dogs and given a tremendous vote of confidence at the lincoln memorial on august has drawn active support from the great majority that had been at best uncommitted hundreds of thousands have come off the fence the religious forces have become involved as never before birmingham has become a watershed of history in the nonviolent revolution much of our conversation in years to come will be dated with such phrases as before birmingham and since birming i i yet with all of its significance birmingham has not been quite enough to convince the powers that belocally statewide and nationallythat an atmosphere of urgency exists despite the civil_rights package being the most sweeping civil_rights legislation ever proposed the political overtones of the elections seem much too apparent in the face of the seven bombings since the birmingham agreement including that which cost the lives of six and the injury of a score more the department of justice is still using policy as a guide line instead of preventive measures being invoked there is still only the disposition to give ambulance service southern racist political figures must be made to understand that the federal court orders are to be enforced partv affiliation and concerns notwithstanding who might gainsay that if barnett had been jailed during the travesty at the university of mississippi perhaps we would not have had to contend with georee c wallace our kid glove treatment of the real anarchists and subversivesthe barnetts and the wallaceshas cost us a terrible price in human life paradoxically i submit that in the one single instance where the federal government has moved it has been against negroes intimately involved in the desegregation movement how despicable that slater king dr anderson and other leaders of the nonviolent movement in albany georgia were placed under federal indictment for obstructing justice and perjury there is no federal indictment against the sheriff who caned attorney c b kingbut it is under investigation there is no indictment against the peace officer who bludgeoned mrs king into unconsciousness and killed her unborn childbut it is under investigation there is no indictment against countless acts of police brutality and murder that take place all over the southbut it is under investigation so now the department of justice takes to trial the leadership of a local community who have sparked the fight against the illegal system under which they are forced to live the maximum penalty andor years in prison organized labor has failed in at least one respect that can be pointed up by the experience of danville virginia in danville as in other southern cities the legal maneuvering goes on endlessly picketing an established protest device is being harassed with all kinds of restrictions and codes now that negroes have employed it in their fight against segregation the dan river mills with all of its force of organized labor has been absolutely silent when the right to picket was limited by city ordinance to x number of pickets when they wake up twenty years or maybe ten yearsfrom now and automation is full blown they will be crying to high heaven about the unconstitutionality of picketing restrictions that were born solely to keep black people psychologically and economically enslaved where are their voices now the time to speak is now but the beleaguered forces of the negro community have not heard from organized labor in danville other quarters of the national community have been equally unconcerned thus the freedom now forces must devise some way to command the attention of the national community in order that all the emoluments of citizenship are secured once now and forever one of the ways the attention of the nation might be claimed to spur a creative and immediate resolution to the problem could well be the implementation of a national program of economic withdrawal a massive refusal to buy on the part of the negro community and others of good will would throw the business world into shock maybe then and only then will the nations financial leaders exert some initiative in eliminating the evils of segregation and discrimination this is not as farfetched as it may appear the ebb and flow of finance in every community determines to a large degree the character and morality of its politics in countless communities the impact on the flow of dollars by the nonviolent movement has been a strong leverif not the strongest leverto alter the traditional patterns in race relations it has already been strongly inferred that a national conference on selective buying may soon be called the strategic choice of consumer commodities to serve as targets nationally could even get some attention from the moguls of wall street someone has said appropriately money does not talk it screams just consider how swiftly segregated patterns could be altered if in threequarters of the nation the struggle for selfrespect and human dignity has as an ally the forces of the business world though it is a seldommentioned fact business leaders have a responsibility to national morality or again has the moment come in the development of the nonviolent revolution when we will be forced by delays and painfully slow results on some appointed day at some appointed hour to literally immobilize the nation until she acts on our plea for justice and morality is the day faroff when major transportation centers will be strangled by mass acts of civil disobedience airports train stations bus terminals the traffic of large cities interstate commerce will be halted by the bodies of witnesses nonviolently insisting on freedom now i suppose a nationwide work stoppage might attract enough attention to persuade some one to do something to get this monkey of segregation and discrimination off our backs once now and forever will it take one or all of these of course there is always the fast unto death why not are we not daily politically and economically strangled to death by the thousands under the present system finally let me say there is no guarantee that equality of opportunity will come this year or within the next five its possible that it may not come in teneven at the risk of national disaster but even if it is deferred another years the cry will remain freedom now in the midst of daily humiliation where we are still forced to be guided in ordinary pursuits by signs that say white and colored even if it must be said through clenched teeth our cry remains freedom now as we recognize the realities of continuing job discrimination and know full well that we are still the last hired and the first fired even with no prospect of paycheck at the end of the week unfailingly our demand persists freedom now when we return to the negro ghetto at night weary and footsore after a day of fruitless searching for a decent home in a neighborhood where we are able to pay the going price despite the frustration of open and subtle housing discrimination we must insist freedom now there are times when we will tire of endless litigation state by state county by county school board by school board plaintiff by plaintiff in order that the children bom of the loins of our bodies may have the opportunity of a desegregated education our cry remains freedom now there will be moments when we will not be riding the crest of great demonstrations that lead to success our efforts will sputter and utterly fail candidates for jail will be scarce sufficient bond money nonexistent apathy deeply entrenched but our cry must remain freedom now our flesh will tear under the assault of police dogs our bodies will literally break under the forces of billy sticks we will not be able to stand before fire hoses our spirits will be crushed by reprisal and fear but our cry must remain freedom now even as we stand in the rubble of burned and bombed churches or at the bier of a slain medgar evers or hear the anguished cry of little girls dying in sunday school and the prospect of the damning of the unborn our cry must remain freedom now by bill russell bill russell the dark gainly and responsible man who is center and cocaptain of the boston celtics the perennial champions of the national basketball association is without question one of the most remarkable athletes of our time yet he regards his life up to now as a waste i dont consider anything i have done he has said as contributing to society i consider playing professional basketball as marking time the most shallow thing in the world russell is not biting the hand that feeds him and his family he is too canny and practical a man he is not sullying basketball in any meaningful sense either it is rather that he is close to years old and has made certain judgments that seem to him so correct and obvious that he is not afraid to enunciate them basketball or any other sport is at bottom frivolous and the imposition of being a negro at this moment in history is an obligation that cannot be met on the floor of the boston garden where and how he can fulfill it russell does not yet know in six full seasons with the celtics russell has been selected four times by the players in the league as the nbas most valuable player including the last three years in succession on the other two occasions he was runnerup before russell joined the celtics late in hey had led the league in scoring for the five foregoing years but nonetheless each year the celtics had been eliminated in the divisional playoffs in russells tenure boston has won six of seven championships the only year it lost out russell was injured during the final playoff series and did not play in two of the last three games his contributions to his teams welfare are however often unsung not long ago for instance it waswho elserussell who found a teammates contact lens on the court do have to do everything for this club he said with an indulgent smile the foundation of russells brilliant play however is not blocking shots rebounding or his other purely physical skills it is rather his admirable mind and purpose his intelligencehe knows what to do with the balland his pride people dont realize says auerbach that this is a brain out there people think of him as just a big guy with fantastic coordination but he approaches being a genius once the game starts i admire his mind off the court too auerbach adds not entirely facetiously because hes smart enough to understand me to sum it all up says heinsohn hes got a hell of a lot of pride when hes playing his game it makes us almost unbeatable and the secret to the thing is that he gets himself up so often hes so nervous before a game he upchucks he wants to be the best in everything he does says cocaptain frank ramsey he hates to lose as long as the teams winning hes completely happy as long as hes playing real great ball were winning then hes the life of the party you hear that laugh miles around hes only moody with himself although bill russell has much to laugh about and does in his high rackety way there are only two things that could make me quit coaching says auerbach my wife and russells laugh he is at intervals an angry dissatisfied and aloof man of uncommon principle and is no less remarkable as a person than he is as an athlete russells scraggly beard is a telling indication of the man not only is russell nearly feet and blackcircumstances obviously over which he has no controlbut he has deliberately set himself further apart by being one of the few professional athletes to wear a beard ask him why he grew it and he will reply in time if he feels like it ive thought about it and ive thought about it why did i wear the beard why do i its part of this thingive always fought so hard to be different and i am different without even trying and maybe its just my own little revolution it just isnt done in polite circles in a sense but i do think its part of my personality when i first joined the celtics i shaved the beard off i did it on my own it was none of their business and if i had valued their opinion i would have asked them i made a concession to conformity at that time then i grew it back after we won the first championship i let heinsohn shave it off and then i grew it back again it was a very childish thing in the sense of defiance i wear it now to let people know i am an individual i do think for myself and im very opinionated contrary to popular belief im a living thinking breathing human being they say i owe the public this and i owe the public that what i owe the public is the best performance i can give period if someone asks me for an autograph i think its a waste but i sign them occasionally sometimes i just feel like being nice or it gets rid of them i personally dont care what people think of me i dont think i think any different than anyone else but i may act different one thing im not is a liar its not a matter of moralsmore a matter of ego i think too much of myself to misrepresent myself ill do anything i can for anyone as long as it doesnt hurt me but i have sympathy for very few people basketballthats all people want to talk to me about its a waste because they have nothing to say i resent people who talk to you and have nothing to say so i dont say anything hows the weather up there how are things on main street thats where i live what the heck kind of question is that you must be a basketball player because youre so tall just walk up and put it in eh no im not a basketball player i just kept growing what size bed do you sleep in i hate for people to get personal a big bed how much do you eat its ridiculous if you mind your own business life aint bad if you do the best you can thats the best you can do were a bunch of grown men playing a childs game its a childs game weve made into a mans game by complicating it silly isnt it we entertain people for x number of hours during the winter they may talk about it for a few minutes maybe an hour then its forgotten is this a contribution no analyze itits a silly game im also a silly man because i enjoy it i enjoy baseball too perhaps im a little dull it is not easy for a white man to understand or totally accept the vision of a black man skin is the hardest boundary the point is this bill russell or any other black man like him does not want the white mans sympathy or indeed his friendship what he wants is recognition and acceptance of himself as an individual a black individual who can meet the world on equal terms and fare unequally according to his merit a few things have happened russell says ive got three kids now a certain amount of responsibility to them i also have a certain amount of responsibility to a lot of other kids i give most negroes a certain amount of pride heres one of our guys doing all right they say the world cant be all bad that contribution is very shallow of course im practical where else but in basketball could i command this salary it is estimated in excess of man does what he has to but the contribution id like to make as a personto my kids and little black kids all over the worldis to make life better so their ambitions arent stifled when they face the world to give them the opportunity to do what theyre most skilled at i could have a burning ambition to give my kids a million dollars if i gave them that alone id be giving them nothing the most any kid can ask for says russell is to succeed or fail on his merits success and failure are relative everyone doesnt have presidential abilities and everyone cant be an allamerica it doesnt necessarily mean youre a failure my fathers a foundry worker this doesnt necessarily mean hes a failurebecause another persons father is a lawyer society needs both some people are going to be laborers but why say a man has to be a laborer because hes black one right we never had in this countrywe never had the right to be a failure or an individual why if one black man fails should all black men fail thats what the struggle is about whether its through love as with martin_luther_king or through pride as with the naacp or through hate as with malcolm_x and elijah muhammad what does the american negro want the editorials ask i find this very stupid were all products of our society and the acceptable standards are the same we want the same things when they write about birmingham the papers refer to outsiders and racial agitators to the black people of the us there is no such thing as an outsider theres been too much play on words in this country negroes have to earn their rights they say my oldest son buddha william felton russell jr was born on november suppose kids were born around boston that day why does my son have to earn any more than any of those kids i was bom on february why do i have to earn more than anyone else there used to be a lot of emphasis on the first negro to do this the first negro to do that its unimportant whos the first or whos the last the important thing is how many the rest is tokenism when thurgood marshall was made a judge it made me feel real good because he never attempted to disassociate himself like some educated negroes some negroes live in a twilight zone closing themselves off into a small white society the negro world doesnt concern them i feel sorry for themto an extent education is the acquiring of the ability to think for oneself anyone can get through college on memory courses if a negro judge says i dont think of myself as a negro just as a competent judge hes not facing life the way it is in our society its harder to face it the other way but you can sleep at nightevery night although everyone in his family is a life member of the naacp russell has not played a major role in any single negro organization he does not look upon himself as a leader and is uncomfortable in crowds he views the negro movement as being various in means but single in aim and feels that its factionalism is not divisive but a search for the most effective way i would have loved to go to birmingham russell says but im not passive sometimes i think i have tendencies to violence ive been mad enough to fight three times in my life and each time i wanted to kill the man you know the athletes i admire ted williams jackie robinson and sonny liston its easy to be easygoing and friendly to everyone i think a man has to be what he is if he feels good he is good if he doesnt he isnt im an admirer of floyd patterson too these are honest people in the sense of representing themselves some negro athletes dont show me much im disappointed in them they are politicians in the sense of saying the right things all the time if i went down there to birmingham and let someone spit on me and didnt do anything about it it wouldnt be me if you never really express dissatisfaction concretely people tend to ignore it if you believe in something youve got to say it this passive kick if it doesnt work how can they keep preaching it it is predicated on the premise that people are basically moral if they are right this is wonderful if they are wrong the religious phase of the movement will be destroyed if martin_luther_king is wrong he has failed as a leader maybe im becoming a fatalist or whatever you call it morality is a very large word morality and love have a lot in common who can really define it what is moral and what is immoral it is relative ive been reading about the black muslims a lot of things they say express the way i feel perfectly or rather a great deal of the things they say i cannot disagree with can the races get along yes will they get along thats the question the muslims say the white mans a devil i dont agree with that because i dont think there is such a thing as a devil they say the white man is evil i wonder about that in the sense that i wonder whether all men are evil i dislike most white people because they are people as opposed to dislike i like most black people because i am black i consider this a deficiency in myselfmaybe if i looked at it objectively detached myself it would be a deficiency in russell first went to black africa on a tour for the state department the continent had such an impact upon him that he bought part ownership of a rubber farm in liberia and named his baby daughter karen kenyatta after jomo kenyatta the prime ministerdesignate of kenya and onetime mau mau leader whom russell greatly admires russell is thinking quite seriously of settling in liberia i found a place i was welcome because i was black in stead of in spite of being black he says the basic problem in negro america is the destruction of race pride one could say we have been victims of psychological warfare in a sense in that this is a white country and all the emphasis is on being white whiter than white according to the law immigrants from northern european countries are more desirable than any others when a white man says his folks come from ireland he says it with a certain amount of pride he probably can trace his family tree for generations for whatever its worth this is not true of the american negro until the emergence of the independent african countries all we knew about africa was from the tarzan and jungle jim movies how stupid they made the natives one white mantarzanwas the best and smartest at everything even king kong after accepting the sacrifice of blacks for years when he was offered a white girl he didnt kill her he fell in love with her pride in being black was practically destroyed by seeing stupid things like this there was almost a sense of selfdegradation also until very recently the socalled negro elite was fairskinned the problem i see in africa is that it has to build a middle class all your great political and social changes have been brought about by the middle classmerchants artisans technicians africas needs are not necessarily administrators but people who can doplumbers toolanddiemakers draftsmen black africa is stepping from carrying things on the head to carrying them in airplanes theyve skipped the wheelbarrow the horse and buggy and practically railroads they have problems so immense where do you start you educate as many as you can but everyone who gets an education wants to be an administrator people have to realize there are stations in life forms of success everyone wants to have the ultimate success everyone cant have it someone must roll their sleeves up and go to work i find it a very perplexing problem whether i should go to africa or stay here ive thought about it a great deal if my contribution would be more concrete here no doubt i should stay here when i look at the struggle of the american negro i cant help but be very very proud with what weve had to work with weve done a pretty good job of surviving but we still have so far to go it would be a hell of a country its a great country as it is now we have to define great an ambiguous word great industrial empire standard of living i think it would be so much greater if everyone had an equal opportunity in every field there is no way to speculate how much brainpower this country has lost and we dont have to like each other to live together peacefully and equally have you ever read how in the time of drought all the animals use the same water hole the lions stay with the lions the tigers with the tigers the elephants live with elephants but they all use the same water hole of course because of his wealth and position russells experiences do not parallel those of most black men most of the time he lives on a white block in a white town has white babysitters and drives a lincoln continental convertible the fact that owning a big car is considered a negro stereotype does not concern russell ive passed the stage he says where i have to prove anything i happen to like watermelon too there may come a time when i have to ride a bicycle it wont bother me it just wont be as fast or convenient in boston russells celebrity is so great he can no longer enjoy himself at the ballpark or at night clubs he gets too much attention once in a while however the ineradicable fact of being black which he has never forgotten intellectually falls upon him and wounds him like a blow in the summer of russell said the other day i took my two sons to louisiana where i was born and lived for nine yearsto see my grandfather i make a reasonable living im a reasonable intelligent person i bathe regularly so im pretty much a normal human being but from the time i left washington dc we couldnt eat i had only driven the road once before so i was following the map staying on the main road we couldnt stop and eat or sleep i wasnt really hungry i was just trying to get food for my kids i wasnt interested in socializing or rubbing elbows some negro entertainers try to show the whites that they are nice people all of us are nice people but the movement is not a popularity contest i dont care if the waitress likes me when i go into a restaurant all i want is something to eat i drove a pretty nice car had a few hundred bucks on melegal tenderbut i couldnt stop to eat or sleep i bet any russian you name from khrushchev on down would have had a nice trip to louisiana what can you tell a kid and a kid no one can justify this to me customs and traditions and all that junk one of the greatest crimes is apathy im kind of hardheaded youre either against me or for me being neutral you support the status quo you see this going on you say thats sad it really shouldnt be say it to a few people and it makes you feel better this is apathy all i ask is that you practice good citizenship vote and try to accept people for what they are as persons if you do that you give everyone an equal chance if you come to me and say youre not prejudiced youre lying i think all whites feel guilty but im not sure they know what they feel guilty about bill russells life is founded on the facts that he is black was poor and grew taller than most men he was born in monroe la and moved to oakland calif when he was when he was his mother died he was raised by his father when my mother died russell says my father was a young man and he could very easily have shipped me and my brother off with relatives but we stayed together it wasnt all good and it wasnt all bad some of the bad things that happened i have come to understand when youre poor its a different world my brother used to run track did the in thats not badand my father came out one day and raced him with work shoes on my brother says he won and my father says he won and i say it was a dead heat its not important the important thing was that my father got in the race i remember this field in louisiana where the grass grew very tall sometimes wed all play hide and seekthe four of usin that field when it was time to go in my father would pick me up with one arm pick up my brother with the other arm my mother got on his back and he ran us all the way home everybody had a great time although russell is just now entering his prime as a player he often ponders quitting basketball when i think about it he says there are a lot of things to con sider but it never has anything to do with quitting on top first of all im very much afraid of airplanes secondly the game takes a lot out of me i call it a ninehour game two hours getting mentally prepared two hours for the game itself and five hours before i get to sleep sometimes even then i cant get to sleep i feel that if i dont have a good game we will probably lose and it will be my fault during the playoffs its a hour game people say floyd patterson should quit i dont think so because hes not champion hes not a failure i think its false values if a guy feels he has to quit on top there are few enough pleasures in life not to do the thing you want to do one of the saddest things that has happened to me russell said the other day is that in basketball so many good things have happened to me its hard to get a real thrill any more you know what i get excited about nowwhen my kids say funny things or i get two new speakers for my stereo although i had a perfectly good system before that in russells home in reading a boston suburb he has installed a stereo systemhe has lp albums and who knows how many sand some worth of electric trains are in the basement recently his wife rose began displaying some of russells basketball trophies around the house if it was up to me id put them away again russell says as far as im concerned there should be no pictures of the man of the house in his home and no trophies outside achievements dont belong in a family setting but rose has her own ideas too shes the finest person i ever met ive told her many times that if i was married to anyone else i wouldnt be married its difficult to live with a person of my character im moody and demanding in some ways inconsiderate in other ways im a pretty nice guy i think when bill russell permits you to get to know him you discover quickly that he is more than just a pretty nice guy you discover a firstrate and rewarding person and when you are talking to him or listening to him or beating him in gin rummyhes no ace at that gameyou do not think of him as a basketball player or a giant or a negro finally but as someone it is worth your while to be with by charles lbrizzi recently a young negro singer in performing an excerpt from the negro folk opera porgy and bess substituted mommy for mammy in the lyric it was a subtle change perhaps barely discernible to some but make no mistake the singer was exemplifying a deliberate attempt on the part of an organized pressure group to viewpoint regulate any and all references to american negroes which exist in the fields of literature and the performing arts the national association for the advancement of colored people is to be commended for its original program adopted in which states in part to uplift the negro men and women of the country by securing for them the complete enjoyment of their rights as citizens justice in the courts and equal opportunity in every economic social and political endeavor in the united states is the cold calculated and often brutal editing of classical works the way to accomplish such a program in their cries for civil_rights negroes often also cry for an identity or heritage that they have lacked equal rights is true but that they lack a heritage is grossly untrue their heritage in this country began in the th century the very day their ancestors arrived their heritage is evident in the showboats of the mississippi the songs of the south the genius of a booker t washington and the minstrels that spanned a century and the breadth of the nation their heritage is evident in the mark twain works and the unique revival meetings that exist today yet these are the very things that are being attacked as unrealistic undignified distorted or degrading by far these accusations are unfounded in the fields of literature and performing arts who can truly say that twains cherished negro characters in his books of late th century life are unrealistic or that stephen fosters beloved old black joe is undignified where is the distorted view of the character joe in the jerome kernoscar hammerstein ii musical version of edna ferbers showboat or the degrading aspect of a firstrate negro song and dance man still some continue to criticize such things and attempt to have them partially or completely eliminated from the american scene apart from literary injustice to deny these things is to deny the very heritage they strive to locate if all minority groups in the united states attempted to change or eliminate entirely all references to their particular groups in literature or the performing arts on this basis then the world would have to forget forever the major works of harold arlen harry golden john steinbeck william faulkner the famous borscht circuit and all of americas dialecticians how utterly bland would be the american culture then pressure groups should cease this senseless purge and concentrate on the true problems negroes face in the country today by carene jenkins today is the dividend of yesterdays investment todays ambition and the time and energy we are willing to spend to make it pay there is no other time given to do todays job than today the past is a matter of record which me may look back on the future is still ahead of us and may be looked forward to but neither of these lessen todays importance for the past was met with its own circumstances and no future can give us todays opportunity whether or not we use today it will passso gradual we need not stop saying today but let us remember that in this same manner centuries have passed this should help us to realize todays importance the past belonged to those who met its challenge the future belongs to those who prepare to meet its challenge we owe it to the past to improve where it is needed and we owe the future todays worthwhile investment therefore as a summation of our heritage and our great hope our past and future today is ours the other enemycomplacency the freedom rides the fnnt freedom songs the i very a r f freedom and s ght f ltlg awaited dream enroute toward reality this comforts my heart and nourishes my soul but deep in my mind im troubled by the question i ask j so much has been written justifiably so about the inhumanity of white americans toward his black v brother and yet i see another enemy just as ruthless and as omni present as my oppressorthis enemy being that uncourageous contaminating stifling state of complacency characteristic of so many of my black brothers this despite the summer of discontent and the energetic efforts of dedicated leaders and faithful followers i see this state as a dwelling in dishonesty and i could only entitle one to adopt it if i were convinced that he would not associate himself as a part of the victory when it has come to past perhaps this motivates my protest i see the complacent as one yho is not truly unaware certainly vnot unable to grasp the scent of freedom and i believe he will find it humanly impossible to pretend not to share the spirit of overcoming when that day comes shining through the line of defense hed so boldly assert would most probably be what do you mean i dont care no this is not at all what i mean certainly he cares what i know of humanity makes it almost impossible for me to believe that an american negro could truly not care deep down inside he has to care but what makes one man complacent and another not the complacent one simply hasnt the courage to admit his care to express his concern and to face the reality of himself he lacks the strength to recognize and seek release from selfoppression and he must do so before he can contribute to the immobilization of his oppressors the complacent will ask why my pen attacks him instead of attacking my oppressor but does he not realize that he is a tool of the oppressor is he so unaware of the role he is playing as opposed to the role he could play i dont suggest that each of us should or could exert the bravery of martin luther king the dedication of james forman or the militancy of james baldwin but i do submit that these leaders depend on each of us for tfheir inspiration i further submit that our very manhood obligates us to support the cause that means o much to each of our lives since my initial exposure to the realities of our society ive harbored deep convictions about the plight of my people in although at a very tender age i was quite aware of the supreme court decision one might say ive grown along with our protest but with more exposure to this reality i was also forced to see this other enemy complacency i used to wonder when we as a people would act i long to see us unified and to see our leadership truly lead im grateful that much of this is factual today but yet i cant ignore the lingering complacent and ive found him to be shockingly present despite the thunder of an awakened people i returned to these united states during last crucial summer after spending the past year overseas as a member of the armed forces during this time i followed the news reading everything available and upon being discharged i returned to my hometown chicago with a heart rejoicing with the prospects of a unified people ive seen much to be proud of but i couldnt ignore the obvious chicago is probably quite representative of my people for if there exists a melting pot for negroes my hometown most certainly qualifies it didnt take long for me to gather the feeling of the people and though i salute many i have no qualms about my criticism of the others i speak of those who say were making a spectacle of ourselves were not really bad off james baldwin is just mad and statements similar to these i can only think of them as victims but i long to see them reached because such a thinking has for so long victimized my race we owe it to our unborn to be more realistic certainly i alone havent seen and heard these things and surely it disturbs many of us what must james forman feel when he walks the street the taste of a cell fresh in his mouth and comes face to face with complacency what hurt must the struggling although ailing roy wilkins feel when he is confronted with this most difficult of enemies though a negligible enemy perhaps in one man the force of an army when totaled i recall an incident that might have provoked or at least intensified my desire to speak out it occurred on thursday evening august the day after the beautiful march on washington on this evening i attended a core rally with the featured speaker being james baldwin there was a pretty good crowd of devoted negroes and awakened caucasians in attendance but among this crowd with the exception of one clergyman i saw not one person i knew i was bom in chicago my existence has in no way been sheltered i know many people but where were they where was just one of them on this evening just one day after the most touching event of my lifetime i was reassured that my convictions were justified i must have walked away that night compelled to write this article i wish it had not been necessary have i answered the question no this has not been my intention ive only presented it the answer lies in the hearts and souls of my brothers i only know that when i think of the progress made i think also of the progress that could be made it can be made i dont suggest that everyone should picket i dont prescribe the organization one should join and i dont pretend to symbolize the nobility of a negro i only know that there is a spiritual beauty in joining hands and singing we will overcome and i firmly believe we shall we have shared oppression and if we share the responsibilities our goals demand so much sooner will we share the victory there is honor in taking the side of righteousness our cause is right rise above your barricade and you wont regret it a middleclass negro said to me recently ive gotit made i cant believe a man has such a small appetite how dangerous complacency charles sumner yankee president johnson could use charles sumner in the united states senate today he was beaten unconscious to the senate floor by a south carolina congressman in for his fiery opposition to slavery he battled for the admission to the senate of a negro from mississippi in and won by a vote of to he pestered president abraham lincoln into issuing the emancipation proclamation converting the war between the states into a moral crusade to end the indignities heaped upon negroes in america a warweary lincoln once said resignedly sumner you are always six weeks ahead of me he demanded an end to racial segregation in the public schools of the district of columbia as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee in the lincoln administrations he guided through congress a treaty with great britain abolishing the slave trade he achieved the recognition of haiti and liberia as independent nations he secured fair employment for negroes in federal servicefirst as mail carriers for the post office department he fought the th amendment protecting negro suffrage on the grounds that it was unnecessary congress had the power he contended to enact a protective law without a constitutional change anything for human rights is constitutional there can be no state rights against human rights who was charles sumner you hear his name today only in the angry howls of southern segregationists who know an enemy when they hear of one you see his name only on the sumner tunnel under boston harbor but charles sumner was the united states senator from massachusetts from to succeeding daniel webster upon the latters appointment as secretary of state one hundred years ago at the risk of life and limb and his political future he was saying there can be but one liberty and one equality the same in boston and new orleans the same everywhere throughout the country to the negro people even then he was advising fight for full freedom now i trust that no excess of benevolence will make you consent to any postponement of those equal rights which are still refused stand firm the politicians will then know that you are in earnest and will no longer be trifled with victory will follow soon and the good cause be secure forever the civil_rights forces in congress today could use a man like charles sumner old jims yankee son you know dont you that jim crow has a blood relative living in other parts of the country yes this mr james s crow is old jims own son but if you should ever men tion old jim to him he would blush and vehemently deny any kinship whatsoever to the notorious jim crow and all of his friends without exception would warmly support him in his denial they would all forcefully assert that there is absolutely no family relationship between the two but old jim will tell you differently old jim is a southerner and proud of it granting that he was actually born in the north as a few people claim he was no one has ever yet accused him of being a damn yankee unquestionably he was nurtured in dixie where he grew up to become for many decades her undisputed ruler with his bedsheet horsewhip noose and shotgun and he dotingly looks forward to living there forever some observers say however that he is fast growing old and crochety others even state bluntly that he is already senile and that he has just about lived out his historically allotted time his characteristic reply to all such scurrilous and outrageous observations is a raucous roar of defiance and a tantrum of violence he loudly swears that he is still as capable and vigorous as ever yet deep in himself old jim realizes that he is not as popular as he used to be that his power and influence are rapidly declining and that his days are numbered naturally this all hurts himand irritates him his formerly complacent hauteur has now become nervous and defiantand reckless although he has more detractors and critics now than ever before he still has lots of friends and supporters he is very widely known at least by reputation not surprisingly if you understand the popular psychology he has admirers and supporters all over the countrynot just in the south and many who will no longer support him openly will gladly support him clandestinely his most articulate followers especially those in the south agree wholeheartedly with old jim that he is still able to do his work as well as he ever did if only those outside agitators would stay away and quit stirring up trouble everything was lovely they claim until these troublemakers invaded the magnolia groves according to a popular legend mr james s crow early fell out with his father over the question of racial segregation but old jim stoutly avers that he and his son never had any fundamental differences regarding a philosophy of life their differences he maintains always were and still are essentially differences of form rather than of purpose plainly the son thinks his father is unsophisticated and crudea back number and old jim for his part always ends any discussion of his son with the contemptuous snort hypocrite if you ask mr james s crow what his middle initial stands for he will invariably smile furtively and reply that it is only an initial but old jim will tell you bluntly that his sons middle name is segregationist mr james s crow who is not so provincial as his father maintains residence in the east north and west those who claim to know him intimately will tell you unqualifiedly that he even has an abiding ambition to establish a residence in the south some day when old jim becomes too decrepit to wield any significant influence and to take over the management of his fathers business and operate it along the same lines as his own in manners and appearance the crows are quite different brusque in manner old jim has never at least until recently given a tinkers damn about appearances in sharp contrast mr james s crow is iave and deeply concerned about appearancesespecially about apraances thats why so many people think there is definitely o kinshio between the two and mr james s crow is ever ready accentuate these contrasting superficialitiesand to call attention to them so he often excoriates old jim publicly yet observers who have closely followed the careers of both of them say unhesitatingly that mr james s crow is unquestionably a chipalbeit a polished oneoff the old block scratch beneath the surface they advise and you will discover the old jim crow in him instead of using old jims brute force and his unconstitutional state and local laws mr james s crow they claim seeks to substitute psychological conditioning and social manipulation to accomplish essentially the same endsde facto segregation and domination of course old jim invariably retaliates in kind and at length to his sons public abuse of him but in doing so he always unwittingly admits to his own execrable immorality by accusing his son of being equally as bad as he himself isand in many respects even worse old jim prides himself on his frankness says he never puts on airs he says if people dont like him as he is they can get the hell out of there and go back wherever they came fromor somewhere else people who are always carpin about him are just damned agitators and trouble makers anyway recently however many reports have been circulated falsely maliciously and slanderously according to old jim that his friends and supporters have successfully pressured him into sprucing up a bit when he knows that important yankee company is coming to dixie and now some scoffing jokesmith has garnished these reports with the story that old jim once tried using a little shaving lotion and hair oil on the slybut that he completely forgot the deodorant in marked contrast mr james s crow studiously observes the amenities of life and his grooming is impeccable these qualities together with his keen appreciation of the importance of good public relations give him the ability to make friends and influence people so like his aged father he also has numerous friends and supporters in all parts of the country many many more in fact than his father has in truth many of old jims former devotees who found it increasingly embarrassing to openly support him any longer in his mounting vituperation and violence have now turned to mr james s crow who has become the last best hope for the respectable people who seek to keep the substance of segregation but without its opprobrious name for mr james s crow moves always in an aura of accepted respectability he associates only with the best people and he has free access to the highest circles of finance commerce trade industry politics education communication and all other policymaking aspects of social life in this country through generally obliging news media he pays voluble lip service to the familiar and popular slogans of a democratic societyfreedom liberty equality fraternity mr james s crow is of course emphatically opposed to jim crows practices but he is warmly in favor of states rightswhich in practice means the rights of alabama and mississippi for example to disfranchise exploit degrade and terrorize certain citizens in order to maintain an old custom of segregation and domination he claims you cant legislate moralitybut strangely he never advocates repealing all the laws now in effect against such types of immorality as murder arson theft bribery slander prostitution and cruel treatment of children he says you cant change a venerable custom with lawsbut he is perfectly willing for the states to be permitted the right to use the law to bolster the cruel unconstitutional outmoded and crumbling customs of racial discrimination and segregation and he seems to have forgotten that the british successfully used laws to end the very highly valued old melanesian custom of headhunting mr james s crow says that property rights are basic to all other rights doesnt a person without any property still have some human rights by this he means specifically for example that a restaurant owner who had to get a permit before he could even construct a building on his own private land who had to construct the building in compliance with a city governments strict specifications who then had to be licensed by an agency of government to prepare and serve food to the public under certain specified regulations and who has to let a government agency inspect his property at willthis multiregulated property owner must now for the sake of the ultimate freedom and liberty of all of us be left unbridled and even be protected by the government in his inalienable right to freely use this otherwise highly regulated property to refuse service to any of the public that he was licensed to serveif he doesnt happen to like their complexion briefly mr james s crow and his supporters with their own immediate freedoms and liberties and profits and jobs and careers all apparently secure as long as the people are generally contented view this country as the best of all possible countriesand one that would soon be much better if the nigras would only be patient and quit rocking the boat in midstream our nigras you know have made wonderful progress during the last hundred years but would mr james s crow and his supporters be content with the negro peoples social status and their severely restricted civil_rights and liberties with their pay checks and their housing and their health educational and job opportunities oh of course not well it does make a difference doesnt it or does it a great deal it seems depends on whose ox is hobbled whose children are deprived anyhow in a nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal jim crow and mr james s crow are both comically and tragically anachronistic the words the facts and the future few negroes and fewer whites believe that our founding fathers thought of the negro for one minute when they framed our constitution in fact a number of nationality groups and races were not considered the freedomnow movement was not guilty of prejudice against the negro nor any other group and there was no oversight when the good men of the american revolution used the word men they meant men like themselves white anglosaxon protestants of course a few polish french and jews contributed to the revolutionary cause but their insignificant number at that time precluded any serious threat or any necessity of thinking of them as being unlike americans but back to the negro his survival during slavery and up to today depended on his ability to understand what the white man was saying and more importantly what he really meant by his words uncle toms shifty headscratching mumbling ways permitted him to survive without offending slave insurrections contumacious blacks and even docile ones were severely dealt with in order to avoid the appearance of offending the negro had to base his knowinga knowing on which his life depended upon something far more reliable than the word he heard spoken he learned to listen to the voice and how the word was spoken tonal patterns inflections and a host of nonverbal cues such as facial expressions movements of the hands arms legs and even ears in short he became sensitive to the whole man and not merely to the orderly procession of words from his masters mouth the slave also learned to delay response to feign confusion and misunderstanding his headscratching shuffling feet and squinting eyes placed the burden of continuing instruction or explanation upon the master and if the master talked long enough rephrasing restating and broadening the slave knew what he wanted with this knowledge he knew what role to play a safe answer was to tell his master what he already knew or what he wanted to hear the former a primitive nondirective therapeutic technique by fading into his environment as an innocuous at times troublesome but profitable child he survived and the white man was happy with his flattering image of his nigger perhaps never aware of being duped but if the master was aware of his slaves mask he preferred in all probability the ruse to the blackfaced humanity behind the mask the negro felt secure and triumphant his artifice his cunning and yes his intelligence bought another breath another day until today the mask also served the white master it heaped together with all the other convenient reasons was just one more proof of the negros difference inferiority subhumanness the mask also helped to allay the guilt that all good christians reportedly suffer when committing evil the nigger became a thing apart a thing unlike anything else and god willed it too to preserve this moral armor the master would have endured a hundred more masks rather than face the man behind the mask or himself to think this survival technique an unconscious one passed on from mother to child is to oversimplify the problem yet i can only suppose that this technique had its beginning on a nonconscious level i do know that it has worked its way into the conscious and still persists today among certain classes of negroes unfortunately this trait appears to have been learned for it does not seem to be present among the ninetofive ivyleagued negro what a pity it is not an inherited trait then both the black and white bigots could have a field day for the black bigots could claim this trait as a badge of superiority and the white ones as indisputable proof of inferiority but in the slums this awareness this defense is ingrained long before grimm if grimm ever makes it even today among some negroes the phrase read between the lines has great meaning or the injunction to the young when white folks talk you just listen and listen well then you know what to say most of the time you just dont know and i mean you dont know even when you do naturally as some negroes prove themselves by meeting certain middleclass standards such as becoming educated speaking properly presenting the proper emotional expression or lack of one attending the right church and viewing art as something separate and distinct from life they have become more sensitive to the literal meaning of words today the negros social perception is dull or he is ignoring the implicit statements of whites the young middleclass negro is demanding that all words regarding his life liberty and pursuit of happiness be explicitly stated he has renounced the understanding bought by the masterslave conspiracy for today the young negro is not motivated by sheer survival this he takes for granted since todays negro refuses to cooperate and wear the mask the white man is alone with his guilt his conscience and himself and he too often damns the negro all the more for causing him the inconvenience of changing his mind and facing himself this returns us to the constitution with all its promises the bill of rights making the world safe for democracy and on and on the young middleclass negro collegeeducated and all is just as surely shaped in the middleclass mold as though he were white and really believed that he could become president albeit in forty years unfortunately he doesnt believe that he can become president nor that all the slogans and sacred documents include him in their promises not even tomorrow he knows that in the north and south he is excluded in the north he is permitted to read these freedom words but told not now in the south until recently his best bet was to feign illiteracy the southerner knows what many white northerners are beginning to fear that to give an inch is to give all having been afforded a good christian education which teaches that every word has an exact meaning the young enlightened negro pushes for the literal rights which are synonymous with america many may explain this push for constitutional rights and the negros recognition of his dignity as a man by the rise of african nations educational achievement world war ii and other pulsations within the last ten to twenty years all of these conditions no doubt ripened the moment for the freedomnow movement but the negro also believes something else something far more advantageous and equally encouraging no american white would dare exclude him literally from his birthright it is this belief which has fired the rise momentum and contagion of the present drive for equality although ideally a christian country and prizing that image both the white man and negro know that christianity takes a back seat to the customs and meanness of the times but the negro believes that just as with democratic ideals the white man must have his word and his image even though they bear little resemblance to reality americas democratic armor now on display and for sale throughout the world is rarely supported by the lofty idealism usually it is supported out of fearthe fear that no group is safe in america if the literal meaning of the sacred words is changed for in spite of the myth about america being a melting pot america as everyone knows is a molding pot no man is safe who is too different and there are too many different groups who are momentarily resting from attack because now it is the negros hour now i know there are champions of the everythingisallrightwithamerica school im aware of the refrigerators collapsing houses and even aspirin consumption in this country im more aware of and indelibly impressed by what it is to be black in america for most negroes have heard the white mans comments i like negroes but jews i just cant stand them or the poor white trash are the lowest meanest things on the earth you just dont know them they just dont want to be any better ive cringed at the venom hate and utter subhumanness that have been dumped on the poor white trash perhaps whites cant accept the idea that even a white man can be poor and unlike the vaunted mold i dont know strangely ive found myself defending them knowing too well that their love for me is shorter than the hair on the bottom of my feet but it is this hate this need to hate that troubles me and more it sickens me making it impossible for me not to believe that hate and fear are the cement which binds americans too often i have heard whites malign the catholics italians polish and other nonanglosaxon protestants who cant quite disappear into the great molding pot and what is more revolting is to see the downtrodden of europe the starving the oppressed the persecutedbecome the oppressor and the persecutor and far too many of them do one generation from the hells of europe they now in best animalrioting form hurl their outrageous abuse at the negro moving on their street or sending his children to their neighborhood school the maddening yelps in these northern cities are biledup by these lovers of freedom these escapees from tyranny these goodbravehungarian freedomfighters and all the others who can now afford the luxury of tyranny and yet they are partially blameless for to become a good american and become acceptable in the middleclass mold you must hate niggers and these good people would become good americans even if it required duplicating belsen today with full knowledge that the american mood is not quite willing to accede to him his full rights the young american negro is pushing not the conscience but the literal meaning of the word captured in the declaration of independence other sacred documents and promises which symbolize america and propaganda beamed to the enslaved of the world to the crossroads either america admits him as a full citizen on a fulltime basis or else sweeps away the shortlived dream and marches him to the gas chamber if anyone has a right to be bitter and demand all now its the middleclass negro living on the fringe ofor in the suburbs consider his sacrifices he gave up the oldtime religion and jazz unless its progressive and can be intellectualized he has chained his feet and soldered his joints no part of him will ever again sway to the blues or the rhythms of the field hand he has become an observer of art and a patron of the arts watermelon is taboo especially if eaten in public he will forever deny himself greens corn bread chittlins now a delicacy sold in gourmet shops and a host of other downhome pleasures hes going to become a packageeating casseroleslopping tv dinner if it kills him which it wont but the negro isnt unique in his adaptation theres something in america which levels and destroys differences the second generation of the foreignborn quickly became ashamed of their parents accent they wanted to become americans everyone moves toward the great mystical goddess equalitarianism and what is her boon now that the negro has his turn maybe hell find out in the suburban neighborhoods in which the negro has gained a foothold he has moved with astonishing alacrity to become the best middleclass neighbor youve ever seen hes become a slave to lawns barbecue pits houses children and dogs a couple of years ago a white friend of mine had considered moving from his suburban commune while wavering and arguing with himself and everyone else negroes began moving into his suburb he thought a new life was coming to the community the infusion of vitality so he stayed a new life did come just like the whitebut black the negroes outdid the whites their love of lawns house and respectability was aweinspiring whites should welcome them into any community they soon become the standard after making such a sacrifice it is no wonder that the middleclass negro is bitter hes divested himself of everything familiar on the promise of finally making it his peculiar desperation will not permit him to go back to the poisonous past he has no choice but to demand his rights and to demand vehemently and what about the slums this summer i walked the streets of the northern ghetto the moods there are blacker than the faces you pass on the street the middleclass negro leaders especially those of status and years would like to slow down and arbitrate but if they do theyll have no sympathy from the ghetto for no one can count the ghetto among his following here in the beginning was the deed and not the word the instincts and perceptions of uncle tom are too strong white and black faces have used and misused the ghetto given promises and broken promises thought of them first before election and not at all after they know theyre alone the tired people of the ghetto have long since lost faith in the word especially all words which allude to justice here in the black slums police brutality is common and always officially justifiable ghetto eyes see prostitutes plying their trade on the streets and paying off in order to do so they see policy men and pimps making money by the fistful around the clock and coupled with all this they know the subtle prejudice of the north they know the norths solution to the negro problem containment welfare and sociological studies no the negro in the slum doesnt trust his black leadership they talk too much like the white leadership besides theres never been an intense drive to enlist his support he feels that hed be out of place with his black betters and he would the middleclass negro is reaching for the middleclass mold he cant hate all niggers but the least he can do to show good faith is to hate poor niggers the man from harlem or hough knows that all that is black is not good hes not sure that all that is white isnt evil but he has only his personal experiences to draw from so the slum negro listens to the naacp core and all the others but he says to them when do the jobs come what does this mean for me man eatin in a air terminal dont mean no big thing for me i cant even make it walkin so the young emancipated educated negro is confronted with the same problem hes black but it doesnt give him the edge he cant at this time communicate with the ghetto nor command a popular following he can attract only his kind he doesnt understand these blacks hes lost touch the young educated black may have sympathy from the slums he may have support if the end should comethe gas chambers for the negro in the ghetto looks for that day he neither sees nor believes in the conversion of white folks he doesnt hear the word when they promise the great change he doesnt believe that the new negro leaders can do any more to help him than the old ones in fact his plight and he knows it too well is tied up with the entire economic web of the country a negro speaks white folks without jobs you know aint none for me a black nationalist leader not muslim has been confronted with this problem time and time again the sheer logic and blatant reality of the unemployed black and white folks in this country are pushing this leader toward socialism not communism but to the ghetto these are more words and as the black nationalist said man my problem is translation if i come up with an economic setup how do i translate it and before that how do i get them to believe it you know translating an idea into a belief to those who complain that the negro needs to achieve more education and become more like the great mold his very injunction his patronizing advice will come home to shatter his suburban dream for it isand will continue to bethe young educated negro growing to manhood on the juice of hatred not oranges who in his frustration will burn the house that words built for he will meet the standards they arent that high he will meet everyone but the one implicit in all instructions he cant become white he will have listened and obeyed the literal word and with increasing rancor he will demand the reality of the literal promises white americans have no choice they must acknowledge his claim and grant him his literal birthright or if they dare they may destroy the sacred words that give rise to this black hope and by so doing make america safe for no one and each at that time will know his place and his end supposing the middleclass prepared acceptable negro is admitted to the molding club what then the negro in the slum will become as white trash something apart and hateful to all only god will be on his side and god speaks softly and carries a twig let us have a new american theatre from maine to mississippi witchcraft is unanimously condemned sometimes dealt with humorously as in john van drutens play bell book and candle sometimes seriously as in arthur millers the crucible not for several centuries has it been controversial men may smile or shake their heads ruefully in contemplation of mans inhumanity or pity not just the victims for their suffer ing but the persecutors for their stupidity how easy to judge the past how difficult to understand the present every era has its myths the middle ages accepted the myth of witchcraft the modern world has accepted the myth of race men of the sixteenth century did not simply believe in witchcraft they knew it the witches were there to see the nazis did not simply believe in aryan supremacy they knew it the jews were there to see millions of americans consider race not as belief but as fact the negroes are here to see in the wizard of oz the wizard gives green glasses to everyone in emerald city so that they may believe life to be prettier than it is american culture gives to many of us black and white glasses which obscure our vision of our fellow men after these general observations let us consider one result of this cultural mythology the position of negro actors in the american theater now it would seem that aesthetic people tend to be less racially biased than those whose values lie mainly in economics or politics yet such is the strength of culture that without intent or even awareness playwrights producers directors and fellow actors restrict negroes to comparatively few roles this situation prevails in all levels of our theaterprofessional university community and to a lesser extent secondary school a hypothetical example may illustrate the dilemma a high school dramatics coach plans to stage the old mysterythriller the cat and the canary white and negro students read for parts he casts a negro girl as the west indian voodoo woman a negro boy in the minor role of the doctor another negro boy in the bit part of the attendant from the lunatic asylum perhaps too he casts a negro as the lawyer in the first act liberal eh what who could possibly complain but someone does one of the negroes is obviously the most talented student in the cast why wasnt she cast as annabelle the leading role or if a boy in a major role as one of annabelles three cousins the thought never occurred to the director why because whites dont have negro cousins it wouldnt be realistic and after all the stage is supposed to reflect life that is a key phrase a fundamental assumption worthy of examination the theater is supposed to reflect life stunned by the protest the teacher asks the advice of his state department of education the department has a policy school dramatic productions are to ignore race if this means doing goodbye mr chips with a japanese chips and a mexican mrs chips all right professional theatrical practices are not to apply within school the teacher must adjust his casting though professional university and community theaters rely on the reflection of life assumption the practice has limitations it applies to appearance but not to name a theater patron scans his program at ocaseys the shadow of a gunman to find abe cooperstein cast as mr mulligan the landlord and tony romboli as mr maguire soldier of the ira conditioned by custom the patron enjoys their performances without weakening of the illusion that he is watching a play about irishmen i want to suggest that we reexamine our cultural conditioning that we consider color as we do nationality and as members of an audience ignore it the policy established in many schools should extend to all theater this involves not only social and humanitarian objectives but a relationship of greater integrity between audience and actor we would come to accept the negro or oriental in the role of mr mulligan or mr maguire as we now accept the jew or italian a man would be a man and we would look on him as such of course certain plays where the racial myth is a theme should be excepted porgy and bess the blacks a raisin in the sun deal with men as negroes and whites rather than as men some will reject the comparison of nationality and color on the grounds of a visual image the image however is mental not visual stemming from a misconception of acting and the actors purpose this confusion of the actor with the character portrayed has produced the emphasis on broadway as well as in hollywood on type casting a system fatal to the development of an actors capabilities who is the actor finally he is the character portrayed no longer himself we often hear that the actor must enter into the character not so the actor must bring the character into himself the fusion is an act of love and understanding the theater demands illusion it is pretense it is pretending along with art and music drama is one of the means man has devised to experience life the stage is a window into the human mind that of the playwright some now living have been privileged to see paul robeson play othello if othello why not hamlet why not caesar why not christ when we view the film version of julius caesar it is not james mason whom we should see as brutus but brutus as played by lames mason mason must believe he is brutus and we must share his belief william james said that habit explains most of our behavior in shakespeares day people watched men play womens parts there was a visual image as real as color today that would be unacceptable the time is here to discard habits based on outworn attitudes about mankind the integrated society emerging in america will be premised on a view of human nature which transcends the externals that separate us the ancient book maggie knew as did the rats that all the apartments of the condemned building were empty except hers and that of the old man and lady who lived on the second floor under her she had hid mandels gun when she first sensed that her face her body and her child were no longer novel to him and therefore no longer appealing it was as though the rats had waited for mandel to leave a lone woman and a baby in a crib would not frighten them the big woman sat beside the crib holding mandels automatic in one hand the other hand lay upon the heavy covers that covered the sleeping childs dark doubled body mandel would have known what to do she thought and she grew aware that that was why she had flirted with him took him fed and loved him the hollow crash of a door slammed shut by the december night wind multiplied itself as it bounced through the empty rooms and down the unlit hallways immediately afterward the scrape of claws upon the floor in the kitchen joined with the other noises in the a tall somber wabash avenue tenement four kerosene lamps one in each corner of the room set in motion peculiar moving shadows responding to the varying currents of the wind maggie pointed the gun at a shadow that moved quickly in and out of a circle of light across the room from one corner to the corner near her but it was gone before she could be sure of what it was another scrape of claws near the crib and maggie squeezed the babys stomach making him stir and whimper outside the snow had begun to fall and broken white lines sped past the window and lit by the street lamp on the corner below appeared to contain tiny little lights within themselves it was these flakes that reminded her that tomorrow would be december a holiday a gust of wind turned the kerosene light into her face lighting the white shawl around her head though barely lighting the deep brown of her wide flat nose or the fullness of her tightly pressed lips her small eyes slitted and seemed to be the only bright thing about her face as she glanced from one wall to the other hand rigidly about the heavy cold steel moving the with the sweep of her eyes it wouldnt have been so bad her voice comforted her if he hadnt awaited til christmas eve the silence following her voice brought about in a kind of delayed perception a realization that she without knowing it had been listening to the steady scrape of claws upon the floor not just one set but many the noise had stopped at the sound of her voice and it was the resultant silence that made her conscious of the fact that there had been such a sound mandel had shot a rat which had been perched right over the head of the babys bed he had promised to take maggie and fred jr away from merrydale arms right after the first of the year they had gone to bed talking about how things would be different from now on and she had loved him as though she really loved him she had not felt gratitude that night only love but on a christmas evetell somebody he cant take anymore she shoutedor rather the emptiness of the room made it seem as though she had shouted how bout me take it anymore i cant take it anymore then she paused and said very softly but i do perhaps it was the sound of defeat in her voice which gave the starving animals crouched along the edge of the wall the impulse to attack perhaps they had planned the attack to occur at this moment perhaps another hunger pain had hit the boldest of them and his forward charge had set the example for the others but for whatever motive or impulse it was that impelled them the rats ran from the corners and the edge of the wall toward maggie toward the crib the first one maggie saw came from directly in front of her where she had been staring so intently that her vision was no longer able to sort out real from imagined movement but now running in the full glow of the lamp light big black the rat left no doubt as to its existence or its intentions maggie leaped to her feet knocking backwards the chair in which she had been sitting the crash of the chair momentarily stopped the attack maggie fired the gun at the spot where she had last seen the rat naturally it was gone the sound of the shot drifted off into the rooms and soon merged with the sound of an l train that rushed its return load of christmas shoppers to their homes farther south maggie reached for the baby and snatched him covers and all out of the crib just as a rat appeared at the spot where mandel had shot the last one something tugged at the cover that dragged the floor and maggie pulled the hand holding the gun from under the babys warm body and shot in the dark at the dragging end of the sheet she ran to the door kicking her feet as she ran her foot collided with something soft and bulky a squeal and a thud she began hearing what seemed to be hundreds of squeals and squeaks she seemed to see hundreds of scurrying shadows at her feet from the corner of her eye she saw the crib spotted with quick moving fat figures she ran down the hallway feeling her way whenever the lights from the street did not penetrate the darkness now down the stairs past the old man and ladys apartment again she thought she felt something tugging at the covers that dragged along the floor again she shot at the dragging end the baby whined and twisted nearly causing her to drop him another flight of steps seemed to follow every flight she passed and the open apartment doors showed the windows beyond and snow piled upon the floor beneath the windows where the panes had been broken when maggie reached the bottom landing the light through the vestibule illuminated a high drift of snow in the hallway maggie running wildly squeezing the baby hard against her chest holding the gun with its muzzle pointed upwards straining for breath maggie martin fell over the dragging end of the babys covers and started a running fall down the hallway steps through the open hallway door she clutched the baby even tighter she dropped the gun she grabbed for the open door of a mailbox near the hallway door and it came off in her hands her legs seemed to have gone crazy and she had no time for thought or feeling nothing existed except the blur of a distant building a piece of sidewalk and her baby in her arms which was now not even a baby but a part of her self inseparable from the whole of herself she felt her arm wrap around a tree and she felt the bark cold and rough against her face it seemed to be the friendliest touch she had ever known she clung to the tree with one arm she lifted her face upwards into the snow she drew short deep breaths that turned into ice in her throat she looked at her baby and suddenly became afraid for it she snatched the covers away from it leaning heavily against the tree the light from the street lamps showed the brown chubby body distinctly the snow fell upon its face and bare arms and legs the baby squirmed and opened its eyes and closed them again as the snow fell into them then it cried loudly and maggie smiled faintly turning him over at the same time feeling his flesh for a break searching for a rat bite she found none the baby squirmed and shivered and cried out again and maggie seemingly just becoming aware of the snow and the cold looked about her as if to make sure that the snow was really falling she then threw the covers around the baby quickly and tucked them in at the ends and pulled her shawl over her head and started walking south towards thirtyfirst street every building from twentyseventh street where she lived to thirtyfirst street had been torn down now only a catholic school stood undestroyed on wabash another l train sped by and the blue sparks shot upwards from the track and vanished in the shower of thick watery snow it was not until she reached thirtieth and wabash that she realized she wore only a thin sweater and a skirt neither brassiere nor slip nor stockings the baby wriggled a little but she knew that at least it was warm a bus hurried eastward on thirtyfirst street inside the packages lay against the windows beside their owners somehow or other her eye caught a welldressed lady standing up as though preparing to get off at the next stop the lady held a baby in her arms and the baby was wrapped in a hooded comforter with a zipper in the front both the lady and the baby looked to be very warm the wind blew westward from lake michigan and the snow blew with it maggie bent forward pushing her head into the babys covers the sweater seemed like no sweater at all and her legs felt as though they were being sprayed with ice water a chill seeped into her body she trembled she could not stop her teeth from chattering the colder she got the tighter she hugged her child thinking that it too felt the freezing cold as she did but the child had closed its eyes and was breathing evenly as though certain that the jerking ride would soon end and that it had but to wait patiently until it could again lie in its warm bed and sleep undisturbed a blinking neon sign vague in the haze of the snow assured maggie that she had not much further to go she did not consider what was going on in the building beneath the sign she knew only that there was life there and that there were people there who would let her get warm and maybe let her stop until she could figure out what to dowhere to go a man stood in the doorway of the building trying to decide if the party at the tavern a block away was worth walking to in the harddriving wind and the wet snow to get to he decided that it was not and turned to go back into the crowded tavern when he saw a wide jumble of shadow tottering in the grey thickness near thirtyfirst and michigan he stared for a minute he saw no heavy flapping overcoat nor did he see a wind twisted hat or a fur collar what he did see made him squint in the slapping bitter snow to see more and as maggie approached him skirt blown hard against her fat thighs and full stomach sweater white in the white of the snow the man yelled inside the tavern lord in heaven theres a woman out here with no clothes on only one or two people heard his voice over the laughter and loud music but they a man in a fur collared storm coat and his companion a young girl prettily dressed in a leather coat ran to the door they caught sight of maggie just as she stopped at the tavern window and leaned heavily against it rubbing her wet face against the bundle in her arms the man who first saw her ran to her speaking with a drunk mans thick tongue girl what you doin out here in all this cold dont you know you goin to freeze to death the young girl in the leather coat reached for the baby is this a baby here let me take it maggie shook her head and held on to the child she pushed past the people around her into the brightly decorated crowded noisy bar the first man ran in front of her pushing the customers out of the way make room he shouted lets have some room for the lady and her baby this womans froze to death then he turned to maggie and almost touched her cheeks with his lips when he asked aint you baby maggie tried to smile at the man but her teeth would not stop chattering two people near her got up and walked out the bartender was at the other side of the bar pouring drinks for a party of four who had spent for a setup hey jim dandy bellowed the winereddened drunk come up this way jim dandy theres a lady who needs help the bartender looked down the bar and upon seeing maggie frowned and continued to pour the drinks for his party the juke box stopped playing and now no one put any more money in it one or two people walked from their booths in the back to take a look at maggie and the baby a man at the bar watched her through the wreathframed mirror behind the bar one dark brown lady wearing a high peaked black hat with a veil that flattened her nose giggled and turned up a shot glass and blurted black as she is its a wonder the snow fell on her her companion a lightskinned man in a narrowbrim blue hat protested mildly the blacker the berry the sweeter the the mans response became lost in the ensuing buzz the atmosphere changed from that of revelry to contemplativeness the bartender seeing that this woman was affecting the holiday spending by his customers stalked swiftly to the end of the bar where maggie stood wiping her babys face alright alright he shouted authoritatively whats going on here before maggie could answer him the bartender squinting through steamy glasses at mother and child said im sorry lady but no children are allowed in here then as if to make amends he took a bottle from the shelf behind him here ill give you a drink to warm up with the drunk protested what do you mean drink she needs help shes froze the bartender glared at him and then turned to maggie i said im sorry miss now the customers gathered around maggie and the bartender they turned their attention first to one then the other maggie felt as though she were surrounded by the rats again she wanted to run to the street into the snow into the iced nothingness that had lain before her before she saw the taverns neon light but she was too weak and frightened to run anyplace else tonight and she knew that whether the bartender knew it or not she would not leave this place of her own free will she would sit at the bar if she had toor in a booth or even in the ladies rest room but she would not leave she felt therefore that there was no need to say anything by way of explanation and anyway she thought while meeting the bartenders stare with a dull blank expression she could not have explained if she had wanted to she had not yet determined for herself what had happened to her bring me a drink jim dandy wheedled a woman who had gotten up to see maggie and who having seen her had gone back to her seat unmoved and thirsty the drunk grabbed jim dandys arm as the bartender turned to get the womans drink oh no you dont not yet aint you got someplace where she can spend the night aint you gon do something for this po woman and her child the bartender slapped the drunks hand away then he pointed his finger at maggie how come you pick me to mooch on i know you girls beg a quarter here and a quarter there preying on peoples sympathy to get money to buy wine he leaned over the bar and pointed the tip of his finger at maggies flat nose now if you dont git out of here quick im going to call the police on you somebody said that aint right to treat her like that somebody else said something ought to be done maggie looked around she caught sight of a door beside the ladies wash room she walked toward the door people made room for her she squeezed past the table and chairs in the middle of the floor if people were talking before she reached them they stopped when she came near resuming their conversations when she passed she passed an old man at a booth near the ladies toilet his hat was tilted far down across his face and he kept his head bent low she could feel the cold exuding from him as she passed and she thought that perhaps he had sneaked in just as she had and was trying to remain inconspicuous long enough to get warm and to figureperhaps as she had to dowhat to do next no one tried to stop her as she opened the door to the room and found it to be a tiny boiler room with a dim light bulb near the furnace a wooden pop bottle case stood against a wall near the low glowing burner she shut the door behind her and sat on the case and began to unwrap the baby the baby was cold she rubbed its body gently she watched her hand as she rubbed him and she watched his eyes as they stared up into hers his face was solemn and his eyes were bright he seemed neither afraid nor uncomfortable no one came into the boiler room she heard a scraping sound and immediately felt the bundle for the gun she did not remember that she had dropped it she stared at the spot where something big and low moved it was a cat she smiled at it the fire warmed her and the glow through the grating looked pretty upon her babys tiny figure already the baby was asleep she lay her head against fred jr and closed her eyes outside the juke box started up again and the talking grew loud again and soon someone laughed loud and the clinking of bottles increased she did not hear the door open but when she looked up she saw the old man she had passed standing in the doorway miss please dont be scared maggie started to stand the man took his hat off she sat down miss i know you aint gon believe me but i know you maggie pulled her shawl away from her head her short hair pressed flat about the curve of her skull the light from the furnace darkened the shadows of her nostrils and the ridge above her lips the fullness of her face blended with the fullness of her body and a little spot of orange light touched her here and there as in a painting the man stepped toward her maggie did not move he shut the door behind him and looked around as though afraid that someone might see what he drew from his heavy rag of a coat this book is from before the bible the man smelled of burnt wood as though he had spent the evening before an open fire i am the direct kin of an african chief the old mans face was white with whiskers about the chin and eyes his flesh was dull and wrinkled and it did not shine when the firelight touched it his voice was rough even though he whispered and it seemed deeper than any voice maggie had ever heard he stopped beside maggie you not from this townare you maggie softly no the old man laid his hat on the floor you dont know where you fromdo you maggie looked away from the man at her baby you aint got no husbandis you well i did kind of no the man stood the book at his hands hung at his side girl you a princess your kin was the most high ruler of the original ghana your great great great great grandfather was the living god to his people and all who saw him praised his name in this book the old man looked around him again then turned to maggie is the history of your people girl know who you are read this book it will make you free it will change your life girl maggie stared at the man she stared at the book it was bound in plain brown paper the surface of the book looked as though it had been put together with flour paste it was wrinkled and smudgy the man turned the inside of the book to maggie she saw pictures of dark people standing tall and straight some held spears in their hands the man turned the page of the book and there was a fullsized picture of a man sitting upon a stool holding a scepter above several kneeling dark people maggie reached for the book the man drew it away ill give it to you for two dollars maggie said i got a dollar to my name the man looked around again and whispered give me the dollar you wont regret it your life will change i know what im talking about maggie looked at the baby he was asleep she wondered where she would go tomorrow one thing was certain she would not go back to merrydale arms she wondered what she would eat what the baby would eat she reached underneath her sweater and unpinned the dollar that lay against her breast she handed the dollar to the old man well there aint much i can do with a dollar anyway you wont regret it miss you wont regret it he handed her the book and turned quickly and rushed out of the room maggie opened the book there were kings in it there were warriors there were great structures she recognized as the pyramids of egypt in small letters at the bottom of the flyleaf of the book was printed in small letters copyright published by the south state book store south state street chicago illinois maggie smiled she hoped the old man would buy a meal with her dollar at first she read silently moving her lips as she did she hardly noticed when she began reading aloud although she glanced often at fred jr as she read from a land far away three travels came seeking the ashanti child who would rule great africa as his father did desire for many days and nights they did travel and it was over an humble place that they saw a bright star shining and they came to that place there they found the black prince maggie read the words until she could no longer keep her eyes open then she fell asleep she did not see the door open again as she slept leaning against the wall near the furnace she could not feel the hand of the young girl who slipped the hatcollected cluster of bills down her bosom neither did she see the drunk stare at her with the oddest kind of resolution upon his face somewhere outside the boiler room a clock struck twelve and the customers stoodtheir backs to the barstaring through the open door at the fat dark woman and her child touched lightly by the orange glow from the fire were adam and eve black were adam and eve black they must have been according to the laws of heredity held today gregor mendel an augustinian monk discovered the mendelian laws of heredity by crossbreeding colored and white flowers he discovered that red flowers might produce white or red flowers red and white flowers would produce red and white flowers but white flowers could only produce white flowers the absence of a quality he called a recessive characteristic the presence of a quality he called the dominant characteristic thus whiteness would be the recessive characteristic since it could not produce that which it did not have viz color so blueeyed parents may only have blueeyed children for blue eyes is a recessive characteristic it only shows that there is less black pigment on a white background and black whiskers on a white background give an impression of blueness since parents lacking pigment cannot have children with more pigment it appears that our first parents were black by arthur m brandel no matter how easy n v or difficult it may be to find a job the real problems for the per son holding only a high school diploma begin when he starts working he must appreciate what his prospects are not immediately but in the next decade and how he can make them come out best for himself is it so hard to think of the next ten years you will be in your late twenties you will probably have voted in a presidential election you may have done a tour of duty in the armed forces there is a good possibility you will have married and have started a family ten years are really not so many are you ready the high school diploma that enabled you to get the job is a license a license to acquire knowledge the future belongs to those who know their work well and can learn with changing times and needs within the next six or seven years the labor market will require more than two and a half million more skilled workers than were required two or three years ago in addition replacements will need to be found for another million persons who will transfer to other occupations retire or die the national economy will therefore be looking for million able young people to apply their intelligence and skills to produce machines build homes and highways and keep america moving the opportunities are as boundless and far reaching as the solar system rapidly growing new technologies will create opportunities unknown today like group photographs statistics can be awfully boring unless you are in them certain occupations within the skilled worker group have grown faster in recent years than have others and will continue to grow faster there are career guides pinpointing these check your schools guidance counselor for information he may have as a general thing however you should know that the job outlook for skilled workers is currently bright growth in the number of skilled workers in the to year bracket has been declining lately this means that increasing numbers of skilled workers must be furnished by younger age groups and opportunities for the high school graduate under are exceedingly good provided that he plans well and gets himself good training in his skill the importance of the skilled worker has been overlooked to some extent in recent years because of the attention focused on professionals such as engineers and scientists but a basic fact of life in the workaday world is more true today than ever before the work of engineers scientists executives and many other professionals would be barren without skilled workers to give their ideas and plans form and substance these are among the more important reasons why this is the era of the specialist and organization man a skilled worker technician or artisan prepares for the future at trade schools in special technical courses or in an apprenticeship building a sound foundation for his career in these ways may take some time really getting established in a skill may take longer yet and as in all kinds of work there are sometimes tough choices to make for example the matter of a union may be crucial to your choice of a skill some unions encourage the development of young workers others do not but while it may be harder to get into x union than into y union x union may have been able to keep wages higher in its industry than y union has done in its field this and other factors are things that the young skilled worker has to take into account it would be wise for him to do a good bit of checking into the job career and advancement opportunities in the several fields that may interest him before committing himself too firmly to a specific skill field one of the best skillslearning places going today is the armed forces so specialized are the skills required in the modem military force that the soldier sailor or airman is often more technician than warrior in the armed forces you can learn how to handle everything from a bulldozer to a battlewagon you still have to go through basic training but once thats past you have a chance at a great variety of technical training schools skills learned in the armed forces often pay handsomely when youre back in civilian clothes radar specialists mechanics electronics experts construction men computer programmers and operators often join firms that have government contracts many opportunities exist also in the civilian side of government pay is generally good theres job security and government work is nowadays so vast and varied that opportunity for advancement is almost invariably available in determining a career examine the future of law enforcement men and women fingerprint and ballistics experts are crucial members of todays mechanized and specialized army of law enforcers so too is the modern policeman the modern fireman any office manager in the united states can tell girls fervently of the need for competent trained knowledgeable secretaries and other office assistants special plea here please get on speaking terms with the english language if secretarial work is what you want high school graduates are in particular demand by utilities and communications companies new systems being installed have increased the employment needs of telephone companies new billing methods and accounting procedures have put a premium on competent young help in virtually every publicserving corporation moreover these companies are among the leading offerers of onthejob training the field of merchandising remains in many ways the most promising of all the field is more demanding now in skills training and knowledge of the public than it once was but the high school graduate who is smart aggressive and imaginative can cover a lot of ground and rise very high although the beginning in this highly competitive field may sometimes look not very promising the population of the united states is increasing by million persons a year new supermarkets and suburban branches of department stores will continue to be built and theyll all need good managers good sales and service representatives good display technicians good buyers around the supermarkets and store branches will be more houses to build sell and service and more people whose living and recreational needs will require competent service representatives a final note on a skill field increasingly overlooked these days farming as everyone knows there are fewer farmers every year as the american migration to the city continues but americans have to eat and farmers raise much of what comes to their tables the modern farmer runs a highly technical operation in which a lot of money is tied up he has to be a skilled manager mechanic gardener animal husbandman all in one he can be very successful and as one of the few really independent artisans left he can know satisfactions oftentimes denied to his coginthewheel fellow artisans of city and suburb where can you find specific information about opportunities and openings in skills fields one excellent resource is your local office of the united states employment service industry personnel offices can help you community county and state offices often have employment counseling and service aids private service organizations such as ymca can often help and so can unions state universities and colleges and church groups dont be shy about checking out possible information sources you are going to be someone of firstclass importance to the future of the united statesa builder mover and maintainer you owe it to yourself and the thousands you will serve to be in work you like and to be good at that work have you ever attended the dedication of a bridge the launching of a ship the opening of a new building on such occasions the designers engineers and architects publicly thank the skilled workers without whose knowledge training and ability nothing more than drawing board designs could have been achieved you are setting sights on the day when you too will be so honored the american racial puzzle can be solved it has occurred to me only recently that perhaps the most striking development in the south is not that the process of desegregation is under way but that the mystique with which americans have always surrounded the south is beginning to vanish driving into atlanta in a heavy rain one hot august night six and a half years ago my wife and two small children waking up to watch the shimmering wet lights on ponce de leon avenue i was as immersed in this mystique as anyone else for the last full day of driving the talk and the look of people were different the trees and fields seemed different the air itself smelled different this was the mysterious and terrible south the deep south soaked in blood and history of which faulkner wrote and margaret mitchell and wilbur j cash white atlanta had been ravaged and still knew it negroes had been slaves and still remembered it northerners were strangers no matter how long they stayed and would never forget it there was something about atlanta about georgia the carolinas that marked them off as with a giant cleaver from the rest of the nation the sun was hotter the soil was redder the people blacker and whiter the air sweeter heavier but beyond the physical beyond the strange look and smell of this country was something more that went back to cotton and slavery stretching into history as far as anyone could rememberan invisible mist over the entire deep south distorting justice blurring perspective and most of all indissoluble by reason it is six and a half years later i have lived these years inside what is often thought to be the womb of the souths mystery the negro community of the deep south my time has been spent mostly with the warm and lovely girls in my classes at spelman but also with the earnest young men across the street at morehouse with the strangely mixed faculties of the negro colleges the white and the dark the silent and the angry the conservative and the radical with the black bourgeoisie of college presidents and business executives with the poor negro families in frame houses across the street and their children playing with ours on the campus grass from this i have been able to wander out into the glare of the white south or cross into those tiny circles of shadow out of sight where people of several colors meet and touch as human beings inside the tranquil eye of the hurricane the southern mystique hovered nearby even on yellow spring afternoons when we talked quietly to one another in the classroom at times it grew suddenly dense fierce asphyxiating my students and i were ordered out of the gallery of the georgia general assembly the speaker of the house shouting hoarsely at us one nightmarish winter evening i was arrested and put behind bars hundreds of us marched one day toward the state capitol where helmeted soldiers with rifles and gas masks waited a dozen of us sat in at a department store cafeteria silent as the manager dimmed the lights closed the counter and ordered chairs piled on top of tables all around i drove four hours south to the black belt country of albany georgia to call through a barbed wire fence surrounding the county jail to a student of mine who was invisible beyond a wire mesh window it was in albany also that i sat in the office of the sheriff of dougherty county who a month before had given a bloody beating with a cane to a young negro lawyer and nowhere was the mystique so real so enveloping as on a dirt road in the dusk deep in the cotton and peanut land of lee county georgia where justice and reason had never been and where the night before bullets had ripped into a farmhouse belonging to negro farmer james mays and exploded around the heads of sleeping children and yet i can say now after living intensely in the deep south in exactly those six years when the south itself has lived most intensely that the mystique is dissolving for me and for others the south is still the most terrible place in america because it is it is filled with heroes the south is monstrous and marvelous at the same time every cliche ever uttered about the south every stereotype attached to its people white and negro is true a thousand other characteristics complex and subtle are also true the south has not lost its fascination but it is no longer mysterious and i want to explain this by talking about those two groups who have been at the center of this mystery the whites and the negroes of the deep south although the darkness of the negro physically suggests mystery it is the white southerner oddly enough who has been presented as the great national enigma this despite the whiteness of his skin against which flaws and blemishes show up more easily a whiteness unsullied by that admixture of slavic and latin blood found in the north and kept homogeneous by the simple expedient of tossing over the wall in the night all offspring from blackwhite sexual encounter the mystery of the white southerner comes from a trait that he is presumed to possess in quantity and quality sharply distinct from everyone else and deepinthebone compared to the obvious difference of the negro that trait is race prejudice other white people it is acknowledged are colorbiased there is considered to be however something special about the quality of the white southerners prejudice the yankee is rather businesslike in his matteroffact exclusion of the negro from certain spheres of ordinary living the british imperialist was haughty and sure of himself but the violence the passion the murderous quality of the white southerners feeling against the negro has become a canon of american thought deep in our consciousness and our literature and of european literature see sartres la putain respectueuse and what is more significant while the outward signs of this prejudice are clear enough at its core at the why of this crazy feeling is a mystery when reporter john bartlow martin wrote right after the supreme court decision the deep south says nevercentral to the books thesis was the implication of some ineradicable mystical hatred so deep and so invisible in the white southerner that no blasts of social change could touch it when i had lived a year or so in the deep south talking to and living next door to the same white people described by the author of that book i began to suspect he was wrong six years later i knew he was prejudice discrimination race hatred are real problems to the point of viciousness even murder but their mystery for those who will look hard is gone i will not tangle with cause because once you acknowledge cause as the core of a problem you have built something into it that not only baffles people but worse immobilizes them causation is not merely complexit may be impossible of solution as some of the new philosophers say one of those metaphysical conundrums created by our own disposition to set verbal obstacles between ourselves and reality why not ignore cause as a general philosophical problem and concentrate on result the point is devilishly irreverently simple if you can get a desired result the mystery is gone stop fumbling with the cause of prejudice except for those aspects on which we can operate a physicist may still not know what really is behind the transformation of matter into energy but if he has figured out how to release this energy his achievement is stupendous atlanta is in the deep south atlanta has as many crackpots kkk sympathizers country woolhats white supremacists barbershop lynchers vicious policemen as any southern city if the deep south said never atlanta too said never in it was tightly segregated by the buses had desegregated so had the public libraries the rails and bus terminals a number of theaters and restaurants downtown the department store cafeterias the opera the municipal auditorium the legitimate theater the public schools the colleges public and private several hotels the plainclothes squad of the police department the fire department the baseball team the tennis courts the parks the golf courses the chamber of commerce several professional organizations the county committee of the democratic party and even the senate of the georgia general assembly now that it is all done there are obvious reasons which can be advanced with great casualness a flexible city administration a layer of negro intellectuals a determined student movement a band of white liberals giving cosmopolitan salting to the countrystyle talmadge ham but none of this takes account of the fact that all the above forces are a minority of the population that most of atlantas population the overwhelming majority of its white people still consider negroes inferior and prefer a segregated society and that these people were numerous enough to have prevented most of the changeby riot by election by boycottif they cared enough they stood by passively and accepted with the puniest of resistance a series of fundamental changes in the sociolegal structure of the city there is then a key to the traditionally mysterious vault of prejudice locked inside the mind of the white southerner he cares but not enough or to put it another way while he cares about segrega tion there are things he cares about more the white southerner has a hierarchy of desires in which many other things are rated higher than segregation monetary profit political power staying out of jail the approval of ones immediate peers conforming to the dominant decision of the community desegregation has come in varying degrees to atlanta and a hundred other places in the deep south in the face of persistent antinegro feelings in the community simply because one or another of these desires which stand higher in the southerners valuescheme was threatened if he did not surrender except as an academic exercise there is no need then to probe the fog that inescapably shrouds the philosophical question of causation in race prejudice what needs to be done is to decide for each group of whites in the community which value is more important and to plan a web of multiple tacticsnegotiation boycott lawsuit voting demonstrationthat will effectively appeal to these priorities in a rough semiconscious way the actions of the federal courts and of negro leaders in the south have aimed at this a more deliberate use of the hierarchyofvalue concept would bring even more dramatic results the white man in the south is subject to the same simplicities and the same complexities that surround the human species of any color any place he has certain biological needs which he will try to satisfy whichever way he can on top of this he has other wants which he has learned from his cultureand because these often conflict with one another he has an unconscious set of priorities that enables him to make choices he is subject to economic pressure and ambition also if jungian theory is correct and the notions of modern role psychology valid and i believe they are he needs approval from certain people around him and seeks to play out the role society has cast him in beyond all this as beyond all the frontiers of human knowledge there is mystery in the behaviour of the human animal but its time to clear from our minds that artificial and special mystique so firmly attached to the southern white that has too long served as a rationale for pessimism and inaction but what of the black manor woman there is a strange and damnable unanimity of segregationists white liberals and negroes on one fervent beliefthe mystery of negritudethe irreducible kernel after all sociological peelings of race difference the segregationist white citizen or black muslim shouts this in all directions the white liberal is subtle sophisticated and ingenious in the various ways he can express thishe sweetens it with sympathy or admiration or affectionhe delights in the sheer thrill of a mystery he cherishes it as a secret shared with his fellow liberals yes yeswe can never know what it is to be a negro no nothey will never trust a white man and we cant blame them the negro robbed of other protection clings to it plays with it turns it to his advantage when he can even the most perceptive of his literary leaders baldwin ellison use it in cunning or in pride and all of them white liberal and negro intellectual fondle it nurture it as men having subdued a forest fire might play with the last flames too fascinated even in the midst of peril to put them out for good physical difference is so gross a stimulus to human beings cursed as they are by the gift of vision that once it is latched onto as explanation for difference in personality intelligence demeanor it is terribly difficult to put aside it becomes an easy substitute for the immensely difficult job of explaining personal and social behavior conservatives use it openly liberals secretly even unknowingly it seems to be the hardest thing in the world to convince ourselves that once weve noted skin color facial features and hair texture we have exhausted the subject of racethat everything beyond that is in our heads put there by others and kept there by ourselves and all the brutal material consequences of centuries from lynching to patronizing friendship were spun from an original thread of falsehood the most vicious thing about segregationmore deadly than its immediate denial of certain goods and servicesis its perpetuation of the mystery of racial difference because there is a magical and omnipotent dispeller of the mystery it is contact contactbut it must be massive unlike those integrated situations in the north and it must be equal thus excluding maidlady relationships of the southdestroys the manmade link between physical differences and behavior explanation race consciousness is hollow its formidablelooking exterior is membranethin and is worn away by simple acts of touch the touching of human beings in contact that is massive equal and prolonged the brightness of the physical difference is relative it stands out in that darkness created by segregated living and is quickly lost in the galaxy of sense impressions that come from being with a person dayin dayout in our country the kind of contact that rubs away race consciousness is possible only in rare places and intermittently but it exists in scattered underground pockets of resistance to the norm one of them is the negro college where white people can become so immersed in a negro environment that they are oblivious at least temporarily of race the fact that they live on an island against which waves of prejudice roll from time to time means that they slide back and forth from overconsciousness on some days to a blissful racial amnesia on others a white student after several months of living eating studying playing in a totally negro college environment visited a nearby white college and returned saying how pallid they all seemedall those white faces and sharp noses this is a startling example of race consciousness in reverse but it is encouraging to see how quickly one can change the temper of racial awareness by an inundation of sense experiences once the superficiality of the physical is penetrated and seen for what it is the puzzle of race loses itself in whatever puzzle there is to human behavior in general once you begin to look in human clash for explanations other than race they suddenly become visible and even where they remain out of sight it is comforting to know that these nonracial explanations exist as disease began to lose its eeriness with the discovery of bacteria although the specific problem of identifying each bacterial group remained so long as evil existsand it exists in poisonous heaps south and norththe raw material for mystery is here we can make the most if we want toof white mobs in oxford mass negro indignation in albany blazing churches in birmingham gunfire on rural porches and the sheer wonder of blackness and whiteness but the specialness of the southern mystique vanishes when one sees that whites and negroes behave only like human beings that the south is but a distorted mirror image of the north and that we are powerful enough today and free enoughto retain only as much of the past we want we are all magicians we created the mystery of the south and we can dissolve it howard u conference last november cv it v many of the nations leading advocates of civil_rights and racial equality gathered at howard university for a twoday conference on youth nonviolence and social change the parley was called by the gandhi memorial lecture committee at howard headed by professor flemmie p kittrell and represented an expansion of the annual lecture series which commemorates the late indian leader the program was financed in part by grants from the gandhi society for human rights and the taraknath das foundation both of new york city the purpose of the conference was to inquire into the impact of the nonviolent movement to date upon the individual and the community with special reference to youth participating in the discussions were youth who are involved in nonviolent direct action civil_rights movements psychiatrists lawyers social scientists and the leaders of ational organizations whose primary purpose is the attainment of equal opportunities author james baldwin also was a participant from the welcoming remarks by president nabrit on the morning of november to the gandhi memorial lecture by the rev dr martin_luther_king which closed the conference on the evening of the following day the several oncampus sites used for the talks were filled to capacity the results of the parley were pretty much as expected there was unanimous agreement that the civil_rights movement should continue there were varying opinions on the techniques to be employed however excerpts from the remarks of the several speakers appear on the pages which follow space limitations have necessitated the use of only brief abstractions it seems that this is both the time and the place for a conference on youth nonviolence and social change this is the centennial of the emancipation proclamation which assures us of physical freedom but the vestiges of the slave system have remained to plague us from the days of slavery down to this day and we are not yet free revolutionary changes are taking place all over the world and america has not escaped this common lot a great many of us are not able to live up to the requirements of this movement which call not only for courage but also for an inner discipline and selfcontrol in the face of great provocation therefore it seems wise to me that we should take this time to look at the anatomy and the impact of one of the great forces in our time the nonviolent movement it also seems that this is a proper time in which to examine the impact of nonviolence because of the increasing intensity of the struggle which the negro is making to achieve firstclass status in our country for many years we have witnessed this struggle in the schools in the courts in our institutions and lately we have seen it transplanted into the streets in the highways and into our business and commercial establishments it is also occurring in our unions and our organizations and as the intensity of the struggle increases opposition mounts so that when we look at the nonviolent movement which is one of the powerful forces in this struggle we do indeed serve our time we welcome you to howard university an institution that has attempted during these many years to aid in theory and in fact in the struggle for freedom we hope your stay at howard will be comfortable and pleasant but above all we hope that from this conference shall come a renewed determination to continue to struggle on every front until we have achieved freedom to those who would divide us because all of us do not think in the same way and to those who would discourage us because all of us do not align ourselves behind any one social force i could remind them of the words of the poet who said if a man does not keep pace with his companion perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer let him step to the music he hears may we do that and may your conference be a success how much provocation can a nonviolent fighter take before he breaks out into violence or if he can hold himself in check during the campaign is he more prone to become violent afterwards nonviolent fighters characteristically master their angry feelings through adhering to a religious philosophy that preaches the ultimate supremacy of love and the redemptive power of suffering does this limit the successful use of nonviolent methods to those who hold this philosophy the hardest questions arise from the fact that to date nonviolent campaigns have all been waged in a context of violence the threat of violence has always lurked in the wings although the primary aim in human combat is to change the opponents mind to make him submit to your will one cannot deny that threatening him with bodily harm is a very effective way of doing this and if you kill him you no longer have to worry about what he thinks so far only groups that believe that they cannot hope to win by violence have adhered to nonviolent tactics however these nonviolent movements could potentially mobilize superior violence on their side the leaders of nonviolent movements constantly remind their opponents that if their demands are not met they may not be able to keep their followers in check is the threat of violence an integral part of the success of nonviolence can nonviolent campaigns succeed in the complete absence of this threat if not are they truly nonviolent dr nelson among the qualities inherent in genuine nonviolent protest is a belief in the persuasive even compelling power of selfsuffering this may be a high price for the end that is sought but what choice remains when persuasion the courts the ballot have failed resort to this kind of soul force has two justifications one is a belief that as the means so must the end be means and ends must be seen as convertible on the belief that to take care of the means is to guarantee the ultimate achievement of the end there is of course the alternative of violence which also is not without its price violence eschewed there remains the pitting of ones spirit against the hardness of the offender of ones whole soul against anothers will we who want genuine enduring freedom why must we look for it to spring from the seed of violence rather than from the seed of kindness a good rule for the participants in any movement of nonviolent resistance is to bear in mind that they are not saints fighting devils they are the aggrieved struggling against the authors of their grievances i would suggest then in relation to nonviolence as a technique that the nonviolent act of a man which outruns in goodness his convictions is still better than a violent act i suggest that the continued doing of good which exceeds ones moral convictions can lead to the making of a better man we must still concede that this as a mere technique is an uncertain foundation upon which to build a good and happy society mr baldwin one could hope in this country for a level of cognizance able to envision a world in which quarrels can be settled in some way other than they have been settled in the past i think the situation of the negro proves the obsolescence of the notion of violence however i cannot help but wonder how long we can endure what is happening to us and not fight back particularly in situations where it is a matter of selfdefense i have found a great number of young people who would think nothing of picking up arms tomorrow on the other hand i see in this danger this terrible confrontation an opportunity for good an opportunity not only to liberate this country but perhaps an opportunity to change the world it is very clear to me in any case that if we were not involved in the cold war or the nuclear race we could liberate a vast amount of our money and energy and begin to change our cities our negroes in them and the white people too it is a question of misplaced energy mr coffin nonviolence as we have seen it in america does not so much change the segregationist as it does the enemy the enemy is no longer the negro the enemy is now violence it is at this point that the moderates come out of the woodwork and begin to moderate they moderate not on the grounds of integration not on any moral ground but on the very pragmatic grounds of law and order the avoidance of violence our societys first concern is not to establish justice is not to grant freedom to individual members but simply to offset chaos by establishing order it is one thing to say that justice rolls on like mighty waters but it is another thing to work out an irrigation system fear is more influential than moral persuasion fear of irresponsible negroes is having a greater effect on the white segregationist community than conversion by people like mr farmer mr farmer one of the problems that we will have to work with is how to control and discipline a mass movement to maintain nonviolence how to do it especially when it is a movement based upon a tactic upon a method upon a technique rather than upon a philosophy or a way of life we concentrate now on setting up institutes workshops and sessions to train masses of people we must train monitors who will be skilled to spot trouble isolate it move the demonstrators on before violence has had an opportunity to wreck the demonstration this must be done quickly otherwise it will deteriorate into a violent revolution there is a peculiar situation here in america demonstrators in the south can affect the conscience of the north but demonstrators in the north have difficulty affecting the consciences of northerners i find that the movement has been more successful where it has been able to affect the consciences of persons i am firmly convinced that the nonviolent movement must be a combination of an appeal to the conscience and the old trade union tactic of hurting the pocketbook we must do this in a more professional manner than we have done in the past dr fishman nonviolent demonstrations have had an interesting paradoxical effect on the one hand the white liberal is enthused and entranced at the image of the morally dedicated brave young negroes risking their lives on behalf of a moral principle the white liberal perhaps has become too much involved in the issue of nonviolence and too little involved in the issue of rights nonviolence in this sense has perhaps had a similar effect on our government if in the long run our government continues to be ruled by political power and concerned with what is politically pragmatic and politically possible then nonviolence may represent an easy out for the politician it represents for him a way of ducking the whole issue so long as he can keep the negro placated with promises extenuations talk about political pragmatism talk about what is politcally possible and hope that the reverend king and the other negro leaders may be able to keep the negro community in check and keep them nonviolent the political leader has a perfect out he can spend his time maintaining his own power and not giving in to the basic issues of freedom and rights sociological and psychological aspects dr edwards nonviolence in its pristine form is more than resistance in nonviolent terms as conceptualised by gandhi it converts the adversary through demonstrations of suffering and selfabnegation which expose and bring to consciousness the oppressors guilt and the faulty position he holds if one elects to follow such a course in accordance with the dictates of his conscience and in full knowledge that the adversary will administer punishment one must be prepared to accept such punishment without retaliation in violent terms desoite the presence in this country of scores of admirers of gandhi who preach his philosophy and have advocated nonviolence and despite the supporters of the peace movement the crystallization of the ideology of nonviolence which guides the present movement is owing to the reverend martin l king prominent attention is given to the reverend king because he has been the most articulate spokesman and has provided the most crystallized ideological expression of the nonviolent movement nonviolence must always be viewed as a phase of a larger social movement it is conceivable and predictable that as the movement changes nonviolence as a technique will disappear though one would not be so bold as to predict when it is already apparent that the successes of the present movement have brought into view a clearer need for different emphases but whatever its future the historian is likely to relate that in the midth century the nonviolent movement focused the attention of america on one of its most significant problems drs solomon and fishman it would appear that the nonviolent student civil_rights movements is neither an unusual accident of history a carefully invented pragmatic ideology of a few leaders nor a movement sprung into being through the appearance of one charismatic leader its content the reactions it provokes and its successes appear to be an understandable intersection between a number of psychological and political forces in the south and the evolution of a new social character in negro youth the movement provides a release of pentup resentment and anger in a politically and socially advantageous and morally superior manner touching both the conscience and political nerves of the community data drawn from the negro students suggest that for many the ideals of nonviolence are secondary to the social and personal considerations of achieving civil_rights to these students nonviolent techniques seem like good strategy and their reason for not striking back when being physically abused is that it would hurt the movement that is not to say they do not believe in the worth of the technique but rather that these students feel that the current political framework and role of public opinion in the country today is such that those who become violent are bound to lose in the long run when a group or individual struggles against opposition much stronger than himself and which is capable of inflicting disastrous retaliation upon him nonviolent defiance seems to provide a way of resolving the dilemma mr kahn there are certain prerequisites for nonviolence a certain degree of organization in society reduces the necessity for violence violence in a large measure is a reflection of social disintegration fundamentally the problem always has been how to remove the instituional causes of violence frictional institutions which cause violence the measure of nonviolence in my view is not how deep down it goes into the individual but how far out it goes from the individual and the group to change the conditions that cause nonviolence the closer the nonviolent directaction movement comes to making progress the more it is going to have to begin to make broad political judgments on the nature of the political system under which we operate it is surprising to me for example that the various civil_rights organizations have yet to mount all together in consort with other progressive forces in society an allout political campaign which has as its single slogan break the political power of the dixiecrats i think this is the main obstacle to which the movement is going to have to address itself mr mitchell i believe the nonviolent movement has been to a great extent identified and described by those who want to make the negro a docile and subservient fellow who is willing to turn the other cheek who is willing to let his women be kicked around who is willing to let his children go to jail this is a great mistake because it is not characteristic of most humans whether they be negroes or not to react that way i think time is running out on america in this resoect i think that those intellectual and dedicated people who have carried the ball of nonviolence who have been willing to be slapped and kicked around have brought about a wonderful chapter in our countrys history but the plain fact is that there are many other people who are not willing to be slapped around there are plenty of other people who will defend their homes if they are bombed the only way to meet this challenge it seems to me is for the u s government to get busy and pass effective legislation which will make it possible to protect people who are interested in safeguarding their lives their property their honor and the future of their children dr waskow i think it is important to examine the question whether there is a field of behavior that is neither violent nor nonviolent but nonlethal this should be done if for no other reason than to make it clear that one need not lapse directly from gandhianism to violence there are techniques for carrying on political conflict that are not violent but do not depend on the direct confrontation of bodies and souls secondly i think we need a new look at the role of the police both the southern establishment and most of the integration movement tend to assume that the role of the police is to defend one or another established order segregation or integration it is possible to imagine a role for the police in which they do neither but aim at only one thingthe prevention and if necessary punishment of outright violence but do not prevent either nonviolent or nonlethal forms of conflict i am not posing this as the solution but i think that the possiblity of this role for the police is one which has not been looked at so far mr meredith first i would like to comment on mr mitchells remarks and say that i am in complete agreement with him no matter how hard i try i cannot fully adopt the principle of nonviolence in addition i do not believe that in the final analysis this principle can solve our problems when i was a student at the university of mississippi and when some other student cursed me and i smiled people would think that i was a shining example of the nonviolent method believe me this was not the case because of the situation at ole miss i had no choice but to act nonviolently i am sure that violence is not the answer to the negros fight for freedom i am not so sure however that our people are as nonviolent as they have been pictured particularly in the white press i believe that if negroes continue to be nonviolent even when circumstances naturally would make them become violent it will be harmful to our position in the long run legal and constitutional aspects mr nabrit the demonstrationsparticularly the sitinshave required lawyers to reexamine some ideas about constitutional law that had become settled and fixed the issue is whether under our system of laws negroes can be kept out of public accommodations because of their race and arrested and jailed for insisting upon service in such facilities the southern states argue that when a storekeeper discriminates against a negro the constitution is not violated because the state is not involved we of the naacp have argued to the contrary saying that the states are deeply involved in these cases i suggest to you that the failure to assure that negroes are treated equally in the public life of the community offends the fourteenth amendment i believe that the framers of the amendment intended that it would cover the failures of states to protect as well as their affirmative misdeeds i think that it is instructive to recall that american states and many english commonwealth and european countries including france italy and the netherlands would protect the right of a negro to be served in a place of public accommodations a principle characteristic of racial segregation is that whatever other impact it may have it is invariably an insult mr trebach one of the great practical effects that direct nonviolent protest has is that it conveys on a personal basis the idea that negroes do regard racial discrimination as an insult the enforcement of segregation is a violation of the equal protection clause it is also true that any action by an official of justice that in any way treats a person differentially because of his race is a violation of the equal protection clause this is a pretty pervasive concept for example there is a case that came out of birmingham where the police went into a railroad station and asked negroes if they had interstate tickets they did not ask whites this action by the police had set the basis for an eventual favorable decision toward these civil_rights protesters bail is a particular problem in baton rouge bail was set at for protesters on a breach of the peace offense normally the bail for this offense is there is also the possibility of relief in the injunctive provisions of the civil statutes the big thing about an injunction in this area is that the general position taken by the federal court is this if a suit commences in the state court the federal court will not issue an injunction unless you can show that great irreparable and immediate harm will occur finally on the possibility of removal of a case from a state to a federal court under present law this is not a very effective remedy i dont know of a successful case in the history of this removal statute i find a terrible prospect for the future but i hope that southern officials will come to their senses stop these practices and conform to the constitution unless they produce a great social upheaval mr bernhard the concept of the original civil_rights statutes passed in the s and s has been totally forgotten this concept was that not only were substantive civil_rights statutes needed but procedures and techniques were needed to enforce them our present provision of the federal law is ineffective in order to get somebody prosecuted successfully today it must be shown that the policeman grabbed a negro hit him over the head jailed him and kicked him after he was in jail but that is not enough you have to establish that while the policeman was doing this to the negro he had a fixed intent to deprive him of a constitutional right i think we need to go back into our history to find out what has happened to the original civil_rights statutes those enacted during reconstruction this is one area that has not been adequately researched to date dean ferguson the method of mass arrests which has been used as a technique against the demonstrators raises some very severe problems about our process of justice administration itself the system is based supposedly on individualization of each particular case what has quite obviously happened is that the mass arrests were not individualized the arrests are what some scholars might call group theory that is if we find a group which can be identified in a particular way then we move against the group i would suggest that there is a fairly substantial constitutional problem here the republican form of government clause may very well be involved when we begin to get mass arrests and mass use of the administration of justice machinery for the purpose of imposing punishment on persons by using such procedural machinery as bail holding for a certain number of hours without consultation and the like dean pye it is easy enough to say that any time we are engaged in nonviolent action where our motives are praiseworthy it is permissible this idea to me raises very serious difficulties i do not have the answer but i suggest that in a pluralistic society such as we live in the dangers to the legal order may be such that we are going to have to place a brake on some of our nonviolent activities we want to be careful in the attempt to justify nonviolent activity which is lawful in the cause of civil_rights that we do not provide the intellectual justification for southern school boards not to desegregate until somebody sues them we want to be careful that we do not give justification to roman catholics who decide not to vote for school bond issues for public schools in negro neighborhoods because they think that constitutionally they have a right to share in those tax revenues for parochial schools miss thornton i am concerned with the amount of time which lapses between the beginning of a right and the winning of a right in the courts i am concerned with the ineffectiveness of the remedies we wait three or four by martin_luther_king jr there can be no gainj ll saying of the fact that ii we face a crisis in race d relations in our nation this crisis has been precipitated by the collusion between the forces of liberation and the forces of domination the old idea of racial segregation of paternalistic relationships has exhausted itself and american society is seeking to reorientate itself along the idea of desegregation of integration the idea of persontoperson relations this is the crisis of our age i am still convinced in spite of the tragedies we have faced in our birminghams and other communities that nonviolence is the most potent weapon available to the negro in his struggle for freedom and justice i believe that nonviolence is the method that can achieve the ideals goals and principles of this new age the philosophy of nonviolence contends that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek means and ends must cohere ones aim must never be to inflict injury upon the opponent this stands at the center of the nonviolent discipline and philosophy one must rise to the heights of being able to accept blows without retaliating nonviolence means that you refuse to engage in external physical violence and it also means that you are constantly moving to the point where you refuse to engage in internal violence of spirit not only will you come to the point that you are able not to shoot the opponent not to hit the opponent not to throw a rock at the opponent but you come to the point that you are able not to hate the opponent some people misunderstood love at this point for they think when you say love you mean a sentimental affectionate emotion and i would be the first to say that it is absurd and nonsense to ask oppressed people to love their oppressors in an affectionate sense the love i speak of is more than an ecstatic or romantic love it is more than friendship it is a love of understanding creative redemptive goodwill for all men it is an overflowing love which seeks nothing in return theologians would say it is the love of god operating in the human heart when an individual rises to love on this level he loves every man not because he likes him not because his ways appeal to himbut he loves every man because god loves him and he rises to the point of loving the person who does the evil deed while hating the deed that the person does i think this is what jesus meant when he said love your enemies and im happy that he didnt say like your enemies its pretty difficult to like some people its pretty difficult to like somebody bombing your home and killing your children its pretty difficult to like some of the senators and congressmen who spend all of their time voting against civil_rights but jesus said love them and love is greater than like it is a recognition that prejudice is a learned process that those who are prejudiced are taught that way hate is dangerous it is as injurious to the hater as it is to the hated the nonviolent discipline says you move toward that point at which you are able to love the opponent and hate segregation and there is something about this that frustrates the opponent it exposes his moral defenses it weakens his morale and at the same time it works on his conscience and he just doesnt know how to handle it even if the opponent tries to kill you you develop an inner conviction that there are some things so precious some things so dear some things so eternally true that theyre worth dying for and if a man has not discovered something that he will die for he isnt fit to live if an individual at yearsold hears some great truth some great principle some great ideal standing at the doorsteps of his life and he refuses to take a stand because hes afraid that his hand will be burned afraid that he will lose a job or afraid that he will be killed and he wants to live longer he may live until hes but hes just as dead at as he is at one must never allow himself to reach the point where he is willing to cooperate with evil this is what civil disobedience means in the final analysis noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good there are those who argue that you cant legislate morality that negroes must wait for freedom until the heart changes but the people who say this fail to see something it may be true that morality cant be legislated but behavior can be regulated it may be true that the law cant change the heart but it can reform the habits it may be true that the law cant make a man love me but it can keep him from lynching me there is need for strong civil_rights legislation and if this legislation is not passed in this session of congress the debilitating sorrow and sore on the body politic will suddenly become malignant and we will be in for a terrible night in our nation it may be a night of violence and terror the whirlwind of hope can be restored in the negro community by the passage of this bill
by gordon b hancock booker t wash hd ington was the first f and only american s who made the long t journey from slave cabin to the hall of fame the nearest approach to this marvelous achievement was made by abraham lincoln who rose from railsplitter to the presidency of the united states but the comparison fades before the fact that lincoln was white and booker t washington was a negro with its disadvantages that are beyond human computation whereas lincoln had all the advantages that go with being white in a white mans civilization where a mere white skin is the password to the best that the nation can offer washington had to make his fight up from slavery with his hands tied behind him it is no wonder then that the rise of booker t washington to fame has become one of the social wonders of the modern world and that the world proclaims his greatness and renown redounds to the credit of mankind and is one of historys grandest adornments the coming of booker t washington booker t washington therefore becomes not only one of the greatest negroes but one of the most remarkable men of history that he found his way from that slave cabin to the hall of fame occasions no surprise to students of history for such universal recognition followed as naturally and logically as the night follows day booker t washington stands out in fullest stature when silhouetted against the times when he arrived on the scenethe closing decades of the nineteenth century those dark and turbulent days of reconstruction had not completely passed and slaverys hangover was rife in the land the south was still huffed over losing its war of rebellion and negroes were feeling in full force the wrath of the souths disappointment and grievance over its loss the south mounted what may be definitely called a fivepoint attack in a cold war on the negro freedmen the first assault was on the negros humanity whether or not the negro is human was once a burning question which this writer remembers quite vividly as a lad i remember reading a book by one writer named carroll who wrote a book entitled the negro a beast or the image of god but the negros general advancement and social behaviour soon relegated the specious argument about the negros humanity which was conceded even by the most venomous enemies of the negros advance the next assault was on the negros industry it was argued that the negro could never survive in competition with the white man and that he would soon fade before the withering pressure of a life in competition with the industrious and resourceful white man but the negros general economic advancement shown by his accumulation of property and his fine beginnings in almost every field of human endeavor soon ended the specious argument about the possibility of negro extermination through his lack of industry the negro was not only surviving but grandly next came the assault on the races vitality it was argued that whereas the negro physically survived under slavery because the white man forced upon him habits of survival under freedom he would finally perish for lack of health discipline in those days white life insurance companies refused negroes as unprofitable insurance risks this gave the negro insurance companies just the opening they needed one white actuary named dublin widely publicized the idea of the negro as a too risky insurance risk the north carolina mutual life insurance company and the atlanta life insurance company and others by their phenomenal growth proved the untruth of the allegation against the negros vitality the campaigns that the white companies are putting on for negro risks today are added proof that the poor vitality argument against the negro has lost its force then came the assault on the negros morality this was an argument to the effect that negroes could not control themselves sexually and were rapists by nature and hence a grave danger to the white mans society this argument has long since been dissipated by such findings as reuter in his american race problem and by the history of sex crimes in the nation the final assault was made on the negros mentality and the mental tests incident to world war i gave just the excuse prejudiced whites craved to prove that the negro lacked mental equality with the whites and was thereby disqualified for full citizenship in this country but when the mental tests showed that northern negroes showed to better advantage than southern whites all the wind was taken out of the sails of the fivefold attack on the negro in a cold war that is still going on booker t washington came on the scene to face this social psychology of the white south then there arose such towering negrophobes as ben tillman of south carolina who was the first to throw the negro question full force into politics he so played upon race prejudice that he an almost unlettered white man became governor of south carolina and went on to the senate of the united states with no political platform other than keep the negro down it was so easy that georgia soon had its hoke smith and tom watson mississippi soon had its vardaman and bilbo alabama had its heflin and soon every southern state had a vestpocket edition of ben tillman tillmanism still flourishes in the south in this situation the negro found himself impoverished untrained and inadequately led except by its ministry that was unequal to the tremendous task that lay ahead booker t washington in this trying and critical hour not only arrived on the scene but he arrived a man with a plan he reasoned that having done the souths hard labor for hundreds of years the negros foot was in the door and all he had to do was to keep pushing he argued that the negros labor was his only commodity and if this could be sold to advantage the negro could gradually rise by his own efforts he came preaching a gospel of industrial education and the dignity of labor it was true that dr w e b du bois and john mitchell and monroe trotter and frederick douglass were urging negroes to contend for their rights but the sign of the times pointed to the conclusion that ere the white man conceded the negros claims for full citizenship there would be a long lapse of years there would be a long and arduous struggle subsequent events have proved the correctness of washingtons conclusion after a hundred years we are still a long way from the promised land negroes in general were quick to grasp washingtons idea but under the aegis of the arguments of douglass and dubois they were soon confused and with the apparent lack of coordination of leadership it was easier to sell negroes on positions than to sell them on the matter of jobs the negroes who fought washington based their fight on the exposition speech he made in atlanta when he said in things economic the races in the south could be as one as the fist but in things social they could be as separate as the fingers this statement by a man beset by a prejudiced south led by at times vicious white leaderpoliticians turned the wolves loose on washington yet when we review his atlanta speech in retrospect what else could he have said at the time for him to have taken the position that martin_luther_king jr is taking now and saying what negroes on every corner are saying would have meant annihilation for the negro race moreover since washington uttered the atlanta speech negroes living in the white mans south have done just what he said could be done in things economic negroes and whites of the south have lived side by side and in things social they have been as separate as the fingers the truth of washingtons statement has been lived before the eyes of the world moreover there are indications that in spite of minor gains here and there and in spite of some momentous court decisions there is little or no evidence that negroes and whites of the south will not still continue to live as one as the fist in things economic and as separate as fingers on the hand in things social of course the negro race would have it different most of us are nowists but are dealing with principalities and powers that have sworn unto death that neverism is the word if there is any leader who can hasten matters his work is cut out for him but conconcluded washingtonand wisely the negro cannot do without eating and wearing until this whole matter is settled eating is a nowist matter and what faced the negro in washingtons day faces the negro in our great today the negro must fight but he must have something to eat in the meantime and so when washington arrived he was a man with a plan what was his planto take the foothold negroes had in the economic life of the nation through his primacy in the manual arts and exploit it to the utmost to sell the use of proficient hands until we qualify ourselves to sell the product of our brains to make the very most of opportunities in the manual arts until we gather strength and prepare ourselves for positions of our liking there is nothing disgraceful about using jobs as stepping stones to positions economic security and assurance must precede full citizenship in this country and not follow this is one of those stern facts of economic life booker t washingtons doctrine rejected according to the teachings and doctrine of booker t washingtonjust suppose he could have sold his idea to the negro race through its leaders the negro cooks would be the owners of our great eating places and establishments our bricklayers and carpenters would be our great contractors now our launderers would have charge of the great laundry industry instead of quarreling and fighting for the jobs that are becoming fewer and fewer by reason of competition and automation we would now be commanding those jobs but washingtons doctrine and his plan were utterly rejected hampton and tuskegee could not supply the great need for training such as they offered but what is even more tragictheir graduates did not spread the doctrines and popularize it at first little tuskegees and little hamptons sprung up all over the south but those who taught industrial education did not themselves believe in it and so could not enthuse their students about its possibilities even our great schools at tuskegee and hampton are today for all practical purposes schools of liberal arts those who rejected and spurned washingtons doctrine of industrial education were under moral compulsion to bring an alternate program just as washington had a plan for his day we need for our present day a man with a plan we have before us a gigantic task to win first class citizenship but in spite of our cry now there are multiplying evidences that we are nin for a long struggle and we must eat in the meantime dr du bois and monroe trotter and john mitchell all gainsaid and disparaged washington they had fine arguments but no alternate plan negro leadership has utterly rejected washingtons plan of using the manual arts and occupations as means of gaining positions but nobody seems to be coming up with a plan to feed the negro while he fights the fight the negro is now putting up deserves a leadership with a plan we cannot reach our goal merely by producing a race of fighters though fighters we must have but we also need a plan to feed these fighters even fighters must be fed one of the glories of washington is that he not only had a plan but it was a positive plan and a practical plan a plan in a time of great crisis and great need today the employment situation is becoming so serious that the government is becoming concerned and is about to pour millions of dollars into training and retraining for the jobs that are and will be available it is seriously to be wondered whether our educators and other leaders who have completely rejected the washington plan will sell the negro race the opportunity inherent in the current efforts to train and retrain for jobs that will be scarcer as competition and automation press like a vise upon the working population today we are fighting against segregation although most of our economic success is of the segregated varietyour professionals our insurance companies our publications our undertakers and barbers and beauty culturists all live by segregation our thousands and thousands of teachers today are faring finely salarywise in our segregated schools desegregation without integration will not relieve the necessity of our leaning hard upon the fruits of segregation in spite of segregation the negro has advanced but we need a plan we have rejected washingtons negro educators what is your economic plan for the masses although the negro race through its leaders and especially its educators has utterly rejected washingtons plan to date has offered no alternate plan to succour the race in its economic life washington made the great mistake too often made by the prophets preaching to the people a gospel of what they need instead of what they want and so booker t washington was stoned even as the prophets of old were stoned but when we consider what booker washington had to show for his teachings and doctrinesa tuskeegeeand what his critics have to show washington thus stands out in bold relief like the towering alps snowcapped and majestic booker t knew in his early times that in the last analysis who has the dollar is a far more powerful question than who is going to marry whose daughter and so he had a plan by which negroes could command the dollar it still is true that he who would get the dollar must put his heart into his work as well as his hands it is still true that beginning at the bottom is the surest way to reach the top washington was our great leader in the darker days of segregation martin_luther_king jr is proving himself a great leader in these anxious days of desegregation of sorts who will bring forward a leadership for the days of integration that lie far into the uncertain future many a great football game has been lost by a fumble negro leadership fearfully fumbled the opportunity that washingtons philosophy and doctrine pointed out to a struggling race we are wondering seriously whether our fumble can be recovered and the day saved by a reformed leadership that will not reject the man and the plan that led somewhere the problems that confront us in these troubled times together with our lack of a constructive plan of solution are a vindication of the life and teachings of booker t washington who looked over the shoulders of three generations by ssgt gerald westbrook the dictionary gives various definitions for this particular essence history identifies those w ho possessed it the bible reveals from whence it came the song that begins lift every voice and sing portrays it violent death often takes he who displays itmedgar evers he conveyed it many more died but the essence lives on and on the freedom march in washington expressed it in a feeling rather than a sight or a sound i have a dream said reverend king and tears sprang to many eyes for he spoke from his heart and his speech had the essence and when i read his speech i felt this essence i think most american negroes who read or heard it did for this essence is at the very core of our existence it binds all our lives together and in it we are one the chains of slavery could not squeeze it from us the noose could not bring it to an end the countless whips may have drawn blood from the flesh but they could not draw the essence from within thus it was passed down to us through the centuries not from hand to hand but rather from heart to heart it is within us among us and around us it is part of our heritage we call it soul to us soul is a part of many things have you heard of soul food or soul music in a recent interview as reported by an international magazine mary lou williams the pianist said this i am praying through my fingers when i play i get that good soul sound and i try to touch peoples spirits she did not elaborate but her statement raises a questionwhat is this soul that she captures in her music it is the same essence that medgar evers conveyed moreover a recent issue of jet magazine reported that solomon burke the singer had been dubbed the king of rock n soul an interpretation of that title is beyond the scope of this article however why is the term rock n soul used in place of the more familiar rock n roll to what does this soul refer it refers to the same essence that was expressed by the freedom march in addition the society editor of jet informed us that the dinner served at a special event consisted entirely of soul food the specific menu for the dinner need not particularly concern us what we are concerned with is this question what was the soul that pervaded the food it was the same essence that per vaded reverend kings speech what is it that has spanned the centuries that can bridge the gap between such different styles of music as those of mary lou williams and solomon burke what is it that was shared by thousands during a mass marchthat reached out and touched them when they heard a speechthat is used to describe such opposites as food and music what is the essence that we call soul it is not the moral or religious soul of any single man not the lone one possessed by you or me it is part of yet apart from the individual soul it is a togetherness a oneness a sum even more than a feeling soul is an affinity rather than a word a look mostly a spiritual sharing in the blending of all that was that is and is to come soul is that which tells the story of many lives in a single prayer one that began perhaps in the slavehold of a ship a prayer that implores the light of freedom to shine to pierce the darkness in mens minds so that well all be free to us this prayer gave a sense of humility and from that humility came soul a james meredith who faces hostile crowds a freedom rider who emerges from a burning bus a pregnant woman who spends days in a dark dank cellthese people transcend fear or bravery they have soulthe essence that embraces happiness and exalts sadness that tempers bravery and lessens fear it justifies dying relieves living and lends significance to life and death in his book black like me john h griffin tells of the time he went to an unidentified smalltown bus station in the south i bought a ticket to montgomery and went to sit outside on the curb where other negro passengers gathered many negroes walked through the streets their glances were kind and communicative as though all of us shared a common secret the impression that he received was correct their glances were kind and communicative because the common secret that they shared was soul for soul is living in sympathy with one another having an empathy for each other and sharing in all the things that we have felt and that we feel soul encompasses facing forward with high hopes and looking backward at the sorrows joys trials toil and tears it involves looking back across the bodies of our dead ancestors back across their shallow nameless graves to the nights when they sat and sang in the face of terror to the nights they hung bloody heads and prayed those songs and those prayers are still among us though they may be different in melody and word so if a strange song or prayer brings sudden tears to our eyes we are not surprised we know that this is soul and if we could hear the ancient voices speaking from the nameless graves they would tell us of the thousands who died from lack of bread they would tell us of the foodless days and cold hungry nights they would tell us that they sat and cried as they watched their children starve and die then they would tell us of the times when there were only certain foods to eat greens from the fields the belly of a sow the bread made from cornmeal or flour they would tell us that those foods once helped them cheat the hands of death that they nourished those who began the struggle that we have vowed to carry on so it is not strange that certain foods touch on memories of those who lived before for we are reminded of all the foods that they had and didnt have this too is soul soul is the common denominator the great identifier the path of synonymity from the crib to the grave from the gutter to the throne rising above love neutralizing hate moving outside of riches or poverty it forges a link between the princes and paupers the bourgeoisie and bums soul combines strength and a feeling of helplessness faith and a feeling of hopelessness an awareness of living and suffering a love for loving an urge for laughing and the need to cry soul is to each of us what it is unto itselfa reflection of lifes miseries and a mirror for its joys we have caught that reflection we have looked into that mirror such is soul the essence we feel by calvin jarrett the mississippi senator v rjp f who succeeded jefferson davis in the united states senate was opposed to lynching his name was hiram rhoades revels he was a negro president of the confederacy tj when hiram revels took his seat in the senate he was fulfilling prophecy senator simon cameron told senator jefferson davis in when he left the senate i believe in the justice of god that a negro some day will come and occupy your seat the senator was the first negro to serve in the united states senate hiram rhoades revels was born september at fayetteville north carolina he was born of free parents so he never knew the condition of servitude he left north carolina when a young man revels moved to indiana while quite young and attended the quaker seminary in union county a while later he moved to darke county ohio and attended the seminary there when he had completed this period of education he went to baltimore maryland he was ordained in the african methodist episcopal ministry in his education was incomplete he went to illinois and graduated from knox college at bloomington after completing his education the young negro taught and lectured to his people in indiana illinois missouri kansas kentucky and tennessee at last he settled in st louis missouri where he taught for a short while the energetic young minister returned to preaching in cincinnati st louis pittsburgh and baltimore preacher revels was in baltimore when the civil war began he assisted in organizing the first two negro regiments raised in maryland in revels moved to st louis and founded a large school for freedmen he helped to recruit a negro regiment in st louis in he went to mississippi and joined the federal army as chaplain of a negro regiment at the same time he helped the freedmens bureau to extend protection to negro troops chaplain revels crossed over from vicksburg to jackson to establish schools and churches bushwhackers almost captured him but he was warned by friends and managed to escape in he left the army and went to louisville and then to leavenworth kansas to preach in he settled at natchez mississippi where he combined preaching with participation in politics the first republican convention ever held in mississippi met at jackson september about a third of its members were exslaves revels had been elected as alderman of natchez in he was elected to the state senate in at this time revels had received no particular attention from the reconstruction republicans but when the state legislature of mississippi convened in january preacher revels was called on to open the session with a prayer his prayer was impressive and did much to lead to his election as united states senator the minister had entered politics reluctantly because he feared his participation would cause racial friction he was careful to never prostitute the pulpit to partisan purposes as some were accused of doing mississippi had no representative in the united states senate after jefferson davis resigned at the beginning of the civil war when mississippi reentered the union in revels was elected as a compromise candidate the memphis daily avalanche of january had this to say about the first negro to serve in the united states senate seven cities contended for the honor of homers birth how many will struggle for revels is yet a question a week ago people had never heard his name or if heard it was only to be forgotten now it will be the subject of leaders and when revels reaches washington the reporters of all the great journals will interview him happy revels he is of popular manners and speaks with great ease fluency and generally in good taste in his intercourse with all classes he conducts himself with decorousness that has won him the regard of all his neighbors at home and of the members of the mississippi senate of which he is now a member revels did not go to washington to serve a full fouryear term it was an unexpired term to last from february to march when senator revels arrived in washington some members of the mississippi delegation held a party president u s grant and his cabinet members were present grant received revels with much kindness and told him he hoped he would be admitted to the senate without difficulty it was reported that even the radicals of the republican party didnt want a negro in congress when revels credentials were presented to the senate on february one senator james nye rejoiced in a speech that a negro was replacing jefferson davis this set off a debate that lasted all day and revels was not confirmed on that day the debate resumed on february and lasted all day without a decision senator simon cameron made a speech in which he reminded the senate of what he had said in when jefferson davis left washington the radicals wanted to seat revels in davis old seat for the spectacular effect it would create senator ross of kansas occupied jeff davis old seat no he would not give it up and revels was forced to take no on the opposite side of the row a vote of to was cast in his favor on february and revels became the first negro to be seated in the u s senate the newspapers and the negro ministers in washington announced that senator revels would give his first speech in the senate on march the gallery of the senate was packed a writer for the philadelphia press said never since the birth of the republic has such an audience been assembled under one single roof it embraced the greatest and the least american citizens the occasion of revels speech was the readmission of georgia into the union in referring to his race he managed to get in a word for civil liberties they appeal to you and to me to see that they receive that protection which alone will enable them to pursue their daily avocations and enjoy the liberties of citizenship on the same footing with their white neighbors and friends sir i repeat the fact that the colored race saved the noble women of new england and the middle states many men of whom they lean today for security and safety many of my race representatives of these men on the battlefield sleep in countless graves of the south if those quiet resting places of our honored dead could speak today what a mighty voice like to the rushing of a mighty wind would come up from those sepulchral homes could we resist the eloquent pleadings of their appeal ah sir i think that this question of immediate and ample protection for the loyal people of georgia would lose its technicalities and we would cease to hesitate in our provisions for their instant relief senator revels didnt receive any more attention until the summer of at this time he appointed a negro to west point the negro cadet failed to pass and was soon dropped the nation pronounced it a very foolish and cruel thing as far as the boy and his family were concerned and a very injudicious thing as far as the colored race is concerned the first negro senator introduced two or three minor bills which failed to pass on february he gave his last speech in the senate it concerned the mixed schools in the district of columbia he favored the proposal of mixed schools at the conclusion of his speech he said the white race has no better friend than i i am true to my own race but at the same time i would not have anything done which would harm the white race revels term came to a close on march he did not run for reelection alcorn college for negroes was established in mississippi and revels became its first president he was appointed by governor alcorn who had replaced him in the u s senate in june revels went to new orleans to edit the southwestern advocate an organ of the general conference of his church revels then served a second term as president of alcorn college after this he returned to religious work and made his home at holly springs mississippi he became district superintendent of his church and died while attending a church conference at aberdeen mississippi the date was january thus ended the career of the first negro to serve in the united states senate our children must not be castoffs my job is that of a teacher i am proud of it devoted to it and fully aware of my responsibilities that is why i am here tonight i apologize for the screen which shields me from your view however without its protection i might lose my job yet the screen does allow my words to reach your ears for this i am grateful to begin with like you i am a product of the society that stands on trial here tonight when i was just a toddler unaware of real human conflicts my mother often said these words to meover and over in a determined voice when you are old enough to go to school we are going to leave this place well go where you can get a good education we lived in the heart of the rural south then where educational facilities for negroes were lacking she kept her promise and we leftheading northward to the land of opportunity we know that teachers should be constantly at war against one common enemyignorance but what do we teach the truth part of it or only the truth as we see it in any discussion of the socalled negro problem the truth is often grossly mistreated usually ignorance is the rootor very close to the rootof this problem as a result the mere mention of the word negro sends minds of all colors scurrying for protective cover nobody wants to discuss it especially squeamish are the whites who created it they have preconceived ideas these ideas were passed down from generation to generation because of this fact they accept without questioning all the ideas that are inherited thus a monster image of the negro has been skillfully built in the minds of white america likewise uncle tom negroes eager to assimilate into the white mans culture adopt readily his values as to beauty standards and cultural patterns lost is the sophisticated negros identity with anything negroid or dark in hue very briefly let me review some very disturbing byproducts of deftly applied ignorance any member of the white race is basically superior to any member of the darker races regardless of age or natural ability the negro in general is not to be regarded as a human beinghe is thought of only as chattel and is to be exploited whenever possible under pressure a few doles can be handed out to pacify him for the moment the negro is only one step removed from the lower animals for this reason he has extra long or large body parts the negro has a peculiar offensive odor his intelligence level is and is destined to be lower than that of other racial or ethnic groupsparticularly the white group the negro has no culture he is really uncivilized and can never be fused into a civilized urbane white society the negro is basically lazy slovenly and happy go lucky he is satisfied with his lot in life he does not want any socalled freedom he is a poor workerin job situationsand is utterly undependable if his job becomes easier as to physical demands it is then declared to be a white job he is fired the negro can succeed only in matters requiring physical or entertainment ability this fact accounts for the monopoly of the sports and amusement fields if a negro is interested in integration he is interested primarily because he desires intermarriage personal wishes of equal job opportunities housing and education are not understood by white americans havent we all heard these statements the fact that these beliefs contribute to the neverending circle of frustration despair and general confusion felt by the average negro is not even considered by the whites tensionreleasing activities such as rock and roll music or other diversions are frowned upon by whites as being symbolic of the animal nature of the negro thus the white man can justify smugly that he has the right to relegate the negro to his place for everyones good such then is the social climate as we switch to a negro school in a negro neighborhood fortyeight negro youngsters push and shove each other into line as they hear the clanging of the shift bell if this class is in a changing neighborhood they are often exposed to perplexed hostile white teachers who neither understand their problems and resultant actions nor attempt to the students are yelled at compared to stupid animals and generally impressed with the fact that they are two to three years below grade levela fact that they are already aware of they are scolded and told to act like civilized people they are told that they cannot write neither can they read the strange symbols in the book if they are lucky they can look at the pictures of the little white blondehaired children playing with their pets in the backyard of course the house is white surrounded by the lilywhite picket fence a first grade teacher in a southside chicago school reading dick and jane with the class asked who lives in the white house on the hill one little boy finally stood up scratched his head and said the white people do this is the white world and it is strangefar removed from his dark world his color is his curse he sees this fact very clearly as his father returns home at night to tell of his failures in trying to get a job that day that is if his father has not already become discouraged and left the home he all too often feels that adc aid to dependent children is the answer that will provide food and shoes for his needy family thus he disappears so that his family will be provided for and he can laugh or drink his troubles awaywith less overpowering responsibility and more opportunity for success is it any wonder that the student leaves school one way or the other as soon as possible truancy dropouts and general delinquency reign supreme in these hotbeds well then how can a teacher teach this class of negro children often rebellious to any form of authority she begins with the pledge to the flaglistening to the chant one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all fervently she labors to develop the concept that equal and adequate services of the public schools are available to all the children of all the people yet she knows that lettie the fifteen year old girl in the sixth seat in the first row has no idea of what shes saying her iq according to test scores is but she is sitting in a regular classroom with other seventh graders the division that could best meet her needs is overcrowded at her school the fact that she has a violent temper and fighting tendencies simply prompts school officials to graduate her from grammar school as quickly as possible where is lettie now what is she doing there are hundreds of letties in regular classrooms throughout the negro sections of the city some have iqs in the s but they still are lost in the rushed crowded schedule of the overcrowded shift situations the iqs of these children are taken as irrevocable fact when educators pounce upon their scores yet studies have proven that they are more often than not completely unreliable consider the example of a negro child attempting to take an iq test she is asked to put a mark on a pail however she marks everything but a pail because she sees only a bucket a pair of scissors and a ball the word pail is not in the childs experiential vocabulary therefore she will not mark the pail and her test results will be correspondingly lowered it has been proven also that the person administering the test plays a vital role in the test results if negro children are being tested by a white tester iq results are considerably lower than those in a control group of children tested by a negro tester libraries are full of data supporting all statements made here tonight but ignorance again wins out when american citizens are either unaware of these facts or are too biased in their thinking to investigate the question arises are all negro children underprivileged and housed in crowded cramped conditions no they are not yet as recently as four months ago statistics were obtained stating that of the children on double shift sessions in chicago classrooms some of those children were negro youngsters the coincidence is too striking what do you think well over a thousand children have passed through my classroom door and each one had some unique problem generally in the crowded situation i had neither the time nor energy to devote to really helping those children solve the problems that were blocking their learning opportunities as a result some children that i formerly taught are today parents of illegitimate children seriously mentally disturbed dope addicts prostitutes and at least one that i can recall is dead because of his unfavorable environment when i have children in a class there just isnt time to listen all i have time for is maintaining order some of the evils of overcrowded school conditions in negro neighborhoods are so remote and removed from the average white persons thinking that he cannot begin to understand the problem little or no school supplies are available for overcrowded classrooms extra fancy supplies such as yarn string scotch tape scissors for every child crayolas or other basic necessities are simply a joke when they are requested one set of books per subject is assigned to each desk despite the fact that two children must share them on a doubleshift basis more not fewer books are needed by these handicapped children they are not available what happened may i ask to the negro parents tax dollar why doesnt his child have books school supplies the extras that make learning fun not drudgery in most double shift schools there is not enough time even for a regular recess gym periods are cut in halfmost normal schools have two gym periods a week but most double shift classes have only one the children are cramped and confined without regular exercise and you know what this does to learning often schools that are on shift have had the library converted to a regular classroom yet these are the students who need libraries most who can answer these questions we have the most talented educator in the country at our disposal so we have been so forcibly told does he choose to give our negro parents any answers does he know does he care he certainly has had opportunity enough for on numerous occasionstoo numerous to list tonightsupt benjamin c willis has been asked to give chicago taxpayers a true picture of the school situation has he shown the courtesy to do so no why should we negro and white alike be burdened more with increased taxes when more than enough empty classrooms already exist in this city to take our children off double shift we do not need new schools we need to fill the ones that we already have attention white america we are not interested in marrying your daughters all we want are equal opportunities at job training and other benefits we want adequate housing for our familieshousing that we can afford then we will not have to double up in order to pay your rents we can pay reasonable rents save our money and buy homes for our familiesas you have been able to do dr willis it is your responsibility as our superintendent to see that all children are given equal opportunity for learning despite race creed or national origin it has been said dr willis that you harbor the same idea that some of your white brothers sharethat those children meaning ours should be treated as castoffs in a society that demands only the best those children dr willis are children and grandchildren of negroes whose talents have been grossly neglected and wasted have you wondered why there are so many dropouts among negro youths have you wondered why that teenage gang made its threat because of the school situation have you ever wondered why the negro youth thrive on rock and roll music and dances have you ever visited any taverns and seen negro fathers in despair over the jobs that they almost gotbut couldnt because they were born with dark skins you are a great educator dr benjamin c willis havent you ever thought about these wasted livesor did you solve your problem by drawing another boundary line with your very wise pencil we are paying you a handsome salary to do a job dr willis when are you planning to start to work we have a right to know by ruth burke so youve decided to o take the happy gamr ble you and the neygu p gro man or woman whom you love feel that in spite of the probable rough going ahead life would be much harder to bear if you didnt marry now that youve made the big decision you want to know what to plan for and what to expect the first item on your program will be to check and see whether or not your state allows interracial marriage nineteen states prohibit it they are alabama arkansas florida georgia louisiana mississippi north carolina south carolina tennessee texas virginia delaware indiana kentucky maryland missouri wyoming oklahoma and west virginia if you live in a state which has a law forbidding your marriage you have two courses of action open to you either move to a state where there is no such law or make an attempt to marry then if stopped take the case to the courts of your state in an attempt to have the law changed these laws are archaic since so many states have dropped their antimiscegenation laws recently perhaps your state is just waiting for a case such as yours to test their law then they could dispense with it on legal precedent of course if you live in the deep south they may be reluctant to do so just yet one important thing to remember is not to settle for a commonlaw alliance for then your marriage will have an inferior status and your children might not be your lawful heirs after you have decided the state in which you will be married and the one in which you will live note if you leave your home state briefly to be married elsewhere and return after the ceremony the state could prosecute you for trying to evade its law your next concern will be the choice of a dwelling will you rent for awhile or can you afford the down payment on a house the houses which carry the lowest down payment are tract houses and if you like them you can quickly have one to call your own more and more tract houses are opening to people of all ethnic groups and government financed houses cannot legally practice discrimination if you dont like tracts perhaps you would like to live in an apartment until you have children good apartments in the right price range are sometimes hard to find when you need one one way is to advertise in the paper most read by the economic or intellectual group in which you belong state all the nice things about yourself and say that you will give a breakage deposit if required another way is to place a card on the advertising boards of your local markets say plainly that you are a mixed couple and then the right people can call you those who live in certain areas of the country where there are laws against discrimination in housing have an advantage but it is up to them to take a firm stand and not back down new york city has such a law and so does california with its unruh ate and the much publicized rumford act however in many areas of the country people are forming committees to peacefully gain open occupancy this is true in riverside california then too in chicago the old town gardens and marina city are examples of places open to all who can qualify with the rise of labor unions employers have been less able to fire their workers for personal reasons if you or the person you are to marry feel that your job has been taken from you because of your association together see your union representative or go to one of your local civil_rights protective groups if you are working on a job handling government contracts this is illegal in any case do your work well so your employer will not want to find an excuse to dismiss you you may have heard that mixed couples lose all of their friends when they marry this isnt true for you wont lose any real friends you may even gain more than you had before as interested people will seek your company unless you live in an area where bigotry is so strong that people are too frightened to be friendly if your family treats you in a mean way or disowns you treat them kindly and with understanding time will mellow them especially when they see your children they will be likely to reown you they will be somewhat ashamed of their hasty judgment and will use many different ways in trying to make it up to you be prepared for questions of all kinds some of them quite personal people are curious and if they can overcome their shyness enough to speak up they will try to find out just how a mixed marriage works try not to be offended but give them an honest answer you dont know but what they are contemplating doing the same thing when people stare at you on the street it is not necessarily out of hostility remember that a good number of people have been taught that mixed marriage cant exist in the united states so it is something of a jolt for them to see a mixed couple negroes stare as much as whites so just assume that people want to look at you if one or both of you still attends high school wait until you graduate to marry this is hard to do sometimes as emotions are hard to control particularly the strong emotions that mixed couples feel for each other your parents may not allow you to date openly but dont sneak out to see each other as difficult as it may be try to finish school so that you will be able to get good jobs after that if your parents still forbid your courtship tell them that you dont intend to defy them but that you honestly feel that you are doing the right thing your new inlaws and other negro relatives by marriage might not care for you very much at first but they are likely to be much more friendly to you than your caucasians relatives will be to your mate just give them time to know you remembering that they are often bitter about the treatment which they have received in the past from whites love and understanding will be your main weapons if you keep your personal life above reproach they will be quick to see that there is no angle to your marriage but love for the one whom you marry dont worry about whether or not to have children have all you can afford they will be interesting and probably beautiful enough to win first prize in the local baby contest if they know that their parents love each other and love them they cannot help but be well adjusted and happy they will be able to make friendsand enemieson their own too as other negro children such children of mixed couples as roy campanella philippa schuyler and andre watts have made a high mark in the united states this is the most important thing to remember dont leave god out of your lives attend church every week and kneel and pray together every day thank god for each other and always be grateful to him for keeping prejudice from preventing your marriage do things together after all you have defied longstanding customs to be together take part in all the activities that you have time for plan trips to the zoo and the beach go to concerts and to museums enjoy each others company if you are a white woman learn how to press hair you may have a daughter who needs it you will find that negro women are often sensitive to having members of the other race around while they are doing their hair once they dont mind you know youve been accepted as one of the gang try to keep your home as much of a refuge from the outside world as possible your mate will be contending with the frustrations which will continue to beset negroes until we help our country to free itself of prejudice use a thousand ways to show you care by the fact of your marriage you will have helped atone for the terrible way in which the whites have treated negroes over the years you will be showing that if the united states is actually the melting pot of the world then every ethnic group has the right to melt soon youll feel like and be an honorary negro knowing how to read expresisons and sensing where discrimination is practiced finally when the ubiquitous bigot asks the classic question about whether or not you would want your daughter to marry one you can reply friend my daughter is a negro so if you are certain that you have made the right choice get married the rest of your life will show you how right you were a matter of fellowship during a softball game a lessthantenyearold boy called to me from the sidelines hey mister you look like johnny jones are you his father no im not i am warren marr and im from new york how do you do mr marr i am carl smith and im from rocky mount are you enjoying your visit here yes yes i am i almost stuttered into additional conversation for i was not prepared for this kind of assurance and maturity from a negro boy in bricks n c i would not have been prepared for this kind of exchange from any boy of or younger carl was one of youngsters all under the age of who were sharing the experience of a twoweek summer camp at franklinton center located in the miniature town of bricks in the rural tobacco country of northern north carolina he was one of a group who were having their play period and who had divided into two softball teams for a lively game without immediate adult supervision carls turn at bat came v excuse me mr marr he said returning to the game and driving a twobagger down center field when the inning broke the boys agreed to pose for a picture quickly they arranged themselves in rows and assumed postures associated in their minds with professional ballplayers the effect was good and i told them that they handled themselves better than many adults under similar circumstances thats a polaroid isnt it mister someone asked yes how do youknow do you have one no but ive seen them on ed sullivans show can we see the picture come out another asked sure i said as i squeezed the shutter release come on i began to count aloud one two a chorus picked up the count and carried it on the basis of the rhythm i had initiated to ten then quiet heads moved in close to watch the back of the camera being opened for the extraction of the finished snapshot hey thats good can you make pictures for us i wont have enough film for the work i have to do if i make a picture for each of you i must get photographs of the buildings and the work in the community to take back to my office ill take one photo which i will give the group of you if that will help how will all of you share one picture thats easy a boy said well take it to miss martin and she can put it on the bulletin board who will take it to her let joe be in charge hes the oldest later in the day in the auditorium of fellowship hall the pure vigorous voices of boys blended in fourpart harmony rehearsals were under way for a closing program and again i was impressed with the decorum of the boys and their respect for discipline there was no fidgeting and no whispered conversations only wholehearted participation the song ended and a tall brown face rose from the group to announce the next feature eight boys walked alertly to the front to sing as an octet then came a demonstration of the virginia reel performed with near perfection a display of acrobatics revealed surprising agility and muscular control twelve boys participated in a military marching drill more songs what you have achieved with these children is completely unbelievable i said to marjorie martin you must have worked with them endlessly im only here for a short period during the summer the redhaired freckled instructor said i am a schoolteacher and can be here only on my vacation time william judson king president of franklinton center interrupted this is the second and younger group of children who have been here this summer there were girls from to in the first group of this annual pta camp they come from all parts of north carolina the way young people respond to miss martin defies description we wish we could afford to have her as a permanent member of our staff the reference to limited funds almost went unnoticed with his positive outlook mr king was only stating a condition he has to work with he was not bemoaning an obvious and im sure heartbreaking limitation this impression occurred again when on a tour of the establishment he said here is the dining hall it seats since we can sleep people comfortably it becomes a trick of mathematics to feed that many everything about mr king is positiveeasy unassuming unpretentious but positive as he moves at a seemingly relaxed pace about his wellkept campus he observes everything and acts immediately that man cutting the lawn is at a point where he should switch to the bigger power mower she wont start the man says president judson king squats behind the machine and makes some adjustments with a screwdriver the machine starts in hospitality hall the dormitory the venetian blinds are closed so the rays of the sun are deflected downward the sun will fade our furniture he says as he reverses the slant of the blinds this is the same man whose foresight has helped the farmers of his own and adjacent counties to have their first contact with the industrial world a corporation was formed with stock offered to the negro farmers at two dollars a share some of the farmers wives made weekly trips to kings strictly utilitarian office to pay for a share of stock at the rate of cents a visit mind you i cant issue you a stock certificate which costs cents to produce until you have purchased ten shares he would say the women didnt mind they and their husbands in a relatively short time accumulated then they looked for a small industrial plant to buy they found one in a neighboring town and their joint investment is now paying per cent we wont identify the business its management is still white the machine operators are negro as far as we were able to learn the town in which the business is located is unaware that it is now negroowned president king finds great satisfaction in the knowledge that some of his people have diversified their financial interests in addition negroes handling the machinery are gaining a technical knowledge and experience they would not have been able to acquire otherwise they can use this new knowledge to particular advantage if they should move into the industrial cities as many do nearly every highschool graduate leaves the area within a year of his commencement exercises it is a good beginning it is impossible to assess the influence judson king exerts in north carolina as head of franklinton center and neighboring tillery he perpetuates and extends the tradition of the organization which founded both these centers that tradition was at its best when the american missionary association went into the south on the heels of the union armies setting up schools for negro freedmen and any whites who would attend more than schools had their beginnings this way franklinton center as it exists today is the result of the merger of two separate institutionsbricks school and franklinton center in franklinton at the end of the th century bricks worked with negro share croppers teaching them to read and write and to improve their agricultural methods later it became a junior college when the school was discontinued the future was uncertain then came the merger efforts to make the new franklinton a conference center were tenuous meanwhile the buildings had fallen into disrepair when one building burned and several others were razed their gaping foundations became dumping groundsunsightly health hazards the vast grounds became overgrown with brush judson king has nearly rebuilt franklinton since he cameand not without excitement as he began to eliminate an old foundation a dragline brought up snakes poisonous moccasins as franklinton has regained its stature its acres have diminished former tenant farmers of the area who once studied at bricks have been sold parcels of land adequate for economically sound farming with the continued cooperation of the center the new landowning families have become successful farmers meanwhile various groups and organizations are using the center for their conferences in addition to the camp mentioned before there have been joint churchmens meetings ministers institutes laymens fellowship meetings the american friends meetings international study caravans conferences on better life for farm families and numerous other conventions less than a score of miles northwest of franklinton is the sprawling community of tillery named for its former white owner when the federal government was selling off the rehabilitation project to negro tenants several local landlords wanted the crossroads site of a community center for business purposes the ama purchased it to preserve it for the use of the tillery community today the tillery community center is operated under the auspices of franklinton center and serves as headquarters for the tillery improvement association which stresses farm home and community improvement one day last august nearly peoplenegro farmers and their familiescrowded into the little auditorium for their fifth annual picnic meeting with the theme farming in the space age they planned for the year ahead and for the years after that during the formal part of the meeting several white farmequipment representatives sat in the audience they had accepted the invitation of tillery to display their equipment on ground space rented at the ridiculously low figure of these men have learned that the tillery farmers will buy equipment only from firms that participate in this annual picnic it is estimated that the gross value of equipment purchased from the exhibitors has reached the sum of that amount of money becomes staggering with the realization that years ago most of the farmers were cultivating small plots with muledrawn plows perhaps the most successful farmer under the tillery influence is a man who has acres of rented land in tobacco com soy beans and cotton his crops are typical of the area so is his forward outlook there is a great amount of cooperation among these farmers as they enjoyed their annual outing the only sour notes were their expressions of disgust about the impenetrable minds and dragging feet of a few of their neighborsneighbors whose refusal to accept change delays the progress of all among these tillery farmers president king shared openshirted comfort conversations between him and the farmers were handled in an offhand manner that bespoke camaraderie king is the director of the tillery center and the local representative of the american missionary association but aside from the prestige of this post he was present at the outing as the most respected person of the community his affability influence and apparently endless knowledge have helped these farmers grow the president of franklinton and tillery is continuously thinking in terms of progress for the negroes in his area he is dedicated to a more effective franklinton both of these concerns have been helped because king has had the courage among other things to hold interracial meetings on his groundsmeetings in which effective communication between negro and white has been initiated franklinton center is dedicated to the service of more than churches of the united church fellowship in north carolina and virginia and to the service of the church universal its work with farmers of the area makes it a practical laboratory with tangible results for the involvement of churches in problems of town and country adjustment it is a living demonstration of the effective application of religion and of religious institutions to the problems of everyday living the influence of franklinton is extensive from time to time farm experts from other areas come in to observe visiting when i was there was dr shaker hammad of the agricultural faculty of the university of alexandria egypt despite its present influence it is apparent that financial limitations inhibit the program how can the center implement its desire to take voter education into the various communities how can young people do research when there is an inadequate library and no set of encyclopedias how can the very poor of the area be helped with clothing problems when few gifts of usable clothing are shipped to the center how can there even be the certainty that franklinton will aave water when the deepwell pump is years old and wheeling about feet deep the well has never run dry and there have been many times when neighboring farmers have had to come to franklinton for water when their wells ran dry the original rosenwald schoolhouse needs repair and hospitality hall could use a new roof an adequate dining room will cost yet as i drove past the college of another denomination a short distance from franklinton i knew wry humor franklintons need for a dining hall is urgent but at the neighboring school bricklayers were erecting a decorative serpentine fencestrictly a luxury itemfor which a benefactor had donated franklinton offers every possible opportunity for meaningful fellowship president king says in this growth toward white and negro fellowship in christ the breaking of legal restraints the removing of personal and social impediments and all the other activities which breach the walls of partition are but necessary preliminary steps and as noble as all these things are the church cannot afford to be satisfied with them nothing less than full fellowship in the body of christ can be our goal what s an american my name is blanchette french you r would assume an unusual t start article perhaps lets continue the fun my mothers name was maloney oh you now thinkfrench and irish too well so what allow me to quote a few lines from louis e lomaxs tomorrows leaders that appeared in the emancipation proclamation centennial edition of ebony magazine in september negroes are terribly confused these days are we africans negroes americans if so which and what do we seek what do we really mean by integration if such a question confuses you does it not follow that i should also be confused am i frenchirish or american i have never delved too deeply into the background of my ancestors but it is possible there is a bit of indian in me toomy gosh what do we have here french irish indian and yet american my confusion you would think must be enormousit isntbecause i know that despite all this ancestral mumbojumbo i am an american we all of us who are americans french irish russian german greek negro hungarian japanesehad our origins founded for us on what are now foreign soils you the negro have as much connection with africa as i with france or ireland the words negro or caucasian do not have too much meaning except where they are useful to certain branches of science interested in the study of man and ancient historyto determine which of our many nationalities lived in a specific place at a specific time and to learn what it is possible to learn of their culture actually you should be proud to be known as an american negro at least you know where you stand we caucasians are in an awful messwith the blood of every nation in the world flowing through our veinswe cant afford to think we simply know we are americans thats all just as you too are americans and there is nothing we can do or should want to do about that i do not particularly care to be called a caucasian not that it is really importantit is just that i am made to feel as a museum piece under the probing eye of a visiting anthropologist for modern use among average men the words negro and caucasian are merely helpful at timesto know if you refer to a man with a light or dark skin we are a common people living together in a common land with educational opportunities steadily improving for negro youth and chances of employment increasing for the adult it will not be long before we are truly united in work and societygeared to the task of making the united states a better place to live for us all the sooner our dispute is wholly solved the sooner we will be able to help settle the more intrinsic problems of unemployment medical aid to the needyand those problems of international proportions there is no such thing as separate but equal we need youyour brains courage determination strength and wisdom there is no real difference between usdont allow the diehard segregationists to fool you the one superficial difference coloronly causes me to envy you you look healthier than i as if youd been out absorbing more fresh air and sunshine actually your war is already won a few more battles perhaps occupational troops for a time and then complete integration and unification in conclusion i provide a quotation so well known it is unnecessary to identify united we standdivided we fall breakers ahead as the wheel turns life becomes progressively more complex and meaningful survival national and personal seems more and more like one long gantlet betweet scylla and charybdis at least this is true for many people tension and anxiety are so much a part of our daily lives that we accept them as normal conditions of existence yet their toll in the disintegration of personality and related problems must be very high indeed recently i heard a woman express her gratification at being able to get through it was an awful year she said so many problems so many tragedies was indeed a fateful year for americans and for most of the people of the world for us it was a year burdened with the kind of events which illustrate the corporate personality of a whole people divulge their national character and reveal their strengths and weaknesses there is no need to catalogue the burden of events with which the year just past was invested for they were of a sort that involved almost every american personally or at least vicariously take the mine disaster in pennsylvania for examplea tragedy which reminded us so poignantly that a mans life is not his alope it belongs at least in part to his family and his friends and even to the larger society even among the most lowly and the most deprived life is a value with which men are loathe to part no matter how poor they are no matter what they do for a living no matter how utterly wretched their existence men want to live for themselves and for those they love and cherish men want to live because tomorrow the reversal may come tomorrow the weight of the centuries may be lifted from their shoulders and some new atlas may be chosen by the fates to bear the burdens of the world for a time and society of course has a stake in the preservation of individual lives although we sometimes behave as if the contrary were true there was the tragedy of unemployment in harlem and west virginia the viet nam incident in far off indochina the murder of the innocents in birmingham all america watched the pageant of the great march of protest on the capital city of the united states there was the dallas incidenta brutal tale in which a man marked for greatness and an uncontested place in history was shot down like a common thief in the most fantastic tragicomedy of modern times while a brave heroic woman showed the world that the dignity of courage need not be subsumed by grief looking back januslike we must concede that was a year of hatred and violence of murder and fear and invective but interstitially it was also a year of heroism and courage and hope few were sorry to see the old year close all of us are apprehensive about the portents of one aspect of the heritage of the american people has been an individualism which has produced on the one hand a rugged independence and a hallowed determination to avoid interference with whatever is not of primary personal concern to the individual because we have until fairly recent times enjoyed a certain isolation from the rest of the world that has functioned to insulate us from most of the worlds problems the occasion for personal involvement in the personal struggles of people elsewhere in the world has not been forcefully presented because america is itself a giant country with plenty of space and elbow room for all we have not been required to take notice of our neighbors this same philosophy of laissez faire has operated at home to produce for most of us an obliviousness of the problems and accomplishments of any outside the primary groups to which we belong as a consequence we have maintained our own privacy and permitted a like privacy to others at the expense of an appalling ignorance of the very factors which threaten the values we cherish so much while the most influential americans have commuted to the suburbs with averted eyes poverty and disease hatred and hostility have filled the vacuums they never permitted themselves to see furthermore because we have so frequently abdicated responsibility to irresponsible people we have as frequently reaped a harvest of incredibly bad government the primary intent of which is to maintain the status quo ie the ignorance and impotence of the responsible in order that the selfaggrandizement of the irresponsible may proceed unhampered the irony of it all is that the most inept rulers always rule in the name of the people while the people themselves are modestly silent and far above it all it is time for the responsible men of this country to take an intelligent appraisal of what is happening in america for if we do not it is inevitable that our most important values will be lost by default ours is a society experiencing the most rapid rate of change in its fundamental values of any society anywhere at any time in history some of this change is good some of it needs to be evaluated some of it is disfunctional to our national purpose and to our survival as a free and independent society our principal danger lies in the fact that in the turbulence of the social flux some changes are imperceptible and go undetected until they are accomplished facts another danger is that in learning to live with modern technology we have become so acclimated to change as to accept it at face value in most areas of our lives we have accepted the dictum that you cant turn back the clock as if all change were progress and as if we have nothing to say about what changes we shall have and what changes we shall avoid we behave as if the world were a huge mechanism already wound and rolling when we got on and we are powerless to deflect it from its course of aimlessness and guide it in the direction of more creative realities it is probably true that none of us can stop the world and get off but each of us can play a decisive part in determining where it is going is going to be a crucial year in the fate of the world and the people of the united states if we are to be participants in the drama of our lives rather than mere objects to be manipulated and shoved here and there by the patterns of events then we must concern ourselves seriously about some of the issues which are before us as individuals citizens and sustainers of the national purpose which embodies the american self image i do not intend to attempt an exhaustive analysis of what is wrong with america nor is such a critique indicated but perhaps it may still be profitable to talk about some of the problems with which we are certain to be confronted they are not problems which we can solve as individuals but in thinking about them and talking about them we help to create a climate more nearly conducive to a realistic expression of the will of the people the category of possibilities is broad but i have selected four areas which i believe will illustrate the gravity of conditions now playing an important part in the shaping of our lives and the circumstances under which we live technology philosophers have argued that the only persistent thing in life the only thing that does not change is change itself the world is forever in the process of change people change institutions change patterns of behavior change so there is nothing very new in the idea of change or the experience of it what is new to contemporary americans and to most of the rest of the world is the rate of changethe speed with which familiar institutions accepted ideas and hardened patterns of behavior are passing out of existence to be replaced by new and unfamiliar entities history becomes increasingly irrelevant as a guide for solving the problems we must face today and tomorrow for example what can we learn from napoleon or clausewitz or pershing or even eisenhower and macarthur about the war we seem to feel we have to fight tomorrow or the day after history used to teach that war was a political instrument that wars could be fought and won peace restored and existing international arrangements altered to the profit and glory of the victor how archaic is this lesson in what can we learn from the political presuppositions of the th century or even of the thirties and forties of the present century we can learn something to be sure from the fundamentals but the specifics of twenty years ago have receded into the realm of the irrelevant today the destiny of america is irrevocably linked to the destiny of every nation in the world because the people of india and a thousand other unnamed communities of asia and africa and south america are dying of hunger we are uneasy with our swollen granaries and rotting potatoes because the people in the congo or in viet nam or in the negev desert or on the island of cypress want to fight each other our farflung armies and probing naval units are restless colonialism and racial oppression in south africa and angola makes us anxious and concerned we are not an island unto ourselves for better or for worse for as long as we can tell and as far as we can see into the future we are indissolubly linked to the mainland of human historyto all nations all races all religions their accomplishments are our own their problems of survival are our problems of survivalclearly even now and even more decisively in the future this is the era of the machine this is the era in which we find ourselves confronted with two infinitiesthe infinity of space and the infinity of nuclear war the chief instrument by which we propose to probe both of these infinities is the machine hence technology has come to bear upon our lives in so many ways and with such force as to give it preeminence among the problems with which responsible americans will have to deal in and the succeeding years if any of all of the scientists who ever lived are living today and they are creating for us a world which threatens to exceed our present political moral and economic capacities i do not believe with the determinists that technology is a force with a life of its own directing the destinies of its creators men do not have to go where technology directs them they do not have to do whatever technology suggests that it is possible to do the imperatives of technology can be resisted but are they it is common knowledge that technology has long since taken over the arms race we build bigger and better bombs for no other reason than that it is technologically possible to do so for years we have had a decisive overkill capacity today we have times the nuclear might needed to annihilate completely any potential aggressor in any quarter of the world it is not for political advantage or national security that we continue to install bigger and more fearsome weapon systems it is because an escalating technology tells us it is possible to do but technology says nothing about the moral implications of our weapon systems or what we plan to do with them we are in danger of becoming prisoners of the very machines we have created to insure our freedom and survivalor at least to be certain that no one else is free or survives in fail safe that disturbing novel dealing with our automated defense system and the possibility of accidental war the authors describe our helplessness to prevent an unprovoked nuclear attack against a potential enemy once a signal has been fed into the machinery by the most unlikely accidentor by technological miscalculation in his book kill and overkill ralph lapp tells about a recent accident in which an american bomber dropped a thermonuclear device on north carolina the device had six foolproof safety locks on it to prevent accidental detonation according to the strategic air command none of these six safety locks could possibly be triggered by accident when the device was examined after being hurled to the earth five of the foolproof safety switches had been triggered but the problem of thermonuclear technology does not confine itself to accidental war it is a problem that searches out our fundamental values technology is a tool an instrument under proper control and direction its function is to serve man not to dominate him it is a means the search for the one best way in the pursuit of efficiency we are in danger of making technology an end in itselfthe prime value of american life along with the blessings of increased efficiency technology has also given us scandalous surpluses of foods mountainous scrapheaps of obsolete machinery and an everincreasing population of unemployed and unemployable men and women we shall have to concern ourselves with the problems of technology and quickly while there is yet time we need human engineering to cope with the increasing problems created by our technologists at a time when we are in need of all the brains we can get we may yet find it expedient to welcome back the socalled eggheads we have so perfunctorily dismissed from time to time economics a second problem is that of our economic order it is in part related to the problem of technology as i have indicated we now have the capacity to produce all of the goods and services needed by americans but not all americans have what they need of what we can produce one fifth of all americans live at or below the level of poverty there are areas in this country which are quite as undeveloped as any in asia or africa the need and the poverty the abject misery saddling the slums of affluent america tell a familiar tale of the inequities of the distribution of wealth in this democratic society fifty million americans do not have enough to eat they are in addition undereducated underemployed and confined to the ghetto if we do not move to rectify these conditions we must inevitably reap the consequences in crime and delinquency the lowering of health standards wasted manpower hostility and social revolution einstein previewed our economic predicament shortly before his death when he declared that the individual has become more conscious than ever of his dependence on society but he views this dependence not as a positive asset nor as a protective force but rather as a threat to his natural rights and to his economic existence we shall have to come to terms with the probability that millions of todays unemployed will never again enjoy sustained employment it is not a question of whether or not they want to work these are human rejects the victims of the technological revolution now in progress we are more fortunate than some countries w h ferry writing in a recent issue of cross currents says that in india for example as many as million indians are unemployed if mr nehrus third five year plan succeeds ferry writes it will produce another million jobs but an additional million people will by then be waiting for them the problem of an escalating technology is not so acute in america yet but we will have a population of million six years from now and the percentage of the permanently unemployed will go up rather than down many americans can be retrained to take their places in the new automated society but many are too old and many do not have the basic education prerequisite to retraining for gainful employment in the space age but these americans have a right to continue to live and with dignity we have a corresponding duty to share with them the benefits of the wondrous technology which has wrested from them the emancipating dignity of work they are the victims of the historical flux if this most advanced of all societies has kept them uneducated unskilled and unemployable for whatever reason or if it has not in times past provided realistic incentives for their development and improvement then ultimately this society must share with them the profits accruing to the birthright of full citizenship they have had no chance to enjoy in a world where people are starving for food no less than for the simple recognition of their humanity and in a society where the imbalance of wealth between those who have and those who suffer from not having is extreme the rationale for such a system becomes less discernible and traditional attitudes about the sacredness and the inviolability of the capitalistic enterprise suffer the gravest erosion the welfare state is not a reasonable alternative for the welfare state destroys the soul while trying to salvage what is left of the body yet a sharply increased sense of responsibilitysocial responsibility which looking beyond the profit motive can see the people brought to distress through instrumentalities they neither recognize nor understand is imperative we may no longer shut out the uncomfortable realities of hunger and crime and destitution by the simple device of averting the eyes or closing the mind for they obtrude into consciousness with a persistence that accepts no further delay international peace the experts list at least five kinds of accidents which could plunge the united states into nuclear war any hour of any day first a miscalculations or misinterpretation of an act by either the united states or russia both the russians and we have tripwire forces set to unlease retaliatory missiles before an attack is experienced if it appears that the other side has mounted an attack secondly the accidental detonation of a nuclear device such as almost happened in north carolina is automatically detected by monitoring devices on both sides but there is no way to tell whether the device was set off accidentally if we think it was not an accident we may attack if the russians think we think it was not an accident they may attack in order to get in the first strike if we think the russians think that we think it was not an accident we may attack so as to strike first and so it goes thirdly we could go to war unintentionally over a military incident that got out of hand such as the holdup of one of our convoys on the autobahn into west germany or the escalation of a local situation like viet nam or cuba or even panama fourth the madman theory of accidental war is viable while the key personnel controlling our weapons systems are carefully screened even the most stable men have been known to break under the tensions associated with such dreadful responsibilities suppose lee harvey oswald had been flying one of the nucleararmed patrol bombers we keep constantly in the sky near the borders of russia or skipper of one of the many polarisbearing submarines we have probing the oceans of the world a fifth type of accidental war may result from technological causes the failure of a machine to correctly assess a given situation and make the right response these are ways in which war may come by accident they do not take into consideration the constant presence of political frictions which could produce war by design all things considered we walk constantly on the edge of the abyss there is no moment of our lives in which we have a reasonable assurance that it will be succeeded by another the anxieties concomitant to such a state of continuing tension and uncertainty is robbing our lives of depth and meaning as we come to accept the inevitability of destruction we generate a value system consistent with this fact of existence while we wish to live in peace psychologically we are perpetually involved in war and we tend to live and express our lives as if life itself were vanity a monstrous joke perpetrated upon a people doomed to die we need a respite from the tension and anxieties of war our psychological orientation needs to be for peace fortunately the era of the big two standing eyeball to eyeball with pushbuttons in hand seems to be declining general u thant secretary of the united nations believes that there are certain unmistakable trends toward new alignments in the world setup there have been fluctuations and vicissitudes in the fortunes of the big powers he says my feeling is that in the seventies if there are seventies the world will witness four big powers the united states of america europe russia and china such a happenstance will signal the decline of russia and the united states to a position among equalsa rebalancing of power which if it does not make peace altogether impossible will at least obviate the standoff between the russians and ourselves our respective peoples the russians and americans deserve a respite from the neurosisproducing anxieties that have so long characterized our relationship as the military sponsors of east versus west our president has made it clear to the soviets that we have no wish to bury anybody and that we ourselves do not intend to be buried perhaps now in we can get on with the matter of disengagement internal peace the most crucial and sensitive problem confronting us today is internal peace the internal peace of this country is predicated upon our ability to reasonably control the violent rightwing extremism which is mushrooming in many of our towns and cities and to equitably resolve the racial issue which threatens to become universal throughout the fifty states at points these two social diseases come together in one foul malignancy but for the most part they represent separate infections which we shall have to fight and fight hard the rightwing extremists like the ku klux klan the white citizens councils the john birch society the socalled christian crusades and others of their ilk are all of a piece led by a handful of sinister expreachers sick retired generals befuddled candymakers and discredited politicians and followed for the most part by weakminded men frustrated housewives and little old ladies in tennis shoes their techniques are slanderous and undemocratic their stockintrade is hatred and suspicion the ends they pursue are diabolical and their danger to america is incalculable they are the kind of people who did the screaming and clawing and cursing at little rock and new orleans who were serpentine enough to dare to spit on a man like adlai stevenson in dallas and who created the climate of hatred and lawlessness that made the assassination of our president a routine expectation the racial situation in this country is not encouraging while some breakthroughs are registered here and there the fundamental patterns of this racist society have changed but little during there were protest demonstrations in the south alone demonstrators were arrested there were thirtyfive bombings and ten people died under circumstances relating to racial protest the savagery we saw in birmingham was a distressing illustration of the bestial hatred characterizing the opposition to social change change is inevitable hatred or no hatred blood or no blood nowhere in the world are intelligent men and women willing any longer to accept subjection to anybody on the flimsy and irrational premise that skin color makes some people better than others the very idea is preposterous and the people who believe it are either ignorant sick or both it is past time for an enlightened america to discard these antiquatedegotistical undemocratic patterns of thinking and get on with the business of making the full range of the common values of citizenship available to all our people in the minds of twenty million determined negro americans discrimination is dead they have sought in every peaceful and reasonable way to communicate this idea to the bigots who keep the country in turmoil by setting themselves up as the racial arbiters of the public conscience but only concerned americans can make america truly democratic and only responsible americans can bring justice and order to this unjust and disordered society let america make haste it is considerably later than we think it has been said that the condition of the american negro is todays bitterest joke about freedom and justice well negroes stopped laughing a long time ago or hasnt anybody noticed monday will be better miss banks was a faj twit miliar sight five morn y ings a week to those living in the older section of town reflecting grand old houses with magnificent lawns sitting snobbishly back from the streets parents could set their clocks and hurry slowmoving children by the time they saw the little gray haired woman walking briskly to the lakewood high school three blocks away during the early spring and fall miss banks always wore a white sweater thrown over her shoulders no matter how warm the weather while carrying a bulging briefcase like a symbol guardedly by her side when the weather became cold and undeterminable miss banks would get out the old black ford of questionable age and drive slowly and too carefully down the streets hunched stiffly over the wheel in her somber black coat and shapeless hat this september morning if there had been those hurrying children or attuning their morning chores to miss banks passing they would have noticed she was ten minutes late and that her usual friendly face was set in a thoughtful mold looking neither right nor left to greet and return a warm smile for the first time in twenty years on the first day of school miss banks had a headache for one long week the ache had persisted in a dull monotonous form causing her to go mechanically through the normal routines of domesticity but on several occasions she had forgotten to feed the cat now as she moved along the streets the tense nervous feeling that had distressed her increased as she neared the school and saw them small groups of people milling around the sidewalk curiously watching the front entrance to the school the women some with metal curlers still entwined in their hair stood with small sleepyeyed children hanging to their cotton housedresses the men were separated into mengroups arms folded khaki baseball caps pulled low over stony leather faces a photographer was busy taking pictures stopping long enough to interrogate the figures standing like a small weaponless army the town police car was parked conspicuously along the street and to miss banks the one sign of normalcy was the orange school bus gliding to a stop when she appeared many turned recognized her as one who had taught them and now their children but they did not speak parts of their mutterings broke against her like muted clipped thunder the niggers come yet its a shame they got schools of their own why want to go to ours why indeed miss banks thought as she purposefully quickened her steps trying to avoid the multitude of gazes she knew or felt were following her no questions please she had no answersonly to her this was the most frightening and confusing time in her life never had she believed something like this would happen to affect her the town and the occupation which she had enjoyed all these years the morningclear and bright loomed large and ominous before her a witchs jeweled stone in her path at this moment she wished she was descending instead of climbing the steps to the sprawling brick schoolthe pride of the town when she entered the familiar odors of chalk sawdust cooking foods and pungent scents that were there last year and would be there years after she had gone assailed her she hurried down the hall to her room miss vladosk of courre was a tall blonde nicelooking girl who taught civics and algebra and had just been there one year goodmorning miss banks paused to smile at the young woman ohyoure late miss vladosk said looking curiously at miss banks to see whether some strange malady had caused this unusual occurrence theyre already in she went on in a whisper gesturing a little excitedly behind her dr robinson thought because of the crowd they should come in the side door now miss banks saw the colored girl sitting alone at the desk this meant the boy assigned her homeroom class was waiting toothere in her room ive been talking to her she heard miss vladosk go on her fathers a minister she seems to be a bright girla little shybut thats understandable yesof course miss banks felt a foreign dampness mist her forehead she extracted a kleenex from her purse dabbing lightly at the moistness its so warm for september the first day of school and i guess im not ready to be back in harness perhaps its time for an old tired woman like me to retire she smiled a tiny smile i think ill get a glass of water would you watch my room until i get back the teachers lounge was thankfully empty and quickly she poured a glass of water from the refrigerator this she halfdrank ending by dumping the contents down the sink a bell sounded pealing shrilly in the room the first bell she had to get back she couldnt delay any longer he was seated directly in front of her desk he was large for his age and the ninth grade seat looked built for a lilliputian he was quite dark and his features swollen stiff black hair closely molded his head like a cap he wore a yellow sport shirt carefully creased brown slacks and polished shoes that looked new the hands gripping the notebook were large and strong looking the lined veins showing a tautness against the skin he reminded her of a painting she had seen of an african prince hanging in the museum she went back to her desk closed her purse in the drawer and did not look at him but at the memo from the principals office about books and supplies then she took out the paper to read the list of names belonging to her homeroom class given at fridays preschool teachers meeting you are james p johnson jr she asked still not looking at him yes maam his voice too was strong and thankfully before anymore could be or had to be said the second bell sounded like a cloudburst familiar students surged in a noisy stream through the halls and into the classroom ohhh look what we got smoky the bear chocolate drop miss banks heard them the muffled whispers which were not muffled at all experience told her she should say something pleasetone your voices down they came in filling up all the seats behind james p johnson until the last ones had to slump noisily in front behind and lastly beside him the third bell sounded school had taken in somehow she managed to get through the morning but each time she looked up there he was a big black splotch marring her view to her it was a little indecent this fly surrounded by milk she tried looking over him to the side of him but neither worked he was still there and then it occurred to her that she could do what she had always done with the masses of them by looking directly at him she found this worked best for then she did not see him at all at lunchtime she went to the cafeteria the colored were already there noticeably seated at a table by themselves four boys and three girls neatly dressed faces shining eating quietly carefully as if they had been cautioned to eat like that james p johnson joined them and now there were eight a representative group arent they miss vladosk sid sliding the tray beside miss banks i hear they were carefully screened by that negro organization miss banks tasted the soup which to her had the same flavor all these years mondayssoup meat loaf peas and milk but she had tea she brought her own bags and they had the hot water ready for her when she passed through the negro organization think im going to enjoy this new experience miss vladosk said smiling i can learn from them and they from meperhaps learn from them what was there to learn from them miss banks thought wasnt that why they were here to learn from us suddenly there was a loud crash a tray had been dropped one of the colored girls bolted upright dress soaked with the hot soup there was a split deathly silence then riotous confusion peppered with the clanging noises of silverware and laughter splayed with boisterous catcalls miss vladosk was there before anyone it was the girl in her room the ministers daughter quickly she handed the girl napkins talking quietly to her as she did while she scanned without seeming to each face closest by miss banks watched her lead the girl out of the room the others at the one distinctive table continued to eat faces expressionless vaguely trying to disconnect the moment she wondered if they liked what they were eating later miss vladosk came to her door and the two of them stood outside talking in low tones we managed to get most of the soup off her dress miss vladosk said shaking her head enough for her to stay the remainder of the day dr robinson was adamant about that an accident miss banks murmured someones careless loud giggles from her room caused miss banks to stop and turn her students looked serene busily writing their assignment all but james p johnson who was looking slowly about him carefully searching each bent face his mouth was bruised in a straight line and his huge body showed signs of harsh rapid breathing an ugly blue stain trickled down and splotched the middle of his broad back inking the yellow shirt in an ugly zigzagging blotch bob miss vladosk whispered i saw that bob waller bob waller popular captain of the football team and son of layton waller president of the board miss banks squeezed her hands together nervously why after all these years did she have to be thrown into something like this the whole idea was ridiculous to begin with you cant make people like what they dont want to like ive got to get back miss vladosk said miss banks sighed with unrestrained relief with miss vladosk gone she did not have to wring and twist with questions and possible threats she could simply ignore it as something she had not seen but she could not ignore james p johnsons face a mixture of bewilderment pain and anger if he were white he would have turned red with fury only he wasnt white he was black how can you tell if a black boy is angry when he cant turn red tuesday and the classes were the same little mounting incidents a sprawled leg a name dropped pushing deliberate avoidance the days following were alike until a month was over october came and the headache still persisted she found herself sleeping less at night forgetting to put the cat out moving around her house like a somnambulist the family doctor had given her some pills to quiet her nerves but even these she forgot to take finally with resigned defeat she decided to ask dr robinson to transfer her to another school the next semester it would hurt to leave lakewood where she knew everyone felt a part even of the pale green walls in her room leaving the students whom she followed with a maternal interest through life but why dr robinson asked seated behind the large desk in his office he was a thin slight man with penetrating blue eyes behind rimless glasses i need a change she said sitting tensely in the straight back chair pushing the mountainous papers and books aside he leaned intently towards her a changea change he murmured questioningly you know this is unusual miss banks you have been with us for years he paused keen eyes focusing steadily on her then softly is it because of the colored student she felt a flushness stealing over and warming her face in this period of transition were all experiencing the pains of adjustment but things never stay as they are and it is up to us educatorsmore than anybody to see that the change is steered carefully through intelligent guidance you arent the only one having difficulties the other teachers are going through what you are miss banks but they are accepting it as a challengenot as something to fear or run away from hewellhe rather frightens me she said looking away frightens youhow i dont know i cant explain her small white hands flailed the air like fluttering wings hes got two eyes two arms and two legs like everybody else hasnt he the wings fell and folded in her lap distilled lightly together she saw where the day was crisscrossed by the venetian blinds and thought barred like his mind he didnt understand he wasnt born and raised in this town like she had been her parents and parents before had helped to shape and build and make real the things the young ones and newcomers were now enjoyingthe library museum community house he didnt know or sense about the town and the people and the way it had always been tell me miss banks do you know anything about negroes what an odd question of course she knew about negroes who doesnt they lived in this town didnt they they lived across the tracks and she saw them downtown on the streets and working in the stores cleaning the floors and washing windows you must remember miss banks i was born only fifteen miles away from this town my town is similar to this town he said gently but nothing growing stays the same no nothing stays the same except the blacknessa gauntlet the albatross around the white mans neck as her father used to say i want you to please reconsider your request think through your problem many of the difficulties you and the other teachers are encountering can be smoothed out with patience and understanding he stood up smiling down at her please dont hesitate to come in to talk anytime after school like youth deputized miss banks thought wryly miss vladosk stopped by her room how are you making out the older woman looked up from the pile of papers she was preparing to take home all right well miss vladosk began briskly after that soup business i gave all my civics classes a damned goodif i say so myselflecture on citizenship then to top that i assigned them a research paper to write on the subject an excellent idea why hadnt she thought of that tomorrow in her american history classes she would skip to the chapter on the united states a melting pot of nations it would be a start but by the next morning she decided they should finish the unit on the rise of political parties instead that afternoon as she listened to the students in her english section recite she thought i must call on him sometime hes been here two months and i havent called on him for a single recitation the time abruptly presented itself when unexpectedly his hand raised to finish the first verse from thoreaus poem love no other hand indicated the answer was known and because of that there was nothing else for her to do but say james p johnson she was astonished by how easily the name came out the class was unusually quiet a movement unheard a breath unknown in anticipation of a wrong answer amazement or surprise that he could even speak she did not know he stood up tall and stalwart as a black warrior slowly he began to recite in a rich sonorous tone let such pure hate still underprop our love that we may be each others conscience and have our sympathy from thence she was not surprised that he was correct his papers were neat and accurate handed in on time more so than the others who had hundreds of social excuses when he finished she said quietly thank you looking down as she did she knew his gaze had not left her face always the eyes were like hot black beacon lights since the bizarre ink incident they seemed to haunt her deliberately focusing never wavering never shifting once when she felt them an uncontrollable urge to look up assailed her and when she did she glimpsed the hurt and confusion shining out novemberthe erratic football month to miss banksthe time when the school was in a fever to win the most important game of the season the homecoming game held on thanksgiving day the boys would practice all hours homeroom periods study periods after school and between classes she added quippishly if they could soldiers training for the great battle but this she was now resigned amending it by concluding extracurricular activities are too a part the month of november did bring cheer to miss banks this was the time when the class collected cans of food to make up holiday baskets for the needy and sick each class donated a basket to a family on a list which only the teacher knew the list was comprised mostly of colored and miss vladosk called it a time when guilty whites assuaged their consciences she scanned the sheet given her by the principal ordinarily she would simply check the next name on the list and send it on but when her eyes ran hurriedly down the page she recognized it immediately james p johnson sr pine street no house number simply pine street she knew the address from her registration book fantastic almost ordained this would be where the basket went a silent gift from the class for the first time in a long while she bebegan to feel enthusiastic about something she would see that the basket would be a very nice one onean ample one fit for a negro family unexpectedly she felt the urge to smile at james p johnson but when she looked up he wasnt there then she remembered friday afternoon he practiced for something or other the last hour of school ohyes football he too was engrossed in the battle of brawn she wished him here to see her smile lightened by her plans the burden did not seem so heavy now miss banks the class had been dismissed for the day james p johnson stood over her desk a black mass looking intently down at her my report card yesyes she said impatiently having just given them out i got two cs in both my classes under youamerican history and english so carefully she closed her books and neatly stacked papers in her briefcase what about it ive been making as and bs on my papers the other courses i got all as and bs your grades kept me off the honor roll anger flushed through her how dare him him she fumbled with the zipper to her bag keeping her eyes down james the word was so quiet and controlled that at first she wondered if she had spoken it at all you have been doing nicely however classroom recitation counts and when she did look up he was gone there was nothing where he had been and all she could think was he moves very quickly very silently for one so large as the days moved one into another miss banks found herself be comine more excited about the basket the collecting of cans almost became an obsession with her each day she reminded the class and like a miser she watched with a deadly concern the daily accumulation each student who brought in a donation received a free ticket to the schools friday movie by thursday when she gave the list a final check there were only two names left not contributing james p johnson and bob waller that bob so forgetful he could afford to bring in a hundred cans that afternoon just as school was dismissed bob waller came to her desk the room was noisy with students wrapped like happy eskimos bounding for the cold blustering day miss banks i almost forgot he said plunking two large cans on her desk these are james and mine a tiny chattering group leaving the room turned for a quick moment as one looking at them james yes mam you know how he leaves before anybody else he left it in his desk guess he forgot to give it to you she stared at the cans both peaches expensive brands and alike i see thank you bob slowly she scratched out their names bob waller and james p johnson as the days wore on there was a difference in the room she could sense itthere was a difference they went through their routines recited handed in assignments conducted homeroom activities but there was something present not there before in their stiff overpoliteness attentiveness and not meeting of eyes and there was a difference with james p johnson more of the boys were talking to him now eating lunch with him being goodnaturedly friendly absently she turned away from the class and gazed out the window the day was bright and sunny but the air was cold and peculiarly she felt a little let down the annual thanksgiving day football game set the tones for the holiday season there was an ebullient expectancy in the air filling it with gaiety she told miss vladosk she would try to attend the game but to her of the most importance was getting the basket to the johnsons this one she intended to deliver herself instead of asking one of the men teachers early that morning she halfdragged and halfcarried the heavy basket to her car propping it in the trunk she drove slowly through town and across the tracks to where the colored lived only when she reached there she found herself getting lost in the tangled maze of dusty roads before she finally discovered pine street which looked exactly like dunbar avenue and jackie robinson boulevard sighing in desperation she pulled the car over to the curb and stopped a woman in a shabby black coat shuffled down the street slightly lopsided from the filled brown greasy bag she carried miss banks leaned cautiously over to the passengers side and called where do the johnsons live frowning the woman eased the bag to the pavement as if relieved that this one instant would excusably give her a rest johnsons which johnsons theres william johnsons a little ways down the street and the thomas johnsons over the james p johnsons ohthem johnsons bout a block down little white house direcly on the corner thank you the house wasnt too different from the others except the shutters had been painted recently and a sears stormdoor added she parked the car and got out to open the trunk grunting with effort she lifted the basket with both hands careful not to brush it against her tweed coat and started up the walk setting the burden down she rang the doorbell after an interminable time and no answer she knocked loudly thinking the bell was out of order the door finally opened and a woman asked yes quickly miss banks dragged the groceries past the woman into the house there she breathed looking up now to smile the woman was tall and dark and towered over her like a sharp angular peak there was no doubt this was james mother the same thick features only the lines were stronger and the dark eyes watching her were like depthless pools im miss banks james teach er the womans eyes did not waver nor did she seem to breathe she was like an impassive statue compressed in brown mud when she did not speak miss banks continued hurriedly breaking the pronounced silence are you his mother yes well miss banks suddenly felt out of breath either from carrying the basket or the moment her gaze quickly scanned the room giving her time to free herself from the unbearable tension the living room served too as a dining room with an old horsehair sofa covered with a clean bedspread to preserve or hide it two overstuffed chairs and a round table ladened with james p johnsons school books she remembered the basket rushingly she explained but the more she talked a heavy curtain veiled the womans eyes like a babbling brook suddenly run dry miss banks stopped realizing she had said all she could until there was no more the room was soundlessthe basket strong between them the woman did not look at the basket only her then she spoke quietly hurriedly in a husky slurred tone my sons tolt me bout you miss banks oh and we dont need no basket not need the basket why how ridiculous the houseeven though it was neat and clean spoke of need but your name was on the list the woman drew herself up in a proud thoughtful line fo months my husbands been out of work they put us on welfare hes a good workera meckanic fo fifteen years he worked at browns garage not missin a day goin at seven and gettin off all hours maybe six eight nine but he liked his job it was a good job then my son signed to go to the white school and my husband was laid off the next day mr brown got hisself

when night comes and we tired we look at our son at that there table with his books and we aint tired no mo miss banks looked at the faded blue wall paper the books piled neatly on the table and back at the woman when she spoke her voice did not sound like hers at all wherewhere is james dont you know slowly she shook her head no she started to say should i no you wouldnt he tolt me how you look at him as if hes dirt how you said nothin when the ink was spilt on his shirt that it took me twodayswash to buy please her eyes searched the womans face pleading you must understand its hard for us toome how you think its been fo us miss banks the power of the woman overcame her she felt helplessweak unable to form the words which needed forming and there was still the question of the basket then suddenly the door swung open accompanied by bellowing whoops bob waller and three other boys she recognized came in carrying james p johnson like a king high on their shoulders he had to bend his head to keep from touching the door sill mrs johnsonwe won bob called triumphantly it was tied and james broke the tie by scoring a touchdown altogether now fellows another yelled hiphiphooray james was eased to the floor like a giant piece of precious china miss banks was surprised to see how white and even his teeth were in the brown smiling face ohmiss banks his face changed to surprise when he saw her then to a blank mask she spoke to him and the others who smiled and kept talking animatedly about the game their whiteness contrasting vividly against the backdrop of james p johnson im mighty proud of my son miss banks when his daddie gets home hell be proud too now james you help miss banks carry that there basket to her car miss banks saw him look down at the basket seeing it for the first time recognizing knowing he looked at his mother and the moment was long and deep and silent you can take it now james his mother said moving her eyes over and above them he lifted the basket avoiding the faces of the boys circling him walking stiffly to the door outside miss banks locked the trunk and turned on him im glad we won james you must be a very good player i didnt do it all miss banks were a team she wanted to say more but there was nothing more to say she reached out and touched his hand it was warm and brown and firm ill see you monday yes mam hey james a boy called impatiently from the house com she drove off watching him in the mirror still standing there in the fast deepening twilight a motionless scarred figure and she knew monday would be better by j noel heermance in richard wright y just back from a fling with communism cio turned his attention once more t o the american scene and produced his powerful novel of social protest native son polished and poignant native son immediately became an archetype of literate negro expression in this country and the social protest novel seemed forever wedded to the expression of negro experience risking oversimplification at this point i think it fair to say that the part which the negro subsequently played in two international wars his tremendous migration into the more politically and economically sensitive cities and the succeeding supreme court decisions all tended to emancipate him from the burden of proving his legal and emotional rights to exist as an american in this country the protest genre still continued of course but now a greater scope came into the novel the novelist now began to examine himself as a man and an american as well as a negro and relatedly he began to examine america itself from a more assured and detached pointed of view and not from the emotional position of achingly desiring membership in it and finally he began to feel so much a part of itand so free to critically examine itthat he began to make major suggestions as to how to change the american society as a wholeand for its own betterment overlooking such negro novelists as frank yerby and john henry clarkemen who have either sought to renounce their negro identity by escaping into the purgatory of writing popular pseudohistorical romances or who have sought to transfer their search for identity to the foreign shores of th or th century africawe will concern ourselves here with the two major figures of contemporary negro fiction in america ralph ellison and james baldwin ralph ellison born in oklahoma city in has written only one novel yet invisible man published in and winner of the national book award for fiction of that year remains so exceptional a novel in its own rightand so monumental a breakthrough in subject matter and expression for the negro novelthat it alone has assured mr ellisons inclusion in the chronology of negro prose fiction invisible man then is a bildungsroman the search for both personal identity and social place by a young unnamed narrator at the same time because it is written by this narrator from a later perspective the novel features both removed exposition and involved narrative developing from this complex structure then we find a negro novel that achieves a new and exciting stature yet in order to see what is so new here perhaps we ought first look at what approaches the old traditionally the negro protest novel concerned itself with defending the negro from the stereotypes held by the white man and then with attacking the white man for this and any other sins or hypocri sies the writer could lay his hands on understandably enough invisible man does not wholly neglect this motif thus there is early in the novel one scene quite reminiscent of this naturalistic protest in it we learn of one jim trueblood a negro dirt farmer who has been guilty of incest with his eldest daughter the sin itself is treated environmentally the nights were cold husband wife and daughter all had to sleep together for warmth trueblood found himself in the midst of a racial dream in which a white man of the town symbolically says they just nigguhs leave em do it and the sin is committed why the daughter slept between husband and wife is never explained nor is it even examined and this i think is significant for it shows that this kind of environmental naturalism is not of great interest to ellison guilt and fault are not at issue here what concerns him more is how the fact of sin affects husband and wife family and negro community family and white community almost immediately we learn the results trueblood has been slugged in the head by an axe the angry extension of his wifes angry arm he understands and accepts this because it is the result of a personal involvement in the fact by his wife at the same time he does not understand the other two reactions principally because they do not represent any recognition of him as a distinct person thus on the one hand the negroes of the town reject him completely and offer to pay his way out of the area for good to them he is merely a disgusting embodiment of the immoral and stereotyped past whose stigma they labor day by day to wash off on the other hand it is the white community which comes to truebloods aid and though their actions are more humanitarian their motives are certainly baser for whites have a morbid curiosity about sex mr ellison seems to imply and it is to hear trueblood describe his sin in all its concreteness that the townspeople offer him jobs and the white state university sends recording interviewers in this world then only the axe at the end of his wifes arm is understandable to the common negro however what is of importance in invisible man is not only how irony rather than pathos plays through this naturalistic scene nor even how that irony is aimed at black and white alike but rather it is important to note the scarcity of such whiteoppressor negrovictim scenes for what is more fundamentally new in invisible man is a certain ironic detachment from the whole naturalistic question altogether and the substitution instead of a concern with white american society on its own terms and in a speaking voice favored by its own white critics such a newly ironic and detached position allows ellison to talk lightlyif pointedlyabout a grotesque widemouthed nigger piggybank with an enormous grin and large black outstretched hand as a piece of early americana just as it allows him to go a little deeper with this tone and quote an insane middle class negro who when laughed at by his fellow inmates for trying to change blood into money retorts i did too i discovered it and john d rockefeller stole the formula from me further ellisons removed position of criticism permits him to dispose of wit altogether and with poignant sympathy quote an old foreman in a modern paint factory as he attempts to cling to an individual pride in the face of automation by asserting that we are the machines inside the machine but perhaps the best example of this new negro interest in american societyand this new position for discussing itis the southern small town night club scene of chapter one where the narrator is a boy of perhaps holden caulfields age led into the main ballroom he suddenly finds himself in the presence of a tall blond white woman dancing naked before the lustfully transfixed townfathers what the young narrator sees then is almost exactly what his salinger counterpart would have seen he notes a certain merchant who followed her hungrily his lips loose and drooling and each time the blonde swayed her undulating hips he ran his hand through the thin hair of his head and with his arms upheld like an intoxicated panda wound his belly in a slow and obscene grind this fascination is rampant among the local businessmen and the scene closes with a wild chase of the woman which ends with her being tossed around as college boys at a hazing it was mad the narrator tells us yet beyond this above the womans red fixedsmiling lips the narrator can see the terror and disgust in her eyes almost like my own terror and that which i saw in some of the other boys it is then a scene of general degradation handled in the mixed tones of disgust wit and compassion and this tone with its application to what becomes essentially a nonracial scene is reason enough for proclaiming invisible man a new novel at the same time it is equally true that ellisons most damaging examination of contemporary commercial america is not made in the vacuum setting of a private allwhite nightclub at all but is instead made in the morning sunlight of the market placeespecially the negro marketplace thus he notes in his wanderings how a whole truckload of defective paint is shipped to a government project with the full approval of the dispatching foreman and more poignantly he describes in antic detail the insane negro inmates of the golden day tavern noting that many of the men had been doctors lawyers teachers civil service workers who were supposed to be members of the professions toward which at variious times i vaguely aspired myself and he notes too the terribly mechanical way that a white philanthropist talks about helping the young narrator enter the american business world you are my fate young man your school that has been my lifes work not my banking or my researches but my firsthand organizing or human life you are important because if you fail i have failed by one individual one defective cog the white world then is essentially a mechanical cage which tries to fit the negro to its commercial ends should he seek to rise above his coglike stature here his world becomes the personal and social chaos of the golden day and its inmates however there are roles for the negro to play within the cage roles of adventure insight and subtlety that are open to him if he will only accept the fact of the cage and work within its confinements and it is the harsh and frank description of these roles which forms another first for invisible man there are in fact five roles open to the negro who recognizes and accepts the cage around him to begin with there is the passive dedicated hating as put forth by the narrators dying grandfather overcome em with yesses undermine em with grins agree em to death and destruction in short let em swaller you till they vomit or bust wide open equally violentthough much more boldly sois the life of the criminal which brings a certain power to a negros sense of identity thus looking at the office wall at his first job interview the narrator notes that the wall was hung with three portraits of dignified old gentlemen in winged collars who looked down from their frames with an assurance and arrogance that i had never seen in any except white men and a few bad razorscarred negroes a third role available to the enterprising and realistic negro is more expansive and spirited in its conception for it is not confined by a passive burning intensity nor is it recklessly defiant in its criminality it is simply amoral thus the ubiquitous rinehart in harlem isall at the same time and with no sense of conflictrine the calculating numbers runner rine the reckless gambler rine the briber rine the romantic lover of dozens and finally rine the reverend pastor of a holy way station which features a neon sign for its narthex and electric guitar for its choir for rinehart the world abounds with possibilities and he is equal to every one of them but perhaps the most devastating revelation of roles is the one portrayed by dr bledsoe the president of a small negro college calling the narrator into his office after the narrator has driven a white trustee to the trueblood shack dr bledsoe angrily asks for an explanation the narrator replies innocently enough that the trustee had ordered him to go ordered you he ordered you dammit white folks are always giving orders its a habit with them why didnt you make an excuse my god boy youre black and living in the southdid you forget how to lie lie sir lie to him lie to a trustee sir me he shook his head with a kind of anguish and me thinking id picked a boy with brain didnt you but i was only trying to please him please him and here you are a junior in college why the dumbest black bastard in the cotton patch knows that the only way to please a white man is to tell him a lie what kind of education are you getting around here who really told you to take him out there he did sir dont lie to me i swear sir no one told me nigger this isnt the time to lie im no white man tell me the truth these then are the four basic possibilities within the cage at the same time though the narrator and mr ellisonhave found a fifth that of descriptive novelist with a certain pride in his inherited past i am not ashamed of my grandparents for having been slaves he tells us i am only ashamed of myself for having at one time been ashamed a proud enjoyment of describing and utilizing the past then marks the texture and meaning of invisible man for ellison himself his own negro identity is as much the expression of the novel as it is the subject of it thus the rhythm and shout of the holy roller revival the rhetoric of the political demagogue the ca dence of the hucksters pitch these are the sounds which form the vital background and meaning of the novel and the negros fifth role the enjoyment of negro rhythm and the fun of its sound the honest identity to be found in folk tale and slang as when the narrator summarizes the meaning of his negro high school education by envisioning himself receiving a diploma that reads simply to whom it may concern keep this niggerboy running these are the fruits of ellisons acceptance of his past and the tools with which he can fashion a role in society to transcend and utilize the cage which otherwise binds him he is still an invisible man to be sure but he is now able like louis armstrong to make poetry out of being invisible in this marked a great new height for negro american fiction when we come to james baldwin now we come to a novelist who is an essayist also and this presents a problem for while this paper l primarily interested in discussion of the negro novel to overlook completely mr baldwins essays articles and interviews is to overlook the fact of his didactic and explanatory novelistic style for like the great majority of negro writers he is an author writing very much out of his experience with a mind intent on a message thus his essays and articles can be very pertinent comments on his novels let us briefly take his three novels in chronological order now to see just what experiences baldwin generally draws upon and what sort of message he elicits from them the difference between invisible man and baldwins first novel go tell it on the mountain is that the invisible man as narrator is constantly wandering among social and political forces in the negros life while johns search in go tell it is one within the personal family the biblical set thine house in order is both haunting echo and essential theme here for go tell it is the semiautobiographical story of a young boy growing up as a negro in harlem under a father who is bitter against the world for its tyrannies yet equally tyrannical within his own household in his struggle with the night and pain and suffering then john chooses personal religious answers rather than social or political ones he becomes converted to jesus not to ellisons brotherhood or the naacp the answer is religious because the problem is seen in such personal terms yet actually the basic problem is the social one of a negro in a white world as well as the personal one of father and son and the point is that baldwin is asking his negro characters to set their house in order before they go out to eradicate the larger social evils of the world it is further interesting to note here i think that baldwin levels the same personal charge at the white liberal in america when he notes in a may mademoisselle interview that they the liberals make no connection between what they do in nightclubs and what they say in print no connection between the ruin of their children and their public pronouncements clearly then this is a fundamental message for mr baldwin as both novelist and essayist just as the personal realm is the fundamental setting for his later two novels as well thus this same personal motif underlines and confines the movement and interests of his second novel giovannis room a story concerned with a uniqueto say the leastromantic triangle involving the choice between hetero and homo sexual love by an american expatriate in paris the point here is to notice just how personal and isolated this little drama is made by the novelist giovanni one side of the triangle is ostensibly a waiter yet we see him in the cafe only twice and neither time does his work impinge on his or ourconsciousness david is the american living on money from home and is so free of responsibilities and outside interests that when he finally decides to love giovanni he is able to sit in giovannis room all day and play housewife and finally hella the second side of the triangle is a traveling womanoff to spain on unknown funds like a hemingway heroine in order to decide if she loves david thus this is a very romantic left bank vacuum in which these characters cogitate and love in another country baldwins last novel to date we are similarly immersed in a small groupthis time of new yorkers and their search for love both hetero and homo in the free setting of greenwich village and we find ourselves once more dealing with an economical dramatic structure confined to three pairs of lovers it is like a large family really especially since the characters are all so much alike and spend so little time outside the loving home of the novels message thus we find again that the central characters in the novel are as noticeably unemployed and uninterested in the world around them as was the case in giovannis room we see the musician rufus far more in bed and at parties than we do on the bandstand likewise vivaldo is a writer whom we never see write and never even overhear think about writing he does have a typewriter we learn but that seems to be only a prop for him to sit behind and muse on intimate problems this same vacuum effect is equally true of all the other characters as well just as the fact that they all tend to think alike further serves to isolate the group as a whole a somewhat closer look at another country now is in order i think since it is a novel as strictly about love within a family as the first two novels but is one which also emphasizes an interracial element thus the critical dramatic question in the novel is seen in vivaldos question to eric hows one to get through it all how can you live if you cant love and how can you live if you do and the general answer comes when eric decides that he wished he could rescue her and make her life less hard but it was only love which could accomplish the miracle of making a life bearableonly love but more important than the general question and general answer here is that the specific answer to this question is ida a vivacious harlem girl whose final marriageofsorts to vivaldo provides the novel with its only happy union and saves vivaldo from the chaos as eric sees it of those lovers who are not needed by the ones whom they need yet salvation from personal chaos is not all that ida brings for she is also a social symbol as well as a personal character thus despite his general personal motif in the novel baldwin does give us an overall social message his thesis then briefly stated runs something like this american today is essentially a dying corrupted society hence the question for the negro is do i really want to be integrated into a burning house or as baldwin more pointedly puts it in his essay down at the cross i am far from convinced that being released from the african witch doctor was worth while if i am now expected to become dependent on the american psychiatrist thus the negroin the figure of idais now intellectually free of the dominance of the white american mind and its values the only thing white people have that black people need or should want baldwin says in the same essay is powerand no one holds power forever at the same time the negro is still an american physically by accident of history and emotionally as well he feels himself very much an american now because the laws of the land and the temper of the people are making him so hence baldwins tone in i accuse my country and my countrymen and also because he has within his past and present the warmth and stamina to supply the redeeming virtue for this american society personal christian love on the one hand this is a love which produces truth and which thereby takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within and on the other hand it is the compassion in the negro to wait while the white world is adjusting to this truth thus baldwin writes to his nephew in my dungeon shook please try to remember that what they believe as well as what they do and cause you to endure does not testify to your inferiority but to their inhumanity and fear there is no reason for you to try to become like white people and there is no basis whatever for their impertinent assumption that they must accept you the really terrible thing old buddy is that you must accept them and i mean that very seriously you must accept them and accept with love for these innocent people have no other hope they are in effect still trapped in a history which they do not understand and until they understand it they cannot be released from it this understanding of love then and the position from which it is offered to american society mark baldwins basic contributions to americanand negro american literature for if ellison emancipated the protesting negro novel by his honest expression of the possibilities within the cage and attempted as well to transcend the cage altogether by his tone of wit and compassionate scorn baldwin has completely turned the cage around and has pictured the white world as trapped within its past history and its present preconceptions thus the cage is on the other foot as it were and the negro is now on the outside looking in only he is looking in with a greater compassion and sensitivity that the white man ever looked in with thus not only is the negro emancipated from his cage but he has attained the even greater staturemoral and religiousof being the free man concerned about the horrible lostness of the prisoner at his most noble then the negro is americas compassionate saviour bringing love to a cold dying society and at his worst he is a caustic critic sarcastically visiting the sick and shut in this is a reversal indeedand marks the highest stage of freedom and assurance the modern negro novel has yet attained in volume of index to court cases of cal laway county on page for the october term is plaintiff the state of defendant celia a slave file no and in the closely written pages of file no there lies a story of violence passion and tragedy it is a story of aged lust of youthful ravishment of blighted birth of jealous betrayal of frenzied destruction of retribution delayed but when it came conclusive and of death on the gallows for a nineteen year old girl whose execution was postponed until after she gave birth to the child of the man whom she had slain and whose body she had caused to be consumed by fire the background of this tragic action was human slavery which had endured in this country for nearly two hundred and fifty years but which was in nearing its legal although not actual close as an institution it had long been under attack because of it unbearable tensions had developed and the nation would soon be cleft in twain in callaway county there were approximately negro slaves and free negroes as compared to a white population of some the fear of a negro insurrection while probably groundless was then a haunting everpresent fear and led to acts of cruelty and oppression which were unnatural and perverted this story properly begins with celia a negro slave girl who in was about fourteen years of age and who was living presumably with her slave parents in audrain county missouri at that time she was purchased by robert n a callaway county farmer who was then some seventy years of age and a grandfather he was a large landowner appears to have been welloff financially was of good standing in his community and was an active churchman with him lived his married daughter virginia w her husband and their two children and an unmarried daughter mary his wife had been deceased since july his two married sons lived in the neighborhood almost immediately after purchasing celia robert n apparently began to have carnal relations with her on this point colonel jefferson f jones testified at her trial in cant say positively whether celia said that deceased had forced her on the way home from audrain county have heard that he did but do not know with certainty whether she told me so regarding the relationship between master and slave in the years following the return to callaway county colonel jones continued she said the old man had sexual intercourse with her her second child was his celia lived with her children in a cabin about sixty steps from the home of her master some four hundred yards farther on was the family burying ground where negroes and whites were interred near together as was the general custom with celia from time to time and surreptitiously there also lived the young negro man george for whom celia evidently had a strong affection george bitterly resented the periodic intrusions of the white master on this point colonel jones testified she said that george had told her that he would have nothing more to do with her if she did not quit the old man this she evidently greatly wanted to do and finally didat the price of her life we come now to the day and to the night of june celia for some months had been pregnant and perhaps as a result of her pregnancy ill according to virginia w celia had been sick took sick in february had been sick ever since had been unable to work since february william powells testimony threw additional light on the relationship of celia and her master she said she threatened that she would hurt him if he did not quit forcing her while she was sick i do not know what her condition was as to health had heard she was sick do not know that she was pregnant judge from her appearance that she was she said she did not intend to kill him virginia w further testified i saw my father in the evening june about twilight reading at a window we all went to bed leaving him in the room he slept in the room he was reading in on the following morning robert n was missing from his home the search instituted by his family was joined by neighbors concerning it virginia w stated record pagewilliam powell further deposed after looking about him i asked his negro boy where he thought he was he stated that he did not believe it was worthwhile to hunt for him anywhere except close around the house for he had reasons to believe he was not far off from the statements of george i believed he had been destroyed in the negro cabin with this information by george the final destruction of celia was assured powell who appears to have been a vigorous crude callous sharpminded individual further testified a passionate plea for civil_rights it is true that prejudice exists in the minds and hearts of men it canej not be eradicated by aw but j firmy be y lieve a sense of fairness and good will also exists in the minds and hearts of men side by side with the prejudice a sense of fairness and good will which shows itself so often in acts of charity and kindness towards others this noble characteristic wants to come out it wants to and often does win out against the prejudice law expressing as it does the moral conscience of the community can help it come out in every person so in the end the prejudice will be dissolved this bill has deep moral implications for the individual and his society for this reason we have seen in recent months an unparalleled show of support for the bill by the religious leadership of america when religious leaders call on us to urge passage of this bill they are not mixing religion and politics this is not a political issue it is a moral issue to be resolved through political means religious leaders can preach they can advise they can lead movements of social action but there comes a point when persuasion must be backed up by law to be effective in the field of civil_rights that point has been reached mr president others have discussed the specific provisions of this bill with more skill than i possess the constitutionality of the bill has been affirmed by the most eminent lawyers in the land but there are some points in each of the major sections i would like to stress the purpose of title i the voting section is to accomplish the aims of the voting rights sections of the civil_rights bills of and had congress known then the weaknesses in those sections i believe these provisions would have been added at that time we learn by experience the civil_rights division of the department of justice under the outstanding leadership of burke marshall has labored for three years to do the job assigned it by the prior legislation its small squadron of attorneys have worked long and hard but every possible legal barrier has been thrown in its path to win after protracted litigation the right to vote in an election held a year ago is no victory the right to vote in federal elections must be enforceable at the time of the election to have any meaning the barriers to the right to vote were taken down in my state over years ago the difference between our social and economic groups have been settled peacefully at the ballot box the way they should be in a democracy it is argued that title vii can only make jobs for negroes by taking them away from whites the same accusation was thrown at the irish in massachusetts in the s the argument is groundless in america because it assumes a stagnant economy we have always had a dynamic jobcreating economy the new income spent by new job holders has created more demand and more jobs in a great upward movement of growth and prosperity mr president this is not a force bill there are no fines or criminal penalties on the contrary the bill abounds with reasonableness with conciliation with voluntary procedures with a moderate approach towards its goals the public accommodations section covers only those types of establishments where discrimination works the severest hardship even these types are exempt if they are small enough so that their integration would disturb the owner in his private life the voting section covers only federal elections it uses the procedures of the courts it creates not special privileges but only tries to prevent irreparable injury the education section creates no new rights the department of justice would be able to sue only to enforce what the constitution already requires the federal program section is equally moderate funds could only be denied to programs where discrimination is practiced other funds could not be affected the procedures under this section must conform to the standard of due process of notice and hearing of the administrative procedures act and the employment section is equally mild companies would have adequate time to comply with its requirements the fair employment commission has no sanctions of its own but must look to the courts for enforcement of its orders in short the bill emphasizes not new rights but remedies of existing rights not coercion but voluntary compliance not the heavy hand of the federal government but the evenhanded justice of the courts of law with provisions as mild as these it can truly be said that even in passing this bill we are still relying primarily on the decency and the tolerance and the conscience of the american people to secure these rights for negro citizens in conclusion mr president there are some personal reasons why i am so interested in passage of this bill as a young man i want to see an america where everyone can make his contribution where a man will be measured not by the color of his skin but by the content of his character as one who has a special concern with the emerging nations of africa and latin america i have seen what discrimination at home does to us in those countries i want to see america respected there and finally i remember the words of president johnson last november th no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor president kennedys memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil_rights bill for which he fought so long my brother was the first president of the united states to state publicly that segregation was morally wrong his heart and his soul are in this bill if his life and death had a meaning it was that we should not hate but love one another we should use our powers not to create conditions of oppression that lead to violence but conditions of freedom that lead to peace it is in that spirit that i hope the senate will pass this bill
in the face of war and death there is a war going on now in the united states anyone who does not understand how this could be possible is more naive fortunately or unfortunately than one would think this century would permit recently in that war four negro children were blown to bits while they were learning to pray the leader of the jackson mississippi naacp himself a reluctant convert to the doctrines of nonviolence was assassinated in front of his home police dogs fire hoses blackjacks have been used on negroes to try to reinforce a simple and brutal social repression and all these terroristic tactics are used finally toward the same end to make young bucks and tottering school marms confess to the same lie the racks and maidens of the inquisition demandedthat there is something other than reality while a negro is under a hose or thrown against a building by some brute he is supporting that lie as well as the lie of his own inferiority the inferiority of the suppliant the readiness of the weak to repeat themselves to be no more than weak or no smarter than their torturers yet in spite of this and in the face of such brutality certain elements in america ask the negro to be nonviolent but who are these elements and what are they really asking on all levels the white man insists that there is no negro in america like the one that claims now to be here or at least there has been a constant and unfailing effort on the part of almost every white man in america and the colonial west to have his own qualified version of a black man exist and not just any black man who might like to appear under his own volition to the southern white and many northerners the sitins are liars the pickets and boycotters all are fiendish liars there is no such negro who would want anything but what weve always given them the white southerner says the negro who wants the foot off his neck must be inspired by communists it is a simple lie to say otherwise they say we know what negroes are what they want governor wallace on television admonishes his black housekeeper warmly yall take care of everything heah the old woman smiles and goes off to take care of his baby that is the negro that really exists for him no other the smiling convicts raking up leaves in his yard he waves as he crosses to his car more real negroes he is on his way to the university to make the fake negroes disappear the liberal white man insists also that there is no such thing as a negro except the thing he has invented they are simply underprivileged the havenots the emerging they are the same as we given an education a livelihood etc and this is the rhetoric but where did all these underprivileged people these havenots come from what for instance are all these black people doing in this country in the first place it is questions like these that the rhetoric is supposed to erase from the liberal white mans mind the fact that the negro was brought here as an african slave and labored some two hundred years in slavery is by now supposedly forgotten during slavery a liberal or a moderate was a man who didnt want the slaves beaten but he was not asking that they be freed certainly the negro middle class has forgotten or at least it is their job to pretend they have forgotten and for this reason even the low moan of blues from some unamerican tenement is almost as much of a social affront as a sign on a water fountain this is the missionaries legacy the last pure remnant of the slave mentality cultural shame what the liberal white man does is to open a door into the glittering mainstream of white american life as a possibility for the middle class black man all the negro need do is renounce his history as pure social error and strive with the rest of the strivers so that he too can help in erecting a monolithic syndrome of predictable social values based on the economic power and hegemony of the american western white man in order for the negro to achieve what i will call an equality of means that is at birth to be able to benefit by everything of value in the society of course the society would have to change almost completely what the liberal white man wants is to change the negro so he can be included in the existing system richard nixon is an example of what the liberal wants the negro to become a drab lower middle class buffoon who has no more political power or cultural significance than his social interment and petty ambition allows very few american white men want the system itself changed and that change complete or to occur with the rudeness of sudden reality abracadabra a family of twelve negroes is living in the next lot what shall we do the cry goes up from the kindest hearts it is the same kind of spurious and pragmatic realism that motivates most american reformers eg most of the socioeconomic policies of roosevelts new deal were not meant to change the society but to strengthen it as it existed roosevelt in this sense gave a flexibility to the american ruling class that it could not have survived without it is like a man who when fire breaks out in his apartment immediately builds a stove around it so far the most serious battles in the war i spoke of are being waged between two classes of white men although the negro middle class is the semiconscious pawn in these struggles the rest of the black population are pawns by default the battles have been waged are being waged now and for the last three hundred years between white men who think the negro is good for one thing and those who think he is good for another this same fight went on during the early days of slavery ie between those of a missionary mentality those who would give the slave christianity thereby excusing the instance of slavery as a moral crusade with concomittant economic advantages and those who felt that as animals the black men had no need for god since as animals they had no souls the fight continues today with the same emphasis except in earlier times the liberal forces the god carriers had only the house slave or occasional freedman to show off as end products of a benevolent christian ethic but now the kennedys and the rockefellers have a full fledged black bourgeoisie to gesture towards as an indication of what the social utopia of the west should look like so the war goes on from battle to battle but with essentially the same things at stake and for the same reasons the forces of naked repression on the one hand have always been out in the open what they want have wanted is common knowledge to negroes once negroes have gotten old enough to know that the world as they will come to know it is basically unfriendly if you are black each class has its own method of making that world unfriendly which makes the quarrel but nothing is really changed complete socioeconomic subjugation is the goal of both white forces what the liberal sees evil about this program is the way it is being carried out liberals want to be leaders moral guides rather than rulers the black middle class and its spiritual forbears the freedmen and house slaves have always fought to maintain some hegemony and privilege and as a privileged class within the american system as definited by the liberalmissionary class of american white man and because of this they have always had to be pawns and tokens in the white class war that constantly goes on trying to decide what to do with negroes the naacp sclc core and any other groups who advocate moral persuasion as their weapon of change reform have been members of the negro middle class or at least bound by that class social sentiments these organizations and others like them are controlled by the negro middle class and largely sponsored by white liberal monies all these people treat history as if it were autonomous and had nothing to do with the people or ideas old slavery for instance and its legacy contemporary social and economic slavery are looked at possibly as hideous accidents for which no one should be blamed the liberal mind is such that it is already trying to persuade us that no one was to blame for hitler or for that matter for joe mccarthy the times are to blame but the fact is that negroes in america are still either field slaves or house slaves the mode of oppression depending on the accident of social breeding one group having easy chairs in its cells the puppet uses to which the historic liberalmissionary syndrome have put the black middle class have grown more bizarre through the years simply because of the increasing dead weight of the black poor which this artificial middle class is supposed to exorcise but this weight if anything has gotten heavier and is felt by all the elements of this society the welfare state was the reformers answer it was and is like a rotten blimp attached to the sleek new airliner thirtyfive dollars a month and carfare to the welfare office is available to each poor negro who rides in this quasilighterthanair ship called ghetto each scream of agony that comes from the airship causes the black middle class who ride in a special airtight compartment of the airliner to ask for more zweibacks in their gleaming bowls so that now there must be a negro assistant press secretary a proposed negro chief of urban affairs a negro for housing etc all of which creates a tiny transistor like industry for the placing of negro tokens booker washington prepared the way for such utilization of negroes martin_luther_king as a recurrent social factor is the same man both men are simply public servants washington solidified the separate but equal lie when that lie was of value to the majority of intelligent white men kings lie is that there is a moral requirement to be met before entrance into the secular kingdom of plenty this is the reason washington said negroes had to labor in the wings in the first place to get ready for this entrance rev king who is formed very clearly and expertly from the same missionary fabric comes bearing the same message of goodwill that once this moral requirement is met by all negroes ie the poor and brutalized will immediately rise once they understand this then they might pass easily and joyously into that burning building which he insists on calling heaven even though gasoline is being spread on the blaze on all sides by every suffering man in the world the reward for piety and high moral concern then is to be a membership in gomorrah in this sense kings main function as was washingtons is as an agent of the middle class power structure black and white he has functioned in montgomery albany birmingham etc as has the negro middle class in general as a buffer a cajoler against action not sanctioned by white intelligence however innocently these functions might collect as moral imperatives in his own mind let it be our blood he has said repeatedly to negroes and his sincerity on this point is not to be questioned he is screaming out to the blimp with the loud speaker of recent agonies he is a much publicized leader of the oppressed but how many of the oppressed are convinced for every token offered in the general interest of keeping goodwill between the black middle class and the liberalmissionary power structure the gap between this invented bourgeoisie and the majority of black men in this country is widened the tokens are more and more bizarre have more and more supposed power and influence but at each instance the poor black man gets even statistically poorer and less accessible to utopian propaganda but the public servant function of the black middle class especially as indicated by the performance of its chiefs like king roy wilkins whitney young etc is one of communication and control that is they present the demands of the black middle class to the white ruling class and in exchange as payment for the meeting of some of these demands usually such social treachery as token integration which involves the creation of a lucrative civil_rights industry they relay that ruling class wishes to the great mass of negroes while making sure that none of this mass becomes autonomous enough to make demands of their own the various vigilante middle class groups like the first student sitins the more militant chapters of core and sncc began autonomously enough but very soon they came into the fold of the mainstream moral suasion groups of which king is the titular if not actual head the reduction of the student nonviolent coordinating committee to mere membership on the rolls of this main black middle class reform element was signified quite blatantly by the censorship of its chairmans john lewis speech at the march on washington ceremonies the montgomery bus boycotts and later disorders as well as the birmingham nearviolence before and after the bombings were all quickly mounted by king and brought to sanctimonious halts hours after the birmigham bombings king was already there moving through crowds of negroes bringing them the word before that when the negroes were marching in that same city king and the other leaders swore that the white men were willing to bargain if only the moral commitment could be made by black men absence of violence was the commitment these leaders asked have always asked and again it was given by lower middle class negroes and those strivers who had to be on the scene and if word got back to the leaders that the silent weight the poor blacks were uneasy at being left to rot in the same ghettos without the slightest hope or chance of their misery being eased except by making that symbolic leap into bourgeois commitment which is the local utopia and dwelt by such uneasiness upon the impossibility of such advice then king would walk among them praying seeking to involve the most oppressed people in this country in an ethic that only has value for the middle class power structure and even in those uses remains artificial except as it maintains local and national social evils with an admirable stability when this uneasiness would manifest itself as actuality or actual possibility then these bearers of the missionary legacy would quickly seek to turn whatever energy that existed into confusion and always shame let it be our blood king says to the poor making an evangelistic identification he trusts even backward white people will understand as leadership and when that cry of passive resistance is translated into common social activity it means very simply do as you have been doing and some white miracle will prove your suffering was accidental and finally worthwhile violence or nonviolence as actualities have never really been real categories rather their use is symbolic in discussing possible goals of any negro progress in this country and the white west negroes except for isolate ie limitedly organized and uncon nected incidents have never been anything else but nonviolent there have been race riots when the liberalizing elements of the white power structure have been briefly stalemated and the brainwashed lower and lowermiddle class whites have clashed with those economically similar groups of negroes in purely idealistic terms the real tragedy is that these two groups could not find goals that were mutually attainable in some kind of egalitarian revolution that would simply overthrow their mutual oppressors and resurrect a system that would be workable for men who could utilize all their energies within it such a revolution was possible at the end of the civil war marx did not study the racial situation in america closely enough nor its macrocosm which has been world wide since the white man realized as e franklin frazier says in his book race and culture contacts in the modern world the extension of control over the colored peoples of the world but the suspicions bred out of race ties and in some cases inculcated in lower class whites by upper class whites purely for their own economic advantage eg at the end of the civil war are much stronger than any purely political method of organization but for the most part there has been no violence from the black man american indians tried violently to defend their lands from white expansionism but the material superiority of western culture and the peculiar aggressiveness of humanist industrialism was of course much too powerful it is a humanist industrialism that has always longed for the twentieth century ie when man really was the measure and literally had his fate clutched quite tightly in his spastic hands a century where the only gods are immediately useful and grow angry only as their worshippers do the moral priggishness of the western white man which grows to insane proportion in america is displayed religiously in every part of the world he has exploited the ritual murders in the name of reason and progress go on every hour in every part of the globe how many nonwhite peoples have been killed in asia in africa in latin america just since in the name of some almost mystical need for a consistently accommodating order the free world is merely that part of the world in which the white man is free to do as he wants with the rest of the people there and he has ruled this way since the elizabethans when the white man says violence he means first of all violence to his system the possibility of outright war to change the political and economic categories of rule but this has to do with thought primarily rather than the actual utilization of arms by negroes to attain some arbitrary political and economic goals the middle class negros first word on the subject of violence as it is sheepishly and unintentionally given reference as a possibility in the real world is that we couldnt win anyway but the real idea expressed here is that the bourgeois black man does not believe he could benefit by a total withdrawal from white society which could be manifest by simple political rebellion and in this sense any attempt at such rebellion represents violence in the same sense the political overtones of the muslim movement represent this kind of violence against the liberal middle class missionary power structure ie as withdrawal and actual political rebellion this is why the intelligent white man and the middle class negro are so frightened of this group because certainly the only real terror in elijah muhammads program is the fact that even though it utilizes a fancied ethnic hegemony as its catalyst its goals and its version of us social history are quite practical as even a thinker like thomas jefferson has attested the slave when freed is to be removed beyond the reach of mixture but a political rebellion within the existing social structure is impossible any energy seen to exist within the superstructure of american society is almost immediately harnessed within acceptable motifs and shaped for use by the mainstream whether the results of this process are called swing music or core the intent is the same white music there is no way the black man can be heard or seen clearly in the existing system muslims would be rounded up and dropped in the grand canyon before any kind of territorial gift would be made absolutely no violence ie real social or political rebellion will be tolerated by the static center and for this reason this center assumes a flexibility which allows it to sweep from right to left without actually moving at all it merely gets stronger and essentially more intransigent we will risk our cities to defend berlin is one answer since negroes have hardly ever tried to mount any organized physical violence and any political violence to the system is by the nature of the black mans oppression almost impossible even though there are attempts from time to time eg the new all black freedom now party which by the very exclusivity of its form proposes a very practical dissent hence violence to the existing party system one might wonder just why it is so necessary for white liberals and the negro middle class to exhort negroes constantly to follow a path that willingly or not they have always followed it would seem if one examines the history of black men in the west and especially in the united states that they have most often been objects of violence rather than its perpetrators it would seem too that if there were any need to caution some group against violence and influence them toward a path of righteous passivity and moral indignation it would be the white man at this point who needed such persuasion as exiled exnaacp leader robert williams has said how much money has been expended to convert the racist brutes of the social jungle of the south to the ism of nonviolence and love how many nonviolent workshops are being conducted in ku klux klan dominated communities and racist strongholds of hate and violence against afroamericans nonviolence as a theory of social and political demeanor concerning american negroes means simply a continuation of the status quo as this theory is applied to define specific terms of personal conduct negroes are supposed to utilize it assumes again the nature of that mysterious moral commitment negro leaders say the black man must make to participate as a privileged class among the oppressed nonviolence on this personal moral level is the most sinister application of the western method of confusing and subjugating people by convincing these people that they the white west know what is best for them since the negro exists at a particular place in american society which has been constantly redefined by the warring elements in white society nonviolence and passive resistance are only the echoes of a contemporary redefinition of the negros place as seen by the most powerful of those elements ie the industrialliberal nee missionary element which since the civil war has held the upper hand in the overall power structure of the society but even couched in purely secular terms the emphasis on passive resistance and moral suasion is an undiluted leftover from the missionary era and its intentions are exactly the same only god has been replaced as he has all over the west with respectability and airconditioning the negro must have both before he is ready for equality is the way another answer goes to enter into the mainstream of american society the negro must lose all identity as a negro as a carrier of possible dissent he must even assume a common cultural liability and when the time comes for this white society to die he will be asked to die with it and for the same reasons that it will die but there is no indication that the poor have any such communal suicide in mind not that they have any theories or bodies of social reasoning to the contrary it is merely that in most parts of america the social system still hews to the intransigence of its beginnings and no real advance into that mainstream is really being offered the white liberals plan is still too academic to really work but then what will happen what will negroes do are there any alternatives all black political thrusts that is any that could issue from the actual needs of the masses of negroes are blocked either by the sham leadership of the middle class negro whose whole tradition is based on abandoning his poorer brothers or by the intransigence of those whites who are behind the times as any liberal spokesman will tell them an america made up strictly of such backward types of white men would survive only a few more years before internal disorder andor external pressures resulted in out and out racial wars asia africa latin america and black america vs the white west but the feigned flexibility of the center permits a toughness for the american way that will take some pushing to topple completely nonviolence is such a feigned flexibility it allows some gesture of social and political protest but offers no real alter native to the existing order but again what is the black mans alternative very simply either he must find some way to do political and social violence to the existing system even though he is hampered at every step by the black middle class and the white power structure or an actual physical violence will result when those four children were killed in the birmingham bombing the us steel plant in that city should have been shut down by negroes black workers should have walked out of every job they hold in the city a general strike should have been called an attempt should have been made to shut down completely the citys industrial resources that city should have died should have been killed by negroes at this writing the bombers have still not been found and attempts have been made toward finding an equitable position for negroes in that city if thats what was supposed to have happened all of this happened two or three weeks after the great march on washington and nothing else could have shown the moral sham involved in that lugubrious display as horribly as that bombing martin_luther_king arrived in birmingham hours after the bombing to quiet the crowds and give a quiet light of hope to the middle class but no real hope or stance is offered by black leaders in the face of such treachery what has been offered is talks in poolrooms with the th st toughs about the dignity of man to men whose dignity consists in their constant resistance to the yoke of cultural compromise white men call their place one young slick haired cat chalking his cue and looking straight into the television camera after that same bombing said theres a whole lotta people aint gonna stand for much more a this meaning i am not the presidents assistant press secretary nor the first negro to appear in a chemical com bank television commercial but nobodys gonna run over me because of it the point is i think that the poor black realizes at least instinctively that no matter what deal goes down ie no matter which side wins out the crackers or the government no help at all is being offered to him the desegregation of schools has been largely a lie the increase of employment among chronically unemployed negroes has also not happened the battle of housing is to see whether a negro who is able to buy a house can live in it there is no doubt that soon he might be able to but that means little to most negroes at this moment even the administrations long touted civil_rights bill is being systematically compromised by its supposed sponsors not that it was very strong to begin with a television commentator says it is a reasonable bill wish to god this man were black so he could get a good idea just how reasonable the bill is such a bill at its strongest is only a token and has no practical application at allin the united nations a few days ago only the united states great britain france and the white free world abstained from voting on a resolution to make illegal any organization that promotes race prejudice in latin america governments change hands monthly and no matter how repressive illegal and nonrepresentative a government might be as long as they play ball with the united states and are anticommunist we say nothing it is only in cuba that something is going on of which we disapprove but why in south vietnam and south korea the united states has supported the most brutal governments in the world part of the sugar quota is transferred to south africa we sign a new contract with franco and this is the society rev king wants to get the poor negro ready to enter better hell itself but partnership in gomorrah is the best thing offered by the white man to the negro in america today this is in essence what the promoters of nonviolence represent to the negro masses the march on washington for instance began as an idea of protest against the system but was quickly turned into a nightclub act and a moral victory for the middle classes with marines and plainclothesmen on the scene just to make sure the audience liked the show they were going to put on nonviolence then is not a protest at all in the context it has been promoted into in america it has to do with india too just as rev king thinks it does just what did nonviolence accomplish there the germans were our enemies and they are better off today than the great majority of indians plague and hunger still ravage india and for all the lies and rhetoric that issue from the west about that countrys independence and the political individuality of mr nehru india for all practical purposes is still a crown colony it is still very much exploited by great britain and the rest of the western world not only does nonviolence usually mean no action at all but it is not nor is it likely to be useful moral concept in the impossible social environment of america especially not in the american south one cannot draw analogies between american liberal proposals for negro nonviolence and the recent algerian quietism under the terror of the oas simply because the algerians were waiting for the french to clear out it was a simple case of resisting a greater malice knowing that the french troops would return if too many colons were killed in retribution for the many algerians who were killed during that period it was a qualified military tactical device which kept the french from marching back at the flank but the negros goal has never except in the late stages of slavery been as clearly delineated as was the algerians in that situation nonviolence in the american context means at its most honest evocation a proposed immersion into the mainstream of a bankrupt american culture and thats all and as i have said even that proposition is finally a fake no such immersion is even possible it is much too late a closer analogy is the fate of the european jews and more specifically the fate of german jews at the hands of adolf hitler the german jews at the time of hitlers rise to power were the most assimilated jews in europe they believed and with a great deal of emotional investment that they were germans the middle class german jew like the middle class american negro had actually moved in many instances into the mainstream of the german society and wanted to believe as that mainstream did even when the antijewish climate began to thicken and take on the heaviness of permanence many middle class jews believed that it was only the poor jews who would suffer in such a climate like these unfortunate jews the middle class negro has no real program of rebellion against the status quo in america quite frankly because he believes he is pretty well off the blatant cultural assassination the social and economic exploitation of most ne groes in this society does not really impress him the middle class negros goal like that of the rest of the american middle class is to be ignorant comfortably what other goals can the negro realize in america the out of date white man who is perhaps in one manner of speaking more honest is offering the negro nothing at all except what has always been offered the black man in white society he is saying that if the negro wants anything further than what the white man has always given him he is going to have to take it and this kind of white man will take steps immediately to see that such taking remainsas it has always remained in the context of an orderly american societyunheard of the liberal white man does not even offer the possibility of such taking his only goal for the negro is that the negro remain nonviolent in exchange for this nonviolence this liberal power structure will send an army into mississippi to see that its symbols are accepted by white and black alike but in essence this is all that this power structure offers and what it hopes negroes will continue to accept it offers negroes nothing further in their or in its lifetime nonviolence then is not being offered as a means to an end but as the end in itself the negros real problem remains to find some actual goal to work toward a complete equality of means is impossible in the present state of american society and even if it were possible the society is horrible enough without negroes swelling its ranks the only genuine way for the negro to achieve a personal automony it seems to me this equality of means would be as a truly active moralizing force within or against american society as it now stands in this sense i advocate a violence a literal destruction of the american sociopolitical stance not only as it directly concerns american negroes but in terms of its strangle hold on most of the modern world the negro must take an extreme stance he must attack the white mans system using his own chains to help beat that system into submission and actual change the black man is the only revolutionary force in american society today if only by default the supposed christian ideal of nonviolence is aimed at quieting even this most natural of insurrectionary elements as as actual moral category all rational men are essentially nonviolent except in defense of their lives to ask that the black man not even defend himself as robert williams tried to defend himself and the rest of the black community of monroe north carolina a few years ago before he was framed on a bogus kidnapping charge by local whites with the aid of the federal government is to ask that the black man stay quiet in his chains while the most liberal elements in this country saw away at those chains with makebelieve saws the negro again in this instance is asked to be what the white man makes of him not only does the white man oppress the negro but he even tells him how to react under this oppression but surely the most patiently christian man must realize that selfdefense in any situation is honest and natural it is also obligatory otherwise there is no use in asking for any right since the asker will probably not be around to benefit by its granting but if the most violent political and social protests are muffled and the exile of robert williams seems to me an example of such muffling the attempted jailing of newsman william worthy for trying to find out about china and cuba another and the moral bankruptcy of the black middle class continues to be used by the white ruling class as its cynical symbol of negro progress then it seems to me that quite soon an actual physical violence will break out for every lie that the liberal power structure tells itself the black bourgeoisie and the rest of the world about the majority of negroes in this country alienates that majority even more critically by not allowing a real grassroots protest issuing from the core of the oppressed black masses the american white man is forcing another kind of protest to take shape one that will shake this whole society at its foundations and succeed in changing it even if only into something worse soon for every sham gesture like the march on washington or the still impending deal king and the other black leaders made with white birmingham there might be twice that many acts of unorganized responsive violence how much longer does anyone in this country black or white think that the th st toughs ie the oppressed black man who has made no deals with the white power structure nor received any favors is going to run from policemen and dogs or stand by and watch while unknown assailants blow up their pitiful homes is it possible that the american white man knows so little about negroes from whatever level he does his observing that he thinks these negroes believe or have ever believed in the justice and morality of the white man left to their own devices the masses of negroes will finally strike back perhaps even kill in a vertiginous gesture of fear and despair their anger will not even matter since it has been a hopelessly familiar element in their emotional lives nonviolence can be your goal if you are already sitting in a comfortable house being brought the news of your oppression over television it can be the normal conduct of rational men if they can believe in the literalness and effectiveness of what they are trying to accomplish by such conduct but walk on any night from one end of th st to the other and count the hundreds of policemen then figure out the climate of rational conduct that is being cultivated by such an environment a legitimate negro protest movement unstalemated by the sham of tokenism and bourgeois intention might succeed in remaking this society and establishing an honest connection between it and the rest of the nonwhite world but most of the leaders of what passes as such protest the middle class negroes and white liberals who have access to courtrooms and picket lines have already sold their souls finally it would seem that for the mass of negroes such leadership as they need will come from within their own ranks bolstered by those young negroes from the middle class who themselves recognize the hopelessness of their social connections but this leadership is most likely to take solid form only in the most repressive and irrational of circumstances the most horrible vision i have is that the white man growing in terror of those suddenly ubiquitous acts of unorganized violence to which the most oppressed black men might resort will grow even more repressive and even the veneer of the liberal establishment will then be stripped away in much the same way that such veneer has been worn away in international affairs or in dealing with the possibility of actual domestic political dissent mail is being opened phones are being tapped the penalty for traveling to cuba is five years in prison and five thousand dollars fine they say where will such insanity lead and in such instances these unconnected acts of responsive violence would increase and perhaps even gradually find their connection the result of such chaos is anybodys guess guerrilla warfare concentration camps one of our congressmen has said recently that our only real ally in africa is south africa and the only foolproof way to completely stop negro protest especially as it grows more agitated by the lies and malice of most of america and agitated into actual bloodletting would be to follow the south african example or hitlers i hope this is a nightmare fantasy but there are very few white men in this country who are doing anything to prevent it the present emphasis on nonviolence rather than honest attempts at socioeconomic reconstruction will only speed the coming of such horror sokagakkai target american negroes from distant japan y p comes an ancient re ligion to win the spiritual support and allegiance of all americans but now with a special emphasis upon changing the religious orientation of the american negro this is the sokagakkai the twelve million member lay organization of nichiren shoshu buddhism the unique practices of nichiren shoshu buddhism are seven centuries old but its postworld war ii lay action organization seeks to make nichiren shoshu buddhism the religion of all humanity although dismissed at first as just another harmlessly bizarre oriental cult the sokagakkai has during recent months been the special target of the japanese and american press for its membership in japan alone numbers some twelve million while powerfully active beachheads have been established abroad outside japan centers have been established in southeast asia in korea taiwan thailand hong kong macao and in vietnam sokagakkai groups are active in the philippines and in australia the movement is firmly established in hawaii okinawa and the united states the sokagakkai is making rapid inroads into portuguesespeaking brazil sokagakkai headquarters have been established in paris france for the promulgation of nichiren shoshu buddhism throughout europe translation of sokagakkai literature into the major european languages has already begun earlier of course sokagakkai literature had been translated and published in the english language explanations of nichiren shoshu doctrines and practice are available now to everyone although but relatively recently established in the united states the sokagakkai has spread its tightly knit organization across the face of america but top leaders in tokyo have felt that an even greater participation of all elements in american life in the sokagakkai is badly needed knowing no color bars the sokagakkai now actively seeks the participation of the american negro in a crusade to change the religious character of the united states and of the world what exactly is this nichiren shoshu buddhism which the sokagakkai is so actively spreading this is a system of esoteric buddhist teachings promulgated by a japanese priest nichiren daishonin who felt that both japan and the buddhism of his day were corrupt and in need of drastic reformation nichiren shoshu buddhism teaches a system of atuning oneself to the basic power and fabric of the cosmos the threefold beginning is the twicedaily practice of the gonkyo ritual veneration of the gohonzon and the chanting of the mystic phrase nammyohorengekyo the gohonzon is a scroll enshrined by every sokagakkai member as a follower of nichiren shoshu buddhism the sokagakkai does not disparage formal and systematic study of its higher teachings but it feels that the gate to true enlightenment and understanding is first through practice contacts are told that the ultimate test of nichiren shoshu buddhism is a pragmatic one try it and see for yourself there is no teaching of a strictly personal god nor does salvation come from anywhere but ones own personal effort however there is a great sea of power within the cosmos which the individual using the techniques of nichiren shoshu can tap for his own betterment what does the sokagakkai seek for the individual personal happiness beginning here and now the sokagakkai teaches that strictly pieinthesky religion is based upon falsehood most of the evils of the world come sokagakkai leaders proclaim from religious faith which is divorced from reality the sokagakkai has been strongly criticized in japan and in the united states for its public and frequent declarations that nichiren shoshu buddhism occupies a position of unique religious truth yet this position of unique religious truth is not merely claimed by nichiren shoshu buddhism alone but by every other vital religion which has shown and is showing dynamic growth the sokagakkai has actually been accused of being militaristic hardly anything could be more untrue or more unfair first and foremost the sokagakkai refused to support many policies of the military clique which embarked japan upon world war ii sokagakkai leaders felt that these policies of the military government were morally and ethically wrong in july the sokagakkai was officially suppressed its top leaders were imprisoned on november tsunesaburo makiguchi one of the cofounders of the sokagakkai died of malnutrition in solitary confinement he died as martyr for his faith his humanitarian principles and for world peace immediately after the end of world war ii almost as american troops were landing as occupation forces the sokagakkai was reestablished to promulgate nichiren shoshu buddhism throughout japan southeast asia and the whole world where does the sokagakkai in the united states stand on negro civil_rights from the time of nichiren daishonin himself nichiren shoshu buddhism has held that human dignity cannot and must not be denied that which makes a man less than a full man goes sokagakkai teaching is evil and evil must be fought between the four seas and under heaven all men are brothers declare the ancient writings of the orient and the sokagakkai cannot see where this is any less true today than when it was written four thousand years ago the sokagakkai in the united states has its national headquarters in los angeles the international headquarters of the sokagakkai in tokyo publishes an englishlanguage weekly newspaper the seikyo news which is available from the los angeles headquarters at a subscription of cents per month the sokagakkai has been accused of being political but this is not true the former political section of the sokagakkai has been made an independent organization never at any time has the sokagakkai concerned itself with the political affairs of other nations nor does it intend to the sokagakkai is not antichristian but it places strong emphasis upon the nonchristian character of nichiren shoshu buddhism it feels that christianity belongs to the past for although being supposedly a religion of peace oceans of blood have been shed in its name too many consider that christianity hopelessly compromised itself by condoning slavery and the negro slave trade during the th century also the sokagakkai feels that such philosophies as marxism are fundamentally false for they are based upon a purely materialistic view of life man is neither a machine nor merely an accidental grouping of matter the sokagakkai rejects both materialism as represented by such philosophies as marxism and false supernaturalism and superstition it seeks the establishment of a third civilization upon the eternal foundation of nichiren shoshu buddhism this third civilization uniting all peoples and fusing the orient and the occident shall be altogether different from anything known in the past youngest federal judge there are those in philadelphia who say theres no telling where a leon higginbotham jr will wind up some see it as quite possible that he might be the first negro to wear the robes of a justice of the supreme court others merely observe that leon will be whatever he sets his mind to being time alone will tell of course but time is what the towering six feet five inches richvoiced jurist has in abundancetime and the ability to use it well at thirtysix higginbotham is united states district judge for the eastern district of pennsylvania the youngest man to sit on that bench in thirty years for more than a year before president kennedy nominated him last fall to the ayear post higginbotham was the first negro member of the federal trade commissionthe first negro ever to serve on any federal regulatory body and the youngest commissioner in history last year the us junior chamber of commerce named him one of the ten outstanding young men in america the same year he won the arthur s flemming award as one of the outstanding young men in the us government his professional and civic virtues have been recognized with enough plaques certificates and framed letters to fill a small hall of fame he hasnt had time to unwrap a few of them and they await unveiling on a shelf in the anteroom to his chambers at the us courthouse his childhood was far removed from the rarefied judicial world he was born in trenton only son of a factory worker who has spent fortythree years on the production line at a refrigerator company and is still there because he likes it higginbothams mother now retired was a domestic he went to public schools in trenton and got fairly high marks at trenton high he played tenor sax and clarinet in the school jazz orchestra summers he worked as a hotel bus boy factory laborer and shoe store porter in his spare time higginbotham frequented the ymca in trenton the ymca director was hilmer l jensen one of the most inspiring men i have ever known judge higginbotham recalled when i talked with him in his office recently this was a segregated y our best piece of equipment was a rickety ping pong tablebut mr jensen would talk to us of our future and our hopes and expose us to higher visions he made us feel somebody in the world cared about us higginbotham pushed on through high school went to purdue university to study electrical engineering while he was a freshman there he took the turn that led him eventually to the bench it began with a door slammed in his face as a member of the varsity debating team higginbotham had gone to evanston ill to take part in a debate with northwestern university when our team checked in the night before at a hotel in evanston the room clerk looked at me fidgeted slightly and murmured sorry we dont accept negroes here young higginbotham spent the night at a ymca but he didnt sleep much by morning he had made up his mind i decided i would become a lawyer i felt i would make a greater impact against such inequalities as a lawyer than as an engineer he transferred soon to antioch college seeking a liberal arts course tailored to his new goal his first day there was more eventful than he realized at the timehe met a sociology coed who ultimately became mrs higginbotham higginbotham started doing something about the fight for racial justice at antioch he headed the students chapter of the naacp later was a research associate for the american council on race relations in chicago working under robert c weaver who is now federal housing administrator in washington after antioch higginbotham entered yale law school before he graduated in he had won more honors in oral advocacy than any student in the schools history he came to philadelphia in got a job as a law clerk with judges curtis bok gerald a flood and louis levinthal mayor richardson dilworth appointed him an assistant district attorney and late that year higginbotham joined the law firm of norris green and harris my clients ran the gamut from murderers to the national baptist convention and the ame church he recalls his star as a leader in philadelphia civic and human relations work rose rapidly governor david l lawrence named him to the pennsylvania human relations commission in he was elected president of the philadel phia branch of the naacp over the protest of a faction led by cecil moore present head of the group who claimed members hadnt been given enough notice of the voting as president of the nations largest urban naacp chapter higginbotham proved a moderate who preferred the law courts to the streets as a battleground for equality says a minister who worked with him leon was never a rabblerouser he appeals to reason he prefers the force of logic and morality to demonstrations to this higginbotham agrees only in part it is every americans right to demonstratebut demonstrations must be lawful they shouldnt be held just to raise he hesitated havoc and he added demonstrations cannot be an end in themselves he took part in peaceful picketing of fiveandtencent stores in because these chains were discriminating against negroes in the south after the supreme court decision of outlawing school segregation higginbotham filed the first school case in pennsylvania using the supreme courts doctrine we filed suit against the lower gwynedd township school board for operating an allnegro school penllyn schoolin montgomery county we received an adverse decision by montgomery county court but the school board integrated the school system before we even filed an appeal he filed the segregation case against the philadelphia school system which is still pending while the school board has filed its own desegregation plan i asked him what he thought was the biggest single factor in the civil_rights battle there is no single solution to unequal rights except the granting of equal rights to all citizens he said progress is being made in this directioni think the negros cause has made greater advances since the kennedy era than in the hundred years before we are now in a process that is irreversible as i see it there is the need for a twopronged attack we must eliminate all of the barriers of actual discrimination that is essential but it is equally essential to stress to young people the change in environment that will permit firstclass opportunities that were not available to them a few years or even a few weeks before he pounded the arm of his chair for emphasis i wish i could make every young boy and girl see that they should prepare themselves on the assumption that the doors that are still closed to them will be open tomorrow but theyll be open only to those who are prepared if sidney poitier had assumed sixteen years ago that there would be no opportunity for him he would not have won the academy award that negro astronaut capt edward dwight jr would not have been appointed if he had dropped out of school years ago the point to me is that despite all deprivations we must stress preparation and i think the motivation should begin not in high school but in kindergarten that goes for white children too although the negro has an extra weight around his neck i mentioned the current chasm between the moderates and what are commonly referred to as the extremists among negro leaders i dont like the word extremist the judge said to many far too manythe fact that the negro dares to stand up and demand his constitutional rights is extremist in itself i agree there is a split between advocates of violence and nonviolence but i firmly believe that those leaders who urge nonviolent conduct will have substantial support of the negro masses he paused thoughtfully the major factor is whether the power structure will respond to their legitimate demands if employers refuse to promote qualified negroes if owners of public accommodations deny them serviceeach such instance causes a diminution of the nonviolent appeal by responsible leaders an implied lack of effectiveness in getting the problem solved so far he said at least ninety five per cent of negroes are behind such leaders as the rev martin_luther_king jr and naacp president roy wilkins most men regardless of their economic level recognize that they stand to gain most by a nonviolent kind of protest and by a respect for the rule of constitutional law he declared i wondered why communism has failed to lure more negroes the negro is realistic enough to know that he can eliminate his deprivation without substituting another form of tyranny despite various levels of education the negro has a high degree of political sophistication he wants racial equalityplus all the other components of democracy why settle for half a loaf i remarked that it was perhaps impossible for a white man to imagine himself in the negros shoes no one he said who hasnt himself experienced discrimination can appreciate it fully some time ago i took a camping trip with my wife and our two children we went to seattle wash and came back via the southern route we had to eat in the car because we wouldnt be served in eating places along the way i suppose some white persons would look upon this more philosophically today judge higginbotham frankly recognizes that his federal judgeship has curbed his role in the civil_rights battle in a narrow sense he cant engage in political and lobbying activities i am supposed to represent all the people he said but i have not retreated from my convictions one step i said that whites often accuse negroes of being prejudiced against them i consider all prejudice and discrimination wrong he said i think antiwhite hatred is as undemocratic as being antinegro but as a realistic matter the twenty million negroes have basically been the victims of one hundred seventy million white americans and some negro porter may be as prejudiced as a white bank president but the consequences are quite different the white bank president can make it a lot harder for the prejudiced negro than the prejudiced negro can make it for the bank president in court these days judge higginbotham maintains a rugged schedule he breezes into his office at am studies briefs confers with lawyers thumbs lawbooks after lunch at a nearby cafeteria he presides over court until sometimes stays in the office until pm takes work home he often greets his secretary mrs essie brock with a cheery hows your adrenalin supply today says mrs brock ive never seen him tired or droopy hes just on the go go go all the time once in desperation i said oh judge why dont you fire me he just laughed and said that would be the easy way outnothing doing the higginbotham family lives in a fiftyyearold house in germantown with six bedrooms three bathrooms and two powder rooms the judge likes to repair the plumbing paint the walls build furniture he likes to cook too and the results one admiring guest told me are out of this world judge higginbotham also tinkers with his trailer like to swim at a pool in yeadon and is a feared tennis player he keeps his towering frame in trim with vigorous basketball romps in his byfoot backyard with son stephen twelve and daughter karen nine i love space he says musing fondly on a trailer vacation trip the family took to nova scotia a couple of years ago marvelous the outdoorsthats real living but he added with a smile he enjoys his days in court too by joseph kennelley are not many nr y negroes in advertis jt k ing why this huge profession employs people in the united states and spends over billion a year growing larger every year it covers such fascinating fields as copywriting art personnel administration buying research marketing and merchandising in such varied businesses as direct mail television retailing mailorder radio public relations publicity outdoor advertising industrial advertising and publishing yet there are very few negroes working in advertising prejudices i personally have found very few signs of prejudices in advertising as a matter of fact ive seen many negroes considered for important advertising positions in the past few years yet turned down by prospective employers i was one of those prospective employers ive frequently talked to other advertising people particularly in the southern california area who have been forced to reject applications by negro job seekers we agreed generally on one point we turned down applicants for the simple reason that we were unable to accept a person totally unacquainted with some phase of advertising frankly though there was another reasona very important one let me cite two examples first my own about six months ago we decided to hire an assistant advertising manager to help us write and design direct mail brochures sales letters and catalogs as one of the largest mail order firms in america we turn out dozens of these advertising pieces every year my firm has not been averse to employing negroes right now of our employees per cent are negroes another per cent have been hired from the mexicanamerican community in los angeles one day the president of our firm suggested that i consider negro applicants in our search for an assistant advertising manager this applicant would if hired fill an important job full of exciting work and offering many opportunities ive been in the advertising profession years and as advertising manager of my firm i could have offered this man helpful guidance i might have steered him into a career that would have brought him high pay prestige and security but unfortunately i didnt have time to break in or trainfromthestart a young man simply because he possessed a burning desire to get into advertising having the desire was not enough i was on the lookout for an applicant who preferably had earned a degree in english or journalism actually though he need not have possessed a degree at all if he could have met one important requirement i contacted three employment agencies in los angeles and hollywood i phoned the los angeles office of the urban league which operates a placement bureau i ran a classified ad in the huge los angeles times there was a grand total of five negro applicants for the job the urban league sent over two young men one of the employment agencies known in advertising circles for its fair employment policy sent two aspirants my ad pulled one negro applicant to white applicants im sorry to say that not one of the negro applicantsalthough i found them all eager and intelligent could offer enough writing background either practical or collegeacquired to make me feel that i should hire him in the case of one applicant i blamed college training rather than the applicant for his inability to land the job this young man was years old showed a friendly personality had certain aptitudes but his writing samplesthose hed written in collegewere very bad so bad indeed that his spelling and punctuation needed about per cent improvement how he passed his college exams in journalism ill never know i really didnt blame himi just regretted that here likely was potential talent gone to waste i advised him to go back to night school and brush upno start overon his grammar and punctuation another case was similar a friend of mine whos been in the advertising agency business for over years recently interviewed two negro men he had an opening in his organization for a young man who could show some writing ability another job opening was that of a fashion artist along with several caucasian applicants he interviewed these two young menboth eager to get into advertising but neither of them had prepared himself properly when one of them was asked if he had read any books on advertisingbooks which he could have picked up at his local libraryhe replied why no how could reading a couple of books on advertising help me get a job in advertising i thought you were looking for somebody with writing experience very well but had this young hopeful written anythingperhaps a newspaper story or a short story or a poem or anythingsince graduating from college no had he enrolled in any writing classes in one of the adult education programs at his local school no had he studied some magazine and newspaper ads cutting out layouts and whole ads studying and analyzing the wordage he especially liked and which appealed to his tastes how were his writing samples the very few he could show to my friend were they good or mediocre today a man must sell himself to get a good job and by selling himself i dont mean displaying a golden gift of gab a smart applicant must display a real interest and be able to back up his reasons for wanting an advertising job by preparing himself for it this sells him having the ability to write well of course isnt the only channel by which you can enter advertising although it is one of the easiest many high salaried persons in advertising got there through art some got jobs through selling or retailing there are even some who entered advertising through the entertainment field others acquired advertising jobs through general office jobs such as finance personnel statistics etc but most of todays highest paid advertising executives reached the top of their ladder by starting from copywriting either by the printed word or by television or radio commercials yes some young fellow right now is earning a week turning out those singing commercials if youre interested in getting into this business do something about it why not enroll in a writing course write a short story or article or even devise a few singing commercials of your own but write one young lady i know used to copy ads in newspapers and magazines she would rearrange the sentences to suit herself sometimes arriving at a brand new idea in the copy before long she was creating her own new fresh ads it was invaluable training when you go on an interview have something tangible to show the person interviewing you let him see that youre not only interested in breaking into advertising but that youve also done something about it heres a field that the negro has hardly dented opportunities are plentiful pay is good the people in advertising are intelligent and friendly and theyll help you over the humps one warning though if you want to be able to take your place in advertising you must learn to write good english know the fundamentals of spelling grammar and punctuation you must learn how to express yourself by the written wordin fresh interesting sentences if you can meet these basic requirements youre going to find it much easier to break into this exciting rewarding profession the patient he was a short bantam cock of a man with deepset dark ey es and black hair and he seemed vaguely familiarlike someone i had seen once standing in a schoolhouse doorway somewhere i waved him to the couch and he stretched out on it with a nervous quickness i notice that you didnt give the receptionist your name when you made the appointment i started in my easiest couchside manner just mr x thats part of it thats part of the whole thing he snapped back spastically i dont remember my name i dont know who i am at all and thats your problem then i said presumptuously no no no he said quickly i told you that was just part of it the other is worse much worse all right shoot i said i realize thats pretty jazzy phraseology for a psychoanalyst but we headshrinkers have to live a little too my patient raised up on the couch and glanced nervously about him you sure there arent any of them here he asked nervously any of who here i inquired glancing around over my shoulders too you know any of them here he said confidentially theyre everywhere these days you know in the pentagon and the white house and the un and all the restrooms i still didnt know who he was talking about but i figured it stood to reason that if they were in the pentagon and the white house and the un sooner or later they would have to use the restrooms well i dont think there are any of them here i said because theres nobody in this room but you and i good good he said im glad to see you havent let them infiltrate your office i decided to use what is known technically in my profession as the imonyourside approach i certainly havent i said firmly you know thats my problem he said lying back down and seemingly starting to loosen up im beginning to think that im one of them too suppose you start at the beginning suggested in what i considered to be a very sound professional tone well you see ive been making all these speeches lately he said in wisconsin and indiana and maryland and all over and i was careful not to say anything against them not directly i just talked about how our individual liberties were being taken away from us by the federal government and that the issue was really one of states rights and that i had never in my life said anything personal against any of them i see i said with a few somber nods actually i had no idea what he was trying to tell me but if you ask a patient what the hell he is talking about somehow it kind of shatters the doctorpatient relationship he went on but even though i didnt say anything about them i began to notice them everywhere i went they were on street corners and riding the buses and driving the taxis and taking my luggage up to my hotel rooms and when i would ring for room service one of them would show up i would go to a movie and there one of them would be sitting right behind me and i was walking down a street one afternoon humming a song and before long i noticed one of them walking along beside me humming the same tune hmmm i said then it started he declared i mean it really started i would be talking to a large audience and at first i noticed a few of them out there then as time went on some nights it looked like the audience was all them and instead of cheering me they would be laughing at me and they would all follow me back to my hotel chanting and singing all happylike and poking me in the ribs and tapping me on the shoulder and inviting me to sing with them my my i said it was like they were slowly enveloping me swallowing me up then it began to happen what what i asked sitting on the edge of my chair slowly i began to get sensitive about my tan he said im from the south you know and the sun gets pretty bright down there well anyway pretty soon it seemed like my tan was getting darker and darker even though i started staying out of the sunlight as much as possible and once i scared the daylights out of myself when i woke up in the middle of the night and looked in the mirror and couldnt see anything but my eyes and my teeth i nearly had a coronary before i realized i had forgotten to turn on the lights goodness gracious i said doctor he went on solemnly ive begun to think im colored ahem i see i replied clearing my throat and this disturbs you you damn right it disturbs me he shot back bolting upright on the couch wouldnt it disturb you if you woke up all of a sudden and found out you were colored well i dont know i said look at it this way scientifically theres no difference in the races theres really only a visionary difference and perhaps a state of mind so what does it really matter if what does it matter he shouted man dont you realize whats happening to me i get on a bus and i go take a seat in the back i take off my hat whenever i speak to white ladies i never get in front of a white person in a line im worried about my kids having to go to a segregated school and getting a secondclass education doctor ive got a problem i sat quietly for a moment looking at him as he tried to regain his composure finally i said yes i guess you do have a problem but we cant solve it overnight this is going to take a little time can you come back same hour same day next week i couldnt possibly make it next week he said oh i said inquisitively next week i have to go to st augustine fla to sit in a restaurant demonstration he answered matteroffactly it took me a minute to get myself together well then maybe the week after that i asked fine if im not in jail er sure sure well see you then governor i said he was halfway to the door and stopped why did you call me that he asked what oh governor well i dont know really it just seemed to sort of pop out thats it thats it he said jubilantly its beginning to come back to me thats my first name im governor somebody governor is kind of a funny name i said maybe its really a title dont be silly he snapped reaching for the doorknob who ever heard of a colored governor he slammed the door and was gone the psychiatric profession has come a long way from sigmund freuds time to this day but even now we have to admit there are some nuts in this world a negro novelist remembered sometimes gre are either not nized or are forgo by the commun where they spent t early life but not always garet mcmahan wrote a sunday feature on november for the fayetteville n c observer in which she said the first negro author in the united states to win lavish praise from literary critics was born of fayetteville parents and spent his boyhood and early manhood in fayetteville and north carolina he was one of the first north carolinians of either race to make a national name for himself in the field of letters the negro literary pioneer she was referring to was charles waddell chesnutt the subject of this article the negro woman chloe sampson and her daughter ann maria were leaving fayetteville the year was and they were fearful and full of insecurity they were free colored people but laws had been passed which took away their suffrage the nat turner insurrection had taken place and the southern whites were jittery concerning negroes the free negroes no longer enjoyed any more civil_rights than the slaves ann maria was a young woman with a brilliant mind she had a desire to be a teacher and had in fact been secretly teaching slave children to read and write she did this at great personal risk because in the decade before the civil war the teaching of slaves was forbidden ann maria could no longer tolerate her condition in the south she prevailed on her mother chloe to go north in they joined a little band of free colored people who were preparing to go north by wagon train they headed for cleveland ohio to join a colony of negroes who had gone there earlier in the group of pilgrims who were headed for cleveland was a young negro man named andrew jackson chesnutt he joined the wagon train but his destination was indiana where he hoped to live with his uncle a respected and wellknown citizen andrew jackson chesnutts father was a substantial farmer and drayman of fayetteville north carolina the elder chesnutt was a member of the cross creek school board he was one of five negroes who purchased jointly a lot where was later built the howard schooleventually to become the negro state normal school and later still to become fayetteville state teachers college ann maria sampson and andrew jackson chesnutt fell in love as the wagon train slowly prodded towards cleveland it was heartbreaking for both young people when andrew departed the wagon train and continued alone towards indiana chloe sampson purchased a little house on hudson street in cleveland andrews uncle was helping his bright young nephew get an education in indiana but andrew couldnt keep his mind on his studies for thoughts of ann maria that kept intervening one day in june andrew left indiana headed for cleveland on july ann maria sampson and andrew jackson chesnutt went down to the probate court and obtained a marriage license the following day they were married charles waddell chesnutt who was the first of thirteen children was bom in cleveland ohio on june the civil war started when charles was three years old andrew chesnutt joined the union army and served as a teamster at the wars end andrew found himself near fayetteville he went over to fayetteville to visit his father who had become old and feeble he found his father in such poor physical condition that he couldnt bear to leave him and return to cleveland andrew sent for ann maria and the children ann maria was reluctant to return to her place of birth because she enjoyed the freedom she had known in cleveland but being a dutiful wife she packed up and joined andrew in fayetteville andrews father set him up in business on gillespie street in fayetteville it proved to be a thriving grocery store young charles was enrolled in the howard school named for union general o o howard who did so much for negro education such as establishing howard university charles was a bright boy from the very start and earned a remarkable scholastic record george haigh was a leading citizen of fayetteville who ran a good bookstore he saw that charles had much intellectual ability and was enchanted by books haigh gave the boy the freedom of his store and encouraged him to read dr edward lilly a member of the fayetteville school board had the finest library in town he also recognized charles ability and gave the boy permission to make complete use of his library charles tried to aid his fathers store business by peddling needles pins thread buttons et cetra one of his students later said he would sit down and display his wares and while the customer made his selection chesnutt would become completely absorbed in any book within reach charles chesnutt was a precocious youth and he sold his first story a serial to a weekly newspaper when he was only fourteen years old even at this age he yearned to be a creative writer he wanted to express his feelings and thoughts in words that would be read by others chesnutts formal education did not extend beyond howard school which had the high school grades and some studies of the higher branches of learning but he had great intellectual curiosity and he was a voracious reader he devoured books by the bushel and acquired an excellent liberal education robert harris was charles teacher and principal at howard school harris was a spiritual man and charles greatly admired him harris had much influence on his young pupil robert harris brother cicero harris was the principal of a negro school in charlotte at age sixteen charles chesnutt was sent to charlotte to be an assistant to cicero harris young charles spent three years with cicero harris in charlotte sharing a room sharing teaching duties and eating their meals together charles was much taken with cicero harris as he had been with robert harris cicero had a great christian influence on his young colleague chesnutt spent the other two years between and teaching in other north carolina schools near fayetteville one of these years was spent teaching in a school ten miles from spartanburg south carolina during that summer he wrote in his journal i am in the woods again ten miles from spartanburg i came up here yesterday july afternoon i am in a large old frame house my room is upstairs it is spacious and tolerably pleasant the people are very anxious to please i begin to feel a little charlottesick and to wish i could see j if she were here i should be contented i wish i could write to her without her mothers reading the letters i would write nothing improper of course but i would pour out my heart i love the girl and i hope she loves me and will continue to do so here is a lock of her hair i kiss the lock of hair and press it to my bosom would it were she i wish i were about twentyfive years old and had about a thousand dollars or so and she were a few years older id marry her if shed have me and i think she would the lonesome young man had fallen in love with a young girl in charlotte charles wrote in his journal on march judge tourgee has sold the fools errand i understand for i suppose he had already received a large royalty on the sale of the first editions the work has gained an astonishing degree of popularity and is to be translated into the french now judge tourgees book is about the souththe manners customs modes of thoughts etc judge tourgee is a northern man who has lived in the south since the war until recently there is something romantic to the northern mind about the southern negro and there is a romantic side to the history of this people and if judge tourgee with his necessarily limited intercourse with colored people and his limited stay in the south can write such interesting descriptions why could not a colored man who has lived among people all his life why could not such a man if he possessed the same ability write a good book about the south as judge tourgee has written but the man is yet to make his appearance and if i cant be the man i shall be the first to rejoice at his debut and give god speed to his work on may charles wrote further on the subject in his journal i think i must write a book i am almost afraid to undertake a book so early and with so little experience in composition but it has been my cherished dream and i feel an influence that i cannot resist calling me to the task but young chesnutts book writing was to wait awhile in the fall of robert harris died the local board of managers of the state normal school at fayetteville insisted that chesnutt go to raleigh the state capital and apply for the position of principal of the school in november at age chesnutt started as principal of the normal school teacher training his salary was per month while serving as principal charles bought himself an organ and taught himself to play it he served as organist in the old historic evans metropolitan methodist church he also served as choir master and superintendent of the sunday school on june chesnutt had married susan perry the daughter of a welltodo and highly respected negro edwin perry proprietor of the barber shop in the fayetteville hotel on sunday mornings a familiar sight in fayetteville was chesnutt on his way to church with one of his babes in arms while serving as principal in fayetteville chesnutt met a white professor of german extraction chesnutt wanted to continue his learning on june he wrote in his journal professor neufeld has consented to give me instruction in french and german three lessons a weektuesdays and thursdays from to and saturdays in the morning i am happy to have this golden opportunity i pay mr neufeld per month and i should willingly pay if necessary he wrote further in his journal i do think that i shall ever forget my latin the labor i spend in trying to understand it thoroughly and the patience which i am compelled to exercise in clearing up the doubtful or difficult points furnish it seems to me as severe a course of mental discipline as a college course would afford i have now spent four months in the study of greek and according to my plans for the session i must now stop and devote my time to phonography and composition in preparation for a different work from the one i am now engaged in a little while later chesnutt began the study of stenography because he wanted to go north and earn his living other than by teaching he thought this would also prepare him for any field of knowledge he declared i hope to write words a minute in two months time by may the young principal had attained his goal and could write words per minute he decided to take his family and start a new life in new york city the school board in fayetteville reluctantly accepted his resignation he had won the respect and esteem of the townspeople of fayetteville members of the school board wrote him glowing recommendations the fayetteville observer of june wrote a flattering editorial on the departing principal immediately upon arriving in new york chesnutt found employment as a reporter for dow jones on wall street chesnutt didnt especially enjoy this type work he stayed with it five years and then he returned to his place of birth cleveland he studied law in the office of judge samuel e williamson later general counsel for the new york central railroad and was admitted to the ohio bar about this time chesnutt began to write in a desultory fashion for various magazines and newspaper syndicates his first published story as an adult was uncle peters house it was based on scenes across the cape fear river where his father had owned property his stories were shortly to appear in puck tidbits two tales the independent the overland monthly century magazine and the atlantic monthly the atlantic monthly in published a negro author for the first time when they published chesnutts the goopered grapevine this was part of a series of seven folk stories later collected in chesnutts first book the conjure woman published in by houghton mifflin and company the year was a boom year for chesnutts writings he wrote the wife of his youth and other stories of the colorline and also an excellent biography of frederick douglass the negro leader the douglass biography was a part of the beacon biographies series on eminent americans the wife of his youth part of a group of short stories is a tale of a very fair colored man who just before the civil war by the aid of his negro wife makes his way from slavery to freedom to a northern city groveland cleveland he makes a success in business and becomes socially prominent and is on the verge of marrying a young white widow when the wife of his youth appears on the scene chesnutts first novel the house behind the cedars is commonly given first rank among his novels in this story the heroine rena walden is sought in love by three men george tryon a white man whose love fails when put to the test jeff wain a coarse and brutal mulatto and frank fowler a devoted young negro who sacrifices all for the love of rena in before he left north carolina chesnutt went to raleigh to report a speech by frederick douglass for the raleigh signal at this time he made this interesting resolve the object of my writings would be not so much the elevation of the colored people as the elevation of the whitesfor i consider the unjust spirit of caste which is so insidious as to pervade a whole nation and so powerful as to subject a whole race and all connected with it to scorn and social ostracismi consider this a barrier to the moral progress of the american people and i would be the one first to head a determined organized crusade against it the stories in the conjure woman are related by a wily exslave uncle julius to a white couple unlike uncle remus of joel chandler harris fame chesnutt has his uncle julius showing the tragedy of slavery his sly wit and a keen awareness of his own interests chesnutt had grave doubts on the question of dialects he wrote one of his publishers the fact is of course that there is no such thing as a negro dialect that what we call by that name is the attempt to express with such a degree of phonetic correctness as to suggest the sound english pronounced as an ignorant old southern negro would be supposed to speak it and at the same time to preserve a sufficient approximation to the correct spelling to make it easy reading i do not imagine i have got my dialect even now any more uniform than other writers of the same sort of matter the marrow oj tradition has been called by some an american classic it was written shortly after the spanishamerican war had ended and is the first negro novel to deal with the negro question in the specific setting of imperialism chesnutt made this observation on liberty at the time he wrote the book the nation was rushing forward with giant strides toward colossal wealth and worlddomination before the exigencies of which mere abstract ethical theories must not be permitted to stand the same argument that justified the conquest of an inferior nation could not be denied to those who sought the suppression of an inferior race one reviewer noted mr chesnutt has made a most powerful argument in favor of social recognition but it seems a waste of time and energy in the present state of american civilization chesnutt was disheartened by the small sales record of the marrow of tradition he wrote his publishers im beginning to suspect that the public as a rule does not care for books in which the principal characters are colored people or written with a striking sympathy with that race as contrasted with the white race his next novel the colonels dream which exposed peonage and the convict lease system did not have large sales either it was a hard blow charles w chestnutt was only when the colonels dream was published but he wrote no more novels after that on june chesnutt was awarded the spingarn medal for his pioneer work as a literary artist depicting the life and struggles of americans of negro descent and for his distinguished career as a publicspirited citizen harles waddell chesnutt came to the end of his frutiful life on november at cleveland ohio his body lay in his library surrounded by his beloved books people who represented every walk of life in america every creed and color attended the simple episcopal service margaret mcmahan the writer says charles waddell chesnutt has stood the test of time he remains one of the nations great writers and north carolinas most outstanding negro authora literary great a word artist by norma fay hamilton i waiting

and wife formal the first negro president of the united states not ten minutes but nearly twenty minutes had passed and still the direct communications line from the alte mainzer palace in frankfurt am main to the cabinet room of the white house in washington d c had not been repaired only general pitt fortney who had asked edna to order the coffee had not had the time to finish more than half of his cup impatient with the delay irritated by the unexplained inefficiency he had been up and down at the handset telephone and away from it and back to it belaboring the signal corps for not yet making the presidents private line operative minutes ago he had bellowed into the telephone at some pentagon underling dammit colonel if you arent fixing to get those wires up im going to get sac to fly me over in a b and do the job myself now get cracking they were no longer gathered around the cabinet table general fortney like a caged and offended beast was pacing near the telephone jed stover stood beside the bookcase beneath the mantel with its model ships examining the titles of the various volumes near him propped on the arm of a chair senator dilman was lighting the stub of his cigar and again reading a sheet of paper he held in his hand before the open door to ednas office senator selander and representative wickland were engaged in a conversation secretary of state eaton his back to the others his hands clasped behind him stood at the french doors contemplating the rose garden in the dull august morning governor talley was making an inquiry of leach the stenotypist thus it was that edna foster found them as she returned to the cabinet room from her office where she had met with tim flannery the press secretary to inform him that the conference call while still interrupted would soon be resumed passing selander and wickland she heard a snatch of their conversation senator selander was saying dont you worry your head none about old hoyt watson hes the most reliable member of the senate southerner or not hes still internationalminded hell go with t c its that damn troublemaker in your house im worried about cant you control zeke miller and that lousy newspaper chain of his he hasnt let up a day on aup representative wickland was at once defensive leave him to me i can handle him he likes t c hes received plenty of patronage from t c i tell him the president wants aup why zeke miller wont obstruct him senator selander appeared unconvinced for someone who likes t c hes sure raising hell with t cs cabinet did you see what he let reb blaser publish in the citizenamerican about eaton dirty politics i tell you edna foster who had hung back to hear the last saw that both majority leaders were turning to inspect eaton embarrassed at eavesdropping she hurried to her purse lying on the table opening it to find a cigarette she cast a surreptitious glance at eaton still at the french doors still contemplating the rose garden she wondered if he was thinking about reb blasers column in the washington citizenamerican leaving dinner last night george had bought the newspaper peering briefly at the baseball scores and reb blasers story as they walked toward her apartment george had showed her the column it had been devoted to the low moral tone of the department of state and then boldly revealed information from an inside informant that the secretary of state and his attractive socialite wife kay varney eaton were on the verge of a divorce the gossip column had pointed out that of the days past kay varney eaton and her husband had been together in the capital city only sixtyeight days in fact reb blaser had pointed out she was now in miami being seen in nightclubs with cartnell the renowned decorator while herequally renowned husband rattled around alone in their elegant georgetown mansion we can only hope reb blaser had concluded that our secretary of state will be more successful in maintaining peace with the soviet union than with his wife of twoandtwenty years edna remembered that she had considered blasers column disgraceful and she had blamed his publisher congressman zeke miller for allowing even encouraging such attacks she had been surprised to find george defending both blaser and miller he had he had said only admiration for their news sense and for their honesty edna had quickly forgiven george understanding that as a member of the white house press corps he would naturally defend and admire his own now edna realized that arthur eaton had come away from the window and caught her staring at him flushing she turned away only to observe senator dilman going out the corridor door probably to the washroom she decided to talk to jed stover at the bookshelves starting toward the under secretary of african affairs she became aware of a folded paper lying on the green carpet behind stover quickly she went to it picked it up and opened it in order to find out to whom it belonged the embossed letterhead she saw bore the name trafford university in the left corner was the smaller lettering office of the chancellordr chauncey l mckaye it was addressed to dear senator dilman not meaning to go further but unable to escape the typed words in the single paragraph that followed edna realized that the head of the university at the suggestion of the dean of men was writing the senator about his son julian dilman a sophomore whose grades had seriously fallen off and who would have to be placed on probation if this continued she noticed words like inattentive and disrespectful and the phrase more interested in outside activities of late than in his schooling she folded the letter embarrassed to have seen its private contents but for the first time she thought of dilman as a human being of those in the room she knew senator dilman the least this was because since t c had been president dilman had been less frequently in the white house than the others only in the few days between the vicepresidents death and the presidents departure for frankfurt had dilman appeared several times with the majority leader but now this letter in ednas hand it gave him a son a son who was a problem and it made him a father not just another senator but a human being noticing that dilman had reappeared and was making his way toward selander and wickland edna hurried to intercept him senator i found this on the floor she said apparently you dropped it im sorry i had to open it senator dilman accepted the letter with the slightest smile its quite all right thank you edna turned in time to see wayne talley approaching eaton arthur its past two in the afternoon in frankfurt t cs probably gone back into the conference think theres any point in waiting around like this eaton shrugged he addressed not only talley but everyone i think we have no choice but to wait the president just may feel this is important enough to delay the conference he may want to speak to us further as if the deferment in resuming communications were a personal affront general fortney charged at the regular telephone once more for the hundredth time it seemed he was calling the signal corps about to continue to her chair and shorthand pad edna slowed down listening hard she thought that she had heard her own telephone ring in her office she was listening trying to make it out above fortneys voice when she heard representative wickland the person nearest to her open door call to her miss foster your phoneshe darted past the congressman into her office slipped between the electric typewriter stand and the table holding the television set and caught up the receiver in midring hello she answered the presidents office for a suspended moment she heard nothing more than the wavy swooshing sound that indicates a longdistance call then a voice came on a strange voice from far away and it said is this the white house who is this this is the presidents personal secretary miss foster may i ask who is calling oh miss fostermiss foster and suddenly edna felt goose pimples on her arms and a chill across her back for the disembodied voice was quavering and frantic miss fosterthis is zwinnambassador zwinn in frankfurtmiss foster the voice seemed to be choked and then it shouted out theres been a terrible emergency get me someonetalleyget me talley with emergency with terrible emergency edna found herself shivering and the receiver in her right hand shaking one secondone second please she blinked at the open door to the cabinet room and screamed out governor talley governor come here something terrible has happened talley burst through the door on the run puzzled curious searching her face she merely wagged her head wordlessly and shoved the receiver into his hands as he took up the telephone she backed away from the desk and could see the room rapidly filling with the others all looking from her to talley wonderingly who talley was saying into the receiver zwinn oh ambassador i didnt know his speech halted as abruptly as if his throat had been cut he listened and listened and as he did so his lips began to move but dumbness remained and his face turned grayer and grayer until it was finally ghostwhite at last he spoke are you sure are you positive the president and then listening lifting his head from the mouthpiece to stare at eaton and the others yes ambassador he was saying again yes i understandi cant believe ityes yes i do believe you ill tell them well get right back to you talley lowered the receiver onto the cradle and stood rooted to the spot a portrait of stunned disbelief eaton came slowly toward him what the devil is wrong wayne what has happened talley tried to speak tried to form the words mouthing them then stuttering them out the prespresidentthe president is dead what eaton grabbed talleys shoulder roughly shaking him what in the hell are you saying who was that what did he say arthur that was ambassador zwinn part of that building in frankfurt collapsedthat goddam ancient palacethe top caved in on two rooms and one was t cs studywhere he was talking to usthats what happened thats what cut off the call broke down everythingfell on him all of themkilled the presidents dead arthur dead eaton was ashen but controlled are you sure is it certain dead whimpered talley killed instantly blocks slabs of granite fell down on him crushed him they have the body two secret service agents in the room too dead all dead oh godgod what a terrible terrible thing that moment the corridor was flung open and tim flannery burst in crying out have you heard associated press just got the bulletin from frankfurt the president he halted eyes going from one dazed face to the other and then he knew that they had heard eatons face was hidden in his palms and then suddenly he looked up the president dead he said that means the speaker of the housewayne what about the speaker earl macpherson was in there what about him talley did not seem to comprehend eaton spoke louder dammit man is macpherson alive or dead alive muttered talley hei dont knowi think hes in pretty good shapenothing criticaltheyve got him over at the hospital theyre working on him this is the worst tragedy in our history the worst whats going to happen to all of us eaton closed his eyes us he repeated the roof just fell in on us too and when he opened his eyes edna foster could tell for the first time that they were wet it was hard to tell because she was weeping and she did not know if she would ever stop night had come to washington a city like the nation dumbed down in grief and mourning night had come to the late presidents oval office where those who had worked with him and for him who had known him and loved him who had depended upon him and needed him now filled the sofas and armchairs forlorn and disconsolate stood in corners heavyhearted and helpless waiting for they knew not what edna foster eyes swollen lips still quivering came into the office with the latest special editions of the evening newspapers and wobbled through the cheerless room passing out copies all who had been in the cabinet room ten hours before were present here but now there were also many others edna recognized attorney general clay kemmler secretary of the treasury vernon moody cia director montgomery scott senator hoyt watson admiral alfred rivard and at least a halfdozen more of equal standing it seemed that every nook and cranny in the oval room was filled except one and that one the vacant place tonight was the late presidents highbacked black leather armchair behind the buchanan desk having finished passing out the newspapers edna found that she was left with one copy the group beside the french doors that led to the rose garden the group consisting of senator selander representative wickland general fortney and secretary of state eaton were reading the front page of the newspaper that senator selander held out for them or rather edna became aware all were reading the front page except eaton whose attention was disengaged whose attention was turned inward there was much more to the news story and many more similar stories on the front page but edna foster had no desire to read further casting the newspaper aside she realized that wayne talley and tim flannery were whispering in the doorway to her office now talley was returning heading for arthur eaton stand by edna he said then reaching eaton he said they have an open line to frankfurt no word on macpherson yet hes been almost three hours in surgery tim spoke to ambassador zwinn briefly the first phase of the operation was successful but theres still a way to go but everyone is feeling better they expect to swear macpherson in the minute he comes out of the anesthetic i think tim and i better draft a press release there are more than a thousand accredited correspondents out there baying for news go ahead said eaton disinterestedly talley hesitated i know howhow you still feel arthur i know how close t c was to you i cant get used to it myself im numb who would have ever dreamt that such a thing go draft that release said eaton curtly then he added let me know the second you receive any flash on mac okay edna saw talley signal her edna he said tim and i need you i know its tough but we have to dictate something about macpherson succeeding t c as president dumbly edna foster nodded her assent hating this moment of surrender of bitter truth when her employer would be supplanted by another she followed the presidential aide into her small office shut the door behind her and observed that tim flannery had already drawn up two folding chairs since he and talley were sitting she went around the desk to take her accustomed place in the walnut swivel chair she located her shorthand pad and several sharp pencils flannery waved toward the pencils dont take anything yet edna wayne and i want to talk this out first flannery had already handed the aide a sheaf of papers which talley was studying intently everything here talley inquired still reading everything said flannery the boys on the judiciary committee pitched in and also the justices gave us material and for the background we had the legislative reference service at the library of congress busy youll find the presidential succession acts of and in full with pertinent sections marked out then theres a lot of legal and background data all severely condensed isnt it amazing how you go along and never think of anything like this said talley youd think id know most of this but i dont i know eight presidents died in office before t c but i never knew this that eight vicepresidents died in office also nine vicepresidents counting poor porter ten days ago talley looked up blankly christ i forgot all about him today seems to have blotted everything else out half listening edna doodled on her pad then as talley read on she began to print the names of the nine presidents including t c who had died in office she printed william harrison zachary taylor abraham lincoln james garfield warren harding franklin d roosevelt john f kennedy and then t c she counted eight who was the ninth then she remembered and printed the name of william mckinley between garfield and harding next she tried to think of the vicepresidents who had died in office she could think of only elbridge gerry henry wilson garret hobart and porter and not another finally she gave up there was no use thinking about it she felt ill she heard talleys strained voice i somehow believed that almost every president who didnt finish his term was assassinated but it says here that not more than four were shot down lincoln garfield mckinley and kennedy said flannery fingers pressing his forehead harrison and harding died in part of pneumonia taylors death was caused by cholera morbus fdr suffered a cerebral hemorrhage like porter incredible but poor t c was the only one ever to be snuffed out by an accident he shrugged i suppose it had to happen to someone sometime then he added wretchedly only why did it have to be t c edna had been watching tim flannery as he spoke and there was a sweetness about him behind his whole facade of forced factuality that she liked very much he was a tall irishman with unruly rust hair and a small reddish mustache and a wide ingenuous florid face now puffy and blotched by sorrow he looked as tweedy as his suits with their leather elbow patches and he had been a midwest newspaperman who had written several highly respected history books on the side it said much for him that most of the cynical white house press corps and her own george among them liked tim flannery chrisamighty but im sure not in the mood for this governor talley was saying his one crossed eye contemplated the ceiling and then reluctantly came down to the papers in his hands well guess somebodys got to do it might as well get it over with let me see tim says here that speaker earl macpherson will fill one year and five months of t cs unexpired term is that correct give or take a few days yes said flannery almost inaudibly he seemed to make an effort to pull himself together all the past vicepresidents who succeeded presidents had over three years of unexpired terms to fill except filmore who served two years and eight months of taylors term and coolidge who picked up one year and seven months of hardings unexpired term and lyndon johnson who served one year and three months of kennedys unexpired term macpherson will have a long enough way to go in thein the presidency yes he will said talley with gravity he touched the sheaf of papers in his hand you say here this is the first time in our history we have ever lost both men elected to serve us for four years never happened before said tim flannery but as clinton rossiter wrote in the american presidency this is no guarantee for the future how right he was flannery pointed to the sheaf of papers did you notice that other quotation from rossiter which one flannery had bent forward and pointed to a paragraph on the top page right there he read it aloud if we are only poorly prepared for a double vacancy we are not prepared at all for a multiple vacancy and it is this kind of vacancy so i am told by colleagues who deal in the laws of probability that we are most likely to be faced with during the next hundred years and beyond tally frowned im not interested in that im interested in the facts tim nothing else were faced with a double vacancy not a multiple one lets check the presidential succession act of just get it straight before we dictate the release to edna he had begun turning the pages and at last he found it here it is okay clear and simple if the presidency and vicepresidency are vacant the speaker of the house of representatives shall upon his resignation as speaker and as representative in congress act as president his gaze moved down the page yes clear enoughpresident vicepresident speaker of the house and after that the order of succession is president pro tempore of the senate secretary of state secretary of the treasury secretary of defense attorney general and so forth through the cabinet he raised his head any speaker even come half this close to the presidency before not while speaker no said tim flannery one former speaker polk was later elected president but none ever okay theres always got to be a first time said talley he handed the papers back to the press secretary so its the speaker of the house grumpy old earl macpherson himselfwhod have believed it possible okay thats the law and no matter how we feel we might as well start dictating some kind of press announcement flannery snapped his fingers i forgot to get a capsule of macphersons background some of that should be in too definitely said talley flannery twisted in his chair toward edna can you be a good girl and fetch representative harvey wickland in here he can give us what we need for now on macpherson edna came out of her swivel chair hastened to the door leading to the presidents oval office opened it and then halted surprised everyone in the crowded room was on his feet all converging upon arthur eaton who stood in the center of the room in the middle of the eagle of the united states design woven into the thick green presidential rug edna turned to flannery and talley somethings happening she exclaimed everyones gathering around secretary eaton immediately talley and flannery jumped to their feet pushing past her into the room toward eaton reluctantly edna followed them toward the center of the oval office eaton his voice dry and low was speaking aloud i have just been called outside to take a telephone call from frankfurt i have terrible news to report to all of you terrible news and it grieves me speaker of the house earl macpherson died in surgery on the table under the knife ten minutes ago this has been confirmed now the speaker is also dead a great gasp swelled through the room and off somewhere there was someone hysterically sobbing and after that there was a sickening silence edna heard tim flannery beside her whisper almost to himself multiple vacancy the first to be heard speaking aloud was governor wayne talley i dont believe it the second to be heard aloud was arthur eaton it is true then it was that general pitt fortney called out who in the hell is t cs successor arthur eaton held up his head according to the presidential succession act of the next in line is the presidents pro tempore of the united states senate for strange and suspenseful seconds the secretary of states pronouncement hung in the air and those who heard it were immobilized allowing it to sink into their minds as the curved walls with their niches and shelves of dead mementos seemed to close in on them the president pro tempore of the senate the attorney general intoned as someone might intone amen and then at once all at once collectively each in the room seemed to realize who this was who their next president of the united states was and all at once all of them collectively turned their gaze upon the one man who stood somewhat apart from them near the buchanan desk everyone it seemed was staring at senator douglass dilman and for edna it was frightening to see that in each persons eyes without exception there was registered a look of horror within thirty minutes the group grown larger from the arrival of other members of the government had assembled in the cabinet room they stood now in the semicircle with an opening in the center for two still photographers and two television cameramen representing the press pool clustered around the sevenfoot dark mahogany table once while waiting eaton had asked douglass dilman if he had any close relatives or friends in the city whom he might wish to have witness the ceremony he had replied in an undertone no sir no one once minutes ago eaton had beckoned to edna and tim flannery and demanded a bible there was much scurrying about but no copy of the bible was to be found until edna remembered the one in the lower drawer of her desk she had gone to get it and found the cheap battered bible a gideon bible she had borrowed from a hotel room in memphis once on a trip with t c and had forgotten to return and which she now retained for reference purposes guiltily she had brought in the gideon bible and given it to eaton she found herself still standing beside eaton who leaned against the highbacked leather chair bearing the tiny brass nameplate secretary of state she heard eaton inquire of senator dilman do you wish this open on any particular passage she heard dilman reply psalms slowly eaton leafed through the book and then he said is this it except the lord build the house they labour in vain that build it except the lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain he glanced inquiringly at dilman and dilman swallowed his adams apple bobbing and said yes sir that is it it was during this moment that noah f johnstone chief justice of the supreme court came through the corridor door and across the room gravely nodding at the familiar faces turned toward him even without his robes edna thought even in his bow tie and dark suit the chief justice appeared impressive he was a giant of a man with a slight stoop and an uneven gait his sunken face wrinkled and wise betrayed no emotion he came around the cabinet table into the glare of klieg lights nodding to talley and then to dilman and eaton and he took his position behind t cs old chair are we ready he inquired of no one in particular and then he accepted the open gideon bible from eaton squinted down at it and said to dilman take the holy book in your left hand and raise your right hand i will recite the oath of office as it is written in article ii section of the constitution of the united states when i have finished please repeat the oath he proffered the bible to dilman who took it and held it with difficulty in his left hand and raised his trembling right hand chief justice johnstone lifted his own right hand and measuring each word he rendered the oath of office when he was done he waited after a painful interlude douglass dilmans thick lips moved and the words that he repeated came out low and slurred i douglass dilman do solemnly swear that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states he halted and looked around the room bewildered as if seeking a friend in a company of strangers the harsh kliegs blended with the light of the overhead neon grill made the witnesses to the historic tableau seem ghostly he had lowered his right hand and suddenly chief justice johnstone reached out and grasped dilmans right hand in his own and shook it mr president the chief justice was saying we deeply mourn the passing of our beloved past president but the continuity of our government the welfare of our country must stand above any one individual in these perilous times our hearts go out to you for your double burden and may the lord in heaven bless you and watch over you as the new chief executive of this nationandas the first negro to become president of the united states it was the muffled sound of argument that awakened him there was a thin line of ache behind his forehead as he listened sorting and separating the muffled sound into two sounds the first shrill and feminine cross and indignant the second low and male calm and placating his head was deep in the fat pillow so deep that when he turned he could not see the time the pillow had been handmade by aldora almost doublesized and stuffed with gray goose down and presented to him on their first anniversary so long ago when their marriage still had hope the cross fire of altercation beyond his bedroom wall increasingly abrasive continued louder he lifted himself ever so slightly on his forearm and was able to make out the time on the electric clock humming upon the end table beside the bed it was eight fiftytwo and although the room was darkened by the drawn shades he knew that it was morning he realized that he had meant to be awakened earlier had meant to set the alarm but had forgotten to do so before falling asleep the shutoff lever on his telephone had banished all calls and in his utter exhaustion he had slumbered on and on it was shameful he thought behind the headache and as always to do anything shameful alarmed him other men could afford mistakes small and large but he could afford none not the smallest one several times during his residence in washington he had awakened with the remnant of the same dream that he had been treading water in an enormous aquarium and that all its sides were painted with blue eyes staring at him the shimmering fragment of dream had always left him uneasy but now the private hook of humor that he possessed but had not dared to reveal to anyone but wanda and his closest friends extricated him from the fish bowl and he was free to admit to himself that he had performed his first act as the president of the united states he had overslept suddenly the enormity of what had happened last night and of what he was oppressed him with its unreality and automatically forced him to retreat into the cup of the down pillow he had he remembered been told by someone last night that after formally resigning from the senate he had become the president of the united states at ten thirtyseven in the evening he had not been returned to his brownstone row house until after one oclock in the morning it was almost impossible to recollect what had taken place in the time between he had signed something yes his first official signing he had affixed his name to the proclamation that poor speaker macpherson was sup posed to have signed the same statement that had been hastily prepared for the speaker and was to have been flown to frankfurt this proclamation was the official announcement of t cs funeral and the period of national mourning he had listened to secretary of state arthur eaton and governor wayne talley expound on the critical roemer conference and he had not absorbed a word of it he had sat with them smoking cigars until his eyes smarted and his throat felt blistered and he had sat with the sympathetic press secretary yes tim flannery the redhead preparing the carefully worded release to all the news media then others had swum about them senators and representatives whom he had known during work hours for years and t cs cabinet members whom he had hardly known at all and they had spoken of approaches and strategies and public relations and the party and he had been grateful that they had addressed eaton and talley and flannery and not himself he had been almost physically ill from the tension of the events of that day and evening and after midnight there had been a stirring and rising and he had been released guided to a cadillac limousine outside the south portico he remembered protesting against the two secret service agents who had entered the limousine with him and protesting with embarrassment against both the motorcycle escort of police which had preceded him and the second car of agents which had followed him to his home he recalled the scene outside his home and how he had begged hugo gaynor the chief of secret service who had followed him into his living room to go home and how gaynor had been adamant about staying and he remembered how he had surrendered from exhaustion desiring only to escape to his bedroom and sleep alone away from the blue eyes around the glass aquarium the sound of the argument beyond his bedroom wall was persisting it had probably been going on steadily in the seconds of his introspection and now at last he was able to place himself accurately in the time of day and the routine of his former life and he knew what was going on in his living room it was crystal and a secret service agent who were locked in debate crystal had come to him through an employment agency during his fourth term in the house of representatives and because he had been alone and was still alone she had grown fiercely maternal in her devotion to his comfort five days a week she appeared at eightthirty to prepare his breakfast make his bed clean his flat market for him she worked until twelvethirty then disappeared to tend to her own home which included her sisters family and then returned at threethirty remaining to cook and serve his dinner often not leaving until eight oclock in the evening she was a poor cook a burner of toast and a slipshod housekeeper a sweeper under the rug but she was prompt loyal busy and relatively unobtrusive that is until recently when she had taken to carrying on always quoting her brotherinlaw a gas station attendant about the tumerite group who were out to ruin the one chance that the colored folk would ever have for economic improvement through that rehabilitation subsidy act for negroes that was being talked about at once the reason for the altercation in the living room was clear to him crystal had arrived as usual and found the secret service waiting which was unusual the irresistible force had collided with the immovable object douglass dilman threw aside his electric blanket and swung out of bed he stood up straightening his blue pajamas stuck his feet into the misshapen slippers picked his polkadot cotton robe off the chair and pulled it on he walked to the bureau mirror and looked at himself his black kinky hair as always after sleep was shoved high into a peak at the back of his head he took the widetoothed comb and ran it through his full hair smoothing down the peak he poked at the inner corners of his bloodshot eyes to wipe and clear them he studied his broad indelicate countenance he was darkwell black but not coalblackand his features were negroid his forehead was high his nose full and wide his lips heavy and protruding at fiftytwo years of age he was overweight not yet fat but stocky and thick tim flannery he remembered had asked for the statistics last night and he had said that he was five feet ten inches cheating a halfinch for more stature and pounds his appearance a bigcity ward heeler had once told him worked for him his lack of height his tackiness the antithesis of the fearsome young negro buck combined with mild refined caucasian speech and mannerisms made him more acceptable to the white labor voters his unmistakable negro features made him authentic and agreeable to the black menial voters oftentimes in the past he had wished that he could be all one or the other like the members of his family pitiful dead aldora had been light tan often mistaken for a spaniard and he was sure this had contributed to what had happened wretched julian his son was as dark as himself black really but possessed of features less coarse than his own pathetic mindy his daughter was or had been when he had last set eyes on her six years ago white and beautiful white and lovely which had pleased her mother had worried him had made julian resentful and had made mindy herself haughty and impossible he thought that he heard crystals sharp voice through the wall wake him up she was demanding he knotted the belt of his robe crossed to the door went through the narrow hallway and turned left into the living room the sight that met him was not unexpected beneath the arch that led from the entry hall into the living room stood the shiny bulging crystal shapeless in her tent of brown coat still holding the morning newspapers in one hand and the inevitable huge straw basket for leftovers for her sisters hound in her right hand blocking her way stood lanky elderly hugo gaynor chief of the secret service the wellproportioned excalifornia athlete whom dilman recognized as lou agajanian chief of the white house detail of the secret service it was crystal who saw dilman first she waved her fat hand and shrieked senator they wont let me ini gotta get up breakfast gaynor spun around and agajanian did the same and both were instantly respectful and apologetic mr president gaynor said we have no idea who this lady is we cant let people without credentials in here simply because they say they work for you can you imagine what dilman nodded shes quite safe mr gaynor crystal has been my housekeeper for years i should have advised you last night hello mr agajanian i think weve met once or twice good morning crystal its all right now you can come in obediently the agents parted backed off and the magic of it made crystals eyes bulge her unsubtle black face was almost comically transformed from indignation to triumph to pleasure to awe she waddled toward dilman halted eyes widening ii almost forgot to say senatorpresidentmr presidentbut i want to be the first to congratulate you and also for my sister and brotherinlaw and the kids thank you crystal thank you she began to go sideways still awed and then she stopped we stayed up late and it was all over the television everyone was sorry about the others but were happy that if it had to be then mercy were sureenough happy it is you ii almost didnt come here this morning i was sort of sure youd be in the white house with a special fancy staff and not needing me any more dilman smiled i wont be in the white house for a while and you can be sure crystal ill want you then as much as i want you now she seemed overwhelmed with relief thank you senamrmr president suddenly her round face broke into a toothy smile enamel and gold and she said ill have to take lessons how to talk to you whatll it be this special morning anything special the same as always crystal give me fifteen minutes or so ive got to shower and dress she was off to the dining room and kitchen straw basket swinging and dilman smiled at the two secret service executives shes here every day he said and weekends her niece comes in gaynor said well have to trouble you for a full list of your employees and friends youll have it today mr president there are a number of calls that have come in anything important i dont believe anything urgent the secretary of state wants to speak to you when youre up oh yes one personal callwell he phoned two or three times from new yorka young man claims to be your son julian thats right mr president gave the name julian dilman said hed call back again at half past nine all right better give me time to get myself cleaned up and into some clothes he started to go then said over his shoulder you can ask crystal to make something for you you must be starved thank you mr president the two secret service officers said in duet the tone of their voices hung inside douglass dilmans ears as he walked back to the bedroom he was attuned to every nuance of every utterance that came from his white colleagues the changeable inflection of speech was their civilized weapon of subtle mockery and superiority without insult even when you were a congressman this was their best weapon when they found that your skin was black and thin you could not prove disrespect but you could know its vibrations he remembered one committee hearing when general pitt fortney had appeared as a witness before him and the others he had posed a question and fortneys reply in print on the record had been beyond reproach in writing it was a general replying sensibly to a senator across the committee tables verbalized it had been a west point white general speaking downward to a semiliterate jigaboo perhaps he had been oversensitive that time and on several other recent occasions for years he had tried to curb his excessive sensitivity as other men tried to reduce their weight it took diligent unremitting work it could be done but then every once in a while you put on sudden sensitivity as you put on extra weight and suffered for the added burden throwing aside his robe entering the bathroom he decided that the two secret service heads gaynor and agajanian had been courteous in their behavior and now it seemed reasonable that they should have been to their dedicated eyes a mr president was a mr president whether he was grover cleveland or woodrow wilson or dwight d eisenhower or t c or douglass dilman all that mattered to them their jobs their future their pride was that they keep the pounds of flesh entrusted to them whatever its pigmentation alive he unbuttoned his pajama top stripped it off and removed the pajama trousers opening the shower door he adjusted the knobs inside then started the spray of water finding soap and cloth he wondered how many other white men would be as courteous as his bodyguards the personalities whose speeches he had heard whose bright remarks he had heard whose prejudices he had known crossed his mind the southern congressmen the northern committeemen the western rightists the eastern ivy league snobs a son of ham he thought in the white house in the oval office of the west wing in the highest seat extant in this red white and blue not black republic despite the old prediction of robert kennedy as attorney general that there could be a negro in the presidency in thirty or forty years there had been no one of equal stature then or now no matter how wise or liberal who believed that it could happen then or in this century yet it had happened by accident stepping into the shower cell he knew that he had been insulated since last night from what was happening out there in the capital city in the cities of the fifty states how stunned the american people must be this hour to learn they would have to look up to an outsider a member of the tenpercent black minority of their white country it was not the first spray of die shower that chilled him but the first realization of what had happened and how wildly it would be resented he remembered the short poem how odd of god to choose the jews he paraphrased it how odd of god to choose me to choose one who had already gone high enough too high for comfort and had wanted nothing higher for himself one who wished only to be limited to his legislative height where reticence and diffidence would still keep him an unresented exhibit that was a sop to the liberal conscience of the north then the chief justices wrenching words of last night came back to him may the lord in heaven bless you and watch over you as the first negro president of the united states his limbs felt weak so weak and his heart thudded inside its chest cavity there were a million white men who were right for the job there were a thousand black men who would have bravely and defiantly welcomed the godsent opportunity and called it godsent yet something something had gone wrong up there the lord had poked his heavenly finger at the wrong name and now it was too late he wanted to rebuke the maker for his blunder and then strangelyout of respect to the memory of his mother and father and aunts in the midwest earth out of fear of the hellfire that had been sounded in that old michigan church in the room behind the brokendown social club when he was in knee pants he was humble before that god and the son of god and his bitterness and fear really it was deepdown cringing fear turned to shame this was no place for kneeling but when there was the time and the place he would beg forgiveness and beg for help yet jesus jesus why did it have to be himself douglass dilman who was not white and who was afraid of being black and who was without armor or grace then as the showers liquid needles warmer now hit his soapy chest and the foam ran down his stomach and thighs and as he absently rubbed himself with the soapy cloth and allowed the stream of water to dissolve the soap he thought that his position despite his secret inadequacy was not entirely bad his mind went backward to last night or the early hours of the morning when the white house limousine had taken him home what had happened then was in retrospect heartening when he had become a member of the house of representatives he had leased the upstairs frot apartment of a red brick twostory apartment building between georgia avenue and sixteenth street the three rooms and kitchenette modest and clean had been sufficient to serve his widower existence the location had been comfortably in the midst of a onetime white neighborhood now occupied by upperclass negroes but the apartment had become too small for him senator espinosa who had become senile and disabled had resigned twothirds of the way through his term the governor of dilmans state to strengthen his position with his vast negro voting populationwhich had trebled with the influx of colored families from the southand with the liberal union leaders had appointed dilman to espinosas vacant office for the two years remaining dilman as senator had found himself briefly a nineday celebrity having left washington dc to campaign in a preponderantly negro district for his fourth house term he had returned to washington as a senatorial appointee one of the few negroes to achieve so high a seat in government he had been the subject of a lead article in such magazines as life look time and newsweek and he had made the covers of ebony and sepia he had vaguely felt a freak and been discomfited but encouraged by the party bosses he had cooperated with one and all it had been during this transitional period when he had been the object of so much attention when his mail had swelled when he had received callers mostly political mostly pressure that he had decided that his rented apartment could no longer serve him he had found that the parlor and kitchenette were too cramped and there was need of a study and library at home he had begun to search for a larger apartment but the rents demanded had appalled him gradually he had decided that it might be wisest to buy a house washington was after all his adopted city and would likely remain his home for years to come while he was a senator from his state by appointment and only for a short period and while he had no idea if he would be a senator again he was confident that he could regain his old house seat and even if that were not possible he could go into private law practice in the capital city where with a population per cent negro a highly reputed negro attorney would have enough client to keep him occupied and secure guided by real estate brokers he had visited three brownstones in his neighborhood and in each instance had felt that the house was overpriced and too expensive for his meager savings the fourth brownstone had come to his attention by chance seated one morning behind his desk in the old senate office building he had learned that the reverend paul spinger was in his reception room eager to see him a visit paid by spinger was not in itself unusual spinger as director of the largest negro organization in america the crispus society had often come to dilman to discuss civil_rights legislation that morning as far as dilman could recall there had been no immediate business to discuss he had invited reverend spinger in and the elderly but energetic clergymanlobbyist had said that the word was around that dilman wanted to buy a house if true he happened to know of a house not yet on the market whose owner j had to sell in a hurry and which might be bought at a reasonable price j in view of its value as an investment it was a tenroom twostory brownstone off sixteenth street on van buren northwest and it was a bargain at it was spinger had said a solid aged abode that one day could stand remodeling but was comfortable enough and well located on the fringe of the wealthier negro section near walter reed general hospital spinger knew about the house in advance he had said because he and his wife rose and a boarder had rented the upstairs for several years the landlord had lived downstairs half jokingly spinger hoped that senator dilman would consider it if someone else bought the house they might need all ten rooms and evict the spingers the senator spinger had reasoned was a widower with his son in boarding school and would have no need for more than the downstairs rooms i senator dilman had gone with the clergyman to visit the brownstone i and he had been enchanted by the quiet residential street with its maple trees the small green front lawn the walk up to the entry hall the generous comfortable rooms and nineteenthcentury fixtures immediately he had bargained for it and closed the deal that had been five years ago more than five years ago and not one day had dilman regretted the financial encumbrance for to this brownstone off sixteenth street dilman owed not only his first real pleasure in having a place where he belonged but also his enduring relationship with wanda gibson and because of last night he owed to this house his first feeling of acceptance as the new and accidental chief executive of the united states last night he thought and then his memory held on last night the feeling of acceptance had come at some time after one oclock in the morning as his chauffeured limousine turned into van buren street dilman sandwiched between the secret service agents had become aware of a phenomenon this was a welloff negro neighborhood but a hardworking one and its inhabitants went to sleep early the thoroughfare was always blanketed in darkness well before midnight but last night after midnight the street was lighted with illumination from every house and alive as a mardi gras and then as they had neared his brownstone dilman realized that van buren street was thickly lined on both sides with people neighbors and others of the capital city who had come to be the first to set eyes upon americas new president when the limousine had drawn up before his front lawn and he had emerged the size of the crowd in attendance had overwhelmed him almost one thousand persons he had guessed the faces many recognizable had been mostly black but there were whites here and there although dilman had been unable to discern if they were reporters secret service agents or simply curiosity seekers of the kind who rushed to accidents as he had walked between the agents to his front door the applause had begun then swelled and there had been cheers dilman had paused deeply moved and had exhaustedly waved and waved and then gone inside his house he had fallen asleep so quickly he now supposed because after the first fear and trepidation the paralysis induced by change and sudden elevation he had been warmed by friendship and approval but now the harsher light of morning was upon him the soothing blackness was gone the uncertain whiteness waited he shut off the shower emerged dripping onto the bath mat quickly dried himself then went into the bedroom to dress this was a momentous day and perhaps he would be expected to attire himself specially for it he considered his dressiest sunday black suit then decided that it would be awkward in the morning he settled for the charcoal one he had purchased readymade at garfinkels for his first appearance as temporary presiding officer of the senate during the vicepresidents last trip abroad six months before his death as he dressed himself his mind compulsively revived one more event of last night one that had taken place a few minutes before he retired sitting on his bed last night wondering if the secret service men in the living room could hear his voice he had dialed the spingers upstairs the phone had hardly begun to ring when it was answered the voice he had recognized as belonging to rose spinger hello rose i hope i didnt wake you this is doug her response had been pitched high with excitement oh doug we hopedheavens i mustnt be calling you doug any more or even senator or landlord he had smiled to himself tiredly please rose no formality nothing has changed between us i thank you doug oh my heavens to think of it did you see us outside in front in that mob waving to you im not sure i saw wanda for a second of course you would have were all so thrilled were sorry for that accident in europe but since it was gods will were happy you will be there to guide us we need you doug we all need you and the reverend says this is the hand of providence oh heavens hes telling me to be quiet and let you speak to wanda all right except i want to say for the reverend and myself from our hearts that we wish you strength and courage thank you rose i need that the reverend went to knock on wandas door shes still up shell pick up her phone in a second ill wait thanks rose in the seconds that he waited his brain had become alive and projected the early pictures of wanda gibson when he had bought this brownstone five years ago and while it was still in escrow he had been invited to dinner by the spingers to celebrate his acquisition he had met the spingers before many times but always about the hill or at crispus society affairs or at parties given by african embassies near sheridans circle this was the first time that he had accepted an invitation to their home twice as a representative he had been asked to their dinners and twice he had declined with fabricated excuses as a member of the house he had not wanted to be in the position of having to answer to white colleagues who might charge that as a negro he was being used by the head of the most important negro organization his timidity had been ridiculous he had known especially since other negro congressmen and white liberals had attended those dinners in a natural way and had enjoyed rose spingers cooking thereafter he had told himself that if he was ever invited again he would accept the familiar timidity had assailed him but one more time just before signing the escrow papers on the brownstone house he had wondered what those on the hill would think once it got out about a senator owning a house in which he permitted the leader of americas largest minority pressure group to live nobody apparently had cared perhaps oilman thought wryly because nobody apparently cared what he did at any time in the senate until his surprising selection in party caucus to serve as president pro tempore of the body when vicepresident porter was out of town or ill few had seemed aware of his existence he was one of a hundred names on the roll call rarely absent but almost always silent and withdrawn he made no speeches gave no interviews introduced no bills and he went along with the party and t c and everyone even though after filling espinosas unfinished term as senator he had been endorsed by the party to run on his own with strong negro and labor support against a weak opponent destroyed by a graft expose four days before the voting and he had been reelected to the senate on his own he had felt an interloper he had accepted the spingers third invitation to dinner not as a senator but as their landlord and he had gone unafraid knowing at last that no one not even such southern redneck mouthpieces as representative zeke miller or senator bruce hankins cared or gave a damn there had been six of them at that intimate dinner at the spingers five years ago the host and hostess a colored engineer and his colored teacher wife himself as the personage and guest of honor and wanda gibson it had been his initial meeting with wanda gibson and for the first time in the many years since aldoras death he had realized that affection and desire within him had not atrophied but had only been sublimated even then five years ago wanda had not been a girl but a mature womana lady he had always thought of her as being a ladyof thirtyone when he had been fortyseven she was a graduate of the university of west virginia with economics as her major and she had worked for her favorite professor in morgantown and charleston and followed the professor known for his liberal books to washington d c when he accepted a government advisory job in the latter part of the lyndon johnson administration when t c had become president and wandas professor had gone back to his university she had stayed on in washington for the last two years she had held a wellpaying position as executive secretary to the director of vaduz exporters in nearby bethesda maryland from the first dilman had known that wanda was a remarkable find her intelligence and wit her good nature and humor her wellbred manner had made it seem incredible that she had not ever been married as he came to know her better dilman had come to understand her avoid ance of marriage her parents who had lived in west virginia where her father had been a shortorder cook dishwasher janitor in an allnight diner servicing coal miners had sacrificed much of their comfort and the futures of her younger brother and sister to educate and launch her when first one parent and then the other had been hospitalized and afterward confined to costly sanitarium care wanda had accepted full responsibility to support and look after them not only as daughter but as debtor she had a burden and she could not discard it in favor of marriage for which she was so perfectly suited but two years ago her father had died and less than a year ago her mother and at last wanda had been free to live her own life as her own person she had expected him to propose marriage last spring dilman knew and he had not and it had created for the first time an undercurrent of unhappiness between them she had known that he wanted her for his wife he had known that he needed her the proposal was up to him and yet while he could profess affection and love articulate his need for her he could not bring her from upstairs to his downstairs flat as wife he had thought about it a thousand times since spring and had known that the failure was entirely his own marriage was an affirmative act and he had been shackled by countless negative fears he had tried time and time again to narrow in on specific fears small ones avoiding the major one until at last he could see what was left and what in himself taunted him with contempt wanda gibson was a mulatto that was the center of it as a mulatto she was more white in appearance than black in most communities she could have passed for white her hair while brunette and curling was soft and long her eyes were light brown her nose delicate and upturned and her lips and mouth small her figure was trim well hipped but otherwise slender she considered herself a colored woman and she lived as a colored woman but for douglass dilman how she regarded herself and how she approached her life were not assurances enough the nagging cowardice within him that avoided marriage to the one good companion of his life was his fear of how she would look beside him and how this would affect his political career with wanda as his mate he would appear blacker with himself as her mate she would appear whiter whatever the facts and truth it would give the impression of an interracial marriage it might not cause talk in washington and in his home state but on the other hand it might it was an unnecessary risk it would rock the boat in times like this or at least it might dilmans solution had been to avoid the issue the weekly platonic meetings had continued the senator and his ladylike lady friend in the spinger living room in the loges of loews capitol theater and ever so occasionally in the golden ox or the lincoln inn recently dilman had become aware each rendezvous had been less comfortable less warm and communicative it was as if they were both present each desiring the company of the other but now that she was free of parental commitment and he was temporary presiding chairman of the senate there had fallen a thick steel grill between them you could see you could hear you could not touch you were two not one and might never be one and wanda gibson for all her evenness of temperament and understanding had begun to resent this failure in douglass dilman since his invisible antenna of sensitivity had picked up and recorded her disappointment in him dilman had recently taken to reviewing and brooding over this relationship and his own life some weeks ago he had almost arrived at the decision to propose marriage and to the devil with the consequences if any after all he had asked himself in a practical way how could he any longer be hurt but then he had been sidetracked by his activity and sham importance in serving the senate in the vicepresidents place and now overnight cruel destiny had touched him he had become the president of the united states the personal choice ahead was clearcut should he be james buchanan or grover cleveland buchanan had been the only unmarried president to serve his country cleveland had been the only chief executive to be married in the white house when the choice was weighed thus the scales tipped toward buchanan a showy wedding like clevelands in the blue room before the world and the press a marriage to a mulatto a mulatto who might almost be mistaken for white would merely serve to incense the enemies of his race his uncertain position and precarious image before a broken and divided country would be worsened this had been his rationale last night as he waited the telephone receiver in his hand to hear wandas voice his private decision he had known was neither courageous nor honest it was merely expedient and political it solved nothing but simply traded off a personal problem to avoid a more fearsome one gazing down at the receiver in his left hand he had wondered why under the circumstances he was trying to speak to her at all at least at this time he had no idea what he could say to her yet somehow as president of the united states for more than three hours he had to speak to someone before sleeping and then waking to the terrible fact and the only one who might care about him reassure him was wanda as he waited for wanda his mind drifted to mindy his attitude toward the two of them was one and the same he avoided taking a wife he needed for the same reason that he did not seek out a daughter he loved he was black and still afraid hello doug she was calling down to him through a wire from upstairs and yet she had never been farther away wanda i wanted toto say good night before going to sleep doug its overwhelming the whole thing what does one say do i congratulate you that sounds wrong you commiserate with me and with the whole country no dontdont talk like that its not true that accident in frankfurt was horrible but it happened doug those things happen remember how we once talked about what we were doing the moment that we learned fdr had died and how we felt even as youngsters we felt the world had come to an end that we were dying too that there was no hope yet nothing happened to us life went on maybe differently than it might have had he lived but not that differently well doug t c was a good man im sure and popular but he was no fdr and neither was macpherson i know youll do as well as or better than either no one is born to be the only one to be president thousands of men could be president just as well as the one who fought to get the office if it had to be someone else i think it could have been no one better than you wanda dontyou know me too well for thatyou know my weaknesses everyone has weaknesses doug be sensible stand off and look around lincoln had weaknesses and t c had too many to count and probably dozens we couldnt see to count of course you have weaknesses but youre strong enough to handle the job dont discount your strengths i cant forget what you refuse to remember with the kind of background you had all that poverty how did you get through university and law school how did you get elected to the house of representatives four times and then get into the senate and even become its presiding officer it took something doug it took very much i know you maybe as well as anyone knows you maybe better and i am positive the whole countryonce they get over the shock of theof t cs deaththeyll see you for what you are and theyll be proud of you wanda wandayoure doing your best i knowi

honesty learning what you have to learn acting as you believe best it will be all right im sure it will work itself out youyou sound less certain now wanda do i i didnt mean to i guess im just concerned about you what do you mean tell me exactly what you mean i meanplease dont take it wrong dougwe know each other too well for thatbuti mean it would be bad hurtful if you started off went

dearest and know we are all with you good night doug good night wanda good night after hanging up he had tried to analyze their talk she had offered him encouragement and her language had been warm and yet toward the end especially he had sensed her remoteness still he had thought as he reached to turn off the bed lamp and then pushed his fatigued body beneath the blanket she was for him and with him no matter how disappointed she might be in him and that was comforting that was something and then he had felt drowsiness and then he had slept
today our nation faces a crisis in finding job opportunities for negroes from the long view of our past this is indeed a historical irony negroes were brought to this country albeit unwillingly because of the excellent job opportunities as slaves in the tobacco fields of virginia on the rice and cotton plantations of the carolinas it has been claimed by some historians that the main theme of southern history was the creation of a social system designed to keep negroes in these jobs slavery terror racism segregation and discrimination were elements of such a system from the countryside to the city twentieth century wartime manpower shortages in the two world wars and the korean war created a demand for negroes elsewhere in american life than in southern fields in response to this demand negroes moved out of the southern countryside in on the eve of world war i only per cent lived in the north and west by per cent lived in the cities of the north and west in three quarters of the negroes in the united states lived in rural areas by threequarters were urban dwellers during this brief year span the intermittent intervals in which negroes were sought for urban industrial jobs were countered by new developments in agriculture the original job opportunities for which negroes were brought to the united states began to disappear due to mechanization of farming in the south tractors chemicals and mechanical cotton pickers replaced men hoes and mules in georgia for instance the use of tractors increased five and one half times in the single decade between and from the beginning of world war ii through the end of the korean war the negro worker underwent a period of extreme economic and geographic dislocation under a push pull sort of pressure the push was the substitution of mechanical power for human labor in southern agriculture the pull was the demand for unskilled labor in urban centers since the push has been accelerated but the pull has diminished in there were negro owned farms in the south by this num ber had decreased by over to in the next five years another negro owned farms disappeared in other words the rate of displacement of negroes from agriculture increased meanwhile the demand for unskilled labor elsewhere in the economy diminished with the step up in automation negro workers bore the brunt of the hardship unemployment of negro workers rose from per cent in to in an increase of over two and one half times this growing non farm unemployment gave rise to a new phenomenon we discovered negro men either born in the city or longtime dwellers therein with a history of good industrial employment who were now welfare recipients these men had been displaced by automation or plant move outs northern racism in the form of segregation and discrimination coupled with too little and too poor an education has frozen these men out of a secure position in the work force we have created and continue to hold trapped a new urban peasantry whites with social conscience have tried to bury the problem of urban negroes by saying that it was a question of newcomers to the city as though negroes were sort of black irishmen this is not the case northern social and economic practices perpetuate the second class status of negroes be they fresh from the mississippi delta or third generation city dwellers northern cities invented de facto segregation in which negroes regardless of education and social status are held within a residential ghetto and sent to segregated neighborhood schools with the breakdown of legal segregation in the south the south has adopted this northern invention the northern cities have created a second class status which has resulted in what i call cultural castration of the lower class negro male in chicago one out of every six able bodied negro males is completely without work and a second one out of the same six receives an income so low that it keeps him and his family below the poverty level we have created vast high rise compounds of public housing in the heart of the ghetto in which we cluster together poverty familial and social disorganization these conditions cause slum shock an illness which our society could eradicate if we use the same vigor that we used in eradicating polio our schools also are failing the negro child this year in chicago the number of high school graduates will be slightly over a third of the number of negroes who reach the age of an alarming number of those who do graduate will not be able to read at the high school freshman level so that even they lack the skills necessary to make the grade in an automated society lest you still think that the ra cial differences are only a problem of rural background of the negro poor let me remind you that in the city of chicago the white high school drop out earns almost more than the negro college graduate new job opportunities given these conditions i join commissioner of education francis keppel in saying thank god for the civil_rights movement south and north the impact of the civil_rights movement is opening up new positions for negroes some with firms which have never hired negroes before and some in skilled occupations and managerial posts from which negroes were excluded this movement has gained the attention of many employers who never before had given the condition and the status of the negro a second thought the civil_rights movement is also important because it has given the little black man new dignity the direct action arm of the revolution has provided an opportunity for the little guy to speak for himself to tell of his anguish his desperation his desolation to force those in the seats of power to act let me give you an idea of some of the openings that we at the urban league see in the chicago labor market prior to the summer of well trained skilled young negroes with few exceptions were confined to employment by government agencies or business institutions within the ghetto today we find chicago loop businesses affirmatively seeking negro professional clerical and technical help the most dramatic breakthrough in which we participated was the agreement last summer of five major loop banks with the chicago urban league to develop an extensive program of recruiting negro employees prior to the announcement of our program there were only a handful of negro workers in the city s banks today either directly through their personnel offices or on referral from the urban league negroes are entering the banks staffs at all levels at one of the largest banks there is a first a negro management trainee all of chicago s major banks are looking for them we also note that insurance companies are hiring negroes as whitecollar personnel and we have begun the long awaited breakthrough in the advertising business in short we are dealing with thousands of employers who are new to the hiring of negro workers and the same is going on all over the north like anyone else with scientific and engineering training negroes with advanced degrees are in great demand the possession of scare skills tends to make a negro very attractive he performs the technical job while he helps satisfy the government contract compliance officer there are further breakthroughs into once restricted areas in one automotive plant we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of negro foremen in other plants some under employed well educated negroes have moved into supervisory positions some firms that had no negro employees even in production or maintenance are now hiring in order to comply with the state fair employment practices law and the president s order on equal employment in the food industry which is sensitive to consumer pressure negroes are being brought into the management training programs of the chain stores although they are still being slotted into stores in negro neighborhoods the large manufacturing firms which supply this industry have followed suit by hiring negroes as wholesale salesmen to the food retailers in the area of government employment we have seen in the last few years a great increase in the number of negro teachers in federal employment while negroes are still disproportionately located at the lower levels of civil service during the last two years there has been nearly a doubling in the number of negroes above grade in general we have noted that almost every major firm in chicago is asking for some talented and skilled negroes the young welltrained negro now has a chance to get into the mainstream of american economic life this situation has put a great strain on my employment and guidance staff tney are under pressure to provide the instant negro the employer names the job specification for which he wants a negro and we are supposed to produce one to fill the spot with the same magic as producing a genii out of a bottle the new opportunities and the american economy these new job opportunities for negroes have not been opened long enough to make any over all change in the economic structure of the negro community nor any basic changes in the labor force of major employers lacking such evidence of basic change we constantly have a gnawing question do these new opportunities represent the opening of the doors of equal opportunity to all or do they just represent token concessions to the great pressure of the civil_rights movement i suspect that it is some of both it is the job of the legal defense and educational fund it is the job of the urban league and of the entire civil_rights movement to guarantee that the doors really do swing wide open and stay open we have had a succession of systems of race relations in our nation first slavery then rural peonage followed by urban segregation and discrimination we have to ask ourselves what is the next stage will we develop a system of tokenism in which a symbolically small number of well educated middle class negroes have access to the total society while the mass of negroes are excluded i fear that tokenism as a system may become a distinct danger even if employers who are opening up these new opportunities are serious and are not going to close the door after they have their token negroes equal opportunity for employment has severe limitations when a nation does not have enough employment to go around it also has severe limits for the individual when he has not had an equal opportunity to become prepared for the job in a certain sense the racial revolution comes at a most convenient time we are undergoing one of the longest economic booms in recent history we are approaching three and one half years of continuous prosperity it is obvious that an employer has to be hiring to hire fairly still the employment effects of the current boom are minimized by the rapid introduction of automation and other technological advances our current national rate of unemployment is still five and one half per cent of the labor force there is a danger that unemployment will increase for the displacement of labor by machines will continue while the labor force grows at an accelerated rate as the post war baby boom hits the labormarket a business recession would further complicate the picture and diminish the number of jobs so far the improvement of negroes employment position has been largely dependent upon full employment for all war time labor scarcity did more to improve the employment position and skills of negroes than any other single social movement any failure in the general economic health of the nation and a lack of expansion of employment would tend to freeze the negroes new opportunities for employment into tokenism or worse racism has become frozen into the fabric of american society in the cities these practices have created an urban peasantry which every year is becoming further removed from the constantly rising level of skills demanded by employers today in chicago the major employers such as the steel mills are requiring a high school diploma for employment as a laborer yet this year in chicago only one out of every three negroes who reach the age of will possess this qualification where do the twothirds without a diploma go to work if they can t work in the mills they are headed for a career of marginal jobs unemployment and welfare they and their families are locked in a pattern of poverty ghettoes segregated and inferior schooling and of course with such conditions unstable family life unless our nation can break this pattern by a massive attack on second class and segregated conditions especially in education the new job opportunities will be meaningless to these people and their children depending upon the general level of employment one third to one half of the urban negroes under current conditions are in a position to take advantage of new employment opportunities this means also that under current conditions one half to two thirds are walled off from a secure position in the labor market the giant step ahead the american community cannot allow tokenism to become institutionalized as we have the systems of race relations which preceded it we are now in the midst of and must continue an all out onslaught against the status quo which denies equal opportunity we are on a road without turning we must shun the blandishments of the gradualist who insists that things are getting better his optimism reminds me of the man who met an acquaintance on the street and in a friendly manner inquired how s your wife the friend retorted compared to what we must all understand that we are striving for equal opportunity and we must be clear ourselves in that equal opportunity means equal opportunity not just a condition better than formerly existed as far as jobs are concerned it means equal education and training equal access to the job equal working conditions and equal chance for advancement all the way to chairman of the board while we must realistically recognize that the achievement of this objective is not the work of a day we still want it and should have had it yesterday the point which i am struggling ponderously to make is that those of us who are in the vanguard of the battle for equality must never allow our eye to be taken off the goal of total equality even though some things are getting better for some black people let me be clear this is not intended to be a blanket indictment of all employers it is a blanket indictment of that portion of the american system which has fostered and condoned crippling discrimination and then in defense pointed the finger of blame at the cripple it created there have been for a long time industrial leaders in the areas of our concern in chicago e.g inland steel international harvester spiegels western electric illinois bell are among those with a very long history of employment of negroes more recently others have joined our leading banking institutions such as first national continental illinois and harris trust are offering a real shot in the arm to help our community toward fair employment by both precept and more importantly by example but we have had too few employers on the right track and we have involved none to the extent which we should but even in the face of these breakthroughs if we are to save the urban poor and their children from an entire lifetime of joblessness and hopelessness of costly dependency and delinquency we must establish a massive crashcrisis program of the magnitude of the marshall plan and the lavishness of the manhattan project we must increase our determination to eliminate segregation and discrimination from american life and then go even further here are some of the ingredients of such a program double the expenditures of urban school systems and spend most of the extra money on those suffering from slum shock retrain the unemployed so that they have marketable skills the chicago urban league has had success with demonstration projects in this field working with public agencies private firms and joint projects in other words everyone can share in this responsibility put enough money into public welfare so that we can change the emphasis from relief to rehabilitation institute a massive program of public works to provide jobs and decent housing school transportation cultural and recreational facilities for all thereby making it possible for men and women to earn their living with dignity while they are being retrained for other jobs these programs would truly eradicate the causes of poverty and create the conditions of dignity the costs are little in terms of human benefit large in terms of our traditional ways of thinking in chicago alone i estimate that we would have to spend a minimum of a half a billion dollars a year for the next years ml vf t last spring at the time of the birmingham riots eric sevareid wrote for america this postwar period is surely the period of the negro passion this generation is not likely to find surcease from the negro passion its source springs and the resistance to it are too deeply grounded for easy resolution and its present outburst too long delayed a year later after our nation has taken the first steps towards equal opportunity we find that this passion has grown not diminished it will not subside until we take giant strides why we have returned to the south a vivid recollection of an incident in my childhood still haunts me the gloating and gruesome description a neighbor of the lynching of a gro man screaming in terror and agony as he was dragged into a car driven to an isolated area dangled by a rope from a tree and then shot to pieces by dozens of jeering white men i myself have twice been attacked with fists and a knife for merely sitting next to negroes on buses as a georgia minister i preached and tried to practice brotherhood and fairness for all men only to be called a nigger lover a term not meant as complimentary by some of my church members no cowards hiding behind bedsheets and the anonymity of a crowd ever visited my churches but they visited others nearby sometimes as a threat and sometimes as invited guests even in recent years on visits to the south have seen long lines of ignorant klansmen in automobiles riding through the night and stopping at certain houses to warn of punishment to those who did not conform to the standards set by these men who in their limited outlook are so sure that they speak both for god and for what they think should be the laws of men and all the while the majority of decent law abiding southerners sit by and let the irresponsible elements in society some in official positions of responsibility perform gross injustices and convey an image that still do not believe is true of the average white southerner of late there has been a rash of articles about episodes in all parts of the country where people refuse to interfere when murder rape and robbery are being committed the usual southern reaction to lawlessness and injustice to negroes is a subtle part of this dangerous tendency for the future of civilization to turn away lest one s involvement bring trouble on oneself but we have come back to the south with the intention and the desire to live here the remainder of our lives and not because we approve of all southern beliefs and actions my wife also a native georgian and i wholeheartedly welcomed the supreme court decision of leading to what must ultimately be the end of compulsory segregation in schools and we hope in all areas of life furthermore we deplore the slow pace of integration and the continued injustices the negroes of the south have to bear we do not underestimate the bitterness the prejudice and the violence aroused anew in many southern white people perhaps then there may be those who wonder why we have taken five children into an area of possible violence with the knowledge that educational opportunities are generally not so good in the south as in the north even for those with white skins in the first place we have not come back south with the idea that we are making a sacrifice nor do we think that southern white people on the whole are moral monsters the advantages our children will have as southerners will more than outweigh the disadvantages although it is shameful that the same thing cannot as yet be said for negro children.it would be unfair and contrary to the facts to praise the south by deprecating the north but it is appropriate to point out that we lived in connecticut new york illinois and wisconsin and have found the people in those states person for person to be very much like the people of the south both north and south have their hypocrites their bigots their areas of ignorance their acts of violence and their injustices to minority groups but both regions also have people of empathy courage and vision inconsistency is not confined to the south cultural changes come slowly especially to a land devastated by war and embittered by the lingering injustices left over from reconstruction days when motives of vengeance and corrupt politics in the north and carpetbagger opportunism in the south played havoc with lincoln s plea for malice toward none charity for all but changes must and will come some southern white people in many walks of life have struggled against great odds to hasten these changes people harassed on the one hand by ignorance southern opportunist politicians and resistance to social change and on the other hand by northern opportunist politicians and sometimes onesided newspaper reporting emotion has prevailed reason has thus far never had a fair chance nor has the plight of southern liberals been made easier by some northern white and negro liberals who in their understandable eagerness for reform have found it easy to overlook the fact that love and understanding are neceessary for the white southerner and his problems as well as for the black doctrinaire liberalism has a special bigotry of its own no man is really tolerant until he has made a serious effort to understand those who are intolerant many southern people would not be so defensive and belligerant if they were understood and given the credit they deserve however small that credit may be in racial matters of course i realize that no white man can really understand the bitterness and impatience that inevitably rise within negroes while i deplore some attitudes and projected programs of the black muslims and other similar negro groups and hope for the eventual good of all mankind that the negro leadership such as that of martin_luther_king and the naacp will prevail nevertheless i am not so certain that i could now write as calmly as i do urging patience tolerance and love were my skin black i cannot asree with the black w muslims but i think i can understand how they must feel yet since i cannot properly share the sense of outrage which burns within most negroes perhaps i am insensitive and wrong in pleading for understanding from those who have never been understood.nevertheless i still believe that two wrongs do not make a right and i hope and expect that negro people will not in significant numbers generalize from particulars and hate or distrust all white men negroes can abuse power too and it will be a sad day for both black and white people if rights are won at the cost of that something down inside which keeps men and their societies sane and wholesome it is unreasonable to expect any non negro to adopt all negro methods and goals uncritically or be cast aside as not really understanding or caring there are many of us who care a great deal and have at considerable hurt to ourselves taken on the fight of our negro brothers but understood or not too many of us in the south have for too long gone north never to return and have lamented the fact that social change in the south is so slow we may have our social views rejected if we return but we are still accepted in a way that northerners with similar views seldom are perhaps this is because we know better than to judge all white southerners by the violence or cowardice of some perhaps too the liberal native white southerner knows by his own independent spirit that a proud people have to be respected and loved even when they are wrong i am glad that legal decisions sit ins stand ins kneel ins freedom riders etc are prodding the south into earlier actions than it might otherwise take in racial matters but however trite it may sound or however much it may be denied the south for the most part must solve its own problems although not in the ways proposed by some inch worm white southerners who are willing to go only one inch at a time with long periods of rest between such progressive moves if the united states is to provide the leadership and example for true world democracy i believe that leadership and example in race relations must come primarily from the south while it is true that the average southern white man does not understand the neero so well as he thinks he does and that probably goes for me too it is nevertheless true that the southern white often feels an affection for the negro in a paradoxical if sometimes paternalistic way that many northerners with their secret fear of the nesro do not understand it is my belief that racial problems in the north will never be satisfactorily laid to rest until they are first solved in the south so much of vast importance for our country and the world depends upon how the proud independent sometimes violent and yet gentle spirit of the south's people black and white can be channeled into constructive social uses i believe the south is equal to the challenge and i have come home to help sick and tired of being sick and tired a feet back from a narrow dirt road just off the state cy highway that cuts through ruleville miss is a small three room white frame house with a screened porch a large pecan tree grows in the front yard and two smaller ones grow out back butter bean and okra plants are filling out in the gardens on the lots on either side of the house lafayette street is as quiet as the rest of ruleville a town of less than located in sunflower county miles from the mississippi river sunflower county home of senator eastland and per cent negro is one of twenty four counties in the north western quarter of the state the delta that make up the second congressional district since this district has been represented in congress by jamie whitten chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee on agriculture who is now seeking his thirteenth term from the house on the dirt road there now comes a person to challenge jamie whitten mrs fannie lou hamer mrs hamer is a negro and only negroes or per cent of voting age negroes were registered to vote in the second congressional district in but in when whitten was elected for the twelfth time only persons cast votes although in there were more than persons of voting age in the district per cent of them negro mrs hamer s bid is sponsored by the council of federated organizations a mississippi coalition of local and national civil_rights organizations until mississippi stops its discriminatory voting practices mrs hamer s chance of election is slight but she is waking up the citizens of her district i m showing people that a negro can run for office she explains her deep powerful voice shakes the air as she sits on the porch or inside talking to friends relatives and neighbors who drop by on the one day each week when she is not out campaigning whatever she is talking about soon becomes an impassioned plea for a change in the system that exploits the delta negroes all my life i ve been sick and tired she shakes her head now i m sick and tired of being sick and tired mrs hamer was born october in montgomery county the twentieth child in a family of six girls and fourteen boys when she was her family moved to sunflower county miles to the west the family would pick fiftysixty bales of cotton a year so my father decided to rent some land he bought some mules and a cultivator we were doin pretty well he even started to fix up the house real nice and had bought a car then our stock got poisoned we knowed this white man had done it he stirred up a gallon of paris green with the feed when we got out there one mule was already dead t'other two mules and the cow had their stomachs all swelled up it was too late to save em that poisonin knocked us right back down flat we never did get back up again that white man did it just because we were gettin somewhere white people never like to see negroes get a little success a ll of this stuff is no secret in the state of mississippi mrs hamer pulled her feet under the worn straight backed chair she was sitting in the linoleum under her feet was worn through to another layer of linoleum floor boards showed in spots she folded her large hands on her lap and shifted her weight in the chair she s a large and heavy woman but large and heavy with a power to back up her determination we went back to sharecrop pin halvin it s called you split the cotton half and half with the plantation owner but the seed fertilizer cost of hired hands everything is paid out of the cropper s half later dropped out of school i cut corn stalks to help the family my parents were gettin up in age they weren t young when i was born i was the twentieth child and my mother had a bad eye she was cleanin up the owner s yard for a quarter when somethin flew up and hit her in the eye so many times for dinner we would have greens with no seasonin and flour gravy my mother would mix flour with a little grease and try to make gravy out of it sometimes she d cook a little meal and we d have bread no one can honestly say negroes are satisfied we ve only been patient but how much more patience can we have fannie lou and perry hamer have two daughters and both of whom they adopted the hamers adopted the older girl when she was bom to give her a home her mother being unmarried i ve always been concerned with any human being mrs hamer explains the younger girl was given to her at the age of months she had been burned badly when a tub of boiling water spilled and her large impoverished family was not able to care for her we had a little money so we took care of her and raised her she was sickly too when i got her suffered from malnutrition then she got run over by a car and her leg was broken so she s only in fourth grade now the older girl left school after the tenth grade to begin working several months ago when she tried to get a job the employer commented you certainly talk like fannie lou when the girl replied she raised me she was denied the job she has a job now but mrs hamer explains they don t know she s my child the intimidation that mrs hamer s older girl faces is what mrs hamer has faced since august on that day she and seventeen others went down to the county courthouse in indianola to try to register to vote from the moment they arrived police wandered around their bus keeping an eye on the eighteen i wonder what they ll do the bus driver said to mrs hamer halfway back to ruleville the police stopped the bus and ordered it back to indianola there they were all arrested the bus was painted the wrong color the police told them after being bonded out mrs hamer returned to the plantation where the hamers had lived for eighteen years my oldest girl met me and told me that mr marlowe the plantation owner was mad and raisin cain he had heard that i had tried to register that night he called on us and said we're not ready for that in mississippi now if you don t withdraw i ll let you go i left that night but pap that s what i call my husband had to stav on till work on the plantation was through in the spring of last year mr hamer got a job at a ruleville cotton gin but this year though others are working there already they haven t taken him back according to mississippi law the names of all persons who take the registration test must be in the local paper for two weeks this subjects negroes especially delta negroes to all sorts of retaliatory actions most negroes in the delta are sharecroppers it's not like in the hills where negroes own land but everything happened before my name had been in the paper mrs hamer adds she didn t pass the test the first time so she returned on december and took it again you ll see me every days till i pass she told the registrar on january she returned and found out that she had passed but i still wasn t allowed to vote last fall because i didn t have two poll tax receipts we still have to pay poll tax for state elections i have two receipts now after being forced to leave the plantation mrs hamer stayed with various friends and relatives on september night riders fired sixteen times into the home of one of these persons mrs turner mrs hamer was away at the time in december the hamers moved into their present home which they rent from a negro woman mrs hamer had by then begun active work in the civil_rights movement she gathered names for a petition to obtain federal commodities for needy negro families and attended various southern christian leadership conference sclc and student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc workshops throughout the south since then she has been active as a sncc field secretary in voter registration and welfare programs and has taught classes for sclc at present most of her time is spent campaigning in june of last year mrs hamer was returning from a workshop in charleston s c she was arrested in winona in montgomery county miles east of indianola the county in which she was born along with others she was taken from the bus to the jail.they carried me into a room and there was two negro boys in this room the state highway patrolman gave them a long wide blackjack and he told one of the boys take this and the negro he said this what you want me to use the state patrolman said that s right and if you don t use it on her you know what i ll use on you i had to get over on a bed flat on my stomach and that man beat me that man beat me till he give out and by me screamin it made a plain clothes man he didn t have on nothin like a uniform he got so hot and worked up he just run there and started hittin me on the back of my head and was tryin to guard some of the licks with my hands and they just beat my hands till they turned blue this negro just beat me till i know he was give out then this state patrolman told the other negro to take me so he take over from there and he just keep beatin me the police carried mrs hamer to her cell when they were through beating her they also beat annelle ponder a sclc worker who was returning on the bus with her and lawrence guyot a sncc field secretary who had traveled from the greenwood sncc office to investigate the arrests they whipped annelle ponder and i heard her screamin after a while she passed by where l was in the cell and her mouth was bleedin and her hair was standin up on her head and you know it was horrifyin over in the night i even heard screamin said oh lord somebody else gettin it too it was later that we heard that lawrence guyot was there i got to see him i could walk as far as the cell door and asked them to please leave that door open so could get a breath of fresh air every once in a while that s how got to see guyot he looked as if he was in pretty bad shape and it was on my nerves too because that was the first time i had seen him and not smilin after i got out of jail half dead i found out that medgar evers had been shot down in his own yard mrs hamer paused for a moment saddened by the recollection i glanced around the dim room faded wallpaper covered the walls and a vase some framed photos and a large doll were placed neatly on a chest and on a small table three stuffed clowns and a small doll lay on the worn spread on the double bed in the comer both the small doll and the larger one had white complexions a reminder of the world outside we re tired of all this beatin we're tired of takin this it s been a hundred years and we're still being beaten and shot at crosses are still being burned because we want to vote but i'm goin to stay in mississippi and if they shoot me down i ll be buried here but don't want equal rights with the white man if i did i d be a thief and a murderer but the white man is the scardest person on earth out in the daylight he don't do nothin but at night he ll toss a bomb or pay someone to kill the white man s afraid he'll be treated like he s been treatin negroes but l couldn't carry that much hate it wouldn t solve any problem for me to hate whites just because they hate me oh there's so much hate only god has kept the negro sane as part of her voter registration work mrs hamer has been teaching citizenship classes working to overcome the bad schooling delta negroes have received when they receive any at all we just have nice school buildings she says in sunflower county there are three buildings for negroes of high school age six buildings for white high school students in the county spent per white pupil per negro pupil when applying to register persons as part of the test must interpret the state constitution but mrs hamer says mississippi don t teach it in school the negro schools close in may so that the children can help with the planting and chopping they open again in july and august only to close in september and october so that children can pick cotton some stay out of school completely to work in the fields mississippi has no compulsory schoolattendance law it was abolished after the supreme court school desegregation decision many negro children do not attend school simply because they have no clothes to wear mrs hamer has helped distribute clothing sent down from the north we owe a lot to people in the north she admits a lot of people are wearing nice clothes for the first time a lot of kids couldn t go to school otherwise one time when a shipment arrived for distribution the ruleville mayor took it upon himself to announce that a lot of clothes were being given out more than negroes showed up and stood in line to receive clothes mrs hamer combining human compassion and politicking told them that the mayor had had nothing to do with the clothing distribution and that if they went and registered they wouldn t have to stand in line as they were doing many went down and took the registration test a couple weeks ago when more clothes arrived she relates the mayor said that people could go and get clothing and that if they didn t get any they should just go and take them i went and talked to the mayor i told him not to boss us around we don t try to boss you around i told him obviously fannie lou hamer will not be easily stopped we mean to use every means to try and win if i lose we have this freedom registration and freedom vote to see how many would have voted if there wasn t all this red tape and discrimination if mrs hamer is defeated by jamie whitten in the primary she will also file as an independent in the general election last fall sncc voter registration workers attempted to register in freedom registration books all those not officially registered these negroes then voted in an unofficial freedom vote campaign choosing between democrat paul johnson now governor republican rubel phillips and independent aaron henry state naacp chairman henry received votes the same thing will be done this summer and if mrs hamer loses the freedom vote total will be used to challenge whitten s election backing up the discrimination charges are nine suits the federal government has pending in seven second congressional district counties including a suit in sunflower county where in only per cent of voting age negroes were registered a mississippi freedom democratic party is also being formed which will hold meetings on every level within the state from precinct on up finally choosing a delegation to the national democratic convention that will challenge the seating of the regular all white mississippi delegation in addition to mrs hamer three other mississippi negroes are running for national office in the elections james monroe houston will challenge robert bell williams in the third congressional district the rev john e cameron faces william meyers colmer in the fifth and mrs victoria jackson gray is campaigning for the senate seat now held by john stennis this extensive program provides a basis for negroes organizing throughout the state and gives a strong democratic base for the freedom democratic party the wide range of negro participation will show that the problem in mississippi is not negro apathy but discrimination and fear of physical and economic reprisals for attempting to register the freedom democratic candidates will also give mississippians white as well as negro a chance to vote for candidates who do not stand for political social and economic exploitation and discrimination and a chance to vote for the national democratic ticket rather than the mississippi slate of unpledged electors we been waitin all our lives mrs hamer exclaims and still gettin killed still gettin hung still gettin beat to death now we re tired waitin by tom f driver closing notice is snr up and i am left to ii sing the blues for blues v f for mister charlie during its brief career i went twice to see james baldwin s play on broadway for one thing i wanted more of the performance by diana sands the best any american actress has given all season for another i wanted to make sure whether the play s faults were really enough to force its closing as some critics seem to think or whether as i suspected its virtues did it in i am now ready to maintain the latter and to see in this a phenomenon of some social importance but before arguing the point let me pay homage to the lady diana sands first came among us some years ago in raisin in the sun a soap opera for dark skins and light consciences not much to my liking it required miss sands merely to be pert which she was and nothing more my joy at seeing her unfold in the baldwin play was great in the third act she had a long soliloquy a lament for her dead lover in which she poured over the theater a libation of anger love and blasphemy the sexual language of this speech is direct it demands to be uttered without shame miss sands did it with such conviction that her dignity increased with each revealing line furthermore she played it at the top of the emotional register shouting weeping and pounding the air with her fists an indulgence few performers could risk without disaster here was acting in the grand manner after putting it to the test of a second viewing i can report that it lost nothing in the repetition honor to miss sands for bringing it off to burgess meredith her director for letting her do it and to james baldwin for writing words to make it possible he play itself is based very distantly as baldwin has said on the case of emmett till murdered in by a white man who was acquitted but who later confessed in the play the murderer s guilt is clear from the start and so is the acquittal the jury will give a negro youth a freeman jr rebellious and unstable to the point of courting death runs afoul of a poor white rip torn with enough pride of race and insecurity of personality to pull the trigger baldwin is interested in these two men only as types his portrayal of them is therefore in sketch but with absolute mastery of detail from these sketches our eyes are led to watch the town s reaction to the murder the whites form an almost solid front that abstraction called justice being less real to them than their fear the front is broken at any rate cracked by parnell a newspaper owner in which role pat hingle gave the best performance he has ever brought us a confidant of both the victim s father and the murderer he tries to remain friends with both while seeing that justice is done this of course is impossible and when on the witness stand he has to choose it is the truth he lets go among the blacks the most important reaction we watch is that of the boy s clergyman father percyrodriguez he has long been a spokesman and a bargainer for civil_rights he becomes an agitator ready to take up arms the play is about the breakdown of moderation in the face of antagonisms that are by nature irrational and immoderate james baldwin s forte has never been the making of plots the structuring of fiction nor the psychological delineation of character he is first and last a preacher but preaching in the theater is by no means always a fault let alone something bad for the box office in the deputy broadway has a sermon that is a solid hit and the lincoln center repertory has an other in after the fall neither is written half as well as blues for mister charlie the only trouble with sermons is that the more they are needed the less they are liked the terms in which james baldwin chose to address his audience are not the terms in which they have wanted to listen on the one hand he alienated a large part of the liberal intelligentsia by paying scant attention to the political and economic roots of segregation marxist and socialist theory have not detained him absent also is any concern with the structure of american law and the elective process in other words baldwin stepped right outside the context in which most americans now see the racial struggle to them it is a question of civil_rights a constitutional question coupled perhaps with problems of unemployment job training and other economic factors instead of talking about all this baldwin has taken what will seem to many a reactionary step he has described racial strife as racial strife warfare between the black people and white people that is rooted in their separate ways of experiencing life the difference symbolized in their sexuality baldwin thus opened himself to two attacks that critics were not slow to make that he had swallowed the myth of negro sexual superiority and that his characters were caricatures that is how it happened that robert brustein of the new republic saw eye to eye with howard taubman of the new york times with whom he had intended strongly to disagree they both uttered the damning judgment that the characters were stereotyped as a matter of fact no play about the negro has ever been seen in america that represented small town southern white people more accurately than does blues for mister charlie i will not judge its representation of negroes in such a town not having lived among them what the play sins against is not the reality down south but the social hence aesthetic myths up north on the other hand baldwin alienated the middle class paying audience by presenting a view of the racial conflict that it fears is true unlike lorraine hansberry who wrote the box office success raisin in the sun he did not flatter the audience by telling it what it wanted to believe namely that negroes have the same ambitions aches and pains as other people the moral of that message is that there is nothing to fear james baldwin by contrast has been saying for some years notably in the fire next time that there is plenty to fear he tells us in blues for mister charlie that negroes do not feel and think as white people and that the assumption they do is simply a manifestation of the white s innate sense that his own values and experience are normative the shape of the play is not a comic one of movement from problem to solution which would be a kind of civic reassurance it is a movement in the negroes themselves from liberality to warfare as this movement is not comic neither is it tragic there is no catharsis in it though baldwin is no brecht the temper of his play is brechtian but not marxist it is brechtian in avoiding both comedy and tragedy it is brechtian in that it is a call to action rather than an imitation of action it is brechtian in that it uses what people will think are stereotypes for the deliberate purpose of challenging received ideas it asks us to reconsider whether the stereotypes may not be nearer the truth than the theory that explains them away far from being as some have charged a commercial sort of play this one has failed on broadway for the same reason brecht fails there it frightens people by challenging the status quo while at the same time it challenges their way of seeing the status quo the social significance of blues for mister charlie lies in what it reveals about our fear of fear it should be looked at side by side with the reaction many people made to the threatened stall in at the world s fair the threat of water wastage proposed by brooklyn core and other demonstrations that go beyond attack on specific injustices in a spirit of generalized protest there is indeed something illogical in these actions the public including many white liberals seems to see in them a threat of anarchy and many negro leaders have warned that riots and the temporary breakdown of law enforcement can be expected the north is discovering its kinship with the south and its reaction is beginning to show itself as fear at this point some of our fixed notions display their inadequacy and the baldwin play becomes relevant dogma has it that nothing stands in the way of racial harmony but the ill will of benighted southerners and other reactionaries who deny civil_rights to negroes ill will can be cured in due time by education preaching and better laws this view is so utterly rational and progressivist in character that it cannot accommodate into its understanding irrational antagonisms between racial groups hence it declares contrary to much evidence that sexual envy which no doubt is irrational has nothing to do with the problem when a baldwin says that it does for negro as well as white he is said to be a purveyor of myth the dogma being designed to rule out fear breaks down when fear becomes unavoidable that is just where we are now southern moderates have been there a long time having no adequate resources to help them face that fear having been told it was unrealistic they became paralyzed by it and were notoriously ineffective in southern politics power was exercised by the faubuses barnetts and wallaces who however unprincipled were realistic enough to see that fear existed that it was inevitable and action must be predicated on it on the other side negroes became a political force in the south by virtue of the fact that they who had lived long in fear ceased to be afraid of it they did not eliminate it could not and did not try it but they ceased to try to avoid it and in that moment their ineffectiveness ended i do not deny that an awakened class or racial consciousness had its importance but class consciousness without the courage to face fear is impotent impotence born of the fear of fear is what has been overcome by negroes in the past years and it is what baldwin is talking about in the rev meridian henry who puts down his brief case and takes up his gun and his bible the message is not very sophisticated but it is true enough and it could hardly be more to the point at a time when the paralysis of the southern moderate is creeping all over the country the sober citizens of the north midwest and west if they do not want to be swept onto the sidelines in the next five or ten years will have to learn that some we don t know how much violence is unavoidable they will have to learn that violence itself is far from the worst of evils even in a peaceable democracy the repression of violence by a force that perpetuates injustice is worse the violence of terrified people is worse than the violence of brave men moderates will have to know that fear is their lot those who cannot risk when they are afraid who cannot cope with anything but rational progress will be made impotent by their fear and their impotence will bring anarchy and violence all the closer if baldwin s play is offensive or even just unrealistic to them they will find their moment of truth arrived too late the negro writer in the u.s assembly at asilomar early in august some two hundred people from all over the country and from several foreign countries converged on a rustic state park and conference grounds at california s famed monterey peninsula to meet and talk with some of america s black literary lions they slept in the two dozen or so redwood lodges took their meals in the huge cafeteria and listened and argued and questioned in the chapel and in the lounges and in the brisk sea flavored open air there was excitement as when poet playwright leroi jones unleashing a whisper of his fiery temper leveled the charge of parasite against so many literary critics and there was nostalgia calm but compelling as when saunders redding arna bontemps and horace cayton recalled their personal experiences with their great contemporary the late richard wright there was a moment when the attentive audience grew tense perched on the edge of embarrassment for it seemed that the occasion was imminent for a needless comparison of two poets work as the two poets sat on the podium the auditorium was sprinkled with partisans of the younger poet a firebrand like themselves ready to do public battle but the older poet is also a great lady and while she had no need to concede any corner there being no qualitative monopoly on artistic approach she was all grace said gwendolyn brooks of leroi jones he is a master of language but all was not so temperate at one point two california claimants to literary distinction drew their verbal sabers and clashed before startled eyes in keeping with his style professor robert bone a program sub for a missing star put down the aging poet kenneth rexroth and the poet whose supply of ego is plentiful screamed back across the room don t patronize me with accompanying adjectives which are unprintable it all happened following the reading of a literary paper but there was the strong suspicion that the two men had brought their mutual animosities with them there might have been other even more blazing battles had the conference lived up to its billing but james baldwin who found europe more rewarding for the moment did not arrive and there were reasons to believe that ralph ellison for whom apologies were made on the morning of his scheduled appearance never intended to show up among mr baldwin s waiting detractors were both mr bone and mr rexroth and mr jones has yet to confront mr ellison in the wake of his highly the word is used advisedly negative review of mr jones the blues people literary feuds aside the conference on the negro writer in the united states turned out to be more than less an occasion for airing the intricacies and implications of the civil_rights struggle which surprised no one the race problem is an inevitable trap for the negro writer and there is no honest escape nor is there any objective reason why there should be even baldwin and jones after disclaiming any necessity for writing protest literature find that their work nevertheless falls into that category only ellison looking down from his personal olympus continues to talk as if considerations of art are above and beyond the question of involvement but it remained for ossie davis that full spirited actor playwright to put everything into perspective with an injection of healing humor acting out all the roles from a scene in his purlie victorious he achieved just the right mood for conciliation and acceptance and then he proceeded to tell it like it is the basic task of the writer white or black is to truly describe america to itself mr davis said at one point and then he got down to the root of the matter the negro writer has to write protest and it must be loud and bitter and aimed at corrective action and an emphatic amen langston hughes and the fantasy or harlem here is never any t f ending to the poet s song and the memory of each theme commits him to the eternal struggle of interpreting what other men are content to experience critic to analyze so called negro literature beyond the concept of traditional form they must go back to the roots to the rat infested jungles to the houses without windows and to the faces forgetting that hope does exist they must taste the strange aperitifs of poverty and despair as they are prepared for the symbolic harlem of hughes poetry and prose it is high time for the negro artist to lead them there the poetic odyssey of langston hughes began in cleveland ohio it was there that he was selected class poet while attending high school he accepted the challenge of meters stanzas and forms because they seemed much easier to deal with than ditches and dishes they also seemed to offer adventure so off to the sea he went as a sailor he learned the value of land it became more than soil houses and fences the land was power the land was science and politics the land owners ruled the world after the spell of the sea wore off he tried earning a living with his hands he also tried book learning at college and then journeyed to mexico where his land owning father attempted to reunite his family after a long separation the next decade would take him to the four corners of the world but before then there was harlem a number of his lesser poems turned up in the little magazines and in the form of pamphlets crisis the official organ of the n.a.a.c.p called him son the labor movement intrigued him the socialist and workers party heard in his plain language the inexplicable cry of the common man his early poems offered music to the weary ears of the little guy vachel lindsay hailed him discovered him as a waiter and busboy his little poems of free verse had freed him and finding freedom for himself he was obliged to seek freedom for others the gods would provide many blessings a patron a place to work a place to hide a trip through the southland a movie in russia a folk opera short stories a first book of poems a novel friends foes more poems tighter stories a broadway play and finally the omnipresent jesse semple and what of harlem the gift that gave the gods to him what is the poetry of how deep are the roots what does it mean to be a black poet in a white world why black why not just a poet who calls the shots and what about harlem the sweet flypaper of life the paradox of the wind and rain and sun climbing the backs of domestics porters elevator operators what mysterious realms separate her from the mainland can the poet langston hughes speak of the city within the city and not speak of the white man s concept of her alienness her ugliness can the poet langston hughes find in her dark obsessions the gift of metaphor simile and aliteration can the figurative patterns of negro speech be put to jazz can the human voice with all of its living modulations be made colorless can the strict metrical requirements of good verse give way to the speech of life black life is god really black is the face of a negro child no less beautiful than the face of a child of any land of any race harlem the hughes harlem of imperfectability harlem arising in the sun harlem sweet everlasting harlem of blazing lights and richard wright freezing at night in his thin overcoat working out his salvation as a native son harlem the natural symbol of misery the national symbol of a country s forked tongue and twisted pride harlem echoing her monosyllabic words to the sophisticated deaf ears of her congress her presidents her critics harlem where does the poet langston hughes fit yes i have known rivers older than the flow of human blood my soul has grown deep like the rivers yes my old pa died in a fine big house but i wonder where i m going to die being neither white nor black sweet harlem they walk in the day and dream at night from th to th he sees the neo classical beauty of a whore s twisted mouth and the bottles of juice stuffed in back pockets behind doors in trash cans under the sinks and why is the juice more meaningful than the constitution or cousin jake down in mississippi why is the soup kitchen more powerful than the gospel and the welfare worker more real than christ what is the cause is it my blackness is it your unconcern what does this poet see what does he mean let america be america again harlem your fantasy has lead him to your gruesome face caught in the full fury of your impassioned plight the nautical mile ends with the soft light of boys who would be men if men would make themselves known the fantasy ends when the banks of your river rise up to match the tide of america s indifference when the rats become lilies growing in front yards when the young see through the fa ade of their own bitterness and take the land to be their own when the true beauty of harlem is spoken of and learned like the pledge of allegiance when the people buy books to read books when the lawyers practice law when the politicians politic for the people when the cadillac owners sell out and sugar hill is no longer sweet when time and life and look learn what to see and whom to ask when paul robeson comes home and jesse semple has no other place to condemn when the sun falls on her belly and covers the world because time has come to an end and your poet like the merchant shall have nothing more to sell i think i see your doom harlem langston hughes has known it all the while he has known your beauty but you would not let your poet tell the world laugh harlem laugh the joke is too universal too ironic too beautiful for you and your poet alone another fantasy begins the freedom riders never board the a train the seeminglv wild young men of stall ins are a different breed they have a harlem unlike the caricatures of your poet s best stories and sketches they have arrived for the show down they are not impressed with the intellectual milieu of greenwich village nor the distant echoes of their job conscious fathers and mothers let america become america again has become real for them and what of harlem what has happened to the harlem of langston hughes where are the solemn faces where are the countee cullens and the alain lockes what happened to the subtleties what happened to the dancing girls and the night people spreading joy and spilling juice at the wonder bar your face has changed the world of langston hughes has come of age he had made laughter a precious thing for horror rides the subways for thirty years he has tried to make you laugh at yourself but humor and the forces of evil do not mix no other poet of your history either past or present has known your shame and self respect so well time changes the past the rats are the graven images of what time has failed to do for you the poetry of your face cries for new symbolism and new words we shall never know the fading symbol of thick lips and bulging eyes in our generation time changes the nature and order of things but the poet s song is never ending direct action the library was a t j stuffy place to study race relations judy confided this to her friend as they exited from the great doors let the stone busts breathe the sacred wisdom inhale it exhale it too judy sat on the cool abutment and stared at her girl friend s sandals then into the spring sunlight that reflected in the concrete steps she yawned pulled her brown hair over her eyes and emitted a soft groan of inertia roxanne bouncy as her fluff of red hair laughed judy a three pointsix student moaning over a simple theme i m sick of stripping facts out of books judy said yet she was apprehensive about her newest plan too direct action was not for the sensitive the bay cities were ideal for her project pickets mass arrests limp bodies black marias common sights but her reports were black and white like the headlines that screamed unrest from corner stands her paper on black muslims was rated superior and the phony buyers at grocery shop ins grade a picketing the trial of a cop who mishandled a negro so good it was read in class is a person right or wrong because he is a cop or a negro nearly all the facts judy complained came from printed matter juggled and rehashed it s research when you steal from the many what a gas crazy roxanne gasped your best themes came from close ups you

the more she studied and observed the less she knew her final paper would be a grade a flop if she could really talk to one black person penetrate him in depth it would reveal more than statistics de

gingerbread house roxanne stifled a chuckle as she whispered stay away from the hills honey black zeus and judy climbed through knee deep wild oats till they reached the highest fire road it was steep and when they crawled over the last brink they slumped in the short lush grass panting and laughing the tilden eucalyptus grove was above a shaggy forest with its hair down across the vale was a sloping golf course where sunday drivers pulled at their club carts judy was surprised at black zeus s new demeanor wearing a coffee picker s straw hat light slacks and hiking doggers he was like a mexican vine tender in her native saratoga not at all like his street image three days earlier when she made her first pitch she had been nervous but an hour ago when she called for him at the caffe mediterraneum her attitude had changed as much as his appearance even in the cosmopolitan scene people stared but she felt newly smart the attention said to her there goes a hip gal what dare what poise they could see over the golf hill to the bay in the misty distance the golden gate bridge spanned its graceful authority from bank to bank it s a cool view he said i m glad you asked me up here his voice was velvety the tone easy and sustained nutty but i ve never seen it before when you first asked me i thought crazy a coolschool maid in the woods well he snapped his fingers still crazy what s the theory behind it must there be one gotta his black goatee pointed a challenge at her judy toyed with the rough fibers of a tiny plant myself i don t believe in mixed marriages oh i mean it s okay for those who want it but couldn't take all those fringe problems she looked up at his brown flesh and yellow straw against the azure tell me what kind of white girls go for mixed dating what s the theory behind it hey that s my question he glanced at judy s tanned face laughing i asked first she said conscious that her dodge was a whopper uh lemme see the brand of pink cheeks who date us niggahs judy flew at him don t say it like that black zeus showed her his superior smirk it s my personal privilege cookie get it i mean it s a freedom of sorts oh hell i m sorry well why the broads go for it eh excitement sex it s in to talk about it after they wanna see what s under the rug he shrugged maybe they like to smell the subterranean scene i dunno oh a few mixed couples are sincere they climbed till they reached the summit near the thicket doggers slacks flat heels and black capris parted the tasseled grasses puffing they sat on a solid granitecolored bluff they were conquerors smugly surveying the sprawled masses all around the bayshore gold is my gal color he said like fried trout the pale dolls assume they re improving a bloodand pink gig mmm sweet charity he kissed his fingertips what type am i it was a patronizing question she couldn t resist he looked at her she saw the pudgy lips part to reveal gleaming teeth that s exactly what i ve been wondering he said you seem to be taking me serious that s a scare with any chick i mean i don t get it not that i m bored by your company but you re the first rosy cheek to take me serious yet i suspect you re not taking me seriously just my race what s the angle judy thought the way he looks at me well he knows what he wants my angle to be but she said i told you three days ago black zeus groaned ye gods judy there s one reason i wanted to come here to get away from the problem i just want to see the scenery with human eyes smell the flowers with human nostrils listen to the birds with human ears here i can be me not a goddam problem i m sorry he was blank for a moment then he dug at his cigarette pocket flipping the lighter he touched the tip of her smoke then his blue clouds merged in the clear air as he spoke it s okay judy what can i tell you she sucked hard with each draw and tried to remember her questions one by one they came till she felt like the school girl she was what did negroes think of the sitins shop ins stall ins bulldozer blocking freedom riders snick and core he should relax breathe deeply of nature and react normally black zeus shook his head lovin jesus judy i m no authority on what we think of all that sure i should dig it but i m a backslider i ve got my own miseries what do white women think of careers homemaking sex on the side judy smiled wryly ashamed of her ignorance she had goofed it even before she d finished her own questions she knew this it wasn t the way it was planned and before he d taunted her with his comeback the clear insight had come being black was like belonging to a heavy laden corporation and zeus was no organization man he was an individual or he struggled to be well judy remember the beefs to rox the personal plane girl oh she cried look at the bay the sailboats are toys on a fairy lake zeus smiled as smoke steamed from his mouth and nostrils sweet mamma nature he beamed mother of the year groovey laughing they strolled hand in hand up a gentle rise toward the grove what if we walked a birmingham street like this she asked he shuddered judy feeling his sudden vibration decided it was genuine are you crazy he thundered hey is this part of your research does it matter she glanced up at him lordy i dream about this cussed paper especially one night in that dream i even kissed a negro what was it like it was salty black zeus jackknifed in laughter wanna find out for sure well why not a kiss is just a kiss the next afternoon judy waited for roxanne at the crossroad of causes as they called it where the university s stony esplanade pours into telegraph avenue here the dedicated sat at folding tables heaped high with petitions mimeo tirades and passionate pamphlets these praised or damned birchers the bomb marijuana laws cuban and canal policies ad infinitum volunteers ranged from budding revolutionaries to square jawed preservers judy watched the excited group roxanne was locked in a solemn black muslim with white shirt and dark tie waving a fistful of leaflets was denouncing sammy davis and chubby checker and roxanne s red tresses blew in the breeze as she shook a psych workbook at him at least sammy and chubby married those blonde chicks the poor muslim judy thought rox likely egged him into it roxanne was the type who had a hot spiel for brief periods especially with newly met people they d stare at her wondering ooh what a live one where have i been all my life if rox wanted to make an impression she d leave before running down for this moment judy waited patiently judy herself often plunged into the crossroad debates but not today she felt subdued in thought the two girls shuffled through pedestrians along the avenue at the curb were barreled plants and parked vehicles mostly foreign miniatures with a few domestic cars current and vintage judy s ponytail flopped as she paced her steps past the tobacco and magazine shop the trade in book stores and the window displays of primitive religious art at the mexican taco den with its peppery smells mingling with traffic fumes they turned this was the day they d begin search for a two room flat though they wouldn t move for two more weeks neither was bored at home so they informed their confused parents but a private apartment was inevitable incoming friends would be less inhibited this was their first real privacy of the day and judy knew roxanne was panting for news but she volunteered nothing so you did romp the hills roxanne said well we counted woodticks judy said woodticks toadshnicks judy callagh come to the scene you know what i want to find out was i right am i a greek oracle judy s smile was faraway but amused she nodded judy felt her friend s fingers digging into her shoulder as one intent on destruction the girls stopped roxanne s hard eyes soon melted into impelling tingling curiosity what was it like judy i mean with a her voice was low expectant judy feeling more angry than wisened snapped at her god damn it rox you talk like a stinkin virgin you know what it s like for some time they walked silently as they neared the apartment judy sensed the other s smoldering hurt she spoke up stoically you re disappointed in me aren t you rox well i try not to be roxanne said but a negro i okay rox shall we forget the apartment roxanne hesitated as both girls stared down at the wistaria roots no give me a few days i ll be okay judy for several hours till her date that night with black zeus judy worked at her notes she convinced herself she felt neither depressed nor exalted her mother at breakfast had thanked her for the warning she had no objections to the date but would lack the poise to be present with friends she attended a campus lecture called the flavors of wine two older sisters were married and her brother ushered at a theatre only her father was home it was he zeus wanted to meet they could talk jazz judy had told him of her father s vast collection of old seventy eights mr callagh had not really listened to the records for years he d take pride in acquainting a young negro with the past culture of his own people it was hard to believe he hadn t heard bessie noone or pinetop judy curled softly on a lamplit sofa listened to the men exchange backgrounds her father once a wine vat jockey now had his own package shop on grove he saved and scrimped and invested and went broke twice in between judy injected laughing he pulled a face at his daughter the red nose humped and the eyes pierced as he jerked at his swatch of gray hair black zeus with the keen quick eyes of a carny barker enjoyed the interchange his name was really joe smith black zeus explained but the nickname stuck and anyway he liked the holy identity his real name was very distinguished mr callagh said as he d see when he heard the records judy sat wondering what was in her friend s mind yet sensing she could never really know even if he spoke with scriptural clarity he was once more a new person both in manner and attire he was neither the jumble of emotions as on the hill nor yet a spouter of copied jargon as in his usual dens she had watched him now in three distinct settings he changed with each was it a personal characteristic or was any negro skilled at adapting himself to what the white world expected color consciousness was stupid yet pretending it didn t exist was even more stupid the community was in the agony of growing pains that would be the core of her theme she d call it judging negroes one at a time the barriers involved the talk from all three was easy free and yet it was hampered by inexperience or by nature itself her father sensing this had prepared jumbo sized vodkas even this prompted an excuse i never listen to bessie smith sober he said grinning judy watched as the pair lost themselves in the eternal primitiveness of the blues bessie s slippery embellishments swelled out and filled the room just as she dominated the horn and rhythm some people call me a hobo some call me a bum nobody knows my name nobody knows what i ve done her voice cried up from the depths of some private hell and joe smith s comet sounding low and mean as a tailgate trombone confirmed her every lament the records were worn and sandy it was like dusting off the family album and looking at pictures of back when the legato tragedies the smashed piano thirds the sensitive corroboration of the hom each sound was the visit of an old friend and old confusions too she remembered as a small girl her parents and their friends sitting on the floor listening sipping suffering with a vicarious sense of exaltation there was a return of her ancient wondering all that misery who were all those slaves in the records and why why maybe if people could drink and listen to blues forever well maybe they d forget the love of blood and greed but daylight always came bottles were empty and people began hating again it was the way of the world it was silly musings judy thought she finished her drink and started another so did the men she watched her father and black zeus both were on the floor near the changer their heads were bowed drunk on the sad beauty of the old blues black zeus was in the orgiastic throes of discovery strange strange strange judy kept thinking he was lazy indifferent and unemployed a sensitive lover a sincerely clever adapter but his was a world she couldn t easily comprehend what did it matter he wasn t her boy friend just an amiable hipster who agreed to help a girl with her lessons yet the impression stuck to her like memories of the music he and i he and i and the men weaving a little laughing talking they nodded and argued and agreed and laughed again yes a negro was a natural philosopher he had to be and he was trapped into being a spokesman too as the stack of records lowered so did the mark in the bottle young woman s blues empty bed blues send me to the lectric chair and many others then they began to talk race again and judy despite the restraining warmth of the vodka tensed i m sure of one thing her father said a white man will always ask a negro the wrong question black zeus glanced up so that s what i say what the hell they laughed down south zeus said the ofay i mean they never ask the wrong thing they re always right that s one thing we don t hafta guess well her father said a little bleary eyed waving his glass you won t have to guess here either cause i m a phony liberal judy jumped at him oh daddy you re not either yes i am yes i am he countered shaking his head tell you what mister joe smith i hope you ll come back again especially after judy moves out he looked over at his daughter if she does meaning the choice was hers judy and black zeus traded glances then she looked down at the carpet that s right her father said i hope you ll come again and again maybe you can hep me i mean hip me to this modem jazz he laughed a moment then added yessir i m a phony but honest to god i didn t know it judy wanted to bolster him she wanted to say the test isn t now but if i married a negro i think you d come through gracefully in the end but of course she didn t she couldn t have said it even if they were alone communication even with him seemed difficult black zeus shook hands and said he d better leave and thanks for a most illuminating evening judy followed him to the porch see you around cookie sure she said goodnight joe it was a wonderful evening when she came in her father was gone she heard him in the bathroom and called in a goodnight then she went upstairs judy undressed in the dark and fell on to the bed intent on rationalizing herself to sleep she hadn t intended to let him have her in the hills really she hadn t despite her smart talk beforehand as she neared sleep some hours later she borrowed roxanne s words and applied them to herself give me a few days literature said a l frenchman named bonnard more than a century ago is the expression of man the goncourt brothers viewed the novelist as the historian of the present for henry james the novel was felt life these definitions though somewhat dated are most appropriate for our purposes and will serve as a point of departure for our discussion of the portrayal of african society by contemporary negro african novelists thus we shall be less concerned with style than with content and for the sake of clarity we shall largely ignore the various classifications of novels in his histoire du roman modern history of the modern novel published in r m alberes lists an astounding number of such classifications a random selection of which would include the baroque novel the realistic novel the post realistic novel the naturalistic novel the psychological novel the historical novel the intimate novel the polyphonic novel the mystical novel the ironical novel the lyric novel the picaresque novel the novel of analysis the novel of apprenticeship the new novel the anti novel science fiction mystery stories the de centralized novel and then something he calls the roman puzzle the puzzle novel obviously therefore a word about limitations is in order the speaker is forced by linguistics to restrict himself to novels written in french or in english this means that we shall unfortunately be unable to include works in yoruba swahili or any of the african languages our second limitation is perhaps less serious we shall focus on the african novel which has been something of a stepchild and has received less attention than african verse nevertheless the dividing line between literary genre in africa is indeed thin a story a fable a poem often overlap and there are passages of african prose more poetic than some of the modem verse we hear as leopold sedar senghor points out in his preface to birago diop s les contes d amadou koumba the tales of amadou koumba even within a given genre the walls of the classification are porous our third limitation stems from the authors themselves and from their milieu writing in a language that is not their mother tongue they depend for the most part on foreign publishers and foreign readers have you noticed asks a character in ousmane soce diop s karim that many senegalese never open a newspaper or a serious book they believe an education has to end when they walk out of the school door in un negre a paris a negro in paris bernard dadie of the ivory coast claims that some of his compatriots boast that they have never opened a book written by a negro i would surmise that even the publications of presence africaine have many more european than african readers another limitation is geographical for several sub saharan countries have as yet produced no novelist in french or english there are indications however that new voices from many of these places will soon be heard numerous anthologies are now appearing i even saw one the other day in swedish meetings of african writers have been held in paris in rome in kampala and elsewhere magazines such as presence africaine black orpheus and transition are providing outlets for new authors five of our novelists are from senegal and an equal number from south africa two each from cameroon the ivory coast and dahomey one each from congo brazzaville guinea niger sierra leone and french guiana we have included the latter because he pioneered in this field and because his novels were inspired by twelve years in equatorial africa and because no study of negro african fiction could omit reference to rene maran in a much discussed volume published in dr frantz fanon a martiniquan psychiatrist now dead who became very prominent in the algerian fln divided the writing of colonized authors into three periods the first period he said is an assimilation period when inspiration is european and one can easily tie up these works to a well defined trend in european literature the second period is one of pre combat literature when the colonized person has not yet become a part of his own people he is satisfied with just reminiscing and he brings up old childhood memories ancient legends which he will re interpret according to a foreign aesthetic according to a conception of the world that has been discovered abroad sometimes fanon says this pre combat literature will be dominated by humor and allegory the third period dr fanon continues is one of combat literature now instead of encouraging the lethargy of his people the writer blows the bugle and he awakens them this is a literature of combat a revolutionary literature a nationalistic literature and during this period men and women he says who had never even thought that they would take pen in hand to write for other people to read are in prison or they re facing a firing squad or they know they re going to face a firing squad and they sit down and they write as their hearts and as their passions dictate now with all due respect to the brilliance of dr fanon s expose one can still question its applicability to negro african literature or more particularly to the negroafrican novel where the three periods seem to merge into one that is the assimilationist period the period of pre combat literature and the period of combat literature the first important french african novel for example rene maran s batouala which dates back to is as scathing and as effective a condemnation of colonialism as any african work of fiction published since that date and it has the additional advantage of being written with consummate artistry the well rounded picture of african life the literary expression of african society will of necessity reflect colonialism and its concomitants but it will also include the many other facets of the african s life his culture his problems and his essential dignity what i find objectionable in dr fanon s thesis is the implication that violence alone inspires the highest form of art and the conscious or unconscious attempt to make every negro african author conform to a single pattern a case in point is that of camara laye of guinea whose excellent novel uenfant noir the dark child was criticized by some of the author s compatriots because in their opinion it was not a livre de combat one critic for example admitted that laye is an authentic poet but accused him of practicing art for art s sake and for not measuring up to the standards set by richard wright in black boy i read a part of this african s criticism on the contrary laye stubbornly closes his eyes to the most crucial realities especially those realities that one has always been careful not to reveal to the general public this guinean my compatriot hasn t he ever seen anything except a peaceful beautiful motherly africa is it possible that never once did he witness the tiniest little infraction by the colonial administration perhaps it did not occur to this critic that richard wright and camara laye were two distinct personalities each writing his autobiography according to his individual talent and his personal experiences despite the difference in their approach there is little doubt that black boy and the dark child were motivated by similar aspirations wright who exerted marked influence on mongo beti of cameroon sembene ousmane of senegal and other african novelists would surely have en dorsed camara laye s statement our deepest and most sensitive characteristics are passion for independence and equality to justify this right to independence and equality the negro african novelist has used a wide variety of tactics he has written subjectively objectively ironically bitterly sympathetically in protest or in defense he has written autobiographical novels such as the dark child climbie or down second avenue he has written tales of the bush such as maran s batouala or tutuola s palm wine drinkard stories of miners in johannesburg or a striking railway worker in senegal tales of the teeming urban centers such as ekwensi s people of the city achebe s no longer at ease or beti s ville cruelle cruel city he s written legends historical novels tales of the transplanted african and political novels such as peter abrahams a wreath for udomo and william conton s the african this approach has made his works more readable has carried his message to different kinds of readers and has emphasized the human qualities of his people who for example could fail to be touched by camara laye s poetic tribute to his mother i d like to quote from this not just because i think it s beautiful but because in the english translation this dedication has been cut in half femme noire femme africaine toi ma mere je pense a toi o daman ma mere toi qui me portas sur le dos toi qui m allaitais toi qui gouvernas mes premiers pas toi qui la premiere m ou vris les yeux aux prodigis de la terre je pense a toi femme des champs femme des rivieres femme du grand fleuve toi ma mere je je pense a toi all of that is deleted in the english translation and then the last little sentence femme noire femme africaine toi ma mere merci merci pour tout ce que tu fis pour moi ton fils si loin si pres de toi black woman african woman oh you my mother thank you thank you for all that you did for me your son so far and yet so near to you such is the dedication but the novel ends with the hero on a plane headed for paris to continue his education this is the conflict between the old and the new between tradition and innovation that underlies most of the negro african novels basically it began with the arrival of the european in one of maran s stories bokorro the python asks moumeu the crocodile what s a white man a white man is a man who is not black moumeu replies and then adds but the white man knows how to handle the lightning our authors found that the white man had brought education and exploitation hospitals and haughtiness christianity and colonial ism money and misery knowledge but not wisdom progress but not partnership the african wanted the progress but he also wanted to retain the more human aspects of his own culture in the words of ezekiel mphahlele the south african exile i admire the white man s achievements his mind that plans tall buildings powerful machinery i used to want to justify myself and my own kind to the white man i later discovered that it wasn t worth it it was to myself and to my kind i needed to justify myself i think now that the white man has no right to tell me how to order my life as a social being or order it for me he may teach me how to make a shirt or how to read and to write but my forebears and i could teach him a thing or two if only he would listen and allow himself time to feel africa is no more for the white man who comes here to teach and to control her human material forces and not to learn incidentally my friend mphahlele is a very ardent critic of negritude and i point out to him the negritude in this particular passage to his dismay this kind of passage indicating partial but by no means total rejection of european values inspires janheinz jahn to write in muntu the africans could become black europeans if they wished but they do not want to do so as their representatives unanimously insist nor do they wish to preserve their inherited culture in all its details but they do want to preserve its basic conception of which they have become conscious in their contact with other cultures our novelists reject among other things the white man s greed his arrogance his forced labor segregated churches his hypocrisy his injustice a surprising number of characters in these novels are in prison often without sufficient justification batouala spends two weeks in jail simply because the commandant took the word of an unscrupulous interpreter you remember the scene batouala was the village chieftain and his people hadn t brought in enough rubber and so the commander speaking through an interpreter of course chided batouala and told him he d have to do better next time the interpreter was as i said unscrupulous and he proceeded to tell batouala the commander says that you ve got to bring him so many chickens and some cattle and bring me your brother s young sister i m going to marry her well batouala who understood a little french said the commander didn t say that what s he saying the commander asked oh he called you a nasty name the interpreter said and so batouala went to jail but that s the way the interpreters worked back then in the days of colonialism in coeur d aryenne the heart of an aryan by jean malonga of congo brazzaville yoka is in carcerated because a european wants to seduce his wife another african in the same novel is imprisoned because a white girl visited his home dadie s climbie is arrested on suspicion of being a trouble maker oyono s toundi in une vie de boy is jailed because he knows that madame is having an affair with moreau the prison warden even meka the law abiding african of le vieux negre et la medaille also by oyono of the cameroon spends a night in jail because he drank just a little bit too much and fell asleep just a few hours after he had been decorated by the french udomo is arrested for publishing an incendiary article called a call to the people rise and be free likewise two characters in con ton s the african are imprisoned for political reasons a girl in people of the city is jailed for three months on suspicion of stealing a piece of cloth the hero of achebe s no longer at ease is arrested for accepting a bribe down mphahlele s second avenue south africans are incarcerated for brewing or drinking beer in view of the frequency with which the prison appears and reappears in these novels one would almost be tempted to consider it the symbol of colonialism but a host of other aspects more of them far less gruesome completes the picture we learn in these pages what the africans eat and how they dress we see them at work and at play maran achebe and beti describe their games and wrestling matches we see them at the islamic school in cheikh hamidou kane s uaventure ambigue and we see them at the french school with ake loba camara laye or bernard dadie at the english school with conton at a school in south africa with mphahlele several novelists describe their dances in the novels in fact we follow the african from birth to burial stopping en route to learn about age groups griots totems dancing bride price courtship and marriage listening to their venerable elders regret the traditions of the past and to their young men debate the problems of the day achebe tells us about an osu a person dedicated to a god a thing set apart a taboo forever and his children after him he can neither marry nor be married by the freeborn onuora nzekwu s hero in wand of noble wood cannot marry the girl who is under the curse of the iyi ocha camara laye s father learned the future from a little black snake his mother also had strange powers one day she was asked to help a man whose horse refused to get up laye writes when we arrived at the pasture we saw the horse he was lying in the grass gazing at us unconcernedly his owner tried again to make him get up and spoke to him in honeyed tones but the horse remained deaf to all entreaties his master raised a hand to strike him don t strike him said my mother it won t do any good she went up to the horse and lifting her own hand declared solemnly if it is true that from the day of my birth i had knowledge of no man until the day of my marriage and if it is true that from the day of my marriage i ve had knowledge of no man other than my husband if these things be true then i command you stand up we all saw the horse get up and follow his master quietly away i have told in very simple words and in very exact words what i saw then with my own eyes and to my mind it is unbelievable but the event was just as i described it the horse got up without any further delay and followed his master from thomas mofola south africa bernard dadie ivory coast birago diop senegal ousmane soce diop senegal jean malonga congo brazzaville and others we learn of the africans legends some of which are built around historical characters such as chaka others around places such as the old empire of ghana even more important for an understanding of the african life than these picturesque details and episodes are the many examples of what has been called la sagesse africaine african wisdom one finds this wisdom first expressed in various proverbs original in their imagery although universal in their appeal from rene maran for example you can make children but you can t make their character stay alive is the first law of wisdom you don t hunt a lion and an antelope in the same way from birago diop one never knows how useful the backside is until one has to sit down give your love to a woman but not your trust the hyena who wants to eat his offspring finds that they smell like a goat from ousmane soce diop in a country where people dance on one foot the visitor must also dance on one foot from sembene ousmane money has not roots but it grows in the heart who knows the value of a nut unless it s broken from chinua achebe a man who lives on the banks of the niger does not wash his hands with spittle anger against a brother is felt in the flesh not in the bone and from mongo beti of the cameroon what is woman a stately palm tree and anyone can climb it who has a belt these proverbs are realistic often a bit cynical sometimes poetic and always impregnated with good hard common sense a second source of african wisdom in these novels is found in the black man s ability to adjust to the difficult conditions under which he lives his very survival is evidence of this ability we believe with rene maran that the first law of wisdom is to stay alive the man or animal who cannot adapt is destined to disappear but the african is destined to live wisdom also requires man not only to adapt to life but also to try to improve that life for himself or for his children or for his children s children to make an adjustment to life one tactic used by the africans is their humor irony it s healthy to be able to laugh occasionally to laugh at oneself there are countless examples in the novels of seeing the comic side of an unfunny situation bernard dadie s negre a paris visits a church in the french capital he sees statues of saints along the wall and not one black one among them i repeat he says we have no right to paradise apparently we must frighten st peter an awful lot and i guess he sends us down in the other direction because of the color of our skin a discussion of the europeans shortcomings ends when batouala s father recommends a rabelaisian solution he says we will do better to grumble less about the whites and to drink more you know just as well as i do that except for the bed pernod is the only important invention by the europeans the hero of oyono s chemin d europe the road to europe sets himself up in business as a guide to tourists and stages all kinds of fantastic shows for travellers who come to africa looking for exoticism he sees to it that they photograph the pigmy the monkey who is balancing on a branch the boa constrictor puffed up after eating and the hippopotamus scampering along the edge of the river all of the so called formidable extraordinary sensational scenes and he says my compatriots and i improvised a little rite that delighted our explorers to such an extent that we could see them showing their film at the next cinematographic festival and being crowned africanists the same irony enables chinua achebe to end things fall apart with the district commissioner who stirred up all kinds of trouble musing over the book that he plans to write said title to be the pacification of the primitive tribes of the lower niger perhaps the crowning expression of african irony is camara laye s le regard du roi the radiance of the king in which european and african values are portrayed in an entirely new light clarence the european exiled in black africa must divest himself of his preconceived ideas of morality and justice and stand naked as a child before being received in the radiance of the king the important and varied role played by laughter in african life is recognized by most of the novelists several writers maran conton dadie describe it incidentally you ll find in richard wright s black_power a very interesting passage on the laughter of kwame nkrumah ake loba analyzes the african laugh as follows the african laughs when he s melancholy just as he dances when he s sad laughter also serves him as a response to the stranger who is curious to find out about his customs he laughs to delude his interlocutor or to be evasive in a word he laughs when he s happy or when he s angry or when he s unlucky but all these laughters don t have the same meaning since laughter is a very eloquent vocabulary generally the african laughs to mislead the person to whom he is speaking he laughs to make the other man believe he s not very observant and meanwhile the african is looking over very carefully studying very carefully the person who is trying to interrogate him he dissects the hearts he turns them over and over and then he becomes shut up in his own silence just as if he were ignorant of everything african laughter seen in this light is therefore a manifestation of african wisdom a means of keeping one s equilibrium come what may but there s yet another indication of african wisdom in these novels the determination to improve one s existence the most obvious evidence of this is the zeal for education an area in which the african is less reluctant to accept european values although not without modification the struggle for an education fills many pages of these novels the dark child climbie kocoumbo uaventure ambigue the african in the african william conton summarizes a letter with which his father starts him out on his career as a student then my father went on to remind me that i had now started to climb a palm tree which was high and difficult to climb that many were watching my progress and much ripe fruit was awaiting me on the successful completion of my climb he ended with a warning that if i failed to reach the top those watching me both living and dead would curse me for failing them on the other hand if i reached the top in order simply to gorge myself with fruit i would surely become sick and fall to the ground and die but if i returned to my people to share with them the fruit of my labors then all would sing my praise and thank me and honor those who had brought me to life the new schooling almost always contained painful separation as the youngsters left home for dakar conakry ougadougou paris or london it also meant creaking with the old traditions nowhere in the novels is this more poignantly expressed than in l aventure ambigu'e la grand royale detests the foreign school but nonetheless she insists that her nephew and other africans enroll there she explains we ve got to go to the europeans and learn from them how to conquer without being right moreover the battle isn t over yet the new school is the new form of war fare that is being waged against us the school in which i would place our children will kill in them what today we love and rightly conserve with care perhaps the very memory of us will die in them when they return from the school there may be those who will not recognize us what i am proposing says this princess is that we should agree to die in our children s heart and that the foreigners who have defeated us should fill the place which we shall have left free in explaining this she uses the analogy of the fields what do we do just before the rainy season we love our fields but still we plow them up we set fire to them if our children are going to get along in life we ve got to be willing to lose them for a while at least until they learn the ways of the european and are able to make the necessary adjustment likewise boubou hama in his autobiography stresses the ordeal of separation today thanks to the education which led him to the ecole william ponty in senegal and to a distinguished career he s president of niger s national assembly in addition as an untiring student of african culture he has merged the best of two worlds into an admirable synthesis occasionally a novelist questions the applicability of the curriculum or the competence of certain teachers or the low level of certain education in institutions it s fantastic how illusory what we study in college is says mongo beti on transferring from his school in ivory coast to france ake loba s hero kocoumbo finds himself terribly handicapped and ill prepared to keep pace with his european classmates who are years younger than he on the other hand there s a considerable amount of healthy self criticism in the novels ake loba chides those who are more diligent in frequenting cafes than in attending their classes camara laye s uncle complains about all the students who look down on technical school they ve always thought about a career of paper scratching is that the kind of career that you want a career where you will forever be thirteen to the dozen and ousmane soce diop who s now senegal s ambassador to this country makes a similar observation we the senegalese the urban senegalese we have a prejudice against manual trades there is some progress and some people nowadays are willing to become bricklayers or carpenters and yet this prejudice still exists and some young men would rather live as parasites than to have to work with their hands and he adds a country which does not want to work and which is satisfied with luxury and pleasure is headed for failure in the great struggle for life the hero of bernard dadie s climbie is even more explicit he spends a summer vacation on his uncle s farm and learns these facts of african life at the very beginning we started out wrong but was it really our fault with the european presence the jobs as clerks began more deserving in the eyes of the people who didn t understand that you could leave school without being a clerk either in the administration or in business or in any case always by the side of the european and we all thought that way the european was the master everything depended on him taxis rain and good weather as well and then the uncle goes on to relate the difficulties he had in making the plantation produce and adds finally work and after work independence my child self reliance should be the motto of your generation and you should also run away from the man who doesn t like to work thus our authors stress the importance of developing technical and commercial skills if africa is to attain some degree of economic independence the ill fated hero of sembene ousmane s o pays mon beau peuple attempts a farmers cooperative to start his country on the way to industrialization udomo signs an agreement with the apostles of apartheid even when this means sacrificing the life of his fellow revolutionary and long time friend corruption and conspicuous consumption on the part of public officials are decried by the nigerian achebe while the senegalese abdoulaye sadji now dead criticizes the women of his country for their excessive expenditures on trinkets now that political independence has been achieved by most of these countries the need for a viable economy becomes the no problem and we may well expect to see it figure even more prominently in future novels by africans as their novelists catch up with their economists they will appreciate the urgency of intra and inter continental cooperation in a remarkable passage udomo reduces his fundamental problems to three listen selina he says to the market woman who helped him to become the father of his country i ll tell you what i m after our country has three enemies or rather had three enemies i ve turned one of them into an ally now but let s say there are three i know you can guess one but can you guess the other two no don t bother the first is the white man then there is poverty and then there is the past these are the three enemies this triple challenge will continue to confront the african novelist tomorrow for the alleviation of poverty much depends on the sincerity and perspicacity of the europeans cooperation but the decision as to what should be retained and what should be rejected from the past now rests squarely on african shoulders in all likelihood a determined attempt will be made to eradicate tribal divisions and other obstacles to the realization of african unity which is probably the basic tenet of contemporary african ideology judging from recent examples in african fiction neither christianity nor communism seems likely to become a predominant force by and large our novelists viewing the european representative of christianity as an ally of colonialism have tended to treat it with hostility or indifference african wisdom will no doubt perceive the less debatable ties between communism and a more brutal a more tenacious colonialism at the moment there have been few manifestations of that phenomenon in african life to keep his job in a paris factory and to please his european girlfriend kocoumbo joins the party but he never warms up to its doctrine and he leaves the party after his girlfriend dies summing up we may say that our novelists though relatively few in number and hampered by all kinds of obstacles have attempted to interpret varied aspects of an extremely complex reality with little encouragement a goncourt prize in and several minor awards down through the years they have persevered in a vital but thankless task that of portraying the african s problems aspirations and humanity to the world some of their works have been mediocre others would reflect credit on any literature until recently few of their volumes had been translated even today almost none of these writers can depend on the income from his novels for a livelihood ousmane soce diop birago diop oyono and camara laye are in the diplomatic service malonga achebe and ekwensi have been working for the radio quenum of dahomey mongo beti and conton are school teachers dadie is directeur des beaux arts cheikh hamidou kane is with unicef peter abrahams living and writing in exile in the west indies is the outstanding exception the danger is that the more remunerative positions now available in the emergent african states may prevent them from continuing their literary careers and this paradoxically at a time when there is a ready market for their manuscripts moreover the new africa will need them to describe its new reality collectively despite a fumbling effort here and there they have the experience the talent the imagination and the objectivity the material for a masterpiece is at their fingertips a continent in transition with a new prestige and new responsibilities a world increasingly conscious of its interdependence human relations between african and african between european and african the inevitable struggle against poverty illiteracy and disease the equally inevitable struggle for human rights in south africa and other multiracial areas the quest for african unity the promise of a rich harvest in african life and african letters may or may not be fulfilled for much work remains to be done but on the whole these forerunners have cleared the land they have planted wisely and well they have left their younger brothers grounds for optimism a place in the sun a heritage of hope

would you want your w daughter to marry one what kind of a question is that and why do you keep asking lately we have noticed that your daughters name crops up in every conversation concerning the rights of negroes last year approximately marriages were reported in the u s of this number some were negroes no statistics are available as to how many of the latter married into your race one reason might be that many of the ones you fear as a soninlaw were actually as white as your daughter one thing is certain it is obvious that none of them married your daughter either because your daughter wouldnt have one or one wouldnt have your daughter so whats your gripe now if the negro is the inferior creature you accuse him of being then your worries are over and your question goes begging surely your daughter must have a sense of smell therefore her nose should support your thesis that the negro stinks if the negros cranial capacity is a year throwback to the neanderthal man as you contend the only reason your daughter would accept such a creature as her lifes mate would be that she is equally deficient if that is the case then you should give your blessings to such a union even you will agree it would be better for her to be married to one than to snatch flies in an institution now because you are my brother and i use the term advisedly perhaps i can help you find comfort in your attempt to preserve the sanctity and virtue of your race and progeny your daughter need not marry one if you follow a few guide lines i shall present them gratuitously an examination of the total marriage population of our country reveals that statistics are in your comer if one could determine the number of marriages involving negroes only and negroes and whites the percentage of interracial marriages would seem insignificant it would likewise be to your advantage to lower this percentage still further by raising your fair daughter on a farm data on hand reveals that intermarriage rates are higher in urban areas than in rural areas of the states it would do well for you to live in one of the states having statutes that make interracial marriages a crime this is true of all southern states and in all but five of the nonsouthern states west of the mississippi but only in indiana among the northern states east of the mississippi not only is intermarriage prohibited in mississippi but this state has a criminal statute for punishing anyone for publishing printing or circulating any literature in favor of or urging interracial marriage or social equality it appears then that of all the states in the union the land of the sweet magnolias would ideally serve as the remover of all your fears indeed in this state in spite of the entrance of james meredith into ole miss your daughter might grow up to be acclaimed as several others have been before her miss america no pun intended before you decide to move it is only fair to warn you that there are some states and cities that you must avoid at all cost stay clear of new york chicago detroit and boston interracial marriages in these areas rose to a notorious high of per cent during the past years if you are honest in protecting your daughter from this abominable statistic go south old man go south with apologies to horace greeley some northern states however may be entered with relative safety in fact back home in indiana no matter how much one might be in love with your daughter or how much your daughter might be in love with one no justice of the peace judge or clergyman can legally perform such a ceremony any person who forges racial strains together in the unholy chains of matrimony is subject to a fine imprisonment or both a study of interracial marriages raises another point you should consider the possibility of your daughter marrying a negro is raised somewhat if she has been previously married particularly if she has been married more than twice to a gentlemen of her own ethnic background it appears then that the best contribution you can make in conserving your racial stock is to make sure that her first marriage is for real by all means if she is predisposed to get rid of her first mate find her a man any man as long as his face is white lets face factseach time she gets a divorce she is moving in the direction of your nightmare another safeguard at your disposal is for you to become a millionaire the daughters of rich men will think twice before risking being disinherited it becomes most necessary at this point to protect her from your own history in the field of race relations she must never learn that you yourself are a firm believer in segregation in the streets and integration between the sheets consequently your argument to keep the race pure is suspect the late william e b du bois once expressed it thusly the rape which you gentlemen have inflicted on helpless black women in defiance of your own laws is written on the foreheads of two million mulattoes and written in ineffable blood of course we recognize that this is not viewed by you as a breach of morals what has been true for the white gander obviously must be avoided by the black gander but doesnt it strike you as unfair that black geese in the past were forced to bear mixed geese it would be interesting to know what your daughter would think if she realized that a few of the black boys toward whom she now throws flirtatious glances are actually her blood brothers here is where i join you in fearing her marrying one such a marriage would be incestuous wouldnt you agree now i hope this doesnt shake you but what is needed today is an effort to remove the restrictive laws barring intermarriage from the statutes let me reassure you the reason is not what you are presently thinking it is not so much that we desire access to your daughter as much as we insist on access to dignity we refuse to believe that we are an inferior people in spite of your daughter you see we must do away with the statutes for the honor of our own daughters as it stands now my daughter has no recourse to law to protect her from your exploitation in fact she must bear your illegitimate child while i cannot even use my shotgun to give my grandson a name your daughter is surrounded by protective instruments ranging from fines shotguns imprisonment under law and lord help us lynching outside of the law now i must be fair the birth of illegitimate children as a result of mixed alliances has decreased radically in the past decade several factors brought this about in the antebellum days where slavemasters had unrestricted access to their slaves such children were numerous after emancipation the negro was cemented in a caste system by laws and codes of en forced segregation currently the negros increasing interest in his own racial pride discourages promiscuity between races to these factors can be added an almost universal knowledge of the use of contraceptives in his book the american dilemma gunnar myrdal made an acute observation in the negros drive for civil_rights much of the opposition derived from the white mans reluctance to allow his daughter to view the entire prospective in fact myrdal ranked the white mans arguments for segregation in the following order intermarriage social intercourse such as dancing and bathing etc segregated facilities schools churches political disenfranchisement equal job opportunities and housing the negros rank order in his argument for civil_rights is exactly inverse to that of the white mans in reading the racists fears in reverse order then his daughter is found at the bottom of the list now please we are not suggesting that we are disrespectful of your kin we only regret that she is not as important to us as she is to you indeed were sorry but miss anne does not fall into the category of our present needs even if she did since so many of us are unemployed we could not support her in the manner to which she has been accustomed when civil_rights issues are raised in congress senators from the south rise up to filibuster whatever other argument they might present they are actually rising in defense of your daughter it would do well for them to remember that the negros interest does not incline toward your progeny perhaps a letter from you to them reminding them of this fact might shorten their debate whereas more time may be given to such matters as cutting your taxes now i must admit many of us have misled you negro leaders have been continually asked what their viewpoints are on intermarriage most of their answers have been vague neither condoning nor condemning forget it you see most of their thinking is in the area of organizing demonstrations marches on washington sitins picketing etc they have no time to be thinking of the future welfare of your daughter so they havent given it much thought to give serious thought to your daughters nuptial potentials would drain them of the intellectual stamina so sorely needed by the negro masses some of them will even agree with you and say such marriages are unwise even so dont be misled such an answer does not mean they are admitting to negro inferiority what they are saying in essence is that they recognize the infantile emotions you display on the subject you may rest assured that these answers are given as contributions to your own mental health finally if your daughter can break through the maze of your maniacal fears and the negros disinterest if she can bridge the gaps outlined in this discourse more power to her if she dares to cast her lot with her sisters in the per cent and if she risks bearing children to the trash heaps of denial as promised by your prejudice feel proud indeed give her your blessing few fathers can boast of daughters with such rare intestinal fortitude about your childs iq what you should know testing has been one of the boons to modern education that has aided the teacher in aiding the child but like many a blessing when handled improperly can become a curse in the hands of the unskilled or uninformed the information regarding a childs ability or lack of ability can become damaging rather than helpful exactly what is an iq or intelligence quotient technically it is the ratio between the chronological and mental age if a child has a mental age of eight years months and a chronological age of years months his iq is a figure derived from dividing the first figure by the second this child is considered slightly above average if the reverse were true that is if his mental age is while his chronological age is the resultant quotient is and he is considered slow a score of is average from is very bright above that is considered genius however the parent must keep in mind that these are approximations and guides to potentiality rather than hardandfast guarantees when a fond parent presents herself at a guidance office and demands to know her childs iq she is elated when she is told that he has a rating she automatically envisions honors piled upon her offsprings head not listening as the advisor tells her that the testing indicates a high potential which the child will have to work to fulfill it may also mean the child works faster or can absorb faster than others but without the proper study attitudes and habits her child may be like the hare in the aesops fable surprisingly surpassed by some plodding tortoise unwittingly she may pass on attitudes to the child that cause him to sit back and wait for good things to come to him or she may cause him to develop a superiority complex that makes him a burden rather than an addition to a classroom intellectual snobs have not been an unknown quantity even in second grade there are some rare youngsters who can take this kind of information for what its worth as one remarked now that i have my genius license where do i go from here conversely the parent whose child is average may be very disappointed as though normalcy was something rather disgraceful the average child may produce far more than average results so much depending upon personality and drive it is a combination of factors that makes the individual what he is as a contributor to our society and we must not fall into the trap of categorizing a youngster through a series of tests feeling that we can mathematically predict his future so far testing measures mainly literate skills and except for a few new tests on the market does not even attempt to measure creative ability a child may write beautiful prose that is badly misspelled and devoid of commas and will score far below the child who knows mechanics yet any publisher can tell you that proofreaders are not a rare commodity while good writers are oftentimes the youngster who does well on the older standard tests can absorb facts and reevaluate them this does not mean he can tear apart accepted reasoning and create anything new thomas edison probably would have scored low on standard testing he was a pragmatist who had little use for accepted theory performing feats that bookbright and literate scientists assured him were theoretically impossible he often remarked that when he needed certain types of brains he bought them by the dozen it was because of this that he appreciated charles steinmetz who had a unique combination of creative and absorbed brilliance einstein too achieved eminence because he brought new ideas to mathematics and physics ripping away theory that had existed since newton it was the freshness of his conceptual vision that opened the fantastic new worlds of nuclear science with his lack of interest and absentmindedness we can only speculate on the testing results he would have achieved the english teacher often smiles wryly as she admits to herself that jack london never attended high school that oneill flunked playwriting at harvard that jack kerouac writes runon sentences fracturing almost every standard grammatical rule it is true that we live in a world where a high scholastic rating insures a college degree which is an almost automatic entree into the upper economic echelonsbut we will find men and women at the top who did not get there by the high iq highway school administrators do not want to pass on statistical information rashly because they are so aware of the danger of tagging a child as average slow or superior in many schools even teachers can not have such information unless a child has become a problem because even among teachers there can be the one who says oh johnny only has a iq he couldnt get a in english id better lower the mark johnny may have a iq but he may have overaverage language ability perhaps there is a nonlanguage factor in his skills that lowered his general average peter on the other hand may have a iq and not do as well in english as johnny because conversely the nonlanguage factors raised his average or perhaps even though both language and nonlanguage abilities are high peter is not an avid student and only does well what he can do easily one figure that betokens iq can not tell the whole story because of the complexity of the human element the results of any one test can only give one facet of the complete picture and the results of any one test appraised alone can not be taken as conclusive it may only be taken as one indication of the direction in which the evaluation is going the most important factors in an achievement test improperly called an iq test are the separate scores of the childin language and nonlanguage areas and in separate subject fields it is most important for the parent to become cognizant of the childs positive abilities and conversely to become aware of his weaknesses so that aid may be offered through further diagnostic and remedial testing rare indeed is the child who needs no help or guidance the very bright sometimes lack humility or are socially immature the average child sometimes needs a buildup of his confidence and a retraining in basic skills a slow child may need most of all patience and understanding and appreciation for the good qualities he has above all the parent must keep in mind that testing is a guide and an aid not an end in itself that will provide a child with an automatic passport to intellectual greatness the negroes greatest gift to american society there used to be a number of pamphlets and documentary films expounding on the theme americaa great melting pot for foreign peoples inevitably there would be a section devoted to the contributions of the various minority groups that emigrated here the germans would be cited for their brewing talents the jews for their scientists and financiers the italians for their operas the irish for their politicians and the negroes for their contributions to labor and to music these groups were always shown as living together in peace and productivity making america great strong and democratic as i looked at america from a more mature viewpoint it became patently clear to me that the united states was not a great melting pot i was particularly impressed with this fact after spending some time in new york new york had always been used as an example of this concept with its teeming millions of many national origins it was in new york that i discovered what was in fact a composite of many different pots of nationality groupings the vision of german and jew living side by side with negro and italian neighbors was for the most part just not true each of these ethnic entities had its own area its own little pot which was not too receptive to members of another immigrant group trespassing on the area they regarded as their own just as my thinking on the melting pot concept had to change as the facts of life were realistically shown to me so too did my estimation of the nesro contribution to america it is true that the ne it is true that the negro did supply much of the labor on which the early economic wealth of the united states was based cotton might not have become king in such a mighty fashion were it not for the forced efforts of the negro it is true that the negro has provided america with its only original and indigenous art form if we exclude that produced by the savages who were here before the first explorers these however are not the true measure of the contribution of the negro to america upon reading lerone bennetts before the mayflower the reader is indeed impressed with the many other areas in which the negro contributed his role in the revolutionary and civil wars was considerable and perhaps even vital certainly it was pervasive and helped to mould america and americans impressive as the contributions already mentioned may be they fall short of what historians will record as the most significant gift given to america by its black sometimes unwanted often mistreated citizens history shows that a civilization remains strong and vigorous as long as there is an energy a movement within it to keep it from becoming complacent selfsatisfied and selfrighteous this energy from within brings about a reevaluation by the citizens reevaluation brings about action action keeps the society alive alert and viable american society is organized on certain wellknown democratic precepts inscribed in the constitution the bill of rights and the declaration of independence if we allow these concepts to become invalid or weakened we are setting the stage for the dissolution of our society as set forth by these documents we are preparing the prologue for tyranny by a few and an abuse of power and authority by the demogogues who will inevitably follow the desertion of these concepts as a guide for the conduct of american policies it is at this point that the american negro vaults into prominence and is in a position to make his most important contribution to his country it is now up to the negro to see that these principles are kept alive and in force it is his supreme duty to himself and to america to press forward his peaceful democratic struggle for complete and absolute application of these principles recently in talking with a young man from finland i mentioned that i was very impressed with the concern so many overseas visitors displayed over the civil_rights issue he smiled and explained to me that it is true many such visitors are concerned genuinely over the plight of the negro but there are other considerations involved as well in the present international struggle between east and west america is pictured as the bastion of liberty liberality and democracy under the intense pressure of to days political affairs there is only one alternative to democracy and that is dictatorship if the united states fails to uphold the democratic way of life in its full sense then she invites dictatorship not only for herself but for the other nations who look to her for inspiration and guidance for their infant or tottering democracies the finnish visitor further pointed out that in effect this has happened in the united states already in the south where democratic principles have been suspended we already have dictatorial conduct in certain areas the country has been able to survive as a democracy despite this because democratic principles have prevailed elsewhere in varying degrees but if america fails in upholding the law with regard to her black citizens just because they are black then she opens the door for intemperates and bigots to take over if she refuses to honor the law impartially immediately and impassionately america effects a mandate for such people to move from the back door to the parlor this would allow the american society to be irretrievably undermined so that other political concepts would be free to dominate domestic and international policies this axiom has been proven very dramatically in both national and international politics haile selassie came before the league of nations in the s to ask that something be done to halt italianaggression against the law and the sovereignty of ethiopia the league of nations did nothing to correct this blatant breach of international law the emperor of ethiopia predicted at the time that the suspension of the rule of law with regard to his small and seemingly insignificant country would be the prelude toand encouragement offurther such suspensions and that those who chose to do nothing would themselves be affected someday it did not take long for his prophecy to come true five years later the entire world was involved in a war that had its roots in the overrunning of smaller nations by larger nations eventually the great powers found themselves facing a menace they had cowardly helped to create during the last year men have been killed buildings bombed children slaughtered and maimed and none of the responsible people have been effectively prosecuted none of the guilty parties have had to pay anything but token retribution for their crimes is it any wonder that a somewhat crazed fanatic seeing others so far above the law seeing the working of the law suspended in civil right issues should feel free to assassinate the president of the united states after all were not the chief justice of the supreme court and the united states representatives to the united nations spat upon and violated in that same city were not the offenders involved allowed to remain beyond the reach of the law and unpunished regardless of what his own personal motives were for killing the president is it not reasonable to assume that such a warped mind might reason that there was justification in shooting what was to some the symbol of liberal thinking internationalism and civil_rights without having to pay the consequences the chief justice of the supreme court recently said that if the bill of rights were now before the congress it would not pass this is not a very encouraging prospect twenty years ago if someone had made that statement in seriousness he would have been ushered off for psychiatric observation twenty years ago the bill of rights was taken for granted by the lawmakersbut not today why one reason is that the negro civil_rights movement has made all americans stop and think long and deep about the basic democratic tenets of their country further negroes have given these tenets a broader definition and meaning what used to be read as applying to white americans the negro is now insisting be read for all americans negroes are insisting on the literal meaning of the words contained in the countrys most hallowed documents in the course of bringing the civil_rights issue before the tribunals before the nation before the world negroes have dramatically put america on trial before the world they have forced the government of the united states officially to acknowledge their struggle and the principles behind it in addition negroes have forced whites to stand up and be counted with regard to the basic philosophy of democracy they have forced fellow negroes to carry out their democratic duty and obligations in almost every case this has been done with remarkable dignity and restraint this is even more impressive when viewed in the light of the pressures from extremists on both sides who would have it done less peacefully and less lawfully in sounding the cry for equal rights under the law the negro has made americans go deep into themselves regarding their belief in democracy and their feelings about it democracy is being evaluated on a scale and scope unknown before to mankind men everywhere are being called upon in effect to practice a philosophy they have professed to embrace intellectually it is now no longer possible to hide behind the old adage dont do as i do do as i say men everywhere are no longer able to be merely intellectual liberals they must be practical liberals as well and manifest their beliefs in actions the very foundations of american society are being challenged if america successfully meets the challenge then democracy will reach a height of perfection never before known to man it is my conviction that the negro will continue to fight for his cause i also feel that he will meet with continued resistance of the most violent and also of the most subtle varieties but the cause has irrevocably been put into motion a final and permanent solution will have to merge if the negro and america are successful in the civil_rights issue then historians will say that negroes in their struggle made the united states into the greatest practicing democracy of all time if the efforts for equality fail then the constitution the bill of rights and the declaration of independence will merely stand as historic evidence of the gross and tragic hypocrisy either way the negro will have contributed crucially to americas achievement of ultimate greatness to her moral demise general butlers fugitive slave war in may of when brigadier general benjamin f butler of the massachusetts volunteer militia was promoted to the rank of major general u s volunteers and placed in command of the troops at fortress monroe on old point comfort virginia the authorities in washington had not decided what to do about the fugitive slaves who sought refuge with the unions armed forces thus he was left like other army and navy officers in the field or on blockade duty to behave himself as he thought best in this matter at this time the war was emphatically not being waged for the purpose of abolishing slavery and many union officers flatly refused to allow any negroes at all to come within their lines or on board their ships while others permitted southerners who claimed they owned slaves or called themselves agents for slaveholders to search for and seize alleged fugitives some officers even accepted color alone as prima facie evidence of bondage with the result that at least a few free negroes were delivered to claimants under a process more summary than anything provided by the fugitive slave law of a day or two after butler reached fortress monroe he sent about half of the first vermont regiment commanded by colonel john w phelps on a reconnaissance toward the village of hampton virginia near the place where in a dutch brig landed the twenty negars as john rolph of jamestown called them who were the first slaves in the british colonies in north america for some reason the negroes in the vicinity of hampton gained an impression that fugitive slaves were apt to be well received at fortress monroe perhaps the fact that phelps was an oldtime abolitionist accounts for the feeling of the colored populace in the vicinity in any case three negroes decided to test the matter taking advantage of the confusion caused by the vermont troops invasion they escaped and made their way to fortress monroe interrogated separately by butler during the morning of may the three fugitives all told the same story they were slaves owned by colonel c k mallory of the th virginia militia and their master intended to send them to florida where they were to be employed in the construction of some coastal fortifications butler decided to confiscate them because as he put it in his autobiography property of whatever nature used or capable of being used for warlike purposes and especially when being so used may be captured and held either on sea or on shore as property contraband of war early the following day butler was informed that a confederate officer bearing a flag of truce desired an interview with him the confederate believed as he wrote to butler some years later that he carried the first flag of truce used in the civil war when buder and the confederate officer met the latter identified himself as major john b carey of the virginia militia in civilian life the principal of an academy in hampton and remarked that he and the general had last seen each other as fellow delegates to the charleston and baltimore democratic party conventions of at the first of which butler had voted times for the nomination of senator jefferson davis of mississippi as the partys presidential candidate carey first asked and butler sidestepped several questions about the principles upon which the general expected to conduct the war in the neighborhood of hampton then never dreaming of anything but ready acquiescence carey requested the return of mallorys three slaves on being told that they had been seized as contraband of war carey spoke feelingly of the fugitive slave law and of butlers obligations under the federal constitution butler replied that the fugitive slave law enacted by the united states congress could not be invoked by a foreign state which virginia claimed to be and that she must consider it among the infelicities of her position if to some extent he took her at her word mallorys three slaves said that if they were not sent back others would understand that they were among friends and more would come the next day actually two days passed before eight more male negroes reached fortress monroe they were followed hours later by a group of fortyseven persons of both sex and of all ages from three months to years thereafter negroes flocked to the freedom fort in such numbers that butler soon found that at current prices he had worth of slaves on his hands at this point he wrote to his superiors in washington asking for definite instructions by which to guide himself in future having been a lawyer in civilian life he was fully satisfied that he could legally confiscate ablebodied slaves and since they were of great value in the enemys hands it seemed to him to be the part of wisdom to deprive their masters of their services therefore he said that he intended to employ such persons as he could use he already had the men working as laborers or as officers servants the women as laundresses seamstresses etc and to issue proper food for the support of all charging against their services the expense of care and sustenance for the nonlaborers keeping a strict account of the services as well as of the expenditures having the worth of the services and the cost of expenditures determined by a board of survey hereafter to be detailed but he asked as a political question and a question of humanity can receive the services of a father and mother and not take the children after president lincoln and the cabinet had carefully considered butlers letter the secretary of war carefully answered it without really answering any of the questions it contained butler was told that his actions to date were approved he was directed neither to interfere with slavery nor to return fugitive slaves to their alleged masters he was instructed to continue to employ escaped slaves in the services for which they were best suited keeping account of the value of their services and the cost of their maintenance and he was informed that the matter of their final disposition would be reserved for future determination the publication of butlers letter and the secretarys reply led to a widespread discussion of what general winfield scott laughingly called general butlers fugitive slave law and to the immediate adoption of the term contraband as a synonym for an escaped slave most northerners agreed with butler that southerners could not logically argue against his acceptance of their oftenrepeated claim that slaves were property just like any other kind of cattle and approved heartily of his action edward l pierce an abolitionist who found butlers conduct praiseworthy wrote in the atlantic monthly november there is often great virtue in such technical phrases as contraband of war in shaping public opinion they commend practical action to a class of minds which would be repelled by formulas of a broader and nobler import the venerable gentleman who wears gold spectacles and reads a conservative daily prefers confiscation to emancipation he is reluctant to have slaves declared contraband his whole nature rising in indignation when henry ward beecher preaches in a sermon that a thing ought to be done because it is a duty he yields gracefully when butler issues an order commanding it to be done because it is a military necessity butlers technical phrase also commended a course of practical action to a number of men in positions to make their influence felt who were not repelled by broad formulas in august of less than six weeks after the thirtyseventh congress convened in special session its republican members mustered the votes necessary to secure the passage in both houses of a measure which legalized the confiscation of slaves employed in or upon any fort navyyard dock armory ship entrenchment or in any military service whatsoever against the government and lawful authority of the united states a year later during its first regular session the same congress passed another act the sixth section of which provided that within days after a proclamation to be issued by the president the property of all persons in armed rebellion against the united states should be liable to seizure and that any or all slaves of such persons escaping and taking refuge within the lines of the army all slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them and coming under the control of the government of the united states and allslaves of such persons found on or being within any place occupied by the forces of the united states shall be deemed captives of war and shall be forever free of their servitude and not again held as slaves in accordance with this law president lincoln issued a proclamation dated july warning all persons within the contemplation of the law to return to their proper allegiance to the united states on pain of the forfeitures and seizures provided by its sixth section although it has been largely disregarded by historians the truth is that to quote from carlos martyns biography of wendell phillips butler had practically freed thousands of slaves before lincoln even dreamed of emancipation and that congressional action based upon butlers contraband theory freed thousands more before the emancipation proclamation was issued civil war hero one of the boldest deeds of the civil war and one that required a u great deal of nerve and a a good judgment for its e execution was performed by robert smalls a pilot of the confedero ate steamer planter in charleston south carolina harbor in smalls was born in beaufort south carolina the son of robert and lydia smalls and a slave of the mckee family he was kindly treated by his master and allowed to acquire a limited education in smalls moved with his master to charleston and became successively a hotel waiter a hack driver and a rigger in he married his first wife hannah who died in in the confederate authorities pressed him into service and made him a member of the crew of the planter a dispatch and transportation steamer doing service in charleston harbor when fort sumter was attacked he and his family saw with sorrow the lowering of the american flag the high pressure widewheel steamer the planter was a light draught vessel drawing only five feet when heavily laden and was very useful to the confederacy in playing around the harbor and among the islands near charleston her officers were white however the crew was black consisting of the smalls brothers robert and john a gradine an assistant engineer william morrison a sailor and a few others for general work on monday evening may the planter was lying at her wharf her officers were ashore and smalls had been given instructions to see that everything was in readiness for a cruise the following day they were carrying a valuable cargo however smalls had other plans for the cargo smalls did not betray his thoughts by his behavior and when the officers left the vessel he appeared to be his usual respectful attentive efficient and obedient self after eight oclock the wives and children of robert and john smalls came on board as they had sometimes visited the vessel nothing was thought of this circumstance by the wharf guard sometime later a colored man from the steamer etowah joined the crew smalls had been contemplating this move for some time he had heard that colored men were being enlisted in the united states service at beaufort and that general hunter was foreshadowing the freeing of the slaves giving kindly treatment to all contraband refugees he had seen from the pilothouse the blockading vessels and had thought of a plan to turn over the planter with her valuable cargo to the union forces the brave men knew that their fate would be death in event of failure and they decided that they would not be captured alive but go down with the ship if the offshore batteries discovered them they also decided to use the steamers guns to repel pursuit and attack if necessary after midnight the fires were raised and pressure made ready and early in the morning robert smalls gave orders to cast off to guard against a suspicion of anything being amiss he backed slowly from the wharf blew the signal whistles and seemed in no great hurry to get away smalls proceeded down the harbor as if headed toward fort sumter and about four oclock the boat passed the frowning fortress saluting it with loud signals and then the steam pressure was increased her appearance was duly reported but as her plying around the harbor was most commonplace she was not molested and the heavy guns that easily could have sunk her remained silent passing the lower batteries again without danger the happy crew jubilantly rigged a white flag and steered straight toward the union ships they were still in great danger this time from the union guns union forces not knowing of their escape and on the lookout to sink at sight torpedo boats and rebel rams might blow them out of the water before discovering their peaceful flag an eyewitness of the planters arrival a member of the onwards crew and a war correspondent gave a good account of the landing just as no port gun was being elevated someone cried out i see something that looks like a white flag and truly enough there was something flying on the steamer that would have been white by application of soap and water as she neared us we looked in vain for the face of a white man when they discovered that we would not fire on them there was a rush of contrabands out on her deck some dancing some singing whistling jumping and others stood looking toward fort sumter and muttering all sorts of maledictions against it and de heart of the souf generally as the steamer came near and under the stern of the onward one of the colored men stepped forward and taking off his hat shouted good morning sir and further stated ive brought you some of the old united states guns sir that were for fort sumter sir and all the others around him set up a yell and the antics and capers cut could only be done by slaves who by a bold and successful stroke had gained their freedomrunning a steamer out from a large city and passing the battlements of pinckney moultrie and sumter as soon as the steamer came alongside captain nichols of the onward went on board of the planter and was joyously received the boats flag was hauled up amidst rejoicing congress was not unmindful of the daring and valuable services of robert smalls and his men and a special act was passed providing that half of the value of the captured steamer and its cargo be invested in united states bonds and the interest be paid annually to smalls group or their heirs this daring exploit gave robert smalls national fame he was made a pilot in the united states navy and his knowledge of the charleston harbor and its fortifications was of great service to the federal services on december when the commander of the planter deserted his post under confederate fire smalls took command of the steamer and led it again out of danger for this act smalls was promoted to the rank of captain and placed in command of the planter holding this post until september when his craft was put out of commission as for robert smalls when he steered away from the wharf at charleston on that early morning may he started a longer cruise than he ever dreamed for it brought him into prominence as a national character his rise to political importance in south carolina during reconstruction was inevitable he was good natured intelligent fluent and selfpossessed his moderate views and kindness toward the family of his former slave master made him to the whites the least objectionable of the freedmen with political aspirations the fact that he was the pet of their liberators led the freedmen to believe that he was the smartest colored man in south carolina his modesty and lack of education were the only circumstances which prevented him from becoming preeminent among the directors of the state during the reconstruction period as early as may a meeting of negroes and northerners at port royal elected him a delegate to the national union convention he was one of the less prominent delegates to the state constitutional convention of from to he served in the state house of representatives and in the latter year was elected to the state senate where he served through the session of from to except during and robert smalls served in the united states congress his congressional career was not notable his most important speeches were attacks on the election tactics of the south carolina democrats and in support of a bill to provide equal accommodations for the races in interstate conveyances smalls was a conspicuous figure in the republican national conventions of and from to he served in the state militia rising to the rank of majorgeneral in december he was appointed collector of the port of beaufort holding this position until except during grover clevelands second term in he was convicted of accepting a bribe of while state senator and was sentenced to three years in prison but while his case was under appeal he was pardoned by governor william d simpson as part of the policy of amnesty which the state democratic administration deemed wise smalls last notable service was as one of the six members of color of the state constitutional convention of before that body he made a vain but gallant attempt to prevent the practical disfranchisement of negroes the last twenty years of his life were spent quietly at beaufort where he enjoyed the confidence of both races cooperating with white leaders in efforts to advance the material interests of the community he died on february lets picket our pockets not the schools i am a negro mother living in an allnegro r community we have our own mayor schools fire department police department waste collection transportation and businesses there is room for improvement but it is a nice place to live many negroes left here for the march on washington last august the march was called a peaceful demonstration the crowd was tremendousand so was the expense lack of money prevented many from participating it was considered the right thing to do since then riots abound everywhere in some instances murder has occurred our children are fighting rebelling against authority school rooms are empty politicians are using race as a subject to exploit their platforms organizations are picketing other organizations a different type of march is going on among many of our people they are marching for food consider the money that was spent for the march on washington picture just one dollar for each negro in attendance how about a dollar for every negro in america once a month envision schools factories homes and businesses created by negroes to me a boycott of schools prevents education it confuses the young it frightens me my children may be hurt or killed how can people march against injustice and still demonstrate peace forcing a change in laws does not enforce a change in people god gave us a world to live in he left a book of instruction telling us how to live in it peaceful demonstrations begin with ourselves let us picket our pockets and start a riot by providing for our own needs let us not become absorbed into another race instead we can keep our own traditionsteach them to our children with pride we can boycott ignorance there is money for marches for bondsmen for lawyers and leadership the same powerful leadership can serve to guide us toward providing for our own needs let others envy our independence not our militant attitudes what keeps good workers from working it isnt enough for one man to be able and eager to work and for another man to want workers gaps in information communication and transportation some of our police and our charitable practices are right now keeping wouldbe employees from meeting employers in our cities the city of indianapolis is an example since indianapolis is centrally located drawing its income from both industry and agriculture and with jobseekers coming or passing through from all parts of the united states the situation observed during the past year and a half by a group of ministers social workers and retired business people may be of interest to others our observation post was the hall of a small downtown church peoples temple which in the spring of ran out of funds for the free noon meal it had served every day for two years so the congregation appealed to outsiders for financial help as a basis for moneyraising a statistical survey was made with the persons served being asked name age address health how long in town last steady job how far in school and how they had been getting along racially the percentages of negroes and whites were almost the same as in the general populationbut we noted that most of the negroes were staying with relatives or friends and not travelling about nearly so much as the white men one explanation was that negroes encounter more difficulties on the road harassment by police and discrimination at many missions the theory that negroes take care of their own seemed to be borne out by the way residents of quite nice homes let unemployed men stay rent free as well as instances where the clear downandout literally shared their last crust with a buddy however negro employers and negro police seemed to take care of their own by bearing down pretty hard on themaccording to reports from individuals we got to know rather well later in the course of our survey men standing in line proffered advice why dont you let us use the phone free to call former employers this made senseso an extension phone was put in the hall with volunteers sitting by it three hours each day to prevent long distance calls being charged and thus our employment desk was born by letting the men use the phone by advertising for odd jobs and by the volunteers bringing the help wanted ads each day quite a few jobs were foundmostly temporary but at least seemed permanent do you need a helping hand asked a flyer that churches of several denominations distributed to their congregations and carpentry painting wallwashing housecleaning yardwork were listed as types of help these hands that could be reached at the peoples temple had to offer but as phone calls came in and as we analyzed the want ads it became apparent that the hands themselves must have help to get to the available jobs they needed appropriate clothing to work at certain jobs such as a clean shirt for a waiter or baker they needed information which sometimes took several phone calls to acquire as to where to sell blood for quick cash where to get chest xrays for a food handlers permit and where to get medical treatment andor convalescent care in order to become employable if hes interested why doesnt he come apply instead of telephoning office girls sometimes snapped when we inquired about job listings but how come out here without carfare if a man walked five or ten milesand many factories restaurants carwash places where at least that far from downtownhow energetic would he be if he landed the job and if he arrived to find the job takenor that his skin was the wrong shadehow able to answer some other ad would he be walking wears out shoes which none of the missions can ac quire in proportion to the need being out in the rain or snow with no facilities for pressing a suit makes it hard to fulfill the must be neat requisite in many ads and walking when a person is hungry and tired wears down resistance so its easy to catch cold or succumb to other of the many germs encountered in missions or cheap roominghouses and yet many persons who work downtown near the park where tired men sometimes sit often complain those lazy bums ought to be jobhunting and police entertain themselves by urging the men to move oneven arresting quite sober and innocous but shabbily dressed sitters for loitering how does a man hunt jobs when hes broke state employment has a department called spot labor where jobs requiring no outstanding skill are sometimes to be had manpower inc gets calls from employers then sublets men to work manpower collecting the wage and paying the man a percentage according to the men manpower can be counted on to pay the agreed upon priceand it advances carfare and lunch money the men also appreciate the bin where you can leave your bundle when youve no place to stay but many men resent working at a job that pays or more per hour then receiving only or the executive whom i talked with at manpower refused to tell me just what percentage of a mans pay they took so i had to depend on the men themselves for the above figures id rather stand on the curb said a union man who can work only at certain times due to acute asthma on the curb i often get jobs paying as much in two days as manpower will pay in a week many of the men find the curb a good place to get jobsbut the police disapprove of this the curb is a stretch of about two blocks on alabama street just north of the citycounty building and police station where employers and employees have met for at least years but some passersby are said to have complained about so many men in old clothes loafing along there so break it up or ill call the wagon shout certain cops causing jobseekers to scatter out or move to another block then return later and in the fall of a gettough policy was instituted whereby men at one time were thrown into jail for jobhunting at this spot this particular group was released because a minister interceded for them but nobody knows how many others were picked up later peoples temple has a small supply of emergency food to give to distressed families and one such family was brought there by a worker from the court who asked the minister to provide for them while the father is in jail for jobhunting on the corner as a taxpayer i resent having to support men in jail when their sole crime is jobseeking they could be fed and bedded just as well in a missionor for a small sum with friendsand there would not be the stigma of arrest the association with the vicious and the diseased the inability to keep job appointments four times i made appointments for men to work at jobs for which they were well qualified then learned they were arrested the night before for a vague charge of disorderly or loitering or drunkenness he must have done something pretty bad to get five days plus a fine i said to the judge pro tern whom i went to in behalf of one of these workmen oh no said the judge hed have had a bigger sentence than that if hed fought or created a disturbance i dont have the record here but he probably fell down on the street or didnt move along as fast as the officer wanted later i appealed to another judge for clemency for another man who had lost two days work by being in jail but who could start earning that afternoon if the judge would release him but look at that long record this judge exclaimed and he sentenced the man to days plus fine not because what he had done was so bad he fell down on the street and the cop said he was drunk but five witnesses told me he didnt do a thing and i being called to the scene smelled no liquor on him the sentence was on his past record thats good criminology maintained the regular judge of this court a judge pro tern made the sentence i have studied criminology myself at the university of wisconsin i have worked in a psychiatric clinic and even in a state prison as counsellorthis isnt what i was taught but lest my teachings be out of date i checked with a psychiatrist and with the head of the butler university sociology department but most lawyers get almost no psychology or criminology in their training a lawyer friend told me they dont understand human nature so again i as a taxpayer had to support this man while he served his sentence and laid out his fine then i and a psychiatric social worker and two ministers had to spend days trying to help the man recover from the injustice the discouragement the loss of many of his clothes and of course this makes just one more entry on his record which another judge may hold against him if he is picked up for jobhunting on the corner also while serving his undeserved term at the penal farm he lost the clientele of satisfied employers that his excellent windowwashing floorwaxing and housecleaning had gradually built up women in need of help hired other men who were available if a worker is good why unemployed in our survey and during our subsequent experiments with jobfinding three reasons stood out some men had newly arrived in town had no references and no leads as to where to hunt jobs they had come because of layoffs in the mines and mills of the east coast or the factories of detroit or because new methods or too many members in the farmers family reduced need for them on the farm some had held what sounded like fairly good jobsbut the plant moved away or they put in new machinery and laid off men back in the s there were similar layoffs but then there was hope of being called back when worked picked up today new methods and new machinery are making men obsolete vocational counselling and retraining are needed here some had left or been firedthen found their age if over a barrier to getting a new job others had suffered illness or accident forcing them to seek a new type of work a painter who had lost half his foot cant stand on laddersbut he has built up such a following of pleased employers through the peoples temple oddjob desk that he now gets his calls direct where he rents a room a roofer had made good money and enjoyed the prestige of this high callingbut on passing he found he could no longer stand heights i referred him to a cleanup and maintenance job where he proved the workin est guy i ever saw according to the employer but frustration loneliness in this stfange town and the physical and financial comedown he had taken bothered him so that he got drunk every payday then was a day late reporting for work an intensive study of this mans needs was neededbut we knew of no clinic where he could be served two men had had surgery which did not interfere with their particular skills of metal working but which did prejudice insurance doctors ive even offered to work free awhile just to prove i can work better and work cheaper than anybody else but they wont try me said the onelegged man so when last heard from he was on relief what to do from our brief and amateurish experience we see a need for information facilities information as to where certain types of labor are neededeven when apples beans tomatoes will be ready to be picked the state employment office suggests that sometimes the man with the skill and the man with the job register at different employment agencies it would be more efficient if all cleared at a central place information as to what equipment or training a man must have should be available so a man need not waste a long tripand there should be facilities for supplying carfare small loans for lunch suitable clothing even though this will result in some losses because not all unemployed are saintsthere is need for better communication a free phone for answering want ads or calling past employers proved practical but a messagereceiving service should be set up the only service we discovered is that offered by a negro bartender mr ben ross of the panama tavern in indianapolis hotels and restaurants call him when they need extra waiters he locates men he knows and if necessary advances carfare or money to get a shirt washed it reflects oddly on americas puritan past though that only a tavern should offer such service in fact many men said the only places a tired man can rest or warm himself is a tavernthen he is apt to get arrested if he accepts an offered drink communication should include help in dialing and in talking with potential employers we found many men who asked us to dial for them but when we did this then passed them the receiver they failed to get necessary data about where to apply when whom to ask for and what bus to take also many unsold themselves i am glad to say two community centers flanner house and fletcher place now plan job clinics where the technics of effective applying for jobs how to take aptitude tests and merit examinations will be discussed we need an uptodate philosophy about unemployment the nowork noeat ruling of john smith shouldnt apply when there is no work to be had all the missions in indianapolis practice a threenights a month or even a threenights in days limit to the time a man can remain free this is partly to give newcomers a chance since there arent enough beds available to meet the need but it is partly a holdover from the idea that men need a shove to go out and find work but as professor alan keithlucas of the university of north carolina says in his book the church and social work a man cannot be vigorous if we underfeed him nor secure in his independence if we keep him insecure constant moving not only keeps men upset and nervous they lose clothes and job opportunities from having no place to get calls the saddest part of the unemployment picture though is the loneliness the feeling of being outside looking innot really part of the human race on learning that one unemployed mans family had a food grant of for four persons for a week i called the municipal dog pound to see how this compared with their perdogperday food budget it was less but you see explained the pound superintendent if we let these dogs get all rundown and starved looking their owners would raise a fuss the biggest need of the unemployed in most of our cities is for somebody to raise a fuss in their behalf the black troika the triad of negro organizations prominent in our racial struggle might be likened to an unbalanced troika bearing the hopes the aspirations and the destiny of the entire race a timeworn troika pulled by three blind horses each unswervingly sure in his own mind of his ability to bear the load and equally as sure of the rate of speed the rhythm of action most suitable for the long run ahead discord holds the guiding reins this is not to say that the horses have not each performed his duty on the contrary and despite their unrhythmic gallop each has labored gallantly in pursuit of the general goal but as should have been foreseen the path has narrowed now and a trio of units is no longer feasible having very efficiently covered the wide path of civil and social rights and equal opportunity in the economy it is time now that the cumbersome troika gave way to a single horseman nor should the horseman be a passivist a moderate or an extremist but a combination of the three he should be passive to the extent of unashamedly admitting our peoples many shortcomings moderate to the extent of exacting the very best from our people and raceminded to the extent of inculcating in even the younger of our people that we are determined to bridge the intellectual and economic gap which separates us and our white countrymen he should in the final analysis be a realist for the ensuing run is down a long and narrow path bordered on either side by distortions of lifes deeper meanings we are of a different race than our countrymen and no demonstrations no protestations no legislations can alter this basic difference until our race recognizes itself as being such and discards the foolish concept that because it is a living breathing indispensable segment of the american scene it must be indelibly identified in every social activity with its white counterpart until then our every undertaking will end in confusion and neurosis will become a way of life though it might very well be a subconscious motivation this issue of an independent or a dependent identity has ever been an obstacle to the negros progress as it is now a cleavage in our aspirations competition is the foundation upon which this nation was built if then the passive demonstrators the militant organizations the inflexible black muslims and the angry young elocutionists have been instrumental in securing the guarantee of equal opportunities in the fields of education and employment let us bend ourselves to the task of preparing our people so that they might compete against whites with some hope of success it would appear that the gist of every utterance every outward action every printed phrase accredited to our articulate leaders deals with the white mans indebtedness to the negro better would it be if we were to cease heaping anguish upon our race by lamenting over what the white man owes us and lessen the races present frustrations by preparing our people to liquidate the debt we owe ourselves indeed the white man does owe the negro something but what does he owe him the privilege of sleeping in a whiteowned hotel and enjoying its cafeteria facilities and bath the freedom to isolate himself from his own race by purchasing a home in an allwhite neighborhood the consolation of interracial intimacies without fear of reprisals what meagre compensations and what does the negro possess after he has collected these overdue debts yes we passivists may cry that the white man owes us something we moderates may negotiate for insignificant concessions and we black muslims may worship at the shrine of a divided nation but the greatest debtthe ability to perceive and the soul to admit that our final hopes lies in a competitive coexistence with the white racewe owe to ourselves we recoil from preparing ourselves for the job ahead saying the preparation itself is a tremendous job good let our dedication be supertremendous and how do we go about performing this feat by uniting ourselves and our efforts toward one general end a life of competitive interdependence with the white race by daring by looking beyond the day the next week month and year we must sow now a harvest we should not expect to reap before the next decade though the right to do so certainly should be ours it is not necessary that we squander our earnings on the white races gaudy enticements nor is it necessary that we pretend an intimacy of association which doesnt exist we must not attempt to evade the very real fact that the negro american and the white american if engaged in fair and earnest competition would change the face of this nations social structure faster and with less mental anguish than could any number of demonstrations legislation or protestations as little as it is generally realized the majority of negroes are spoiling for a fight admittedly the odds have been and are still against them but with expectations of more opportunities and greater heights being made accessible to them they need only a strong hand on the reins to direct their progress do we have in our race such a man the future social progress of our race demands one americas first negro poet the names of many re nowned poets are wovj en into the past of this great country such names as longfellow emerson whittier riley and dickinson are easily brought to mind the work of these writers retains a certain popularity today and they continue to be widely read that these writers were preceded by others is logical thinking yet very few readers are aware that one of americas first published poets was a negro our nations cultural foundation was aided and enhanced through the efforts of this remarkable man and it is well that out of the archives of the past new light has fallen on his identity for many years controversy raged on this subject as the distinction was thought to belong to phillis wheatley a young negro slave of boston massachusetts historians in recent years have acknowledged another aspirant to the title namely jupiter hammon research has proven that mr hammon wrote and published several prose articles and had at least one poem published before phillis wheatley arrived in america thus his status as americas first negro poet is duly established what do we know of the early history of this illustrious man unfortunately our knowledge is extremely limited yet there are some basic facts which have been preserved for us evidence gives as the year of jupiter hammons birth though nothing is known of his birthplace it may have been africa the west indies or remote possibility america history tells us that he and his mother were purchased as slaves by henry lloyd a wealthy settler of lloyds neck long island a community now more familiarly known as oyster bay obviously jupiter hammon was a young child at the time of this transaction after the death of henry lloyd jupiter was inherited by mr lloyds son joseph later he came into the possession of john lloyd jr joseph lloyds grandson where he remained to the end of his days early mention is made of jupiter hammon in the records of henry lloyd mr lloyd wrote to a physician asking required treatment of one slave jupiter by name about ten years of age who apparently had developed a rheumatic disorder from this and the written word of hammon himself we learn that he was most kindly treated and accorded unusual privileges by his successive masters there can be little doubt the noble character of this family had considerable influence on jupiter hammon as he grew to manhood even in youth he appeared to have great authority over his people and they often called on him for advice it is also apparent that mr hammons talent was recognized at an early age considered a valuable and trustworthy servant the lloyd family took a deep interest in fostering his literary efforts their encouragement was rewarded when his first commendable verse an evening thought was published in the original copy of this verse is in the collection of the new york historical society this poem conforming with all of mr hammons work is of a highly religious nature following the british armies occupation of long island jupiter hammon together with the lloyd family was forced to flee across long island sound where they took refuge in hartford connecticut however the majestic spirit of this man remained undaunted by circumstances in hartford he was warmly received by his own people and many of the white race early in hudson goodwin publishers of hartford brought out mr hammons work of poetry and prose a winter piece which was followed by an essay on the ten virgins the original of this manuscript is in the possession of the connecticut historical society shortly after this publication jupiter returned to long island with the lloyd family where he continued to write and give counsel historians readily concede that jupiter hammon was a guiding force as a preacher and leader among his people he was highly esteemed and his exhortations bore fruit as evidenced by the reception given his prose work an address to the negroes which reached three editions the influence of this treatise traveled far beyond its initial environment as daniel humphreys of philadelphia issued the third edition in presumably after the death of mr hammon filled with religious zeal strong in the faith of the lord spiritual convictions poured from his eager pen no attempt was made to alter the directness in approach or content of his work however some minor errors in spelling stood in need of correction by his publishers it is with unfeigned regret we learn that much of this work has been lost although little is known of the man in life far less is known of him in death historical records have placed the date somewhere between and during this period it was customary to set aside a corner of the fields owned by the gentry as a burial place for faithful slaves in some obscure location possibly on the grounds still retained by descendants of the lloyd family lies the final resting place of jupiter hammon surely this valiant crusader is justly deserving of the approbation long overdue americas first negro poet goodby baby boy hes like every other lucky black boy they cant wait to be seen she said this ones not really like that no cadillacs for him the hell with it buy me another drink she said

the bartender said then make it four he said damn gabe whatcha trying to do cora said marry them in my mind he said marry them in my mind i nothing ike macklin felt this he felt as if the only thing left for him now was the comfort and rest of death he felt as if he were stepping into another world a black suffocating world that closed in on him as soon as he clambered from the back of that pickup truck that brought him from his job his natural scowl deepened as he turned from the corner and the paved avenue and started the trudge down the sandy rutted street to his home he veered from his path to avoid stepping on a something which lay sprawled in drunken somnolence halfin halfout of an alley its dirty ragged garments its very pores reeking with sweat filth and whiskey he moved down past the waisthigh weeds past rubys the moonshiners past the sounds and smells of people who had hit bottom or had been born on bottom and were now wallowing and rottening in the excrements of their own helplessness and humiliation in spite of the cutting wind he carried a frayed leather jacket loosely in the crook of a heavily muscled arm that did a peculiar jerk every time he swung it in its tight downandup arc by the time he came to the twin sycamores the only trees on the blockwhich masked the front of his frame house the same old humiliation and anger began stirring through his very soul hed had no drinks but he suddenly felt very drunk and mad as he stood in front of the house that seemed to lean to one side the soft gray sand cuddled around his thick heavy brogans from the one street light at the far end of the block he could see the trash now scattered and copious over the deeply rutted road that was scarcely wider than a path all of the houses seemed to lean on each other for support as if the very strength had gone from them in their old age they all looked alike all alike down to the last sagging porch and tarred roof all hideous headstones in a giant races graveyard he turned to the one that was his and stumbled up onto the warped porch and for this he paid twelve dollars a week he kicked savagely at the rockerless rocking chair sent it crashing across the porch slamming into the bannister which held various cans filled with the dry sand and miraculously growing flowers he swayed momentarily before the door his stocky body bracing itself and stared hard at the graying wood which had already assumed the lost helpless color of everything in the neighborhood he burst into the tworoom house and saw his wife sitting before the open hearth her hands dangling between her legs a cigaret hanging loosely between two fingers the lights were off and the red glare made the brown of her face glow hell whatcha doin setting here in the dark he growled defensively falling into the pattern of every day of his life the arguments senseless unprovoked providing some outlet of emotion for a shamed man she turned stood up a tall thin woman and the sight of her hurt him her breasts had lost their resiliency and now sagged flatly against her ribs her body once firm suppliant the body of a woman was now hard and angular like a mans god this is the same woman i married almost fourteen years ago shes almost dead he thought she stepped to him and dutifully kissed him on his cheek her lips were warm and ike grabbed her and held her tightly against him a sudden shock wave of humiliation shaking him delia macklin melted to the unexpected surge and wiped away the tear she felt against her cheek it was not hers she stared at her husband when he finally jerked away his back to her broad and straight ike ike what is it she reached for him almost touching him but her hand stopped inches from his back and she stood still a thin sweater draped over her shoulders looking at him she didnt press him she knew it wouldnt do any good she didnt ask him again she just waited goddam he cursed savagely flinging his jacket onto the bed that commanded half the space in the room he stood in front of the fire his hands shoved into the pockets of his khaki trousers how old are you dee you know how old i is she snapped then almost as an afterthought she added quietly thirtytwo we been married most foahteen years right she nodded to his back what we got in foahteen years dee what we got he turned to her his face his hands every muscle asking the question why we got artie and this this here she stopped her hand poised in midair ill tell you what we got nothing not a damn thing dee there aint a thing in this house thats ourn not a thing but the boy this houseit aint nothing i worked today like i been working every day for forty dollars a week an i help mr foss build them houses real houses dee with real paint not calsimine paint that smells and

out slowly drawnout sounding like a cry from a tortured spirit im so sicka this im sicka buildin white folks houses an then comin home to this he sagged back until the edge of the bed hit his thighs and he sat down he fumbled for a cigaret his black face twisted with a pain he could not name he took a deep drag and drove the smoke out with a violent ffffftttttt you know how much ruby makes a week baby he asked and saw his wifes body stiffen and her eyes grow cold still standing she said flatly i dont care how much he makes aint no shine coming in this house ike spoke on as if he didnt hear her i seem im pay off the collector last week las friday he paid that man over a thousan dollars just for a weeks supply of shine an he kept over five hundred for hisself five hundred a week dee we cud

and i mean it ike i dont care if we never have a thing we can still have our self respect i cant eat selfrespect barked ike ike looked at her standing rock hard in the gloom of the fire and he sucked deep on his cigaret and snapped it into the pine flame the boy sleep he asked his voice now calm and quiet delia nodded j f but the boy was not asleep in the darkness of the frame house with the sound of the november wind knifing through the branches of the leafless sycamores artie lay just beneath the lip of the window sill his heart now pounding with excitement as he licked his dry lips and listened to the voices in the other room grow quiet almost to a whisper he wrapped the clean ragged nightshirt around him and listened to the sounds that filtered through to him from the house next door mr rubys house he had heard the same sounds much of his years the loud garrulous guffaw of a man who told a halfheard joke and then the amazingly clear soft whimpering sounds of the woman the woman who occupied the room not feet from his across the alley the strange mysterious woman who frightened him with her tobaccostained teeth who was now locked in some contortionist embrace with some man sweating despite the cold grinding in the dark dark now yes but he had seen when that room was not darkened and the shade was not all the way down he had seen the men going through the same actions with the woman in her faded pink underthings sipping the clear harmless looking liquid then going together animallike with blind hungry caresses closed eyes and open mouths and at the age of he knew every muscle of the woman each curve hollow valley all were familiar to him he could close his eyes and see the heavy pendulant breasts and he could see the curling pubic hair on her body somehow in some strange way he did not understand she birthed a strange new excitement in him she seemed to awaken some horrible part of him that frightened him the sudden sharp cry of his mother startled him and he jumped guiltily under the blanket and pulled it over his head he heard his mother plead no ike no but it was not like pleading when they were fighting when his father was blind drunk raging it was a different kind of plea the sound of which was completely new to him he heard them moving around now and he listened carefully through the paperthin walls curled tightly in a ball warming himself he heard his mother repeat the no and then it was quiet and soon it was quiet from next door and though he waited for those sounds again it was as it often was during the middle of the week there was no more sound he tucked his head under the blankets and fell asleep sh artie had waited for friday all week friday was the night that things began to happen when he saw and heard everything immediately after his frugal supper he washed and retired to his room carefully closing the door which couldnt be locked anyway behind him he sat in the darkness next to the open window and listened to the exciting sounds pour across the narrow alleyspace between the two houses he could see in the room now and the woman was seated on the bed her body papersack brown in the harsh light her back to him a housecoat draped over her nakedness the steady driving sounds of a jazz record pushed at him and he could hear the horn talking to him wringing from him an innate pounding a sleeping other life that awoke twisting and rocking to the steady thumping of the steady rhythm he heard it and was not aware he heard it he heard the sounds distantly the sharp crack as of a tree branch snapping in the wind and then a crash of weeds then he saw the man bounding into the alley crouched low hugging the protection of the house and he heard the loud curses and the screams and the man was at his window tossing something big and heavy through the paneless window and running hard down the alley to the planked back fence and he was over it quick shadowlike then came the sharp flat crack of the gunone two three timesand he heard the bullets slap wickedly into the fence and then the other man fat short and white ran past cursing and screaming he drew back from the window the satchel at his feet and he heard the noises of people yelling and screaming in confusion and then his mother ran into the room and kicked the satchel under his bed he stared at her wideeyed but then remembered the dark running form and he knew he had seen that stocky build before he had seen it crouched in that same piston run when they had played football together it was his father then his mother held him held him close as she had not done in many years and her voice was a voice of pain a voice lost a voice he had not heard since that time granny died it was soft almost not a voice at all and it was crooning the old song of despair and suffering and anguish that had no name it was a song they were born singing a song that was sung to them when they died a song they knew all of their lives it had no words it had no special tune but when he heard it he knew it and his mother was singing it to him now as people slowly filled the alley outside and he heard the staccato sentences you see im the cops call the cops who was it lawd lawd that crazy sonofabitch and cold fear hit him for the first time in his life it was worse than hunger even because he had learned how to beat hunger he knew that he could swallow his own spit and cut the knifing pains he could drink water he could go to the city market with the others and steal fruit but this was something new this made him want to scream to cry to run but his mother was there comforting and she rubbed his head and held him phi later trembling both of them stood on the porch and watched the police car next door milling negroes moved back and forth over the sandy ground crushing the futile attempt of a garden in mr rubys front yard he saw the policeman big and fleshy even in the dark talking to the short fat man who had fired the shots in spite of his sweater he trembled he heard the flat drawl you protect you somebodys got nerve enough to steal from a shiner and im supposed to catch him for you harfff i wisht i knew who it was id plumb near shake his hand the officer turned still laughing and climbed into the patrol car with the other officer and the car moved off the fat man cursed climbed into his shiny cadillac and churned the street as he sped off his mother held him close he wanted to ask her something anything but he saw the fear and anxiety on her face and kept quiet then from around the corner he saw the familiar squat blockhard figure of his father walking casually his arm hitching in that familiar swing of his the leather jacket on the crook of his arm he strolled slowly and artie held his breath as his father came abreast of the scattering crowd walked slowly around it waving to mr ruby who waved back his father came up the steps put his arms around his wife and they all moved into the house where is it ike asked as soon as the door was closed i aint touched it its still in the boys room under the bed ike but he was gone then he was back a jackknife in his hand look dee he said looking at her i didnt steal from no black man ruby got his he got his befoah he even turned this over to him this aint nothing but the money them white folks been stealin from them poor bastards next door silverpure sweat glistened from his black brow but he had to lick his lips to moisten them when he kneeled on the floor forced the lock and spilled the paper out on the floor art had never seen so much money in all his life he listened as his father counted laboriously it seemed like a long time then ike whistled leven thousand threehundred dollars lord i didnt know it was going to be this much dee theres leven thousand dollars here he stood up wiping his hands on his trousers moved over to delia and held her by the shoulders we ggo buy that house he said but we aint go buy it now and when we do we aint go git it with no cash for the next month or so we aint even got this money we go sit on it we aint go buy nothin then we go move out out someplace where this boy kin go to a good school learn somethin sides how to shoot dice make somethin outten hisself dee this was for him not us we aint old but hes what we got to live for ike held her and artie looked at them both still not understanding his father had stolen stealing was wrong a sin but his mother didnt say anything she just sat there her face immobile placid but her body rigid and ike moved from her knelt down and shoved the bills back into the case he pushed the satchel under the bedarties bed and reached into his pocket and took out a pile of crumpled bills he extracted a single gave her the rest i got to go over i been havin a drink ever friday for three years and i cant change nothin i think i need this drink too cant change nothin she nodded imperceptively as he pulled on his jacket ike kissed her on the head and stepped out the door when he walked outside delia seemed to sag in the chair to artie she seemed a very old woman old and haggard and beaten not so much by time and work and worry but by something even greater something that lay heavy over the entire house and street like some suffocating cloud he moved to her side and as he moved he saw her long brown fingers working nervously on the crumbled bulge of bills feverishly twisting and the tear that started down her face looked like silver ice sliding down a craggy mountain he watched her on his knees watched her cry silently her mouth open looking into the center of the blazing pine fire and not knowing why he began crying too it was not so much that his mother was crying but because he felt that out of the sin and crime of robbery something strange and new and wonderful was going to happen it was because he knew his father and he knew he meant what he said and in spite of everything the lying the stealing and the fearinghe was proud of his father proud of being his son sitting there in the glow of the fire that cracked every now and then sitting there in the glow of a fire on a winter night next to his fathers wife his mother in three weeks they were moving and delia sat next to the driver of the dray with a tightly tied shoebox in her lap holding it with the same tenacity as a small child holds a coin the old furniture filled the truck and ike stood in the door of the house with artie his thick arm about the boys shoulder looking into the gray bleak emptiness of the frame shack its floors scrubbed white shone from front to back the windowsthe ones still in were gleaming nothingnesses ike hawked deep in his chest and spat violently in the middle of the front room and the thick phlegm lay there quivering seemingly a part of all the filth and humiliation of ikes life and it belonged there ike slammed the door and he and artie climbed into the back of the dray it was always with v shyness half respect f and half naked fear that barney approached women even now as he stood in the dim hallway at the top of the stairs it was only with the grimmest effort that he could keep himself from squirming a little under the cruel gaze of r cs niece whose daring eyes seemed ready at any moment to laugh rc cleared his throat wanda he said at last tentatively as though baying a small but dangerous animal or should i say miss oneal convinced this was clever rc glanced sideways at his young companion and vinked miss oneal he continued more confidently im certainly surprised to find you at home at such an hour still she said nothing merely continued to stare in a vaguely mocking way from behind the halfopened door can can we come in rc requested the confidence beginning to break he too was usually struck dumb in the presence of his niece though he hated to show it he was a big graying awkward man who seemed ill at ease in even the most informal situation now he stood clumsily in the doorway his arms hanging down silly she exclaimed in a sudden shrill voice why didnt you say so of course you can come in she stepped aside finally to allow them passage rc ventured forth and grabbing nervously at barneys shoulder led him into the untidy little room it was airless and close scattered about the tiny floor were at least a dozen phonograph records articles of clothing hung immodestly from the bedposts and along the windowsill the spotty walls were cluttered with photographs of male movie stars clipped from magazines the young girl clad in a blouse and a pair of shorts closed the door behind them and returned to the bed where she lay on her back gazing with just the faintest amusement at the two men there was an uncomfortable pause wanda her uncle said uneasily wanda this is our new boarder his name is barnes that is mr barnes mr barnes he said turning to barney this is my niece wanda r c made a vague gesture with his hands then repaired to a far corner of the room where he sat down well how do you do mr barnes his niece said with rather exaggerated enthusiasm and without leaving the bed she extended her hand awkwardly barney leaned forward and felt the warm moisture of her small fingers it was as close to her as he had been all day he had yearned to meet her ever since that morning when their eyes had met briefly on the stairway she clung to his hand longer it seemed than necessary then released it adding im glad somebody finally took that dreadful room theyve been trying for monthsto peddle it off i mean oh dont get me wrong theres nothing wrong with it exactly but youre the first person to she laughed suddenly shifting her body sensually on the bed she tried to control the gushing sound but succeeded only in making halfstifled little sniggles through her nose after a long vhile she regained her breath dont mind me she managed to add im silly r c from his seat in the corner slapped loudly against his knee shes a mess that girl he said i swear i cant keep up with her no more maybe you try too hard she said quickly maybe he stammered i dont try hard enough maybe you cant she replied tiredly not looking at her uncle r c sat silent ignoring the insult he clasped his big hands together and looked about the room for something else to talk about finding nothing he nervously left his seat and ambled clumsily across the room at the door he turned and said well folks i got things to do you two get acquainted he smiled suddenly and added but dont get caught he winked at them and turned suddenly and left the room an awkward hulk of a man stumbling noisily to another part of the house wanda grinned mischievously at her guest hes a card she said there was another pause but what about you mr er whatsyourname she almost mimicked the words as if to assure him she really disdained such perfunctory utterances how long you gonna be around i dunno said barney speaking for the first time as long as they can put up with me your family he grinned nervously as though having said something amusing he wished she wouldnt stare so dont worry about that we get some real nuts around here drunkards all kinds you seem kinda nice though without any transition she leaped abruptly from the bed and with a quick little movement snatched up a record from the pile on the floor you dance mr er you can call me barney okay you dance barney not very well he replied what are you a preacher or something no what are you then barney hesitated fighting for courage well nothing exactly but i want to be a writer really she exclaimed genuinely surprised what do you want to write about the music had begun to play she had set the volume much too high and the little room nearly shook with the twang of an electric guitar and something that sounded like a females voice or a childs uttering something about love lots of things he said feeling very foolish like impressions i get sometimes and feelings its hard to describe sort of like she was no longer listening say she exclaimed in a brand new voice you didnt even tell me what your first name was its herman thats cute mines wanda wanda oneal i guess my uncle told you who knows maybe well get along all right but dont pay any attention to him hes silly realizing he did not in fact intend to dance she returned and sat on the edge of the bed and began snapping her fingers to the music her bare legs also moved slightly in rhythm you look awful young to be living alone she said dont you have any folks im twentytwo he said quickly my folks live very far from here how long you been in washington couple of days got a job yet this is a hell of a place to get a job sissie never found one thats a friend of mine or used to be anyway she finally went back home she paused a moment and seemed to reflect i met her at school she continued you didnt take me for the college type did you well im not i put it down after a semester she seemed to study his face carefully then reached inside her blouse and brought out a wrinkled pack of cigarets lighting one it seemed to barney with a kind of studied poise it was a drag she continued to me anyway for others its all right i guess what about you yeah i went for a while its okay i suppose barney reflected a moment plenty of girls he added smiling silly she shrieked youre silly what what did you say you wrote about well never mind i can guess girls barney squirmed again trying to reply and she laughed again as suddenly as before for heavens sake relax and say something most boys i know say too much but you youre kind of different her eyes were staring again barney lowered his head observing his feet he clasped his hands together then unclasped them he bit furiously at his lip and scratched his nose but still she stared anyway she said at length as if deciding something maybe well get along all right that is if you like music she gestured with her hand sweeping over the records that were scattered across the floor and stacked along the wall all these are mine even more because some are downstairs wait ill get them barney squirmed uncomfortably oh dont bother he said rising from his chair relax she shouted and giggled once more just relax mr herman barnes ill only be a minute and tonight if you want to well go out you can meet some of the kids i know just as suddenly she bounded from the bed and disappeared through the halfopened door seconds later barney heard the quick dribble of her footsteps on the stairway left alone his mind began to wander he wondered what they were like her friends what did they talk about what did they do that had made her the way she was she wasnt much to look at unless you took away the lipstick and powder and the arched eyebrows that gave her narrow face an unpleasantly quizzical expression if you took away all that she was rather attractive like someone he had imagined once but couldnt remember when or where and how really appealing she was how appealing in spite of the powder and rouge yes appealing indeed and more than once he had felt the urge to take her by the shoulder and brush the falseness away tenderly brush away the falseness and look upon her as she really was but how foolish he must seem how utterly ridiculous and beside the point and how absurdly he had answered when asked about his work it was like a desecration of writing itself like an apology he could perhaps have said more he could have tried to describe to her that private world inside him he could have attempted to put into words for instance the memories of his midwestthat flat open midwest where wheat fields stretched like a yellow ocean on each side of an asphalt highway he could have told her of steel mills that rose dark and sooty amid flaming cities and elevated roadways stretching over chicago where every morning and every night great trucks thundered out of the endless plains and into the skylines of flaming cities but how tiresome it was at other times how hopelessly personal and beside the point not exactly the most amusing conversation piece especially in the company of such a glittering young lady so wanda was her name wanda oneal how old could she be twenty perhaps not perhaps not even twenty she had asked if he were a preacher was he that way did he seem so to her nobody had ever said that before maybe he was sort of stuffy by her standards anyway barney lit a cigaret and began puffing reflectively his mind drifted across the hallway where his clothes and manuscripts were stuffed haphazardly in the two suitcases all those manuscripts all those hundreds of thousands of words often lately he had regarded them with something like shame did they really say very much the lofty concerns that were a part of his mind seemed rather ridiculous lately and he could not help but wonder how they would fare before the eyes of wanda preacher indeed maybe she would understand though maybe he could communicate them to her they had seemed so terribly important then when their fever first seized him and thus it was mainly that he left home as with his hero thomas wolfe it was a kind of quest a wonderfully intense and gallant quest only now he wasnt sure anymore just what the quest was of and the very idea of a quest seemed somehow provincial somehow square anyway he was having a rollicking time on the road and when the money ran out hed simply have to find himself a job but what about wanda what was she all about behind that raucous fagade what did she read think feel what did she really look for in a man maybe they could sit together in some quiet place maybe then she would reveal herself and speak to him with these thoughts barney let himself sink into the soft armchair and felt the happiness well in his chest and thought to himself with a certain regret how long it had been since hed felt so excited about life wake up she shouted at the doorway catching him by surprise she proceeded to the center of the room where she dumped the huge pile of dusty records on the floor most of these are fortyfives she said all my seventyeights got broken here choose what you like but hurry up because its getting late all the good places close at midnight barney gzed languidly from his chair behind her through the window the little park halfshrouded in the dusk seemed to actually beckon on each side of the broken walkway the grass grew high and weedy in places sprouting up between cracks in the pavement it was a rare place he had been thinking old and tragic with overhanging trees and deep shadows the scene in its dusky brooding sadness caused a sudden lump to form in barneys throat and for a moment he was tempted to reach out and touch her hand instead he merely cleared his throat and said lets just sit here for a while if you dont mind she seemed to study the top of his head just sit she exclaimed incredulously i only sit when im in the bathroom and once more the piercing laughter bounced off the walls youre crazy he said youre cute she said kind of different though she giggled suddenly what did you say you wrote about nothing i mean skip it lets talk about you me she almost shouted the incredulity returned to her eyes now youve really lost your senses theres nothing about me to talk about i dont believe that barney answered gazing a bit too intensely into her faintly laughing eyes i cant believe it youre just pretending i know you are and you youre just silly she answered you talk so silly she seemed to relax settling her small body more comfortably against the wall and half turning her head to stare at him with such an intensity that barney felt the insides of his stomach turn over and over and the cold sweat trickle from his armpits and run icily down his naked skin who knows she said musingly maybe youre gonna be fun after all a little anyway whatll you be doing till you find a job barney fought for courage the irrelevance of her conversation her bold eyes were succeeding despite his rapture in making him unbearably nervous and unsure look for one i guess he stammered she laughed shrilly dont be crazy i mean when youre not doing that i dunno he answered why we could go around together you and i andyou knowbe friends kind of you could even come in and listen to records if you wanted to if im not here just open the door and walk in barney sighed thankfully won dering if now she would talk what kind of music do you like he asked she reflected seriously oh any kind fast kind mostly the kind i suppose that sends me the farthest how about you all kinds said barney cursing the words silly she shrieked and laughed again a kind of sudden impetuous mindless giggle that stopped as suddenly as it had begun be serious now she continued regaining her breath you couldnt possibly like all kinds you either like jazz or rockandroll or classics or something well jazz he replied letting his eyes scan the shadowy treetops outdoors ghostlike in the darkness and thinking how absurd the very notion of syncopation in such a setting in the midst of such noble sadness and how equally ridiculous the sound of cellos in still a second scene a second hour and how odd it was that the world was so many strange and beautiful things all at once at least youre honest she went on in the shrill inflectionless voice i had a girl friend once who took in the classics you know played them all the time or so youd think like youd be talking to her on the phone and there would be beethoven or one of those clowns in the background very highbrow i wouldnt be a bit surprised if she didnt put him on purposely whenever she called you up the snob barney tried to laugh but his sadness was too great and after a short pause he awkwardly groped inside his shirt pocket for another cigaret he inhaled deeply letting the smoke pour from his nostrils in jerky little spurts im different she continued lowering her eyes im honest about what like i listen to all kinds like what for instance asked barney controlling his voice well like the platters and fats domino you know good strong negro music even little richard i play him when im feeling wild hes crazy youre crazy answered barney it was the second time he had said so how he cursed himself how he yearned to talk to her but seriously he ventured why do you call beethovens music highbrow because it is she replied irritably anyway how should i know all thats over my head barney studied her sadly her proud mocking eyes slender neck how he wanted to stroke that neck gently instead he continued awkwardly do you read much oh a little for instance there was an uncomfortable pause while she fingered nervously at her bracelet for instance why do you ask so many silly questions she said finally vexedly barney lowered his eyes youre a funny sort she continued i bet you read a lot still he averted his gaze feeling vaguely ashamed and not knowing quite why he continued looking at his feet and the pattern they made spread vlike on the floor his arms long and awkward hung comically between his legs no not so much he replied anyway not nearly as much as i used to i bet you do she pursued tauntingly then laughing suddenly added i bet you read shakespeare barney blushed no i dont then why do you talk like that like what the way you do she replied reproachfully she sat cruelly studying him her eyes shrewd and calculating squirming under the gaze barney swallowed back what would have been a kind of scream and let his mind flee it was often that he did so in a kind of urgent escape from the menacing present into the realm of theory or that other more private world he was fond of visiting there they were the two of them side by side in the little park and the whisper far away of a fairyhaunted fountain it was a most personal vision one the others could not see following it he had tackled the entire world typewriter in hand like don quixote come back what a quest it was to have been the smell of the spring breeze and the vision of faraway cities and now the quest was ending for there was nothing to be found dumbly almost despairingly he raised his hand and closed it carefully over her small delicate wrist youre crazy she said by way of reply youre the one whos crazy he insisted suddenly emboldened and staring desperately into her eyes you know i believe you really are she removed her hand eyeing him with vague suspicion cant you see it he continued the uselessness of it the crime her gaze relaxed what on earth are you talking about all im asking barney pleaded his voice cracking is that you try just for a moment to be serious i am trying she said irritably but youre so funny barney sat silent tasting the words he threw the cigarette to the floor squashing it with his foot his chin quivered funny how he said in a way that you like she reflected yeah sort of but first ive got to hear you recite poetry then laughing very loudly she grabbed his ear and twisted it vigorously lets go she commanded we may be missing something barney remained motionless where are you taking me he asked dont expect much its sort of a dump then why go he said we could stay here or sit in the park boom boom she replied beginning a slow almost imperceptible wiggle of her hips you know bongos dance floor lets go wait barney protested unable anymore to hide his desperation just a little longer please we havent even had a chance to talk silly she shrieked too much talk talk talk talk lets live then still shaking her hips she began snapping her fingers to the silent beat barney watched with horror as her face underwent an almost complete transfiguration the eyes staring dumbly like hideously empty sockets the teeth clenched as in a kind of epileptic seizure after a long while she looked again at him and the laughter returned to her eyes youre so funny she said why dont you learn to dance i cant said barney why not look at me now she was undulating her shoulders and again the terrifying grimace not so bad huh not so bad barney said at the point of tears but you know id much rather just sit here and watch you thats why i wanted to stay you know so i could go on just watching you silly she cried out again a vague coquetry lighting her eyes and thats what i wanted to talk about barney continued desperately how i could watch you and never get tired cha cha cha she chanted and how wonderful it would be he went on if we could get to know each other you know like really know each other but in a much different sexy she chimed cutting him off the shrill voice seeming to grow louder filled the entire room and barney was about to speak again when her perfume seemed to engulf him and she was kissing him passionately on the mouth satisfied now she said pulling herself away with a deliberate almost comical seductivity barney regained his breath the scent of her perfume hung heavily in the air her breasts seemed to swell and part of her hair had come undone her smell was everywhere a moist thick sensual presence that blotted out the entire room the world had lost its music and there was only her her odor her breathing barney lifted his arms and placed them heavily around her narrow waist pressing his fingers roughly into the moist sticky skin satisfied the word echoed teasingly no he said replying to her question i didnt think you would be she whispered drawing herself coyly away a visit with muhammad it was a rare fall day in chicago it was the kind of saturday mornin one wishes he were on the lakefront watching the weekend skippers ready their slim craft for a day of sailing i decided to walk the nine or ten blocks from the university of chicago quadrangle to the bluetrimmed mansion at woodlawn i did not know any of the students i met along the way old grads like me are always peering hopefully here and there as if they really expected to see someone they used to know some miracle of reincarnation yet even the old professors die off or maybe by progressive moultings they achieve some academic nirvana anyway the new ones who take their places dont look like the ones you used to know but there is consolation in the fact that at least the good grey gothic does not change it is reassuring to know that there underneath the ivy the granite is the same pretentiousness is a word ordinarily associated with mansions if a mansion is not pretentious it may as well be called a house i had walked past the room house on woodlawn before i realized i was even near it somehow it seemed to escape pretentiousness and i had passed it without really seeing it perhaps i was lost in my silent soliloquy on gothic and old grads perhaps it was because there are many mansions on this quiet street their original owners have fled the alwaysthreatening hovering advance guard of the stifled black ghetto had moved in long ago and settled down in decorous serenity north west and south of the great university the ghetto crowds in upon the famous midway where the university coeds sun themselves to sleep while reading aristotle and james joyce i had passed the address i was seeking but even as i did so the awareness of my oversight was signaled into my consciousness it was the blue and white trim on the multigabled old houseso inconsonant with the studied dignity of the neighboring housesthat halted me and sent me retracing my steps to the concrete driveway i had passed without seeing a moment before the number on the gate was it was the residence of elijah muhammad messenger to the mystical nation of islam in the wilderness of north america prophet to a confident empire of militant black muslims who may bow toward mecca in prayer but whose every other genuflection is toward chicago the prophets mansion sits rather near the street and entrance is by way of a portico extending out over the narrow driveway there was no sign of life anywhere about the grounds as i mounted the concrete steps and rang the bell presently the heavy door swung inward and a woman in a white uniform confronted me yes i have an appointment with mr muhammad i gave her my card yes she said ag in the interrogative was spent there was no emotional content in her voice whatever the messenger is expecting you i followed the woman into a small foyer and waited for her to tell muhammad that i had come i had been there before once during my early research on the black muslim movement i had had dinner with the prophet and had spent the entire evening listening to his explication of black islam as he had learned it from farad in the s a year or so later in another marathon session i had filled a small notebook with data on the messengers interpretation of history the respective roles proper to black men and white men in social and political relations and the eschatological promise inherent in the manifest destiny of the black nation he hoped to unite under the starandcrescent i remembered that there had been a comparative quality of cogency to these heterodox arguments that never seemed to come through in the addresses i had heard muhammad deliver in the various muslim temples about the country i awaited the prophets appearance with some apprehension the book i had written on the black muslim movement displeased some of his ministers very greatly and they had not been reticent about their displeasure a delegation of the faithful had called on me in atlanta to discuss the book and at least one irate muslim minister expressed the desire to burn them as fast as they came off the press too i had received some uncomplimentary letters one or two of which were thick enough to require my paying extra postage in order to get at the insults inside that some of the faithful would be unhappy about my treatment of the movement and certain of its leaders was not unexpected since the black muslims like most of the religiously devout themselves offer no pretensions about objectivity it would be naive to expect them to be clamorous in their applause over an objective analysis of their doctrines or activities nor was it altogether surprising that some of the protesting letters came from people who said they were not muslims but who because they do not like white people read the book with myopic impairments as i waited in the little foyer i could sense muhammads approach even though the sound of his footsteps was stillborn in the thick grey carpeting suddenly he was in the rooman electric sort of presenceand i was trying to assess the confusion i felt at what seemed an intuitive response to it welcome professor the muslim leader held out a lean brown hand as if to underscore his greeting i offered my hand in return while searching his face for some clue as to whether the reception was perfunctory there was no clue his eyes were steady and his handshake was firm he did not smile but then i could not remember having ever seen muhammad smile if in fact he does smile on occasion that is not the image by which he is remembered i followed the muslim leader into a large dining room where two young muslims were seated facing each other near one end of the table they arose at the approach of the prophet and remained standing until he had taken his seat at the head of the table i knew them both john x muhammads secretary and james x minister of the chicago mosque while they were standing i greeted each of them in turn secretary john assalaam alaikum minister james assalaam alaikum we shook hands and sat down the muslims had been drinking coffee and at a signal from muhammad the woman who had answered the door appeared and placed a cup of the steaming black brew in front of me it is muhammads custom to teach his ministers in a kind of informal briefing session each saturday morning these are not strategy sessions designed to accomplish some immediate tangible goals although such conferences are frequent the messengers saturday morning lectures are inculcatory their end is the progressive displacement of christian ie the white mans values with with a neofaradian interpretation of black islam as i joined the circle the messenger was addressing himself to the natural heritage of the black man and the superficiality of the white mans sense of moral responsibility it is the white man who disturbs the peace of the world he was saying the teachings of the white christian divide the natural unity of peoples they have put asians against asians africans against africans brothers against brothers all over the world throughout their civilized history this is the secret of their power the congenital blindness of the negro in america is demonstrated in his expectation that the white man will ever give him justice the white man is incapable of justice except to his own kind by nature he is incapable by nature he is a devil in trusting him we close our eyes to knowledge in loving him we ally ourselves with evil the white man is incapable of loving anyone who is not white it is time for us to go for self the white mans rule is ended the future belongs to the black people of the world the future is here if we can wake our people who have been duped by the white mans promises to set them free and make them equal i tried momentarily to bare my reason to this potent hypodermic to see if i could get the lift i have seen transport thousands in the muslim mosques in the black ghettos of america across the damaskcovered tables in an immaculate grey suit and a powderblue bow tie secretary john x was writing i could not see his eyes for he did not look up but i knew that he had missed no word uttered by his master i had been told that john had a college degree and i thought how incongruous seemed his role of amanuensis to the semiliterate messenger of allah john x the black baruch i said to myself and at that very moment as if he too were thinking of another prophet and another scribe years before muhammad was pronouncing doom for all the enemies of black islam jeremiah to proclaimbaruch to write it down elijah muhammad secretary john and now his remarks were addressed to me you intellectual people should pay good attention the white man wants to call you by your slave name now those who refuse to give up the mark of the beast must die with the beast the white devils want to set you against your own people but they will murder you if you forget that you are black give up the white mans name learn to love your own people i shuddered a little i had always thought my own name euphonius suppose i gave myself a private challenge following the black muslim custom of discarding european surnamesbadges of slavery the muslims call themi had to be known as eric x the rest of my life and my son would be eric x and my wife and daughter would become mere cross marks on my income tax returns so many xs could be confusing on the same side of the table with myself minister james sat enraptured he was seated nearest muhammad but his whole body was tense as he strained to capture and memorize every word that fell from the prophets lips occasionally he uttered an ejaculation thats right but the fixed smile never left his face his whole posture was one of unrelieved expectancy i thought about the old old lady with the gruff voice who used to sit on the edge of the front pew and talk back to the preacher in the revival meetings when i was a kid in alabama a long time ago raymond sharrieff came in muhammad paused while we exchanged greetings sharrieff is muhammads soninlaw he is also supreme captain of the fruit of islam foi the secret protective arm of the muslim movement sharrieff sat down next to john directly across the table from me the woman brought more coffee and the messenger resumed his teaching if the average black preacher would study the history of christianity he wouldnt believe in it or teach it to his people the white man will not call you brother there is no brotherhood in his religion the prophet then went on to tell about his experience in the holy city of mecca and in the other islamic lands where he has traveled it is a beautiful and touching thing to get among your own people and see the love that exists the white man cannot love you by nature he cannot love you but you must love each other and protect your own kind the white man will take care of himself the chimes sounded and the woman who had brought the coffee went to answer the door a moment later malcolm_x strode into the room every muslim came to his feet to greet the tall minister from new yorks mosque no muhammad embraced him in muslim fashion kissing him gently on each cheek assalam alaikum wah alaikum salaam assalam alaikum wah alaikum salaameach of the brothers greeted the smiling malcolmbut muhammad would hardly let him go how is the baby the prophet asked referring to malcolms infant daughter who interestingly enough is named attila the hun when did you leave new york there was genuine affection here between these two not unlike the affection between a father and a son who has done well for the family name one could sense that the little drama being acted here was real for the chief actors were for a time completely oblivious of all else who were in the room i had never doubted malcolms absolute loyalty to muhammad but now i made a mental note muhammad has never doubted it either there was a broad grin on his face as he waved malcolm to a seat at the long table it was the first time i had seen muhammad smile the teaching resumed but now two were writing for the ubiquitous malcolm_x would be quoting his master in halfdozen cities within as many days mr muhammad teaches us we cant make a future for twenty million black people by lying around the employment office we have to go for self we forget overnight what the white man did to us mr muhammad was speaking in less than hours a bomb would explode in a negro church in birmingham alabama where the right of black citizens to enjoy the fruits of democracy was still being contested in blood and invective four little negro girls guilty of no crime worse than trying to worship the god the white man taught them to love and believe in would be murdered by monday morning there would be more black muslims and fewer negro christians in america who are its members ace relations in america are relations between ruling elites issues are resolved boundaries are marked off favors are granted and pleas are denied by men of substance and power on both sides of the racial line negroes and whites in america gunnar myrdal observed deal with each other like two foreign countries through the medium of plenipotentiaries what is also true and more to the point is that negroes and whites deal with each other through the medium of competing power structures like two foreign countries like hostile and suspicious strangers negroes and whites negotiate treaties and truces through separate but not quite equal power blocs the white power structure has been endlessly annotated and analyzed but little or no attention has been given to the negro power structure as a group of selfconcious moulders and shapers of racial policy the importance of the negro power structure can hardly be overemphasized it is in fact a parallel government which fills the vacuum that exists between negro citizens and the state plenipotentiaries of this shadow governmentwhich we shall call the black establishmenthave negotiated with the league of nations and addressed formal notes to the united nations during world war ii the naacpthe offensive arm of the establishmentnegotiated with the government of england and addressed formal letters to sir winston churchill in times of crisisand it has always been a time of crisis for the negro black men ask not what their country can do for them but what the black establishment can do for them the black establishment oddly enough is not allblack it is a group of negroes and whites who command the power lines in the negro community the executive secretaries the board chairmen often white the presidents often white and board members of protest and improvement associations the bishops of negro denominations and the pastors of the largest and most influential churches the two are not necessarily synonymous the editors and publishers of major negro newspapers and periodicals the leading educators business and professional men the key members of this group from the standpoint of racial policy are the executive officers and boards of directors of the protest and improvement associations it helps enormously if a new departure in the negro community is sanctioned by these structures of power on the other hand it is difficult though not impossible to carry new ground if the black establishment says no although the power and influence of the establishment ranges over the whole theater of negro life the focal points are concentrated in five cities washington atlanta and nashville are important as centers of ideas programs and recruits new york and chicago on the other hand are control centers the importance of being a new yorker is dramatized by the board of one protest organization eighteen of the twentythree national board members come from new york city and environs what are the prerequisites for membership in the group money helps but many moneyed men are not members and many members are not moneyed men as in the white world control of a major institutiona protest group a major business or a churchis extremely important for our purposes then an establishment member and we are concerned here only with the national establishment is a person who holds a key office president executive vice president secretary treasurer board chairman or board membership in a major educational business defense or improvement association these men and women are the decision makers in the negro community but there are men who decide for the decision makers elites in other words within the elite a member of the inner core of power holds an independent base of power and membership on the governing boards of one or more key national institutions how does one recognize an establishment man by the boards he acquires here is a power profile of channing heggie tobias one of the least known and most powerful negroes in recent history note particularly the signs of establishment grace membership on governing boards channing h tobias social worker educator national decision maker student secretary international commission of ymcas senior secretary for colored work of ymcas of usa director phelpsstokes fund member president trumans civil_rights committee alternate delegate united nations member governing boards board of directors or board of trustees of following organizations and institutions naacp chairman marshall field foundation jessie smith noyes foundation liberia company hampton institute howard university paine college palmer memorial institute national council of churches of christ in usa commercial state bank and trust company of new york the important thing to note in this power profile is what sociologists call the accumulation of advantages an unnecessarily obscure phrase for the admirably simple biblical rule to them that hath more will be given what this means in terms of national negro power is that influence in one sphere can be transferred to influence in another sphere prominent educators and bishops for example often serve on the boards of directors of major business and protest and defense organizations and powerful businessmen in turn often serve on the boards of trustees of educational and philanthropic organizations contrary to the generally accepted opinion power does not inhere in individuals without access to institutionalized power individuals are powerless in both the negro and white community the popular error is to confuse prominence or wealth with power these things as we have shown are convertible into power over racial policy but they are j not in themselves instrumentalities of national power some politicians for example hold local power but are not usually members of the national establishment nor are politicians as politicians adam powell jr excepted fertile in raising and disposing of large issues bearing on national racial policy one makes a great leap into an understanding of the establishment if one perceives why adam clayton powell sr was admitted to the establishment while his son adam with greater fame and greater local power was excluded powell the elder sat for many many years on establishment boards the son has not yet occupied a seat in the inner sanctum relevant here are questions of style and temperament as well as availability powell has over the years complained bitterly of establishment snubs and he has discovered repeatedly that establishment games are played by establishment rules what precisely are establishment rules why for example is a richmond physician and a new york city judge more influential in shaping national racial policy than say congressman william l dawson or congressman adam clayton powell jr the core answer is that the physician and the judge are members of the littleknown inner core of establishment power both are among the ten men and one woman who were on the naacp board in and who were still listed twenty years later in more importantly both men were members of the executive committee of the board in the new york judge though little known nationally has ranged over the whole arena of establishment power he was a founder and incorporator of the naacp legal defense and educational fund and he is a former member of the executive committee of the urban league board through the physician and the judge we come to the heart of the matter continuous service in establishment circles board members in every organization come and go the names that turn up year after year are important they indicate centers of power and influence more importantly they point to the hierarchies within the hierarchy the governing boards of establishment organizations change periodically but the surface changes hide a steel core of continuity there is as professor n p tillman jr pointed out in a study of the naacp an inner core of men who hold board seats for years and then dying hand over the torch to another core in a study of the persons elected to the board through professor tillman focused on the nuclei of active minorities which dominated the board in the two periods and he concluded between and the nucleus appears to have consisted of john milholland d walter sachs joel spingarn arthur spingarn william e walling john h holmes mary ovington oswald villard and w e b du bois all but the first carried over into the second period both as board members and general officers thus providing continuity of personnel and policy in the second period they were joined by others predominantly negro namely louis wright charles toney allan chalmers alfred lewis channing tobias theodore spaulding and perhaps robert weaver meanwhile some of the holdovers died or resigned among whom only du bois was forced out in for the good of the association what emerges from all this is the power of establishment boards and the relative weakness of men whatever their local power or influence who do not participate in the informal giveandtake that precedes decision and the formal voting that ratifies it the only exceptions to this are the individuals who can make their weight felt without formal entree into the board rooms before a white administrator was named to head an establishment agency the appointment was cleared by long distance calls to a handful of men across the country but this exception proves the rule the men who received long distance calls were not asked to vote on the appointment the board had already voted they were asked to close ranks behind an establishment fait accompli we return then to the major premise men remote from the board rooms do not vote and men who do not vote in the small groups where one vote makes a difference do not generally count this is not to say that national boards are the final arbiters of racial policy the ruling boards of the establishment are free to decide policy within certain limits prescribed by other institutions within the family of power in the negro world of vast importance in this connection are negro educational institutions negro educators have always exerted tremendous influence on racial policy the nature of this influence was dramatized by the sitins which led to the expulsion of hundreds of students and the firing of scores of teachers the family of power includes not only negro organizations but white organizations racial policy is subtly shaped and diluted by the expectations priorities and fears of liberal labor religious and minority groups from this white liberal nexus the establishment seeks allies and donations the most talented of these allies have definite ideas about the goals and the direction of negro policy and it is not always possible to accept the donations without accepting the donors program among the leading organizations in this shadow cabinet of the shadow cabinet are the uawcio and other liberal unions the americal civil liberties union the american jewish committee and the american jewish congress the race relations departments under various names of the ywca ymca the national council of churches the roman catholic church and the american friends service committee another layer of hidden power on the fringes of the establishment centers in philanthropic organizations and their representatives the rosenwald foundation the american missionary association of the congregationalist church the rockefeller foundation and the harmon fund have played huge roles in shaping and braking negro policy of crucial importance in the context of current power realities are the taconic foundation and the phelpsstokes fund these organizations and their representatives are part of the formal and informal network of power surrounding the core organizations of the establishment some of these groups send white delegates to the establishment some groom specially selected negroes who represent them in the inner councils of power white delegates to the establishment should not be confused with bona fide members of the estabhhment certain positions in the establishment are apparently reserved for white men the naacp the national urban league and the naacp legal defense fund have never had a negro president or a negro treasurer nor for that matter have many other negro institutions of power final control chairman of the board and financial control treasurer and chairman of the financial and investment committees of negro colleges are generally vested in white hands one eastern investment banker for instance is chairman of the board of one negro college president and treasurer of the board of another and a member of the investment and executive committee of a third although this trustee holds enormous power in the negro world his name seldom if ever appears in a negro newspaper analysis of white power in the black world is complicated by primogenital relationships no negro family for example has exerted greater influence on negro policy than the baldwins the rosenwalds or the spingarns william h baldwin the elder was a close and influential advisor of booker t washington his wife ruth standish baldwin was a founder of the national urban league lester granger said she did more than any other person to shape the basic philosophy of the urban league since that time there has always been a baldwin on the urban league board the spingarns have made a great contribution to negro welfare and they have held power positions commensurate with their contributions dr joel e spingarn an erudite professor of english served as treasurer and chairman of the board of the naacp before assuming the presidency which he held from to his death in he was succeeded as president by his brother arthur and as a board member by his widow amy the spingarns are to the naacp what the baldwins are to the urban league in other words there has always been a spingarn on the naacp board in fact for almost fifty years there have been two spingarns of the naacp board arthur spingarn the current naacp president was chairman of the legal committee for more than years he was also a founder incorporator and first president of the naacp legal defense fund other white men in black_power in the year of the revolution were allan knight chalmers professor congregational minister author president of the naacp legal defense fund former head of the scottsboro defense committee former cochairman of the national council for a permanent fepc onetime member of more than governing boards jack greenberg attorney new york executive director of naacp legal defense fund former associate director of the fund henry steeger new york publisher of argosy magazine

for major civil_rights organizations other influential and wellheeled whites poor whites like poor negroes are democratically excluded shape negro policy and exercise veto power on new issues through their positions as board members and patrons and links to the white power structure the counterparts of the white friends in power are roy wilkins an exnewspaper editor who is executive secretary of the naacp whitney young jr a former social worker and educator who is executive director of the national urban league and cochairman of the council for united civil_rights leadership also influential on the national scene though not in the limelight are frederick douglass patterson veterinarian educator foundation executive new york city president of phelpsstokes fund president of national business league president emeritus of tuskegee institute founder and former president of the united negro college fund board of trustees bennett college bethunecookman college hampton institute palmer memorial southern educational foundation ralph johnson bunche political scientist un official new york city board of directors naacp phelpsstokes fund board of higher education new york fund for advancement of education rockefeller foundation harvard university board of overseers stephen gill spottswood ame zion bishop washington d c chairman of board of directors of naacp how much influence whites exert on negro policymakers has long been a matter of bitter debate no one doubts however that white influence is important in negro decisionmaking ralph j bunche among others has sharply criticized the role of white men in negro affairs in a memorandum prepared for the myrdal study bunche said white men exercised a great deal of control over the selection of negro leaders and scholars he went on to criticize the whole philosophy of interracial liberalism white members of interracial organizations he wrote usuall fix the measure of value of the organization deciding not merely the question of how much to ask for but also how to ask and indeed whether the negro should ask at all similar attacks have come from carter woodson w e b du bois e franklin frazier and others all echoed in varying degrees the charge of jessie o thomas who said once that interracial cooperation often ends up with negroes cooing and white people operating bunche in particular was scathing in the memorandum in his criticism of interracial liberalism too often bunche said in a criticism often repeated in the sixties negro board members receive their cues from white board members in general he concluded concern for the opinion of white supporters and allies is a powerful factor in keeping negro organizations respectable establishment arbiters denied these criticisms in the forties and they deny them today in their support it should be said that some whites in the establishment are more militant than some negroes jack greenberg for example is one of the more militant members of the legal wing other examples could be cited a former national urban league board member who championed a more militant urban league policy at a time when some though not all negro board members were opposed and yet when all this is said the fact remains that most white members of the establishment are moderate whites as a group have served as a brake rather than as an accelerator of the freedom movement it would be a mistake however to blame white liberals and moderates for establishment style the establishment in its present form is an invention of two radically different men booker t washington and w e b du bois and it betrays the tensions of this extraordinary miscegenation between conservatism and militancy in the first decades of the twentieth century booker t washington established an entente between moderate negroes and the better element of whites in this same period du bois established a similar entente between militant negroes and liberal whites after washingtons death these divergent forces met at joel spingarns country home in dutchess county new york and decided in so many words that booker t washington and w e b du bois were both right and that all roads leading to the goal were equally honorable this of course was no decision at all and du bois perceiving this years later left the establishment with a blast at the ruling group the basic problem in laffaire du bois was not program but style to understand establishment style we must hold to contradictory ideas at the center of our minds the establishment is both militant and conservative its pronouncements in other words are militant but its actions are cautious and conciliatory what distinguishes the negro power structure above all is its reluctance to act this powerful group whose tentacles extend into every area of negro life rarely raises new issues fepc nonviolence sitins mass demonstrations dontbuywhereyoucantwork came from without through the years the dominant voices in the negro power structure have been voices of caution and compromise through the years the manipulators of the structure have been men too timid and too cautious to initiate and direct action the establishments word protest is a mask for inaction the deepest strain in establishment protest is sterile and socially irrelevant endless debate polite petitions the sending of telegrams and letters the whole ritual of mimeograph machines and typewriters all this has been a substitute for hard analysis and risky action the word risk this separates the establishment and its perennial critics the radicals the establishment has never been willing to take serious risks it has never been willing to jeopardize place position and institutions in adventures for freedom as a result there has hovered over all establishment activities a faint smell of gamesmanship of pretense and posturing and evasions of reality it was this i think that led myrdal and bunche to write two of the most mournful sentences in the whole history of leadership analysis bunche leadership itself is a form of escape myrdal the negro hates the negro role in american society and the negro leader who acts out this role in public life becomes the symbol of what the negro hates there are endless stories on the game aspect of establishment leadership the best one i think used to bring down the house on the old vaudeville circuit a negro comedian mimicking a big negro leader would begin the following sentence in a stentorian voice and gradually lower his voice until at the end it was a bare whisper what we colored folks have got to do is to rise up and strike down these here damned white folks since the establishment of the establishment negro leadership has been under constant attack no serious student of the negro ethos has failed to note what drake and cayton called the ritual condemnation of negro leadership day in and day out from barber shop bar and beauty shop the cry arises negro leadershipthe people who run things i e the negro establishmentis no good a great deal of this constant and sometimes petty criticism stems from the social distance between the leadership and the masses students of power say that a people always get the kind of leadership they deserve but the reverse is also true leaders in the long run get the kind of followers they deserve the main bone of contention between the establishment and its critics revolves around the cumbersome wordmasses garvey in the twenties bunche in the forties a philip randolph in the forties e franklin frazier in the fifties and rebellious students in the sixties have contended that the establishment is a conspiracy in contempt of the masses however that may be it is certain that the establishment has never solved what du bois called gingerly the inner problem of contact with their own lower classes bunche went further and said in the forties that the negro elite knows little if any more about the negro in the mass than does the average white man the question at issue however is not knowledge but use the establishment has never organized the masses for social contention down through the years the negro power structure has been more active in accommodating the masses to misery than in organizing them for an attack on the forces responsible for the misery establishment statements point to a deep fear of direct intervention on the part of the masses the fear is not altogether unreasonable and it is not a fear of the establishment alone some of the new organizations trembling on the verge of risky action have shrunk back shuddering from the abyss into which they had just peered behind all the words and all the slogans is a terrible reality millions on millions of men and women with deep fears and resentments and needs fears and resentments and needs it should be noted that cannot be met by the appointment of a negro federal judge or the filing of a court suit no one knows really what will happen if this force is loosed for the lower strata of the negro working class does not belong to any organization not even despite current propaganda the church how bitter are these men and women how far are they willing to go if they are set in motion can they be controlled many men not all of them members of the establishment have asked themselves these questions and have decided in good conscience that they would rather not know the answers the establishment says officially that the negro masses cannot be organized that they are utterly apathetic and demoralized what this means unofficially is that it is impossible to organize the masses around a responsible respectable moderate programaround the establishments program in short in essence the establishments program is a program of agency relation of carefully selected agents acting for the masses in the courts and other theaters of power the central weak ness of this programand establishment men are too brilliant not to know itis that men cannot be freed by agentswhite or black the everrecurring cry of the negro power structure and some of the new organizations have taken it up is deal with us or the radicals will take over this is a curious confession of programmatic and ideological poverty the statement as a statement of leadership tells much about the relationships between the masses and the men who claim to be their leaders over the years negro men of power have built up considerable good will with the white power structure they have access to the state house and the white house and the sources of white money and this access enables them to get small favors for the people they say they are leading radicals surprisingly enough admit the existence of this good will but they contend that power and prestige are capital and like capital must be invested and risked occasionally if it is to bring a proper return at issue here are deep questions of power ethics power works the same way everywhere and men respond to power in the same way everywhere outs for example tend to be radical ins tend to be conservative the same rule applies to organizations experience suggests that reform organizations cannot stand too much success the more a reform organization wins the more money it collects the more staffers it acquires the more conservative it generally becomes establishment in style can best be understood in a comparison with radical out style radicals seek a showdown the establishment seeks an accommodation the establishment says it is necessary to reduce racial tensions radicals say it is necessary to raise them to the highest pitch to create what bayard rustin a leading philosopher of the freedom movement calls creative social confusion radicals denounce white people the establishment appeals to their sense of fair play radicals call for a revolt the establishment calls for a conference radicals appeal to the masses the establishment appeals to the better people radicals march the establishment confers radicals demonstrate the establishment negotiates radicals demand the establishment resolves radicals are radicals in the latin sense of root the establishment is conservativemilitantly so although the establishment resists new ideas it contains many bold and some radicalmen to say that the group is moribund and reactionary is to simplify a complicated process reactionaries have always been members of the establishment but so have progressives atlanta life insurance company for example sponsored many forwardlooking developments in atlanta supreme life financed and carried to the supreme court through earl b dickerson a key restrictive covenant case prominent members of the inner core have supported none causes and some like dickerson thurgood marshall ralph bunche and w h hastie have made laudable efforts to move the structure in the direction of the dominant social challenge the negro masses men who see a simple blackwhite dichotomy between the establishment and radicals would do well to ponder the actions of emen during world war ii dickerson and hastie resigned important government positions as protests against discrimination radical representatives of labor protested but did not resign other independent establishment men include two powerful editors who continued to print news about paul robeson in the fifties equally independent was an insurance executive who disavowed the ideas of the elder du bois but refused to disavow the manat a time when many radicals were running for cover but here as elsewhere rank has its privileges and here as elsewhere the exceptions prove the rule what matters in the establishment is not the individual but the group as a structure of power as a selfconscious determiner of negro policy the establishment moves slowly views all new ideas and departures with suspicion if not hostility like men of power everywhere establishmentarians are victims of their fears and phobias they would rather see things not happen than to see them happen they are in short hamlets who prefer to bear those ills they have than to fly to others they know not of and yet like hamlet they can be goaded into action one of the most important decisions in the history of american negroes the midforties decision to attack segregation per se in the courts was made by a handful of emen in a manhattan hotel room among the decisionmakers were the late walter white thurgood marshall and w h hastie the decision made by these men and others was later ratified by a larger group that the establishment was able to initiate and carry this radical new departure until then the dominant issue in negro life was separatebutequal facilities despite strong opposition from men in local power structures indicates the power and the potential of the group although members sometimes meet behind closed doors and make large decisions affecting the lives and livelihoods of the negro masses the establishment is not a conspiracy most decisions in fact are unconscious extensions of establishment style decisions that crystallize and take shape without vote or indeed an articulated proposal members of the establishment are by and large men who look out on life from the same vantage point as managers of men andor material and as holders of real estate and stocks and bonds establishment men are moulded by the same forces and respond to events with the same style like their contemporaries in the white world like men of place and power and property everywhere they tend to fear men and issues that rock the boat establishment policy is not entirely a matter of common temperament since the armenia conference of a negro unity conference called by a white man joel spingarnthe negro power structure has been a selfconscious group composed of men of weight who make decisions with other men of weight in mind and more men in the inner circle know each other see each other socially play bridge and poker together and decide affairs of state and money over martinis and scotch when the late president kennedy invited negro leaders to the white house for the emancipation centennial celebration negro guestsfrom north south east and westgreeted each other with the warmth of longlost cousins as indeed many of them were an administrative official dimly recognizing the implications of all this said with consternation and surprice why these people all know each other the establishment is linked not only by formal and informal ties but also by common backgrounds most members of the current establishment are lineal and according to their critics spiritual descendants of house slaves and the free negro elite not a few sprang from the black puritan class which placed a high premium on respectability responsibility and the middleclass values of thrift sobriety and steadiness almost all of them were marked for ill or good by strong men and women who desperately almost fanatically dedicated themselves to proving to themselves and to othersthat they were not negroes a common educational background also links the power structure a significantly large percentage of toplevel leadership has come from ivy league colleges many more however came from a handful of negro colleges which form a subivy league league howard university for example has served as a kind of postgraduate school for harvard postgraduates the number of negro leaders who studied or taught at howard bunche hastie thurgood marshall charles e thompson james nabrit carl murphy is impressive from these men came some of the establishments best thinkingpro and con the successful legal campaign was mapped at howard the pioneer thinking on nonviolence came largely from howard mordecai johnson james farmer howard thurman w s nelson and the thinking for several beyondtheestablishment organizations the national negro congress the negro sanderin was hammered out there atlanta and nashville have been equally important as establishment nurseries the southern branch of the ivy league consists of atlanta university james weldon johnson walter white virginia union eugene kinckle jones lincoln thurgood marshall morehouse martin_luther_king jr james nabrit jr mordecai johnson and fisk w e b du bois j finley wilson charles wesley the black puritan background the tutelage of white puritans in new south missionary schools and new england universities the proving of self and race against the standards of white power the postgraduate training in and around howard fisk morehouse and the leadership factories of chicago new york and washington this was the common womb from which came men imbued with a stern sense of duty responsibility men driven and set apart tragically separated from their white peers who patronized them and the negro masses whom they patronized this background plus du bois ideology of the talented tenth sent forth leaders with a rather aristocratic and not altogether realistic concept of noblesse obligemen who felt they were responsible for the masses and discharged that responsibility at a safe distance there was a mark on the brow of such men by the mark they recognized each other and excluded interlopers in their time and in their place they made important contributions it was not their fault really that they were products of their time and their place it was not their faultor was it reallythat they learned caution with duty that they learned to value order and respectability in the same places that taught them the desirability and the inevitability of social change they were on the whole a remarkable lot though not revolutionaries themselves they tilled the ground and prepared the way for the bitter harvest for many years the elite of family education property and yes color was in part an interlocked directorate composed of several large families tied together by marriage and a larger group who stood in candicacy for powerand marriage there are indications that the establishment is losing some of its caste and color flavor despite ingroup mating and a certain snobbishness based on status and color the establishment has always been open to talent backed by money andor organization and if possible respectability within recent years new members have entered the group by marriage and accomplishment the bumper crop of new doctors and professional men with status and money has also changed the contours of the establishment more important still is the expanding middleclass which makes it difficult to tell without a scoreboard where the establishment ends and the commons begin even more important as a factor in the waning influence of the establishment is the revolt of the masses asa philip randolph opened a pandoras box of mass participation when he called laborers and maids to the barricades in the forties there is considerable evidence that the establishment was scandalized but since the process was unstoppable the establishment wisely joined the movement and pushed it forward the postwar world which called off all bets has shaken the establishment to its foundation having fought off one challenge in the garvey movement of the twenties the establishment found itself face to face with another massbased black nationalist movement the nation of islam in this same period there was a complete revolution in mass communication a revolution that bewildered the establishment and almost isolated it in the void stepped john h johnson an inventive chicagoan who rose to the top ranks of the coalition establishment with a new kind of journalism there were other changes the shifting of the center of gravity from new york to atlanta in the wake of the montgomery boycott and the sitins and the emergence of the negro student as a social force the net result of these changes was a new correlation of forces in which a few ragged students could make decisions and carry them out without the advice and consent of the establishment in faraway new york then in the sixties the establishment was called upon to face a long suppressed issue the growing chasm between it and the masses urban renewal more than any other issue made the negro power structure face the fact that what is good for the negro real estate broker or the negro millionaire is not necessarily good for the negro laborer or the maid on relief a variety of issues in every big city issues revolving around poverty and middleclassness or the lack of it has called into question the good faith if not the good sense of the establishment it would be a mistake to conclude from all this that the establishment is dead far from it with the resiliency that has marked it for more than fifty years the group has grafted the new onto the old new men with new power have been accepted by the curiabut the curia has so far failed to ask itself the ancient questions about new wine and old bottles these questions are pushing the new men of power in quite a different direction a new establishment has sprung up around the core groups of the southern christian leadership conference the student nonviolent coordinating committee the congress of racial equality and the negro american labor league the new organizations are tapping new sources of negro and white expressiveness radicals pacifists intellectuals rebels nonconformists negro and whiteare finding niches in the new organizations among the persons who have served on the governing boards of the new organizations are harry belafonte sncc ella baker sncc rev c k steele sncc and core advisory committee howard thurman core advisory committee james baldwin core advisory committee and l d reddick slcc historian interestingly though the new men of power are weaving yet another interlocking directorate rev fred shuttles worth the president of the alabama conference of human rights is secretary of the sncc king himself and many of his aides and supporters flit in and out of core the fellowship of reconciliation and other organizations king is even fashioning a separate legal organization the ghandi societya move that has greatly disturbed the old establishment an analysis of the governing boards of the old and new organizations reveals two different layers of support with few exceptions members of the old organizations are not members of the governing or advisory boards of the new organizations among the interesting exceptions are james b carey allan knight chalmbers earl b dickerson a philip randolph ira de a reid walter reuther hobson reynolds jackie robinson and bishop w j walls the establishment exists today as an uneasy coalition of old patriarchs new men of power and rebels but it still wields force as an independent power in the negro world its continuing power and influence were evident in the march on washington where establishment men moderated and mitigated explosive forces and militant men the establishment still lives but it operates in a different climate establishment men grew up in a world where simple people acquiesced in the decisions of their betters now suddenly all that has changed policy is made now in the full glare of kleig lights with intellectuals students and a comedian dick gregory looking over the policymakers shoulders having survived marcus garvey in the twenties black lenins in the thirties and asa philip randolph in the forties the establishment is waiting now for the next turn of the wheel the only thing wrong with this calculation is that the name of the game has changed the young students and behind them the young black nationalists are playing for keeps when a game or historical process reaches that point as french conservatives and american tories discovered establishment men who refuse to bet lose all the time almost everyone knows that the white power structure is threatened by the negro revolution what is not noted often enough is that negro men of power are also on trial not for the decisions they made but for the decisions they did not make not for the battles they lost but for the battles they did not fight the frustrated masculinity of the negro male there is a saying that the only people free in america are the white man and the negro woman while this is true only in a special sense it does point to the simple fact that negro men are extremely frustrated in playing the masculine role this leads to a psychological effort to compensate for feelings of inadequacy by way of a struggle for conspicuous masculinity many cloak their deepseated feelings of inadequacy in boldly masculine garb and mannerisms for example while only eccentric white males and old west villains wear mustaches the mustache is widely sported by negro men this spotlights their visible contrast with women more than a few negro women for their part will say that they dont want a man without a mustache tassled shoes umbrellas and earmuffs are regarded as feminine within the lower class although this now is waning to some extentwhat with the adoption of the continental and ivy league look the bouncing jitterbug walk and the bluffing demeanor of negro males is still another aspect of the quest for conspicuous masculinity while white men think nothing of crossing their arms or legs as a gesture of refinement negroes typically spread their legs and lean forward ever so slightly to achieve an effect not open to women wearing dresses and skirts then there are the masculine epithets such as man stud a stallion jack a male mule cat lion or panther and the like to suggest a masculine ferocity they long for but do not have women are accordingly given less ferocious labels such as babe and chick this does not include broad which apparently has come down from slavery days meaning a negro slaves wife owned by the master of another plantation and called an abroad wife the frustrated masculinity of the negro male also is apparent in the extreme suspicion of homosexuality among even the most normal of men thus the negro man who plays the classical piano or dances the ballet is likely to be called homosexual much more so than in the case of white men a negro man with the refined bearing of rock hudson would be viewed with suspicion or regarded as queer much of this is realistic anxiety for it is true that negro males are frustrated in the effort to play a male role before the coming of nonviolence in racial discord with its relative safeguards against resisting white mobs negro women and children were typically sent in men hung back apparently then rushed in after the situation was underway witness rosa parks who sparked the passive resistance movement autherine lucy first negro to enter the university of alabama ada lois sipuelfisher first negro to enter the university of oklahoma in a nonsegregated capacity and daisy bates who stood up to faubus along with the little rock nine now that the pattern has been set and the ku klux klan tamed negro males have become more reckless although one wonders what they would do without constance baker motley of the naacp legal staff and gloria richardson militant leader of the cambridge maryland protest this is in contrast to the cultural expectation that men should be the aggressive guardians of their women and children yet in some deep south communities negro males cannot even preserve the sanctity of their homes from invading white suitors the fact that the negro man cannot protect his family presents a special problem to the negro male psychology negro women can and often do rationalize wed get our rights if our men would face up to the white man negro males on the other hand have no one on whom to project the blame rather they are likely to internalize the contempt held by their women who have two national organizations the national council of negro women and the national association of colored womens clubswhile negro men have none as such witness the incident in chicago during the summer of when a group of negroes having obtained official permission to use calumet park which then was regarded as white were stoned by white teenage boys most of the men present ran off leaving four teenage boys and the women and children to fend for themselves on an individual level one irate worn an complained that her husband pretends to snore whenever she must arouse him from bed to check some mysterious noise downstairs say in the kitchen similarly negro males are frustrated in the effort to play the role of provider this is illustrated in the fact that a major tenet of the black muslim movement is to restore the male to a respectable position in their families women are expected to obey their husbands and relinquish some of their power in the family group men are bound in turn to a struggle to provide for and protect their families while there is some doubt that the muslims are successful in accomplishing these goals it is true that in muslim services unlike many christian churches which are disproportionately filled by women and children men do dominate the conduct of church affairs but the fact remains that negro men in general are impeded in the role of provider they are more likely to have their salaries outstripped by their women census figures for show that considerably more white males than females are enrolled in college percent to per cent this is not true for negroes where per cent of the males were enrolled in college against percent of the females even if a negro male does go to college he is more likely to wind up in a nonprofessional occupation while considerably more white males than females are professional the reverse is true for negroes needless to say there is often a strain between the nonprofessional negro male and his professional wife he may resent her professional associates while she may reject his nonprofessional friends the nonprofessional husband may feel sensitive to the professional status of his wife in contrast to his own and she may feel the need to apologize for him before her professional friends even those negro males who go to college and work in professional capacities are most often pushed into the traditionally feminine occupations of school teacher and social worker beneath the college rank high school women graduates may get clerical jobs in the white collar category and feel a prestige not accruing to their blue collar mates thus many negro women ex press the belief that a negro man cant do nothing for you financially or dont know how to treat a woman such women pride themselves on the possession of white sponsors who pay their clothing bill or the rent the negro malethey feelis minus the masculine prestige contingent on the ability to provide luxuries and satisfaction for females the paramount importance of the occupation to the males selfrespect has been pointed out by harold finestone see cats kicks and color in identity and anxiety ed by maurice stein and arthur vidich thus some reject work altogether and turn to pimping as a compensatory exploitation of the female but this is counter to a culture which expects the contrary only many persons mistakenly point to the negro males success in sports as an indication that negro males possess superior masculinity but this is not necessarily so such theorists may be overlooking the fact that the athletic field may be especially attractive to individuals who have a need to spotlight or showoff a conspicuous masculinity professor kirson weinberg of chicagos roosevelt university made a study of professional boxers for instance see the occupational culture of boxers american journal of sociology and found among them young men who were called sissie in childhood or who originally had femininesounding names one individual decided to learn boxing because his sister had grown tired of taking up for him much of the viciousness of welterweight champion emil griffiths fatal fight with benny kid paret was said to be the result of hostility generated at the weighin when paret patted griffith who also is a designer of womens hats on the buttocks and called him a woman in spanish the lynch mob also has helped to exaggerate and spread the myth of the negros superior masculinity yet only one out of six lynch victims were even accused initially of rape see arthur raper the tragedy of lynching sex was merely used as a pretext by angry white mobs even so there is an old theory that many negro sex offenders are acting out their frustrations especially when the victim is white one negro simply walked up to a strange white woman in a chicago elevator and hit her in the mouth he explained that he simply had an irresistible impulse to bop her not to rape her and did not molest her sexually although many a man has shared this urge toward women of both races the point is still conceivable another who raped a negro girl said that he had always been too shy or meek to approach a woman in the usual manner but this has not offset the myths and jokes among whites regarding extreme or animalistic sexual prowess and equipment attributed to negro males it has helped to make the negro male an object of curiosity to more than a few white women but in turn has been utilized by white supremacists to salve their guilt regarding their easier access to negro women in the deep south see john dollard caste and class in a southern town at the same time the white supremacists develop fears that their own weird tales may contain some element of truth the next step naturally is to try to stifle or minimize the masculinity of the negro male in actuality sometimes even by outright castration john o killens author of a novel about negro men at war and then we heard the thunder was no doubt aware of this when he had a woman character tell the hero solly the one thing they will not stand for is for a black man to be a man and everything else is worthless if a man cant be a man the myth of the white backlash currently editors c columnists and commentators are making much of the socalled white backlash against the civil_rights movement they argue with uncommon unanimity that the stiffening resistance of white people against negro demands as exemplified in the large vote for alabamas segregationist governor in wisconsin indiana and maryland represents a significant loss of sympathy among whites for the cause of equal rights the assumption supporting this proposition is that there existed prior to the eruption of school boycotts sitins lieins stallins and the ascendancy of negro militants a great store of sincere goodwill toward negroes on the part of most northern whites and this is almost per cent pure myth if such goodwill did exist for negroes among northern whites then how was it manifested was it translated into activity designed at lowering racial barriers against negroes in the norththese are important questions for the key to the nature of the whole crisis of civil_rights in the north lies imbedded in the answers and yet these are questions few of the editors and analysts are asking the simple fact is thathad such goodwill been prevalent among northern whitesthere would never have developed any need for boycotts and demonstrations and the moderate and responsible negro leaders like roy wilkins of the naacp would never have been eclipsed by the extremists if northern white people generally favored equal rights for negroes then there would have existed no racial barriers in the craft unions no nonnegro hiring policies by many industrial firms no practice of keeping negroes in menial jobs in those firms where they are hired no exclusion of qualified negroes from middleclass or white residential areas and therefore no allnegro schools with facilities equipment and instruction demonstrably inferior to that in predominantly white schools those who argue insistently that negro militance has hurt the negro cause neglect to offer convincing evidence in support of their argument it may be that such evidence is in fact quite small and difficult to come by it is even possible that the argument is used largely as a club with which to discourage the growing nuisance of demonstrations viewed from the negro side of americas racial wall the proposition that there is a white backlash against the civil_rights movement takes on the character of a particularly insidious canard just what are these proponents of the white backlash theory up to anyway are they genuinely concerned that white sympathizers with the negro cause may abandon the struggle or are they attempting ever so subtly to blackmail negroes into submission surely any honest observer of the civil_rights scene who is capable of even moderately accurate perception must know by now that the white community tends to act in favor of negro rights only in the face of concerted negro pressure rare indeed are the instances where white authority bows to the principle of total equality of the races on its own initiative it is true that northern whites are reacting with some vehemence to the disruption of the status quo but are those who interpret this as a backlash unconsciously equating the status quo with the conditions of amiable race relations to negroes it would certainly seem so many of the whites who now are claiming disaffection with the ne gro cause because of some excesses on the part of some civil_rights activists or groups are actually revealing their own latent condescension prejudice and intolerance they are in effect seeking to punish all negroes for the behavior of a few negroes which is precisely the excuse southern racists have always employed now these people may proclaim themselves friends of negroes if they choose to but it is extremely unlikely that negroes have ever thought of them as friends this of course is another way of stating the dilemma of the liberal many whites who think of themselves as being friends to negroes would be embarrassed to read what amounts to a description of themselves in a book written by enlightened virginia aristocrat lewis harvie blair back in directing his words to those fellowpatricians who protested that they were gentle and helpful to negroes lewis harvie blair wrote in a southern prophecy but we forget that our kindness to the negroes proceeds from the standpoint of condescension and of assumed caste superiority and we expect it to be received with humility and from a feeling of acknowledged caste inferiority and if not so received by the negroes they are thought impudent and impertinent and the foundation of our kindness dries up the cause of justice and equality is either right or it is not and if it is right it does not become wrong because of the behavior of some individuals or groups concerned with it to say to negroes that their cause is just only so long as they behave in a way to deserve equality is not only to insult negro citizens but it is also to ascribe to white people precisely those powers over negroes which no citizen can have over another in a free society the point is that those who are defecting from support of negroes are those whose support was only token to begin with not only do these whites who believe in real equality still give unqualified support to the cause they also understand how and why many negroes are resorting to extremism these white people are not racists which is to say that they do not assign human rights and values according to race and therefore they are able to put themselves in the negros shoes and having done so they know that nothing short of death would prevent them from insisting that they have the same rights and privileges as all other americans and looking at the prowallace vote in wisconsin indiana and maryland from this viewpoint it is possible to be cheered rather than depressed by the results if wallaces pull of onethird of the vote really means that this proportion of the people oppose negro equality then it also means that the other twothirds are willing to accept negro equality indeed if the vote means any such thing it amounts to a great victory for the cause of equal rights in those two states personally however i am not so optimistic what the country is finally facing are the consequences of its own timidity hypocrisy and neglect americans in no section of the country have ever been subjected to any intensive coaching in the honoring of negro rights quite the opposite has been true and even some conservative observers are getting around to admitting as much in a recent column in the chicago daily news john m johnston wrote nobody who reads the papers should be surprised by the wallace phenomenon it was not by oversight that a hundred years have gone by without spelling out the privileges of citizenship for negroes as is now being attempted in washington indeed it was not i suggest that when the full impact of the meaning of the negro revolution dawns on white america the vote in favor of states rights and against government interference will be even greater than that recorded in the recent wisconsin and indiana primaries for negroes are in no popularity contest and they are not asking for tolerance negroes are insisting upon their rights as free citizens furthermore it is highly unlikely that negroes will be impressed by the endless admonitions of moderation and pleas for restraint directed at them by whites white people have been telling negroes to wait for their full rights for over a hundred years in fact it is precisely because negroes failed to insist upon their full and equal rights in the north that many of the racial restrictions now prevailing came to harden in custom many people believe for instance that the question of housing segregationundoubtedly a central concern in the nations racial dilemmais a relatively new and particularly delicate consideration in the overall problem but such is not the case the basic federal law on housing was passed nearly a century ago in it provided a year in prison a fine of or both for those who violated the following provision all citizens of the united states shall have the same right in every state and territory as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit purchase lease sell hold and convey real and personal property however in the south custom was joined by brutal suppression in the conspiracy against negro rights writing recently in the reporter of the great racist reaction that overtook the country in the s historian c vann woodward had this to say in the south the reaction found expression in whitesupremacy propaganda segregation laws poll taxes literacy and poverty tests white primaries and other devises for disfranchising the negroes it was accompanied by an increase in lynching riots and other forms of violence against the minority race it resulted in driving the negro from all forums and avenues of political life in stripipng him of many of the civil_rights and defenses he had gained through the reconstruction amendments and in reducing him to a despised and segregated outcast well negroes now are calling for a redress of all these grievances and it is the nations challengenot his aloneto see that the grievances are redressed with honor and dispatch in recent years liberals have replaced segregationists as the prime targets of negro ire writers like james baldwin and leroi jones have gone so far as to picture the liberals as millstones around the negros neck and poet calvin hernton flatly blamed the failure of white liberals for the rise of the black muslims these attacks of course were not leveled at genuine liberals who are relatively few but at that vast army of americans who mistake a patronizing attitude however subtle for a liberal conviction what most of these people mean when they say they are friends of negroes is that they dont mind negroes as long as negroes stay in their place and that place invariably turns out to be somewhere other than where full and unconditional rights of citizenship are a reality in other words these liberals tend to balk and to reject their convictions at the point where negroes insist on being simply men and women like any others with precisely the same rights privileges and obligations as other men and women and so whites in the metropolitan areas of the north are being flushed out into the openforced to go on recordrelative to their true racial attitudes it was one thing to strike a liberal pose in favor of negro rights so long as what was involved only amounted to a question of unsegregated seating on a southern bus or free use of a public park or even unrestricted service at a sandwich counter but it is quite another matter when this liberality is put to the acid test in terms of jobs schools and housing areas where some adjustment and possible inconvenience on the liberals part is required to make negro equality an unqualified reality white analysts of the civil_rights movement may choose to see a great white backlash but negroes remain unconvinced there is no surprise for negroes in the revelation of widespread bigotry among white people north or south what is happening is that the two major races in this country have arrived at the inevitable confrontation this is the true meaning of this moment this is the service governor george wallace of alabama is rendering to americans he is bringing us closer to the longpostponed moment of truth the time has come when white people are going to have to decide whether they are to be guided by the principles of justice and equality as spelled out in the constitution and bill of rights or whether they are going to submit this system of government to the rationale of racism we are now witnessing the weedingout process the separation of the true believers from the hypocrites from now until the resolution of the race problem one way or another white people will find it increasingly difficult to cloak their desire for white privilege in robes of genteel patronage the partys over it was sitting alone i f near the end of the p bar trying to finish a quick afterwork scotch when this tall blond fellow with bushy eyebrows came up to me and blurted would you come to my party beg pardon i said id like to invite you to this party im having up to my house friday night he explained noting the look of amazement on my face he plunged on you see im having this big party and a lot of people will be there but i dont have a negro you dont have what i asked not sure i had heard him right but certain i did not understand him if i had well youre a status symbol everybody else has one and i havent been able to find one anyplace he complained i mean ben matthews has got one working for him over at his accounting firm and joe gleason has got one selling cars at his agency bill miller knows one personally who is maitred at the golden rooster and bill can quote him on the negro problem in sales meetings and at social gatherings but i dont have anybody i could see frustration written all over the poor fellows face and i was not at all sure but what he was about to cry it would have been indecent of me not to be sympathetic what time is your party i asked oh goody its about eightish do you mean youll come but why me i asked you dont even know me well ive got to have somebody he cried you mean you want me to be your token negro i said drily oh yes indeedy you are most welcome he said well what are the ground rules i asked i mean what do you expect me to do what kind of party is it oh its just a cocktail affair you can dress casual and you dont have to do anything but stand around with a drink in your hand and talk to the other guests and maybe answer some questions about some of your friends like mahalia jackson and theolonius monk i dont know mahalia jackson and theolonius i said you dont he asked incredulously for a moment i thought he was going to take back his invitation well never mind he said finally talk about jazz and sugar ray robinson in his heydeyboy he was some fighterand maybe even martin_luther_king and all those dogs and water hoses down in birmingham we all felt just terrible about that how about barry goldwater i asked what suppose we get to talking about things like the presidential candidates maybe somebody will want to know what i think oh i think id stay away from politics he warned and added with a quick laugh you know what they say about never discussing politics and religion unless you want trouble what about a discussion of some of the organizations currently on the american scene like the john birch society i wanted to know well now there are going to be some more or less conservative people at the party andwell after all the john birch society is against communism you know isnt everybody i said but i tell you what suppose i just stand around and maybe talk business like what is real estate going for in the neighborhood oh i dont think id ask a question like that if i were you he protested quickly i mean therell be a lot of liberals there and all but a thing like mixing neighborhoods gets to be pretty touchy will there be dancing i wanted to know my yes he said and youre welcome to dance all you want as a matter of fact wed like to see you dance of course youll want to bring your own date i mean someone who knows all the dances then too you know how other guys are about someone dancing with their wives or dates he laughed again is it all right if i smoke i asked finally well i dont know about that he answered with all this cancer scare about smoking you know some of the guests might be a little queasy about being around a cancerous negro we just sort of stared at each other blankly for a moment say ive got a great idea he boomed at last how would you like to serve my party the negro who saved america the year was thomas jefferson had just become the third president o f the young struggling republic that was the united states in france napoleon bonaparte had just become the first consul of the republic for life and had barely begun his fantastic career of european domination but it was a former negro slave toussaint louverture who lived on the small caribbean island of san domingo around which world events would turn for the next two years from the island of san domingo toussaint louverture saved the united states from a possible war halted napoleon bonapartes plans for a western empire and made it possible for the united states to purchase louisiana from france to understand how this almost unknown figure came to have such a large influence on world events it is necessary to look at life on the island of san domingo in the year in san domingo was divided into two parts the eastern part of the island now called the dominican republic was a spanish colony the western half of the island now haiti was french and one of the richest colonies in the world at this time there were about onehalf million people living in the french colony about were white french colonists about were mulattoes and the rest were fullblooded negro slaves toussaint louverture was one of them the french revolution which had taken place two years before had severe repercussions on the island in the mulattoes who were wealthy well educated and french citizens but still subject to a kind of caste system demanded their freedom as french citizens the whites fearful of the mulattoes refused their demands and became ardent royalists the quarrelling and fighting between the two groups went on for two years until the government in san domingo decided in to stage a slave uprising to scare the whites and mulattoes into forgetting their differences and uniting behind the government the government called together the slave leaders and planned a mock uprising the slaves in return for their help were to receive one day off a week and a promise of no more whippings the slaves were to walk off the plantations and then the french troops would come in and pretend to end the pretended rebellion on august the slaves walked off the plantations as planned but a few slaves got carried away and the mock uprising turned into the real thing the whites and mulattoes now frightened ceased quarrelling joined forces and began to kill as many slaves as possible most of the slaves who had no intention of killing anyone now found themselves hunted by the whites and mulattoes who killed any slaves they caught to save their lives the slaves fought back and the battle was on toussaint louverture and other slave leaders seeing a chance to turn a senseless uprising into a real fight for the long dreamed of freedom gathered together an army of slaves and started the fight for freedom for two years toussaint conducted guerrilla warfare against the french insisting on freedom for the slaves as a part of any armistice agreement just as the french were preparing a campaign planned to ultimately defeat toussaints troops the french people removed louis xvi from the throne and france became a republic armies all over europe quickly mobilized against the democracy which threatened the safety of royalty everywhere england and spain seeing an opportunity to grab more land each sent troops into the french colony on san domingo toussaint quickly joined forces with the spanish who lacked troops in return for professional training for his troops the french fighting a war on two fronts now found themselves slowly losing ground finally the break toussaint and his troops had been waiting for came the french people at the height of their revolutionary ardor proclaimed the freedom of the slaves in january toussaint immediately offered his services to the new democracy and was accepted toussaint now turned to the task of defeating the english and the spanish this took time but by toussaint and his troops had driven out the english and had taken the eastern half of the island in the name of france although san domingo was still technically under french rule in toussaint louverture now held the real power being both governor and commanderinchief under the leadership of toussaint san domingo prospered by the island had reached twothirds of its prerevolutionary production toussaint invited the french planters who had fled the island during the fighting to return and pick up where they had left off many went back and enjoyed prosperity once more toussaint placed an overseer in charge of the lands owned by french colonists who did not return and divided the profits from these lands so that the workers received onequarter the government received onehalf and the absent owner received onequarter in a trust fund in case he should ever return toussaint improved roads and started schools he instituted a simple universal tax system under which everyone paid the same fixed percentage he made secret trade agreements with the united states and great britain and conducted a lively trade with these countries in short everyone from the white planters to the black former slaves prospered under the leadership of toussaint louverture more important everyone had freedom in the true sense of the word and there was no conflict between the whites and the blacks by the revolutionary government of france had fallen and bonaparte was now in power he had grandiose plans for building a colonial empire for france his original plan was to extend the french domain to egypt india and louisiana but by he had met failure in egypt and his plans for india had fallen through only louisiana was left for french expansion bonaparte wanted louisiana because it was a vast prosperous section of land enough land to start a new france new orleans was a trading center through which all american trade coming down the mississippi had to pass trade between the french caribbean colonies such as san domingo and louisiana would prosper all which would produce more wealth for france and gave bonaparte more room in which to operate besides louisiana would also be an excellent base from which to mount a french invasion of the united states if the occasion should ever present itself a french owned louisiana would have had a tremendous effect on the united states war would have been inevitable our rapidly expanding nation could not have tolerated a french colony on our western boundary the french would have been much more resistant to united states expansion than the spanish had been our struggling nation could not afford a war we had no army to speak of and our navy consisted of just seven frigates if we had gone to war alone against france we might easily have lost and become a french possession if we had joined forces with great britain against the french the greater possibility we would have been very dependent on britain for our existence and our future if we had won the war on britains side it is quite possible that canada would then have surrounded the united states on three sides a situation just as bad as a french louisiana the united states was in a tight spot and things looked dark indeed bonapartes plans for louisiana included san domingo bonaparte wanted to use the island as a supply base for the new colony however the island belonged to the french in name only the island really belonged to toussaint louverture and the negroes who might cut themselves loose from the mother country at any moment that situation could not be tolerated napoleon didnt exactly like the blacks either i am for the whites because i am white i have no other reason that one is enough besides that black upstart in san domingo had let himself be called bonaparte of the antilles and even had the nerve to send a constitution for bonapartes ratification in which he made himself governor of san domingo for five years opened the islands ports to any country in the world and declared san domingos local independence so bonaparte resolved to do away with toussaint and reinstate slavery france had ceded louisiana to spain in and bonaparte had to force charles iv king of spain to sign a treaty of retrocession of louisiana to france the treaty was agreed upon in october but it took bonaparte two full years to force charles to sign the treaty and make it legal while bonaparte waited for charles to sign the treaty he concentrated his efforts on san domingo he placed leclerc one of his best generals and his brotherinlaw in charge of the expedition to the island leclerc was to deceive the blacks win their confidence and then arrest toussaint disband his army and restore slavery napoleon gave him two months to accomplish this task when that had been done leclerc was to proceed to louisiana and assume a hostile attitude toward the united states great britain fearful of slave rebellions in its own colonies agreed not to interfere the united states trying to avoid war withdrew its trade from san domingo toussaint and his army alone were left to thwart bonapartes plan for a western empire leclercs troops set sail in january it was the largest expeditionary force ever sent overseas it consisted of troops generals and war vessels the fleet was so large that when toussaint first saw it he exclaimed we shall perish all france is come to make us slaves it was to be his only moment of panic quickly returning to the hills he issued to his people a proclamation which breathed vengeance my children france comes to make us slaves god gave us liberty france had no right to take it away burn the cities destroy the harvests tear up the roads with cannon poison the wells show the white man the hell he comes to make his people proved themselves equal to the task when leclerc landed in le cap one of the islands finest cities he found it reduced to ashes it was a scene which was to be repeated many times in the coming days the twomonth schedule bonaparte had set for leclerc came and went but the blacks showed no signs of giving up the fight although the french had captured the major cities and the coastal plains and many of the blacks had deserted toussaint he held on with an ever dwindling force continually defeating and eluding leclerc in the field leclerc was getting desperate he was losing as many men in sickness as he was on the field the morale of his troops was sinking lower and lower his supplies were in the same pitiful condition toussaint was also getting desperate his troops had dwindled down to men a force too small to fight the french toussaint could either hold out as long as possible or he could agree to an armistice let his troops go home to their families and be prepared to fight again when the time came to do so either way toussaint knew the coming rainy season would bring with it yellow fever which would effectively wipe out the french toussaint chose the latter course and arranged an armistice leclercwho wasted four months and troops trying to catch toussaint readily agreed to the armistice the armistice was a victory for toussaint the blacks were to be free french citizens and there were to be no reprisals but the armistice was not to last long toussaint was suddenly arrested and sent to france where he was put in a dungeon after his arrest toussaint told a french officer in overthrowing me you have cut down in san domingo only the trunk of the tree of liberty it will spring up again by the roots for they are numerous and deep numerous and deep they were indeed for all over the island insurrections were raised against the french the french their troops now badly depleted by yellow fever became increasingly powerless against the freedom fighters when leclerc died of malaria bonaparte reckoning that his army of had been defeated by toussaints uneducated badlyequipped black troops decided to withdraw from san domingo before he lost his reputation as a military genius he quickly leaped into a war with britain and in left the island to the negroes who had finally won their freedom while bonaparte was having his troubles in san domingo jefferson catching wind of napoleons plans for louisiana dispatched james monroe to france to try to buy new orleans and west florida for million dollars jefferson would have been satisfied if the united states could have retained its right of deposit at new orleans bonaparte his plans for a western empire now shattered by toussaint louverture was only too glad to be rid of new orleans and the rest of louisiana by selling louisiana he could raise needed money for his war with britain and could at the same time keep louisiana out of british hands napoleons representatives and monroe and livingston the other united states representative agreed to terms of million for all of louisiana even though monroe was not authorized to buy it agreement to terms was reached on april only days after toussaint louverture died of pneumonia in his lonely cell bonapartes dreams of a western empire came to an end san domingo had won its independence and the united states had gained an immense area of land the debt this country owes to toussaint louverture is considerable yet he is a forgotten man most united states history books fail to even mention his name race prejudice alone has blinded the american people to the debt they owe to toussaint louverture and the courage of onehalf million other negroes who would not be enslaved the nation needs your gifts a part from anything wanted to be able to come here and speak with you this afternoon because you are young gifted and negro aj in the month of may in the year i for one can think of no more dynamic combination that a person might be you are after all the product of a presently insurgent and historically vivacious and heroic culture a culture of an indomitable will for freedom and aspiration to dignity for even though it is not as well known as it should be our people have sustained one of the most heroic resistances to tyranny in the history of man our african ancestors came to the new world fighting slavery by mutiny on the high seas and by suicide the character of slavery itself was defined by the black mans repudiation of his enslavement which he daily did battle with by sabotage work stoppage acts of violence against those who enslaved him and of course most telling of all by running away by the thousands from slavery and when the time came to help give the fatal blow to the slave system our ancestors now by the tens of thousands fell into the ranks of abraham lincolns union army to serve in any way they could to destroy that hideous cancer against human dignity that was the confederacy they served as cooks they served as spies they served as work battalions men and women thousands and thousands of them but above all they served as the most determined fighting soldiers to don the union blue and storm the barricades of the rebel camps and after that war the civil war the negro people and the poor whites of the south sent their own sons for the first time into the halls of congress to represent them and create the finest democratic hour the south and this nation have ever known during the period of the reconstruction for example the free public school system was made available for the first time to the southlandwhereas before only the children of the rich had been able to enjoy the right to education it was against this brief upsurge of democracy for black and white that the bourbon south unleashed the night riderto take away the ballot from the negro and thereby from his poor white brother as well it was against this brief upsurge of equality that slavocrat apologist historians arose across the land to villify and defame the reconstruction and create an image of it that persists to this day and it was against the threat of the return ever again of such an hour of democracy and opportunity for allthat the system of brutality murder and economic intimidation we know today became the instruments used to guarantee the disfranchisement of the black men and degradation of the white men of the south it is this system which prevails today and it is this system that once again shall compel this nation to find better education or be torn asunder once again but apart from all these things apart from this little known and much distorted history of the negros threecentury struggle against oppression in the new worldis the fact of his culture a culture which since the seventeenth century has thrust forward poets and since the nineteenth novelists and journalists contrary to the notion of the quiescent intellectuality of the american black man is the fact that he first began publishing his newspapers in while the greatest of his number were yet in chains he began writing classical verse before america was a nation more important the inflected speech and idiom of our people continue to influence an entire nation as indeed do our everreplenishing dance and music forms continue to dominate our national arts and entertainments and that is why i say that though it be a thrilling and marvelous thing to be merely young and gifted in such times it is doubly so doubly dynamicto be young gifted and black look at the work that awaits you there is a story to be told and retold again until no man can plead his ignorance of the things i have just ripped through in such paltry outline i suppose what i am trying to do is to urge you in an opposite direction from the more fashionable attitudes and vogues of our times there are many who would have you believe that there is something wrong with you as writers if you concern yourselves with anything that i have just put before youwho would try to persuade you that genuine sophistication lies in the realm of the psychoanalytical novel and the absurdist play drawn not from the world as it is but from only your most highly internalized and overdistilled notions of that world i am too young and unwise not to offer advice this afternoonand i caution you as developing writers away from those seductions language symbols spoken and written have permitted man to abstract his awareness of the world and transmit his feelings about it to his fellows that may be the most extraordinary accomplish ment in the universe for all we know and even if it is not it is certainly one of the most wondrous and marvelous things to have happened since our particular group of megatons or whatever either fused or split to make this particular world of ours and it is certainly too important a gift to waste in not using it to the best of ones ability in behalf of the human race write if you will but write about the world as it is and as you think it ought to be and must beif there is to be a world write about not only exotic disappointments but ordinary ones write about the sitins write about the lady who bored you on the airplane write about how the stars seem viewed from earth write about love write about hatred pride jealousy in short write about all the things that men have written about since the beginning of writing and talking and write to a pointand dont pretend that you are being modern when you cant find what the point in what you have written is throw that thing away and start over with honesty write work hard at it care about it eschew the unstructured and the undisciplined and the pointless no matter what anyone tells youthey are cheap evasions of art and write about our people tell their story leave the convoluted sex preoccupations to the convoluted you have something glorious to draw on begging for attention use it one day several years ago mrs rosa parks refused to move to the back of the bus in montgomery alabama and gave the whole nation something to talk aboutand write about dont pass it up use it good luck to you the nation needs your gifts perfect them ft lee in enemy territory one doesnt have to be a galbraith to realize how impossible it would be to draw an economic picture of petersburg virginia without having the neighboring army base fort lee dominate the canvas yet if one uses the attitude of its citizens as a gauge he can only conclude that the town has retained its social and political autonomy despite this dependence now this attitude alone is in striking disagreement with the common belief that a town adjacent to a military base is forced to adopt its social customs and standards but petersburg actually goes a step further not only does it refuse to let the army influence its social customs it even tries to exert as much of its own influence as possible over fort lee the primary reason for this attitude lies in the location of the town petersburg is in the southcentral section of a state that is southern in both geographical position and temperament virginia is a state that prides itself on being the cradle of the confederacy a term which to its citizens is synonymous with independencesouthern style that is but it would be an understatement to simply say that virginia is in the south any virginian worth his tobacco or peanuts will tell you virginia is the south and any person who dares question this distinction risks being accused of an ignorance of american history a casual glance at a map is all it takes to prove that geographically this argument is fallacious but historically the virginian is on firm ground when he makes this contention for even the most desultory student of american history is aware that the state supplied many of the leading civilian and military heads of the confederacy general robert e lee made it all too clear that his allegiance to virginia took priority over his american citizenship to strengthen his argument the virginian is quick to point out richmond as the first capital of the confederacy it was at richmond that the illfated government took shape amidst the cheers of the throngs who hailed it as a declaration of independence from the tyrannical government in washington and it was in the richmond area that the once magnificent army of lee its ranks now thinned and illequipped had its final death throes the adventure had begun and ended in virginia the fall of a government however does not erase an image and the proud independent and selfreliant image the virginian had of himself persisted all through the humiliation of reconstruction like a muscle it absorbed this punishment gaining strength in the mere act of resistance until today this strength is boldly manifested in a monolithic resistance to edicts handed down by the federal government from prince edward county to arlington the backyard of the nations capitol this image flaunts itself the key word in virginia is independence its significant that petersburg which lies so close to richmond doesnt consider itself a suburb of that city the distance between the two cities can be traveled in thirty minutes and a community even an hour farther from a city like say chicago would accept the suburban label as a matter of course my first glimpse of the town came at night from the window of a rickety army bus that had picked the group of us up at richmonds byrd airport perhaps the poor first impression it made on me was because of my disappointment at not being shipped overseas immediately after basic training this plus the natural distaste a chicagoan has for any small town was enough to make the shabby buildings shabbier and the dim lights dimmer on the outskirts of town just before we reached the base the bus passed a cemetery few of us were surprised by its immense size but its unkempt appearance was enough to shock even the most complacent among us gravestones ran right up to the edge of the highway sitting there in a grotesque fashion still i could not help but see a poetic quality in having a cemetery serve as a buffer zone between a town of peace and a military installation it was as though it had been placed there as a reminder of the ultimate consequence of war a week passed before i was able to see the town again the intervening time was spent getting myself situated on the base that was to be my home for the next sixteen months fort lee turned out to be as beautiful as a college campus and as unique as the man whose name it bears like most of the military bases close to washington it is a showcase established as a training camp during world war i it has since become a training center for quartermaster officers the buildings are new and strikingly modern in design some even require visitors to remove their shoes before entering the floors can literally be eaten off of the lawns are green and wellkept the athletes and there are many for lee is also a special services center wear letter jackets and the commanding general often wore a red dinner jacket to social functions as my platoon sergeant often told us the quartermaster corps may not be the fightingest outfit in the army but ill be damned if were not the bestdressed lees athletic facilities were the envy of every college on the atlantic seacoast and many were quick to take advantage of them during the college spring vacation of the track team met princeton penn state morgan state winstonsalem and hampton institute lee certainly couldnt have been considered a breather for these schools because three members of the team had also been members of the u s olympic team bo roberson a silver medal winner later became a star halfback in the american football league baseball was the commanding generals pet sport so its not surprising that the baseball field was the best in the area what was surprising was that this small base had four swimming pools while much larger installations were lucky if they had one or two small wonder that when i finally received orders for an overseas assignment i was told that i was at last joining the army as pleasant as life was on the base i was still curious about that town that was a scant three miles away finally on a bright saturday afternoon i boarded the bus that made hourly trips into town it was significant that i remained in my seat near the front once the bus was through the post gate five years before the bus would have stopped after it had passed this gate and the driver would wait patiently until all his brownskinned passengers had movedprobably sullenly to the rear i was enjoying a privilege that certain individuals had risked courtmartial to win we drove past a field i hadnt seen or noticed on my first journey down that broad new highway the many plaques and statues indicated that it was meant to be much more than a park it was in fact a memorial a memorial to the confederatenot union mind yousoldiers who had died in the battle of petersburg later i learned that the gallantry of the union forces hadnt gone entirely unnoticed they had been buried right next to confederate soldiers one magnanimous virginian pointed out a man couldnt ask for a finer resting place i soon discovered that petersburg was full of civil war memorabilia plaques indicated where confederate troops had camped and large xs on sidewalks marked the spots where lee had conferred with his lieutenants it seemed that the city fathers were trying to create the impression that the entire war had been fought in that one small area i was reminded of the story told by a visitor to greece if one were to believe the many plaques and markers found in greek villages he stated then its clear that a handful of greeks nearly annihilated the entire turkish army in their war of fifteen minutes after leaving the base we arrived at our destination the bus station in downtown petersburg had two memorable features first there were the signs over the two doors where the words colored and white had recently been removed the imprints were still visible however perhaps to indicate that at least the ghost of segregation remained the second feature was not only strange but a little disturbing as well it was strange that the majority of the negroes still insisted on using the inferior facilities they had been relegated to during the stations segregated era instead of availing themselves of those in the erstwhile white section this botheredbugged would be a better wordme because i had learned that hundreds of students from nearby virginia state college had satin and picketedat the risk of imprisonmentto end the stations discriminatory practices as one leader of the demonstrations put it it just proves that you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink but one of his colleagues quickly pointed out that the purpose of the demonstrations had not been to force negroes to use the white facilities but to have their right to them recognized by station officials the fact that most of the local negroes refuse to abandon their old patterns of behavior doesnt mean the demonstrations were failures he contended i believe were justified in claiming a victory when the lone negro traveler no longer has to suffer the humiliation of being ordered to use a particular rest room or dining room unfortunately the bus station was the only victory the demonstrators could claim when it had come to the city library and local picnic area the white citizens had followed the example of their neighbors in prince edward county closing the library had obvious effects on citizens of both races but closing the picnic area produced unexpected and rather ludicrous results the petersburg picnic area it had no official name covered a dozen or so acres near the outskirts of the city it consisted of a few patches of seldomcut lawn sand mixed with stones and glass scraggly pine trees and a lake that was too muddy for swimming and where voracious snapping turtles had long ago destroyed the fish yet it offered the white petersburger the pleasure of quiet and negrofree weekends and was therefore considered well worth the tax money spent to maintain it naturally the negroes disagreed with this point of view as unappealing as that plot of land was it was still supported by public ie white and negro tax money and consequently it was the negroes right to decide for themselves whether or not to use the facilities so the inevitable picketing and demonstrating began interestingly enough the negroes were protesting the injustice of the policy rather than an inconvenience for they had always preferred lake jordan an armymaintained resort a mere eight miles from town lake jordans waters were clean and blue well stocked fish not snapping turtles and its picnic area looked like one all this was in addition to the fact that the facilities were available to everyone within a week after the petersburg lakes closing lake jordan officials noted a sharp increase in attendance it was clear to even the casual ist observer what was happening white petersburgers who only a week before had vowed to resist integration forever were flocking to integrated lake jordan this phenomenon could have been predicted from what had been happening at fort lee for years local whites however grudgingly had long been sharing the bases excellent athletic facilities with negroes on sunday afternoons even the lilywrhite restaurants were forsaken by these whites to enjoy an inexpensive dinner at the bases cafeteriaand few of them complained about having to share a table with a negro gi in the usually crowded dining room apparently they viewed segregation as a luxury to be enjoyed only when it was convenient for them since there was so much contact between fort lee and petersburg and since it was obvious that the town needed the base more than the base needed the town one would think that the base would take advantage of this opportunity to change local customs such was not the case instead there was overwhelming evidence that army officials had succumbed to local pressures no other explanation can be given for two service clubs and two noncommissioned officers clubs being maintained when one of each was more than adequate for such a small base no attempt was made to openly bar a particular race from any of the establishments but it was generally understood that a certain place was for us and the other place for them a few negroes ignored this silent decree and insisted on patronizing the white clubs just to assert their right to do so but the majority had little interest in integrating those pleasure spots where the blue grass variety of rock n roll music was a specialty actually the only ones inconvenienced or embarrassed by the system were members of the sizeable group of northernbred whites who had a predilection for a more sophisticated type of jazz occasionally a few of them could be seen cringing in a darkened comer of the negro club listening to the sounds that reminded them of their new york or chicago haunts how far fort lee officials would go to conform to local customs wasnt made clear to me until a certain incident on a hot spring afternoon the occasion was a parade in honor of j lindsay almond then governor of virginia who was touring various military installations in the state those with military experience need not be reminded of the grueling hours the soldier must spend preparing a base for the visit of a dignitary particularly if he is a politician the task was especially distasteful to negro soldiers who knew that almond represented all the social injustice they had encountered in the state it had been governor almondnot senator byrdwho had encouraged monolithic opposition to the supreme courts school desegregation order but the command had been given for everyone to stand tall for the occasion and distasteful as it may have been this order applied to black as well as white the army frowns on boycotts as a clerk in a battalion headquarters i was usually spared the harassment and discomfort of parades this time there were to be no exceptions how i swore as i labored over my scuffed boots and tarnished brass its at such times that a soldier asks what in hell have parades got to do with winning wars and invariably an old soldier would reply trooper a good soldier never questions orders it has always amazed me how quickly college graduates products of institutions encouraging inquiry adjust to this rigid code its even more amazing how many seem to enjoy having someone make decisions for them could it be that inquiry is often used as a means to escape responsibility if inquiry were a means of escaping anything then i was certainly eligible to be excused because a dozen questions passed through my mind as i stood at attention on the griddlehot parade field i was too angry to be bothered by the boilinghot sun that was baking my helmet and heating the metal on my rifle a few rows behind me i could hear someone whispering his own words to dixie i wish i was in old manhattan where negroes wear just silk and satin run away run away run away from dixieland but i was too engrossed in my thoughts and this spectacle before me to be amused by my comrades levityor bitterness why i asked myself were we being forced to stand at attention while dixie was being played why was the army so concerned about making a good impression on almond why werent any negro dignitaries in the reviewing stands along with the dozens of petty white politicians if it was because the white politicians had requested that none be invited why had the army complied with their wishes was it only the officials at lee who were unaware of the armys position to influence and change social policy or did this ignorance extend all the way up to the top brass since these were silent questions i expected no answers and even if i had had the courage to voice them theres little doubt that they would have been viewed as merely rhetorical questions however an explanation was offered unwittinglyimmediately after the parade units were ordered to pass in review a corporal next to me a young yankee whispered to the staff sergeant directly ahead of him say sarge are we expected to goosestep as we pass the reviewing stands trooper the sergeant replied the important thing in the army is to keep in step that was it the army in its efforts to keep in step with local custom had fallen out of step with the times had i been a hero or a fool i would have shouted this as i marched past the stands but since i considered myself a good soldier i saluted instead the story of the quakers among the most active of all religious groups in the area of civil_rights is the religious society of friends commonly called the quakers surely the quakers have done more for american negroes than has any other group in christendom at a time when it was illegal to provide religious instruction for slaves george fox the founder and leader of the quaker movement wrote about his concern that the enslaved negroes might come to the knowledge of the lord too he admonished slavemasters to treat their slaves mildly and gently and to consider setting them free after certain years of servitude fox had just visited one of his mission outposts in barbados where he had come face to face with the phenomenon of negro slavery for the first time seventeen years later a group of foxs followers in germantown pennsylvania expressed their conviction that human slavery was evil because it violated the golden rule it encouraged adultery and it caused cruel treatment the german friends concluded that slavery should be abolished it was largely by quaker action that pennsylvania began the legal abolition of slavery in nearly a hundred years before lincolns emancipation proclamation and early quakers were among the leaders of the abolitionist movement nationwide valiant antislavery voices in america included those of john greenleaf whittier lucretia mott and levi coffin all quakers coffin vividly described the activities of courageous quakers on behalf of the underground railroad between the slave states and canada with proclamation of the emancipation of the slaves the quakers did not consider their work finished the exslaves were for the most part ignorant untrained and confused quakers were prominent in the formation of freedmens associations which provided for the protection education and practical training of the emancipated negroes in modern times we find that quakers have been active in the formation of such organizations as the national urban league and the national association for the advancement of colored people who are these people the quakers why have they been so concerned about the welfare of negroes both of these questions can be answered satisfactorily by our taking a look at the history and basic convictions of the quakers first of all let us understand that quaker wa not the name which members of the group took upon themselves at first in fact for many decades after the appear ance of the movement it had no name there is no evidence that george fox intended to form a separate religious body born into the family of an english weaver in fox was a very serious and conscientious child as he grew up he became more and more unfavorably impressed by the formalism and irrelevance of the prevalent religions and soon left home to find a more vital dynamic faith the conviction unfolded within young fox that all christiansnot only the officially ordained clergymenwere priests who could speak directly with god from the depths of his newfound living faith fox began preaching in not only did he speak in churches but also in barns at market crosses and wherever else the opportunity presented itself by fox had followers by he had over the actions and way of life of the early quakers followed naturally and logically from their beliefs fox preached that every christian could hold mystic communion directly with god the spirit of love and truth therefore ordained ministers and forms of worship were unnecessary anyone believed the quakers could be guided by the holy spiritan inward spirit or inner lightif he would sit quietly and shut the world from his thoughts in the sight of god preached fox and his followers every man woman and child was equal and sacred by acceptance of these basic tenets every quaker found himself on what a later american quaker john woolman called the damascus road whereon he became aware of the concerns o the spiritual life and the drawing of the supreme spirit god soon he found himself on the jerusalem road which required a quickened conscience and a complete commitment to the holy life next came the jericho road the one on which he was called to action and service on behalf of his faith finally said woolman the quaker reached the erasmus road the way of true christian fellowship the followers of fox refused to take their hats off before judges or even kings feeling that you was too formal a title to be used among equals they addressed each other as thee because they believed that there was that of god in every man they absolutely refused to bear arms against another human or even to sue a neighbor because they felt that legal oaths implied a double standard of truth the quakers refused to make them the story is told of a modern quaker who was called to testify in court as he mounted the witness stand the judgeknowing the man to be a quakerasked him do you swear or affirm neither replied the qauker i tell the truth very well said the judge you may proceed such an attitude of tolerance might very well mark officials toward quakers in midtwentieth century america but it most assuredly did not characterize the views of the seventeenth century english officials what the quakers were telling the churchstate of england was in effect that it was wrong that its theology and ritual meant nothing that men did not have to attend steeplehouses to worship god and that it was evil to pay taxes in support of the state church of england certainly the group was not looked upon with favor from the time of their appearance the quakers were the objects of almost continuous persecution which they endured with almost incredible patience and courage in contrast with the other disapproved sects in england the quakers never met secretly for worship they always insisted that it vas a christian duty to meet openly no matter what the consequences many hundreds of them were imprisoned because of their refusal to attend the services of or pay tithes for the support of the recognized churches and especially for their steadfast refusal to take the governmentrequired oaths of supremacy and loyalty while being tried in derby england george fox admonished the presiding judge to quake with fear of the lord contemptuously the magistrate called fox a quaker and the epithet has been used ever since it was not until almost years after their appearancethat the group the quakers first referred to themselves as the religious society of friends which is to this day the formal name of the group the earlyday quakers fared little better in america than they did in england of all the early american colonies only rhode island at first welcomed the quakers in all the other colonies they were whipped deported hanged and in other ways persecuted some of the quaker women were even accused of being witches in the first american martyrs to the quaker cause william robinson and marmaduke stephenson were hanged on boston common mary dyer a quaker woman had been twice banished from boston but had returned with stephenson and robinson she had been sentenced to die with them too but was reprieved at the very last moment she was deported but returned to boston a year later insisting upon martyrdom as she ascended the gallows she was told she would be freed if she promised to leave massachusetts and never return nay she replied i cannot it was a windy day and after the execution a witness pointed to the body and exclaimed look she flies there like a flag when englands king charles ii heard of the heinous execution he was outraged and commanded the massachusetts authorities to stop killing quakers but to deport them to england the mary dyer execution was one of several events that led finally to englands toleration act of and the end of quaker historys long period of horror less than two years later george fox died it seems that with the passing of the toleration act and the demise of george fox quaker zeal began to wane and die no longer did the friends feel impelled to go out into the world and rid it of evils instead they began to turn in upon themselves they developed and enforced ever more rigid codes of discipline on the society music art pleasure and the marrying of nonquakers were all strictly forbidden scrupulous honesty sobriety and punctuality were demanded quaker dress and speech became painfully plain during this timefrom to the quakers grew more and more different and dour indeed they became a peculiar people and they lost many members while gaining very few however respect for quaker education and philanthropy grew deeper and stronger and the ardent activities of the quakers for prison reform and the abolition of slavery began to take effect william penn a convert to quakerism established the model american colony pennsylvania and built its model capital city philadelphia he made with the indians what has been called the only treaty never sworn to and never broken the quakers treated the indians like dignified and intelligent sons of god and the indians reacted in kind during the years in which the quakers controlled pennsylvania and philadelphia the colony was never raided by the indians too it was unequaled in prosperity and in the excellence of its hospitals and educational institutions in the quakers stepped down and out of power in the city and colony when the demand was made upon them to pay a tax to finance a war against the shawnees and the delawares modem quakers belong to several divisions called meetings of the society of friends in complete contrast to every other group in christendom traditional quakerism has no formulated creed demanding definite subscription no liturgy priesthood or outward sacrament and no inequality between men and women in the organization though the friends have no written creed their beliefs generally agree with those of other protestants some are as liberal theologically as unitarians while others are as conservative as southern baptists most quakers study the bible placing special emphasis upon its moral teachings probably all of the friends insist that the bible is only a part of the continuing revelation of the divine spirit to man all quakerslib eral or conservative modernist or fundamentalistshare the doctrine of the inner light the divine spirit within every human being in the early days of quaker history all meetings for worship were silent or unprogrammed the members would gather in the severely plain meetinghouse and would sit in silence until some member felt moved to speak many of the friends still prefer the silent meeting however there are modern quaker groups that have paid ministers organs choirs and orders of worship their services are hardly distinguishable from those of presbyterian congregational methodist and other oldline protestant congregations and there are friends churches that conduct revivals and crusades as diligently as ultrafundamentalist baptists methodists and pentecostalists modern friends have kept alive the traditional quaker emphasis in education philanthropy and social justice for more than two centuries american quakers have sought ways of agreement by which they could approach the social problems with which they were concerned not only have the friends labored for better race relations but also for religious liberty the cause of peace temperance prison reform and care of the mentally ill throughout all their history the friends have sought first to achieve the new higher social order within the individual then in the meeting and thereafter to create it in their community and nation probably the most effective instrument of the modern quakers has been the american friends service committee the committee was formed in by members of most of the quaker meetings in america to care for the innocent victims of the war with a small group of paid workers and trained volunteers and relying heavily on local help and resources the afsc carries out an extensive program of relief and reconstruction in times of peace the committee maintains centers and work camps in europe and latin america as well as in underprivileged areas of the united states it is extremely active in the humanitarian works of resettling immigrants slum clearance and the improvement of housing it also collects repairs cleans and distributes large amounts of clothing in the american friends service committee shared with the british friends service council the nobel peace prize for worldwide labors for the cause of brotherhood the quakers have come a long way no longer are they merely a peculiar people who refuse to fight avoid politics and require absolute simplicity in speech manner and dress the modern quakers in america support registered representatives in washington dc and have produced a president herbert hoover and a vicepresident richard m nixon as well as untold scores of our countrys leading educators philanthropists men of letters and men of medicine rather than passively frowning on war the friends have sought ways to alleviate it many have rendered invaluable noncombatant service to their country in times of strife and a few have even fought in wars thus we see that the quaker concern for the negro has been and is but a part of a much larger picturethe vision in the heart of every friend of a world wherein there is peace and goodwill towards all men a fantasy the civil_rights bill of had been extremely weak when compared to the one that confronted congress in the new bill had been before the legislative body for almost a year and the filibustered were still going strong on both sides of the fence pro and con tempers were growing short it seemed to be just a matter of time before the negro revolution would change from passive resistance to a violent offensive the president had appeared on television numerous times in efforts to calm this explosive situation but his words were not enough and russia sat like a giant buzzard waiting to pick clean the bones of a nation that could die from the cancer of violence such was the state of things when it first appeared all the residents of the little town where it arrived had been evacuated and were virtually being held prisoners in an area cordoned off by a regiment of soldiers only a select group of scientists military men and important political figures was allowed to roam freely in the town all reporters were barred from entering and none of the select group was permitted to discuss the matter outside of the immediate area not even those who first observed it were exactly sure of the time it had arrived they only knew that it had come somewhere between midnight and am on the fateful morning of december investigation subsequent to its arrival allowed that one frank garvey night porter at the markus building was probably the first person to observe it after vigorously shaking his head to dispel any visual illusions he had run down the street to the all nitery biterya restaurant owned by frederick fred jacoby since fred was entirely familiar with the amount and consistency of frank garveys drinking a full half hour elapsed before he finally realized that frank was not in the clutches of delirium tremens at exactly six oclock fred stepped outside and looked what he saw sent him scrambling back to the telephone it was freds telephone call that eventually brought the horde of scientists military men and important political figures swarming to the town the military soon after arriving placed fred frank and all other eye witnesses under guard to keep them away from newspapermen and television owing to the rapidity of the exodus and to the removal of all eye witnesses the remaining residents did not really know why theyd been evacuated the fact that many carefully avoided all contact with their neighbors resulted from a rumor that mr jones mcklinin the used car dealer had contracted and spread a deadly tropical disease there were those who broke through the military cordon and fled to the woods in the belief that all populated areas were to be devastated by negro pilots who had stolen giant aircraft equipped with nuclear bombs but by the second day the facts began to emerge newspapers around the world carried the story on their front pages in germany herr grantz dropped his prized beer stein when he heard the news over his radio and tokedasan in japan bit the ends off his favorite chopsticks when he opened his newspaper the occurrence carried such impact that the possibility of an american race war was momentarily averted by evening of the second day even the aborigines in australia knew that an alien space ship was hovering over america the space ship did not whirl twirl nor spin it did not move backwards forward or sidewards it just hung there motionless nine hundred feet from the ground measurements by highly accurate scientific equipment showed that its altitude and position did not vary from day to day military and scientific aircraft equipped with cameras flew above below and beside the space ship the photographs that were taken received close study from a highly trained group of scientists but nothing of value was disclosed however reports from pilots of various aircraft revealed one significant fact on the upper right side of the otherwise unbroken surface of the space ship was a round sliding panel about three feet in diameter the angle at which it was located prevented those on the ground from photographing it through telescopic lens at irregular intervals the panel would rapidly slide open and shut as yet no aircraft had been lucky enough to snap a picture when it was open on the third day the panel slid open and shut at least fourteen times it was on this day that professor v c swainer a scientist began fiddling with the dials of a radio that sat on the counter of the all nitery bitery the group had selected the restaurant as a sort of headquarters for their activities therefore many heads swiveled toward professor swainer when he tuned in on the frequency of the towns radio station for a high metallic voice was blaring from the instrument repeating the same two sentences over and over i wish to communicate with the president you can contact me on this frequency i wish to communicate with the president you can contact me on this frequency iwishtocommunicatewiththepresidentyou there was complete silence in the restaurant as each highly trained mind assessed the repeated statements silence reigned as each scientist military man and important political figure reached the logical conclusion the silence persisted as each man accepted the conclusion in relation to the space ship outside the alien was speaking then professor swainer dropped his coffee cup and the silence was broken tables were overturned chairs kicked over and military shoe shines were ruined forever as men scrambled for the radio on the counter for telephones for radio transmitters and in some cases for safety itself one hour later everything was set communications with the space ship had been established then reestablished on a different secret frequency the president was standing by on a direct telephone line from the town to the white house fearing for the chief executives safety in such a strange situation his advisors had suggested that all information from the alien be relayed to the president via telephone at precisely ten minutes past two the alien began speaking through relay to the president of the united states of america no one except the select group of scientists military men and important political figures will ever know exactly what was said during that strange executive conference for the entire text of the conversation has never been made public but some facts were revealed at six oclock that same day when the president spoke over a a world wide hookup of radio and television my fellow americans and citizens of the world today has been one of the strangest and most important of my life we of this earth have long wondered if life exists out there among the stars we have long wondered if god in his wisdom saw fit to create other men on distant planets we have long wondered if such men would be compatible with our own world if they would have human characteristics if they would come in war or peace we need no longer wonder today i talked with such a man the president went on to explain that only one alien was on board the ship it had come as a sort of advance scout for the group that would eventually follow the alien he explained had not yet come out from the space ship because the atmosphere was slightly different from that of its own planet however after a period of adjustment it would be able to breathe the air without harmful effects thus the sliding panel in the side of the ship was enabling the alien to gradually become used to earths atmosphere the president continued there is no need to speculate on the intellect of these people the fact that they sent a space ship here shows their intelligence is far advanced when compared to ours i was informed that the customs languages policies and systems of governments on this earth have been under surveillance for years the president paused then looked steadily at the camera as he resumed speaking i was also informed that these people have concluded that we on earth will destroy each other if there is no outside intervention for reasons which were not told me they decided to intervene in so doing they further decided to support and expand the principles philosophies and government of the nation which is most similar to their own after years of study the nation of their choice is the united states of america in the wake of this news there were of course many reactions the russian news organs proclaimed that this is another devious capitalistic scheme to threaten the soviet union and all other good peoples of peace loving nations in a rabid rage red china swore that vile vicious warmongering lies will not deter us from our chosen objectives below the cotton curtain the misdirection of southern intelli gence resulted in the deduction that the aliens have studied all facets of ouah society and have ahproved all that white america has done therefoah they have studied segregation and found that it is propah in foreign lands american diplomats aurgued that in view of the aliens superiority it is apparent that we must do whatever they decree lest we ourselves be destroyed on the morning of the fourth day it was by the sheerest luck that captain gregory parrin veered in on the space ship and snapped a picture at the exact moment the panel slid open he himself did not realize that he had captured the interior of the ship on film more important he had photographed the alien within thirty minutes after the picture was taken captain parrin landed his aircraft it wasnt until three hours later that an excited group rushed a copy of the photograph to the white house only one half hour elapsed before the president again looked out on an international audience from the television screen dispensing with all preliminaries and formalities he began speaking immediately during the past days all of us have no doubt wondered what the being on board the space ship looks like perhaps we expected little green men with horns or some other monstrosity but this is not the case as we all know when god made us he made us in his image it is now apparent that when he made other men on other planets he abided by the same rule i have in my hand a picture of our visitor i am happy to say that he is not really alien at all though he is super intelligent he is just another man like you or me here is his picture the cameras focused on the enlarged photograph that the president held up for all to see it showed a man that was bare from the waist up it also showed that he was fair skinned blond haired and blue eyed two thirds of the worlds population viewed that picture with apprehension the question of whether it had anything to do with the sudden defeat of the civil_rights bill in congresswith the bloody uprisings of africans in various colonies with the vicious attack on the u s zone in panama or with the sudden sneak attack on russia by the chineseis now academic practically the whole world was in turmoil on the fifth day that day the space ship descended for two hours it sat on the ground unopened in the small town the ban on newsmen and television was lifted reporters and cameramen vied for the most advantageous positions even the president surrounded by security guards journeyed to the town and waited to greet the alien the word flashed around the globe and all fighting ceased at the end of those two hours men everywhere where sitting in suspense waiting and watching all talk and noisy speculations were halted by a high whining noise as a door in the space ship swung slowly open when the alien stepped forth mens breath caught in their throats as they gaped in astonishment only then did they remember that its picture had been taken in profile for the side of its body that resembled a fair skinned blond haired viking warrior blended in perfectly with the other side that resembled a black skinned curly haired african king the eyes of the world were upon it and its blue eye and brown eye stared back at the world by thomas merton if i dare to imagine that these letters may have some significance for both of us it is because i believe that christianity is concerned with human crises since christians are called to manifest the mercy and truth of god in history christianity is the victory of christ in the world that is to say in history it is the salvation of man in and through history through temporal decisions made for love of christ the redeemer and lord of history the mystery of christ is at work in all human events and our comprehension of secular events works itself out and expresses itself in that sacred history the history of salvation which the holy spirit teaches us to read between the lines we have to admit that this meaning is often provisional and sometimes beyond our grasp yet as christians we are committed to the attempt to see some meaning in temporal events that flow from human choices to be specific we are bound to search his tory that is to say the intelligible actions of men for some indications of their significance and some relevance to our present choice as christians history then is for us that complex of meanings which we read into the interplay of acts and decisions that make civilization and we are also this is more urgent still at a turning point in the history of that european and american society which has been shaped and dominated by christian concepts even where it has at times been unfaithful to its basically christian vocation we live in a culture which seems to have reached the point of extreme hazard at which it may plunge to its own ruin unless there is some renewal of life some new direction some providential reorganization of its forces for survival at present in a worldwide struggle for power which is entirely pragmatic if not cynically unprincipled the claims of those who appeal to their christian antecedents as justification for their struggle to maintain themselves in power are being judged by the events which flow from their supposedly christian choices for example we belong to a nation which prides itself on being free and relates this freedom to its source in christian theology our freedom rests on respect for the rights of the human person and though our society is not officially christian this respect for the person can be traced to the christian concept that every man is to be regarded as christ and treated as christ briefly then we justify our policies whether national or international by the implicit postulate that we are supremely concerned with the human person and his rights we do this because our ancestors regarded every man as christ and wished to treat him as christ or at least believed this to be the right way to act even though they did not always follow this belief now if we advance this claim and base our decisions and choices upon it we must not be surprised if the claim itself comes under judgment if we assert that we are the guardians of peace freedom and the rights of the person we may expect other people to question this demanding from time to time some evidence that we mean what we say commonly they will look for that evidence in our actions and if our actions do not fit our words they will assume that we are either fools deceiving ourselves or liars attempting to deceive others our claims to highminded love of freedom and our supposed defense of christian and personalist ideals are going to be judged we believe not only by other men but above all by god at times we are perhaps rashly inclined to find this distinction reassuring we say to ourselves god at least knows our sincerity he does not suspect us as our enemies do he sees the reality of our good intentions i am sure he sees whatever reality is there but are we absolutely certain that he judges our intentions exactly as we do let me cite an example our defense policies and the gigantic arms race which they require are all based on the supposition that we seek peace and freedom not only for ourselves but for the whole world we claim to possess the only effective and basically sincere formula for world peace because we alone are truly honest in our claim to respect the human person for us the person and his freedom with his basic rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness comes absolutely first therefore the sincerity and truth of all our asserted aims at home and abroad in defense and in civil affairs is going to be judged by the reality of our respect for persons and for their rights the rest of the world knows this very well we seem not to have realized this as well as they another example we claim that we are really solicitous for the rights of the negro and willing to grant him these rights some time or other we even insist that the very nature of our society is such that the negro as a person is precisely what we respect the most our laws declare that we are not simply a society which tolerates the presence of the negro as a second class citizen of whom we would prefer to rid ourselves altogether if we only could they assert that since the negro is a person he is in every way equal to every other person and our religion adds that what we do to him we do to christ since we are a free society based on respect for the dignity of the human person as taught to the world by christianity how then do we treat this other christ this person who happens to be black first if we look to the south which is plentifully supplied not only with negroes but also with professed christian believers we discover that belief in the negro as a person is accepted only with serious qualifications while the notion that he is to be treated as christ has been completely overlooked it would not be easy for a christian to mutilate another man string him up on a tree and shoot him full of holes if he believed that what he did to that man was done to christ on the contrary he must somehow imagine that he is doing this to the devilto prevent the devil doing it to him but in thinking such thoughts a christian has abdicated from christianity and has implicity rejected that basic respect for the rights of the person on which free society depends from then on anything such a man may say about christianity or freedom has lost all claims to rational significance only with the greatest unwillingness have some very earnest southern christians under duress accepted the painful need to ride in the same part of public conveyances with negroes eat at the same lunch counters use the same public facilities and there are still not a few of these christians who absolutely refuse to worship christ in the same congregations as negroes even some catholics have refused to receive the body of christ together with negroes in sacramental communion and they have been astonished to find themselves excommunicated officially for refusing integrated schools when in point of fact they had already by their own action manifestly excommunicated themselves acting purely and simply as schismatics rending the unity of the body of christ nevertheless the inner conflicts and contradictions of the south are not to be taken as a justification for the smugness with which the north is doing just as poor a job if not a worse job of defending the negros rights as a person the race problem is something which the southerner cannot escape almost half the population of the south is negro though there are greater concentrations of negroes in northern slums yet northern negroes can be treated as if they were not there at all for years new yorkers have been able to drive to westchester and connecticut without going through harlem or even seeing it except from a distant freeway the abuses thus tolerated and ignored are sometimes as bad and worse than anything in the south it is clear that our actual decisions and choices with regard to the negro show us that we are not in fact interested in the rights of several million persons who are members and citizens of our society and are in every way loyal americans they pay taxes fight for the country and do as well as anybody else in meeting their responsibilities and yet we tolerate shameful injustices which deprive them by threats and by actual violence of their right to vote and to participate actively in the affairs of the nation here i can see you will protest you will point to the supreme court decisions that have upheld negro rights to education in integrated colleges and schools it seems to me that our motives are judged by the real fruit of our decisions what have we done we have been willing to grant the negro rights on paper even in the south but the laws have been framed in such a way that in every case their execution has depended on the good will of white society and the white man has never failed when left to himself to block or obstruct or simply forget the necessary action without which the rights of the negro cannot be enjoyed in fact hence when laws have been passed and then contested and then dragged through all the courts and then finally upheld the negro is still in no position to benefit by them without in each case entering into further interminable lawsuits every time he wants to exercise a right that is guaranteed to him by law in effect we are not really giving the negro a right to live where he likes eat where he likes go to school where he likes or work where he likes but only to sue the white man who refuses to let him do these things if every time i want a coca cola i have to sue the owner of the snack bar i think i will probably keep going to the same old places in my ghetto that is what the negro until recently has done such laws are without meaning unless they reflect a willingness on the part of white society to implement them you will say you cant legislate morality that phrase may be quite true in its proper context but here it is a question not of morality but of a social system if we have got to the point where the laws are frequently if not commonly framed in such a way that they can be easily evaded by a privileged minority then the very structure of our society comes into question if you are responsible for legislation that has only a dubious value and if as a result the authority of law itself begins to be questioned then you are partly to blame for the disorders and the confusion resulting from civil disobedience and contempt of law i think there is possibly some truth in the accusation that we are making laws simply because they look nice on the books having them there we can enjoy the comfort of pointing to them reassuring our own consciences convincing ourselves that we are all that we claim to be and refuting the vicious allegations of hostile critics who question the sincerity of our devotion to freedom but at the same time when our own personal interests and preferences are concerned we have no intention of respecting the negros rights in the concrete north or south integration is always going to be not on our street but somewhere else that perhaps accounts for the extraordinary zeal with which the north insists upon integration in the south while treating the northern negro as if he were invisible flatly refusing to let him take shape in full view lest he demand the treatment due to a human person and a free citizen of this nation that is why the negro now insists on making himself just as obviously visible as he possibly can that is why he demonstrates he has come to realize that the white man is not interested in the rights of the negro but in the white mans own spiritual and material comfort if then by making himself visible the negro can finally disturb the white mans precious peace of soul then by all means he would be a fool not to do so yet when we are pressed and criticized and when the negros violated rights are brought up before us we stir ourselves to renewed efforts at legislation we introduce more bills into congress knowing well enough how much chance those bills have of retaining any real significance after they have finally made it if they make it at all the negro finally gets tired of this treatment and becomes quite rightly convinced that the only way he is ever going to get his rights is by fighting for them himself but we deplore his demonstrations we urge him to go slow we warn him against the consequences of violence when at least so far most of the organized violence has been on our side and not on his at the same time we secretly desire violence and even in some cases provoke it in the hope that the whole negro movement for freedom can be repressed by force i do not claim to be either a prophet or even a historian i do not profess to understand all the mysteries of political philosophy and i am thank god not a sociologist but i question whether our claims to be the only sincere defenders of the human person of his rights of his dignity of his nobility as a creature made in gods image as a member of the mystical christ can be substantiated by our actions it seems to me that we have retained little more than a few slogans and concepts that have been emptied of reality it seems to me that we have little genuine interest in human liberty and in the human person what we are interested in on the contrary is the unlimited freedom of the corporation when we call ourselves the free world we mean first of all the world in which business is free and the freedom of the person comes only after that because in our eyes the freedom of the person is dependent on money that is to say without money freedom has no meaning and therefore the most basic freedom of all is the freedom to make money if you have nothing to buy or sell freedom is in your case irrelevant in other words what we are really interested in is not persons but profits our society is organized first and foremost with a view to business and wherever we run into a choice between the rights of a human person and the advantages of a profitmaking organization the rights of the person will have difficulty getting a hearing profit first people afterward you ask me indignantly to confirm these vicious allegations it appears that the one aspect of the negro demonstrations that is being taken most seriously in the south is that they hurt business as long as there was talk only of rights and of freedom concepts which imply persons the negro movement was taken seriously chiefly by crackpots idealists and members of suspicious organizations thought to be under direct control of moscow like the naacp but still all this talk of negro rights especially when accompanied by hymnsinging and religious exhortations could hardly be taken seriously it was only when money became involved that the negro demonstrations finally impressed themselves upon the american mind as being real we claim to judge reality by the touchstone of christian values such as freedom thought the spirit faith personalism etc in actual fact we judge them by commercial values sales money price profits it is not the life of the spirit that is real to us but the vitality of the market spiritual values are to us in actual fact meaningless unless they can be reduced to terms of buying and selling but buying and selling are abstract operations money has no ontological reality it is a pure convention admittedly it is a very practical one but it is in itself completely unreal and the ritual that surrounds money transactions the whole liturgy of marketing and of profit is basically void of reality and of meaning yet we treat it as the final reality the absolute meaning in the light of which everything else is to be judged weighed evaluated priced thus we end up by treating persons as objects for sale and therefore as meaningless unless they have some value on the market a man is to us nothing more nor less than what he is worth he is known to us as a reality when he is known to be solvent by bankers otherwise he has not yet begun to exist our trouble is that we are alienated from our own personal reality our true self we do not believe in anything but money and the power or the enjoyment which come from the possession of money we do not believe in ourselves except in so far as we can estimate our own worth and verify by our operations in the world of the market that our subjective price coincides with what society is willing to pay for us and the negro he has so far been worth little or nothing until quite recently there was no place for him in our calculations unless perhaps we were landlordsunless we had real estatein harlem that of course was another matter because the negro was really quite profitable to us and yet we did not think of profit as coming to us from the beings of flesh and blood who were crowded into those rooms on the contrary it came to us from the only thing that was realour estate the negro was so shadowy so unreal that he was nothing more than the occasion for a series of very profitable transactions which gave us a good solid reality in our own eyes and in the eyes of our society but now suddenly we have discovered that there are also some real negroes for them to be real they must have the same kind of reality as ourselves reality is estimated in terms of financial worth and so we discover that there are a few negroes who have money why has this rich negro suddenly earned the grace of our benevolent attention because he is a person because he has brains because of the fantastic talents which alone could enable him to be a professional success against such inhuman odds none of this it is now to our interest to recognize him because we can use him against the others so now when the negro claims he wants to take his full part in american society as a person we retort you already are playing your part as a person negroes over the years we now declare have had a rapid rise in income a nice vague statement but it satisfies the mind of anyone who believes in money large numbers of negroes drive highpriced cars another beautiful act of faith but here we come with exact figures it is estimated that there are now thirtyfive negro millionaires in the united states what are these statements supposed to mean simply that there is no need for the negro to make such a fuss to demonstrate to fight for recognition as a person he has received that recognition already thirtyfive negroes are millionaires thirtyfive out of twenty million large numbers drive highpriced cars what more do you want these are indications that the negro has all he needs for he has opportunities he can make money and thus become real what opportunities even though a negro millionaire may live in a fine residential neighborhood he is still living in a ghetto when he moves in the whites move out the neighborhood is taken over by negroes and even if they are millionaires their presence means that a neighborhood is no longer fine for a white man it is no longer even residential so that even when he is worth a million a negro cannot buy himself in the land of the free the respect that is given to a human person doubtless the mercy and truth of god the victory of christ are being manifested in our current history but i am not able to see how they are manifested by us a little time perhaps only a few more months and we will realize that we have reached a moment of unparalleled seriousness in american history indeed in the history of the world the word revolution is getting around accepted at first with tolerance as a pleasantly graphic figure of speech it is going to be regarded with more and more disapproval because it comes too near to the truth and why what is a revolution what does it mean to say that the negros struggle for full civil_rights amounts to a revolution i much as it might distress southerners the fact that a negro may now sit down next to a white woman at a snack bar and order a sandwich is still somewhat short of revolution and if by dint of courageous and effective protest the negroes who have a vote in deep southern states should actually manage to cast their votes on election day without getting shot that in itself does not make a revolution though it may have something radically new about it the question is who will they be voting for ross barnett yet i have often thought there is something true as well as sinister in the usual conservative claim to realism we must admit that the southern politicians are much more fully aware of the revolutionary nature of the situation than are those northern liberals who blithely suppose that somehow the negroes both north and south will gradually and noiselessly fit in to white society exactly as it is with its affluent economy the mass media its political machines its professional thoughtlessness and its middle class suburban folkways we seem to think that when the negroes of the south really begin to use their largely hypothetical right to vote they will be content with the same candidates who were up last year and the year before if those candidates themselves were under any such illusion they would long since have done something that would get them the negro votes in point of fact the southern politicians realize very well that if the negroes turn out full force to vote and thereby establish themselves as a factor to be reckoned with in southern politics the political machines of the past are going to collapse in a cloud of dust to put it succinctly if the southern negro is really granted the rights which are guaranteed to him de jure by the american constitution and if he fully and freely exercises those rights it is all up with the old south there are quite enough negroes in the south to make any really free election catastrophic for the status quo and negroes both south and north are not going to waste time voting for people who sic police dogs on them and drench them with high pressure fire hoses while occasionally lobbing bombs onto their front porches for good measure so much for the south but what about the north northern negroes are already able to put some of their own men into office but this is only the beginning of what is suddenly becoming a very conscious and concerted drive for real political power this drive is going to be more and more accelerated by the problem of jobs with five million unemployed officially acknowledged in with no indications other than that this figure must grow and with repeated strikes and protests in which negroes demand to be hired along with whites there is going to be violent conflict over the limited number of jobs with the best will in the world nobody is going to be able to give jobs to negroes without taking them away from whites and there is no indication at the moment that the whites intend to retire en masse and spend the rest of their lives watching tv so that the negroes may carry on the work and collect the paychecks of the nation this represents whether we like it or not a radical threat to our present systema revolutionary situation and furthermore it accentuates the already clearly defined racial lines dividing the two sides in the conflict this means that the negro is going to continue to be what he has decidedly become aggressively aware of the power and impact on white society of mere threat of revolutionary violence the negro himself is in the presence of a social structure which he has reason to consider inherently unjust since it has never done him any real justice except in fair words and promises he also sees that this society has suddenly become extremely vulnerable the very agitation and confusion which greet his demands are to him indications of guilt and fear and he has very little respect for exhortations to go slow and be patient he feels he has been patient for a very long time and that anyone who cannot see this for himself is not being honest about it he also feels that there is no hope of any action being taken unless he takes action himself and that the steps taken by the government are mere political maneuvers leading nowhere this means that a wellmeaning liberal policy of compromises and concessions striving at the same time to placate the negro and to calm the seething indignation of the conservative whites is not going to avert danger it may on the contrary aggravate it hence the realism again of the conservatives who think that the only thing is to stop violence now by the full use of all the repressive agenciespolice national guard armywhich they themselves still fully control after all the traditional line of thought of those who use repressive power to defend the status quo is that they are justified in applying force to prevent a chaotic and explosive outbreak of revolutionary disorder save many lives protect property especially their own of course and maintain a semblance of national identity which would otherwise be dissolved in blood needless to say this is identical with the argument which revolutionaries themselves advance for repressing all resistance once they themselves have achieved their aim and have seized full power now my friend here is your situation you the wellmeaning liberal are right in the middle of all this confusion you are in fact a political catalyst on the one hand with your good will and your ideals your fine hopes and your generous but vague love of mankind in the abstract and of rights enthroned on a juridicial olympus you offer a certain encouragement to the negro and you do right my only complaint being that you are not yet right enough so that abetted by you he is emboldened to demand concessions though he knows you will not support all his demands he is well aware that you will be forced to support some of them in order to maintain your image of yourself as a liberal he also knows however that your material comforts your security and your congenial relations with the establishment are much more important to you than your rather volatile idealism and that when the game gets rough you will be quick to see your own interests menaced by his demands and you will sell him down the river for the five hundredth time in order to protect yourself for this reason as well as to support your own selfesteem you are very anxious to have a position of leadership and control in the negros fight for rights in order to be able to apply the brakes when you feel it necessary this is why the negro emphatically rejects you now he does not want you in his way you are more a nuisance than anything else and you offended at this lack of appreciation want to reassure the negroyou are really on his side and to prove it you will help him to get just a little more you will be satisfied with the headlines you will once again feel cozy with your liberal imagefor a few days thus you make it possible for him according to the fantasies of conservative thought to taste blood and conservative thought is not always deluded in its choice of metaphors on the other hand when you come face to face at last with concrete reality and take note of some unexpected and unlovely aspects of what you have hitherto considered only in the abstract you yourself are going to be a very frightened mortal you are going to see that there are more than ideas and ideals involved in this struggle it is more than a matter of images and headlines and you are going to realize that what has begun is not going to be stopped but that it will lead on into a future for which the past perhaps offers little or no precedent but since it is one of the characteristics of liberals that they prefer their future to be vaguely predictable just as the conservative prefers only a future that reproduces the past in all its details when you see that the future is entirely out of your hands and that you are totally unprepared for it you are going to fall back on the past and you are going to end up in the arms of the conservatives indeed you will be so much in their arms that you will be in their way and will not improve the shooting these are frank and brutal facts my good friend but they are the facts on which you must base your future decisions you must face it this upheaval is going to sweep away not only the old style political machines the quaint relics of a more sanguine era but also a great deal of the managerial sophistication of our own time and your liberalism is likely to go out the window along with a number of other entities that have their existence chiefly on paper and in the head what are you going to do are you going to say that though changes may be desirable in theory they cannot possibly be paid for by a social upheaval amounting to revolution are you going to decide that the negro movement is already out of hand and therefore it must be stopped at any cost even at the cost of ruthless force in that case you are retreating from the unknown future and falling back on a known and familiar alternative namely the alternative in which you who are after all on top remain on top by the use of force rather than admit a change in which you will not necessarily be on the bottom but in which your position as top dog will no longer be guaranteed you will prefer your own security to everything else and you will be willing to sacrifice the negro to preserve yourself but it is precisely in this that you are contributing to the inexorable development of a revolution for revolutions are always the result of situations in which the drive of an underprivileged mass of men can no longer be contained by token concessions and in which the establishment is too confused too inert and too frightened to participate with the underprivileged in a new and creative solution of what is realized to be their common problem this is the case at present in the united states instead of seeing the negro revolution as a manifestation of deep disorder that is eating away the inner substance of our society because it is in ourselves we look at it as a threat from outside ourselvesas a deplorable revolutionary adventure by an understandably dissatisfied minority goaded on by red agitators but this is a totally fanciful view which removes the crisis from the context of reality into a dreamworld of our own in which we proceed to seek a dreamsolution we forget that the negro is there because of us his crisis is the result of our acts and is in fact our crisis our total inability to see this is turning a common political problem into a violent conflict in which there is no possibility of real dialogue and in which the insensate shibboleths of racism drown out all hope of rational solutions when this happens even those whites and negroes who would normally be able to work together to find a common solution will be driven apart and the white man will become the black mans enemy by the mere fact that he is white as martin_luther_king sees so clearly if the negro struggle becomes a violent conflict and this is what would best please the white racists it is bound to fail in its most rational and creative purposethe real vindication of negro rights and the definitive assertion of the negro as a person equal in dignity to any other human person i am convinced he says that if we succumb to be the temptation to use violence in our struggle for freedom unborn generations will be the recipients of a long and desolate night of bitterness our chief legacy to them will be a neverending reign of chaos from strength to love by harper bros in one word there is a serious possibility of an eventual civil war which might wreck the fabric of american society and although the negro revolution in america is now unquestionably nonmarxist and just as unquestionably a completely original and homegrown product of our own there is no doubt that if it resulted in a revolutionary upheaval of american economic and political life there might be a danger of marxist elements capturing the revolution and taking it over in the name of soviet communism remote as it may seem this fits an already familiar pattern and furthermore it has to be considered because it already dominates the minds of the segregationist right wing my question to you is this can you think of a better way of conducting yourself does all profoundly significant social change have to be carried out in violence and with murder destruction police repression and counter repression is it not possible that the whites might give closer attention to the claims of negro leaders like martin_luther_king who assert that they do not want violence and who give every assurance backed up by some rather convincing evidence if you can remember birmingham that the negro is not out to kill anybody that he is really fighting not only for his own freedom but also in some strange way for the freedom of the whites this is a new and quixotic concept to us since we are fully convinced that we are the freest people that ever existed is it true that all change of our present social framework is necessarily a disaster so great that any price can legitimately be paid to keep it from coming about is it not possible that whites and negroes might join together in a creative political experiment such as the world has never yet seen and in which the first condition would be that the whites consented to let the negroes run their own revolution nonviolently giving them the necessary support and cooperation and not being alarmed at some of the sacrifices and difficulties that would necessarily be involved is there no alternative but violent repression in which reluctantly no doubt you decide that it is better for the establishment to be maintained by the exercise of the power which is entirely in white hands and which ought to remain in white hands because they are white because of course negroes are not yet ready for any kind of power this presupposes a simple view of the situation a belief that when the chips are down it is going to be either whites or blacks and since whites have proved their capacity to run the country and keep order it is unthinkable even to permit the possibility of that disorder which you take it for granted would follow if negroes took a leading part in our political life conclusion revolution must be prevented at all costs but demonstrations are already revolutionary ergo fire on the demonstrators ergo at the end of this chain of thought i visualize you my liberal friend goose stepping down massachusetts avenue in the uniform of an american totalitarian party in a mass rally where nothing but the most uproarious approval is manifest except by implication on the part of silent and strangely scented clouds of smoke drifting over from the new camps where the negroes are living in retirement ill how is christianity involved in the negro struggle dr martin_luther_king has appealed to strictly christian motives he has based his nonviolence on his belief that love can unite men even enemies in truth that is to say that he has clearly spelled out the struggle for freedom not as a struggle for the negro alone but also for the white man from the start the nonviolent element in the negro struggle is oriented toward healing the sin of racism and toward unity in reconciliation an absolutely necessary element in this reconciliation is that the white man should allow himself to learn the mute lesson which is addressed to him in the suffering the nonviolent protest the loving acceptance of punishment for the violation of unjust laws which the negro freely and willingly brings down upon himself in the white mans presence in the hope that the oppressor may come to see his own injustice the purpose of this suffering freely sought and accepted in the spirit of christ is the liberation of the negro and the redemption of the white man blinded by his endemic sin of racial injustice in other words the struggle for liberty is not regarded by this most significant sector of the negro population merely as a fight for political rights it is this and it is also much more it is what gandhi called satyagrahaa struggle first of all for the truth outside and independent of specific political contingencies the mystique of negro nonviolence holds that the victory of truth is inevitable but that the redemption of individuals is not inevitable though the truth will win since in christ it has already conquered not everyone can come to the lightfor if his works are darkness he fears to let them be seen the negro children who walked calmly up to the police dogs that lunged at them with a fury capable of tearing their small bodies to pieces were not only confronting the truth in an exalted moment of faith a providential kairos they were also in their simplicity bearing heroic christian witness to the truth for they were exposing their bodies to death in order to show god and man that they believed in the just rights of their people knew that those rights had been unjustly shamefully and systematically violated and realized that the violation called for expiation and redemptive protest because it was an offense against god and his truth they were stating clearly that the time had come where such violations could no longer be tolerated these negro followers of dr_king are convinced that there is more at stake than civic rights they believe that the survival of america is itself in question they believe that the sin of white america has reached such a proportion that it may call down a dreadful judgment perhaps total destruction on the whole country unless atonement is made these negroes are not simply judging the white man and rejecting him on the contrary they are seeking by christian love and sacrifice to redeem him to enlighten him so as not only to save his soul from perdition but also to awaken his mind and his conscience and stir him to initiate the reform and renewal which may still be capable of saving our society but this renewal must be the work of both the white and the negro together it cannot be planned and carried out by the white man alone or even by the negro under the white mans paternal guidance it demands some negro initiative and the white man cannot collaborate fruitfully until he recognizes the necessity of this initiative the negro is not going to be placated with assurances of respect and vague encouragement from our side he is going to make sure that we are listening and that we have understood him before he will believe in our attempts to help the purpose of nonviolent protest in its deepest and most spiritual dimensions is then to awaken the conscience of the white man to the awful reality of his injustice and of his sin so that he will be able to see that the negro problem is really a white problem that the cancer of injustice and hate which is eating white society and is only partly manifested in racial segregation with all its consequences is rooted in the heart of the white man himself only if the white man sees this will he be able gradually to understand the real nature of the problem and take steps to save himself and his society from complete ruin as the negro sees it the cold war and its fatal insanities are to a great extent generated within the purblind guilt ridden selfdeceiving selftormenting and selfdestructive psyche of the white man it is curious that while some southern whites are surrounding their houses with floodlights to protect themselves in case negroes creep up to murder them in the dark all the violence in the south to date has been on the part of the whites themselves barbara deming a white new england woman who demonstrated with the negro children in birmingham was sent to jail with them the jail was of course segregated she was thrown in a cell full of white prostitutes and other delinquents and found them not only furious and hostile towards her but terrified lest the negro children who were still singing hymns after a sublime display of christian heroism might rape and murder them in the jail curious that these white southerners people to be pitied indeed from their halfworld of violence petty thievery vice and addiction were the ones who felt themselves menaced and menaced by the clear eyes of children the truth is that they had very good reason to fear the action of the children was aimed at them and aimed directly at them it was an attack not upon their property their jobs their social status but upon their inmost conscience and unless that attack could be met and deflected these people would not be able to continue as they were in all literal truth if they heard the message of the negro children they would cease to be the people they were they would have to die to everything which was familiar and secure they would have to die to their past to their society with its prejudices and its inertia die to its false beliefs and go over to the side of the negroes for a southern white this would be a real death indeed this is the radical challenge of negro nonviolence today this is why it is a source of uneasiness and fear to all white men who are attached to their security if they are forced to listen to what the negro is trying to say the whites may have to admit that their prosperity is rooted to some extent in injustice and in sin and in consequence this might lead to a complete reexamination of the political motives behind all our current policies domestic and foreign with the possible admission that we are wrong such an admission might in fact be so disastrous that its effects would dislocate our whole economy and ruin the country these are not things that are consciously admitted but they are confusedly present in our thoughts and fears they account for the passionate and mindless desperation with which we plunge this way and that trying to evade the implications of our present crisis unfortunately not all negroes can appreciate the christian foundation of nonviolent action as it is practiced by the followers of dr_king many northern negro leaders and especially the organizers of the black muslim movement categorically reject dr_kings ideas as sentimental they believe that his nonviolence is a masochistic exhibition of defeatism which flatters the whites plays into their hands and degrades the negro still further by forcing him to submit uselessly to violence and humiliation in some cases the sharp criticism of martin_luther_king is carried so far as to accuse him of deliberately and cynically sacrificing his followers in order to get power and prestige for himself in white society this reaction against what is basically a christian protest leads to another extreme a black racism as intransigent and as fanatical as that of the white racists themselves it is true that the black muslims must not be painted as a corporation of devils yet the muslim movement is one of absolutely hostile rejection of all that is white including christianity conceived as the white mans religion instead islam regarded as african religion and as the worship of a black god or at least of the black mans god is substituted for it emphasis is laid on the martial and combative elements in the faith of islam and the first principle of all race relations is that the white man is never to be trusted he is worthy only of hatred and contempt no dialogue is possible between white and black and all that can be achieved is a complete separation their aim is to achieve this separation without violence in so far as this may be possible but they will not hesitate to use violence if this becomes necessary theoretically then the black muslims do not have a systematic program of violent attack on the white population as some seem to imagine but since the separation of which they dream is and can be no more than a dream the tension between the races in the big cities of the north where the muslims are concentrated will undoubtedly produce some violence sooner or later it can be said however that the fact that the muslims are disciplined and organized makes them to some extent an asset they will certainly try to control violence and direct it this is preferable to completely uncontrolled and in some ways uncaused rioting exploding at the slightest spark and spreading in aimless fury through whole cities until its force is spent yet the muslims however disciplined they themselves may be can easily start a general conflagration among other negroes the black muslims have so far had no influence in the south and although the negro spokesmen in the north are often hostile to martin_luther_king he has immense prestige wherever negroes are to be found in the united states though birmingham was not understood by all of them as a victory for their race it seems however that all hope of really constructive and positive results from the civil_rights movement is to be placed in the christian elements it is also possible that as the movement gains in power the reasonableness and the christian fervor of these elements will recede into the background and the movement will become more and more an unreasoning and intransigent mass movement dedicated to the conquest of sheer power more and more inclined to violence if the christian and nonviolent element in negro protest is finally discredited it may mean that christianity itself will become meaningless in negro eyes those negroes who attack their christian leaders in the south are usually completely disillusioned with christianity if not bitterly hostile to it because they are convinced that it has no other function than to keep the negro in passive and helpless submission to his white oppressors when white christians express admiration and sympathy for dr_king this is immediately interpreted by his negro critics as evidence for their own negative thesis as for the attitude of white christians toward the negro freedom movement protestants and catholics alike are at best confused and evasive in their sympathies one gets the impression that they mean well and that they recognize the validity of the negros protest but that they are so out of contact with the realities of the time that they have no idea how they can effectively help him it is true that the american hierarchy has denounced the sin of racism some but not all catholic bishops have taken action to integrate catholic schools or to castigate the worst abuses of discrimination here and there christian leaders get together to make encouraging statements yet at the same time even those white christians most favorable to the negro cause have been quick to react against the protests in birmingham and jackson censuring them and demanding more patience on the negros part sincerely believing that the whole problem can be adequately settled only by the administration in washington this to the negro is more than naive he cannot help but interpret it as evasion and bad faith and consequently he has little or no confidence in any white christian group including the catholic church evidently many white christians will be grieved and disappointed at this evaluation of their sincere concern over the negros struggle for his rights they will remind the negro that they have taken certain steps in his favor they will expect him to be more grateful i think the time has come to say two things about this attitude first of all it shows that they do not grasp the real dimensions of the problem as the negro sees it like the average liberal they think that the negro is simply presenting a few reasonable demands which can be met by legislative action and as a corollary to this they assume that if the negro were to ask any more than this he would be unreasonable if not rebellious in actual fact the negro is not simply asking to be accepted into the white mans society and eventually absorbed by it so that race relations in the us may finally come to be something like those in latin america i think that most catholics tend half consciously to imagine that this would be a reasonable outcome let the united states imitate those countries that were settled by catholics in the first place and where there has never been a very strict color line catholic values will triumph and there will be no more racial problems because the united states will be like brazil as present events in brazil make quite clear this is no solution the actions and attitudes of white christians all without exception contain a basic and axiomatic assumption of white superiority even when the pleas of the negro for equal rights are hailed with the greatest good will it is simply taken for granted that since the white man is superior the negro wants to become a white man and we liberals and christians that we are advance generously with open arms to embrace our little black brother and welcome him into white society the negro is not only not grateful he is not even impressed in fact he shows by his attitude that he is at the same time antagonized and disgusted by our stupidity and here i think is where all christians are innocently no doubt doing the gravest harm to christian truth for some unknown reason the white man especially the southern white does not seem to realize that he has been rather closely observed for the last two centuries by his negro slaves servants sharecroppers mistresses and bastards he does not seem to be aware of the fact that they know a great deal about him and in fact understand him in some ways better than he understands himself this information has never been passed on to the white man who has never dreamed of asking for it he has assumed that the ideas of the negro were more or less worthless in the first place do negroes think of course not they just sing dance make love and lie in the shade doing nothing because they are different they hadnt got the energy to think the negro knows precisely why the white man imagines that the negro wants to be a white man the white man is too insecure in his fatuous selfcomplacency to be able to imagine anything else consequently when the catholic church gives the impression that it regards the south as a vast potential pool of negro converts in which a zealous and ardent white apostolate can transform a few million uncle toms into reasonably respectable imitations of white catholics this actually does very little to make the negro respect the truth of christ practically nothing to help him understand the mystery of christ in his church it is often quite evident that the genuinely warm sympathy which so many catholics have for the negro is nevertheless something the negro himself now accepts only with resignation and disillusionment what we love in the negro tends to be once again the same old image of the vaudeville darkie the quaint black mammy of plantation days the pullman porter with ready wit the devoted retainer whose whole family has served a white southern feudal tribe for generations this is a caricature of the negro of which the negro himself has long since grown tired and its chief function is to flatter the white mans sense of superiority one has yet to find very many catholics including especially priests who are really able to deal with negroes on an equal footing that is to say without the specious and fraudulent mediation of this image most of us are congenitally unable to think black and yet that is precisely what we must do before we can even hope to understand the crisis in which we find ourselves and our best considered and most sympathetic consideration of the negros plight is one calculated to antagonize him because it reflects such pitiful inability to see him right before our nose as a real human being and not a higher type of domestic animal furthermore we do not bother really to listen to what he says because we assume that when the dialogue really begins he will already be thinking just like ourselves and in the meantime we are not too disposed to offend the white racists either we still want to please everybody with soft words and pleasant generalizations which we convince ourselves are necessary for charity a genuinely catholic approach to the negro would assume not only that white and the negro are essentially equal in dignity and this i think we do generally assume but also that they are brothers in the fullest sense of the word this means to say that a genuinely catholic attitude in manners of race is one which concretely accepts and fully recognizes the fact that different races and cultures are correlative they mutually complete one another the white man needs the negroand needs to know that he needs him white calls for black just as black calls for white our significance as white men is to be seen entirely in the fact that all men are not white until this fact is grasped we will never realize our true place in the world and we will never achieve what we are meant to achieve in it the white man is for the black man that is why he is white the black man is for the white man that is why he is black but so far we have managed only to see these relationships in a very unsatisfactory and distorted fashion first of all there was the crude initial concept the black man was for the white man in the sense that he belonged to him as his slave but in the relationship of master and slave there is no correlative responsibility the master is like god who cannot enter into a relationship with a creature the creature can only enter into a relationship with him so the master could do what he liked with the slave and perhaps incidentally he might find himself without realizing it living to some extent for the slave whom he had come to trust and love but though there was a germinating humanity in this relationship there was no sense of a real social obligation to slaves as such who therefore were never really admitted to be human beings thus though the south of slavery days was a kind of eden for the white man and is still remembered in the southern myth as eden it was without human significance because it was empty of basic truth the truth of man was absent because here were two different kinds of men who were supposed in the order of nature to complete one another as correlatives and one of them was not admitted to human status the civil war came and the negro acquired a human status on the books of law but only on the books in actual fact his position was even less human than before to assume the superiority of the white race and of europeanamerican culture as axiomatic and to proceed from there to integrate all other races and cultures by a purely onesided operation is a pure travesty of catholic unity in truth in fact this fake catholicism this parody of unity which is no unity at all but a onesided and arbitrary attempt to reduce others to a condition of identity with ourselves is one of the most disastrous of misconceptions it may be true that a french missionary who brings the truth of the gospel to a west african pagan is bringing him the truth indeed but unfortunately the fatal tendency has too often been to assume that everything he was bringing down to his clothes his table manners his cartesian habits of thought his gallic selfesteem and in a word the infallibility of the bien pensant were all pure revelations of god and his church in such conditions missionaries have assumed with extreme generosity that their only function was to give of their sublime fullness and that it was never necessary for them to receive to learn to accept any kind of a spiritual gift from the native and from his indigenous culture material contributionsyes but nothing else there has generally been no conception at all that the white man had anything to learn from the negro and now the irony is that the negro especially the christian negro of the heroic stamp of dr_king is offering the white man a message of salvation and the white man is so blinded by his selfsufficiency and selfconceit that he does not recognize the peril in which he puts himself by ignoring the offer but is the white man in a position to recognize the providential char acter of this hour if i say that the negro offers him an opportunity the white man will perhaps scrutinize him afresh in order to find out what he has to sell and what will he see something at once disturbing and unattractive processions of discontented black men and women carrying signs groups of exalted children singing hymns frightened but determined people letting themselves be rolled around the street by the power of firehoses there is courage there no doubt and they obviously mean business but we have courage too and there is no need at all for us to have the hoses turned on us but this is not the point the negro in fact has nothing to sell he is only offering us the occasion to enter with him into a providential reciprocity willed for us by god he is inviting us to understand him as necessary to our own lives and as completing them he is warning us that we cannot do without him and that if we insist on regarding him as an enemy an object of contempt or a rival we will perhaps sterilize and ruin our own lives he is telling us that unless we can enter into a vital and christian relationship with him there will be hate violence and civil war indeed and from this violence perhaps none of us will emerge whole it must then be said that this most critical moment in american history is the providential hour the kairos not merely of the negro but of the white man it is or at any rate it can be gods hour it can be the hour of vocation the moment in which hearing and understanding the will of god as expressed in the urgent need of our negro brother we can respond to that inscrutable will in a faith that faces the need of reform and creative change in order that the demands of truth and justice may not go unfulfilled it is for this reason that the prudence and the selfstyled wisdom of some white christian leaders may well prove to be a sign of spiritual blindness and as such it may be decisive in leading the negro away from christian truth and natural reason to embark on a violent and chaotic fight for power characterized only by brutality and pragmatism in this struggle the lessons given by the white police and politicians in the south will certainly be turned to good advantage what the negro now seeks and expects or perhaps what he has entirely given up expecting from the white christian is not sermons on patience but a creative and enlightened understanding of his effort to meet the demands of god in this his kairos what he expects of us is some indication that we are capable of seeing a little of the vision he has seen and of sharing his risks and his courage what he asks us is not the same old string of meaningless platitudes that we have always offered him in lieu of advice he asks us to listen to him and to pay some attention to what he has to say he seriously demands that we learn some thing from him because he is convinced that we need this and need it badly negro writers like james baldwin have repeatedly demonstrated that this conviction lends an extraordinary power to their words there is no question that they have more to say than anybody else writing in america today many have read their books and heard their message but few are prepared to understand it because they simply cannot conceive of a white man learning anything worthwhile from a negro still less can tney imagine that the negro might quite possibly have a prophetic message from god to the society of our time in simple and christian terms i would say that the message is this white society has sinned in many ways it has betrayed christ by its injustices to races it considered inferior and to countries which it colonized in particular it has sinned against christ in its lamentable injustices and cruelties to the negro the time has come when both white and negro have been granted by god a unique and momentous opportunity we have this opportunity because the negro has taken the steps which made it possible he has refused to accept the iniquity and injustice of white discrimination he has seen that to acquiesce in this injustice is not virtue but only collaboration in evil he has declared that he rejects both the physical evil of segregation and the moral evil of passive acquiescence in the white mans sin but this is only the beginning now the white man must do his share or the negros efforts will have no fruit the sin of the white man is to be expiated through a genuine response to the redemptive love of the negro for him the negro is ready to suffer if necessary to die if this will make the white man understand his sin repent of it and atone for it but this atonement must consist of two things a complete reform of the social system which permits and breeds such injustices this work of reorganization must be carried out under the inspiration of the negro whose providential time has now arrived and who has received from god enough light ardor and spiritual strength to free the white man in freeing himself from the white man i state these two conditions as nakedly and unequivocally as i find them in the words of negro leaders my only comment is that in making these demands they are committing themselves very heavily to provide answers in case we should ever ask them any questions the negro is saying that in effect he has answers so far his actions in birmingham make his claim credible i for one am willing to hear more but i must admit there is as yet a certain vagueness in the inconclusive remarks so faradvanced concerning the future i am not too sure the negro knows any better than anyone else where this country is actually going yet this is a challenge and a very bold one the negro leaders are making some fantastic claims and they are perhaps all the more fantastic because those who make them have half despaired of ever being heard certainly all the official good will of the administration is in no sense an acknowledgment that these claims have even been considered in their depth that is because washington is professionally capable only of seeing this as a political issue actually it is a spiritual and religious one and this element is by far the most important but it is the element that no one is ready to see a white detective in birmingham watching scores of negro children file into the paddy wagons gave expression to the mind of the nation when he said if this is religion i dont want any part of it if this is really what the mind of white america has concluded then we stand judged by our own thought what is demanded of us is not necessarily that we believe that the negro has mysterious and magic answers in the realm of politics and social control but that his spiritual insight into our common crisis is something we must take seriously by and large in the midst of the clamor of every possible kind of jaded and laughable false prophet the voice of the american negro has in it a genuine prophetic ring who knows if we will ever get another chance to hear it in any case the negro demands that his conditions be met with full attention and seriousness the white man may not fully succeed in this but he must at least try with all the earnestness at his command otherwise the moment of grace will pass without effect the merciful kairos of truth will turn into the dark hour of destruction and of hate the awakened negro will forget his moment of christian hope and christian inspiration he will deliberately drive out of his heart the merciful love of christ he will no longer be the gentle wideeyed child singing hymns while police dogs lunge at his throat there will be no more hymns and no more prayer vigils he will become a samson whose african strength flows ominously back into his arms he will suddenly pull the pillars of white society crashing down upon himself and his oppressor and perhaps somewhere out of the ruins a new world a black world will one day arise this is the message which the negro is trying to give white america i have spelled it out for myself subject to correction in order to see whether a white man is even capable of grasping the words let alone believing them for the rest you have moses and the prophets martin_luther_king james baldwin and the others read them and see for yourself what they are saying it is related that when mohammed was seeking the light he thought of becoming a christian and he went to some nestorian christians in a corner of arabia and sought a sign of the truth of christianity from them in order to see whether they had faith he asked them to show him the credibility of the christian message by walking barefoot on red hot coals the nestorians told him that he was mad mohammed saying nothing departed from them and soon the conviction that he sought came to him in the burning heat of the arabian desert it was a truth of stark and dreadful simplicityto be proved by the sword originally published in ramparts magazine whats a negro revolt boy an amateur freelance writer i nevertheless scooped the nations press in an interview with the notorious jim crow never before had old jim as he is affectionately dubbed by his devotees granted an interview for publication getting the meeting was very difficult the explanation of why an amateur was able to get it is quite simple old jim is press shy over long decades of observing from a distance so to speak how the press operates he has come to distrust the integrity of the gentlemen of the fourth estate he says they have always misrepresented him and often even maligned him and now he maintains they seek to dress him in a gray flannel suit and make a racemanipulating hypocrite of him but in his homeland old jims most quoted aphorism is i operate right straight from the shoulder after seven weeks of negotiation through an intermediary who must remain unnamed i was finally able to get the interview simply by convincing old jim that his answers would be published precisely as givenunadorned and unexpurgated the following interview occurred last march in old jims unpretentious hotel suite in dixie city capital of the empire of jim crow after i arrived in the city all preliminary arrangements including the satisfactory establishment of my identity had been made through one of old jims faithful lieutenants who at the scheduled time ushered me into the presence of this unique political boss seated behind a plain magnolia table old jim merely nodded when i spoke and indicated my he firmly advised get started chair i had barely got placed when instantly the interview began question what is the central purpose of racial segregation in your country answer to guard and maintain the pristine purity of the great anglosaxon race q would you say this racial purity has been kept unimpaired to date a hell yes of course otherwise how do you think it could be maintained you cant maintain what aint q then how do you explain the presence of so many light skinned negroes in the empire of jim crow a these are the legitimate offspring in the practical moral sense of the word of free white men and nigger girls or women but these mulattoes are examples of an impure nigger race since they have nigger blood in them they are niggersnot whites so the white race remains pure q but by the same token then wouldnt you have an instance of the impurity of the white race in the offspring of a negro man and a white woman a wed have just an ordinary mulatto nigger and two hangings q is there any economic purpose in segregation a the driving purpose of nigger slavery was economic gain and one of the chief secondary purposes of segregation is of course economic advancement economic exploitation of inferior races is one of our godgiven rights and we should show the good creator our appreciation by using this right without shame or reservation also social gains naturally flow from segregation in a civilized society a racial caste system releases the most capable members of the superior race from the cheap dirty dangerous work so they can devote their time and talents to business politics the professions education travel and recreation or fun q but what about the socalled poor white trash how do they fit into this caste system that is based on race a these rednecks and crackers no matter how povertyridden and ignorant can always look down upon the niggersand lord it over em this is a big boost to their spiritsthe whites i mean it enables them to adjust more easily to their natural poverty and this adjustment helps to insure the political stability of our society so segregation is both a psychological and a political asset it encourages contentment and fosters patriotism after all these lazy white people like the shiftless niggers get the kind of jobs they are best prepared for and the kind of living they deserve why man without these poor competing whites the niggers would make too much moneyand vice versa both groups come in very handy indeed q jim people all over the country are especially eager to get your uncensored views on education for negroes a beyond a little elementary schooling the least education they have the better off they areand the better off our country is too whatever is good for them is good for the country you never in all your life saw an educated nigger that wasnt uppity and you never saw an uneducated niggerif he was uneducated enoughthat was uppity its them educated town niggers that take off after them damn yankee trouble makers senator eastlands niggers dont ever bother nobody education ruins niggers as quick as a little extra money does besides they dont need no education above the grades for the jobs we need them for a little onthejob training at a nominal wage can teach them all they need to know anyhow dont anybody with just half sense know that you cant really educate a subject race and continue to hold them in subjection they wouldnt stand for it maybe the ancient romans did have some educated individual greek slaves but here in democratic america in the last half of the twentieth century we are dealing with a race of twenty million niggers that are already getting democratic ideas in their heads we either keep them in poverty and ignorance or they will eventually escape our domination and become free q how then would you explain the reason for the many new brick school buildings for negroes that have sprung up rather suddenly all over the empire of jim crow since when i was down through here last a actually they are essentially just window dressing a kind of false front or what some of them educated niggers like to call a facade what is taught inside them is little different from what was taught in the old inexpensive frame buildings which were really adequate for the purpose to teach the niggers a smattering of the three rs a little vocational training lots of life adjustment behavior and plenty of civics and patriotismloyalty we are not about to start that separate butequal education youve heard so much hypocritical talk of really them expensive buildings are an unnecessary strain on the taxpayers but many of my people i must admit have lost some of that old dontgiveadamn independence that nearly everybody down her used to haveeither from conviction or from apathy and even jim crow has to adjust his sails slightly to the prevailing windsuntil he can change the winds in a word a lot of my people have become appeasers instead of standing up and fighting like free white men they are trying to stave off real schoolhouse integration by appeasing them communist bureaucrats in washington with a few shiny new buildings and a little tokenism q see you mean stand up and fight like governor wallace did when he stood in the schoolhouse door he a why hells bells no like george wallace my eye here old jim shook the spittoon with a spout of ambeer how long did he stand in that door till them washington stooges bodily overpowered him manacled him and hauled him away no he meekly walked away with a sickly look on his face as meekly as a little lamb being led to the shears and if you please how many other schoolhouse doors has this redoubtable states rights governor said with a supercilious sneer stood in exactly none hes been too damn busy traipsing all over the country trying to polish up alabamas image image hell get it straight i mean stand up and fight like bull connor honesty forces me to admit that many of my people have become infected with that social malady of conformity at least they want to put up a nice looking front as they say and quite a few of them in fact a disturbingly large numberactually want to make what they call some long needed reformsa nice sounding word for unprincipled surrender evidently some of them are really deeply troubled by a warped sense of right and wrong theyve become soft q one more question please if you have time old jim had just glanced at his watch lying on the table do you think negro citizens should have the same voting rights that caucasiani mean anglosaxon citizens have a hell no and neither does anyone else down here who values our great democratic anglosaxon heritageor even just his own hide of course a little token voting by the right kind of niggersthe ones who know their places and stay in themis all right in fact at times it can serve the good of the country from my long career i can recall several instances in which we were able to swing a local election by using the nigger vote in manageable numbers but if we are to preserve our democracy the ballot must always be carefully protected the democratic ballot must never be subjected to promiscuous use by the niggers after all niggers dont automatically have the rights of citizenship they have only what rights we choose to give them practically speaking niggers are subjectsnot citizens when old jim picked up his watch i knew the interview was over although i was strongly tempted to ask him to elaborate upon his concept of the right of the ballot in a democracy i discreetly crammed my papers into my briefcase arose and thanked him for the interview he nodded without further formalities i left the roomand dixie city by byron fulks this is the eleventh school year since the u s supreme court announced its epochal decision banning socalled separatebutequal public education but only this year has the wall of segregation been breached in the last of the defiant states in the late confederacy and all across the deep south the wall has been only breached racial segregation in our schools is still the only system in hundreds of southern communities and the dominant pattern all over the south further it is a disruptive practice mentally morally and socially stunting in many cities over the rest of the country its an old southern customwidely admired and emulated executive orders as well as other supreme decisions have sought to extend integration to other important activities of our public life such as service in the armed forces the use of parks recreational facilities transportation facilities libraries hospitals and housing numerous state laws and city ordinances have been enacted for the purposes of integrating our uses of public facilities and of more nearly equalizing our opportunities for education employment health and decent living standards these efforts national state and localhave by no means been in vain much indeed has been accomplished but immensely more remains to be done we have not yet become one nation indivisible we have not yet won liberty and justice for all in fact in these laudable endeavors as in integrated education we have really only barely begun for the most part we still have an essentially segregated society racial segregation discrimination and domination are old caucasian customs that will die hard why do we who widely and loudly profess to be a free nation and who propose to lead the socalled free world in a determined effort to maintain and further the ideals of liberty equality fraternity and democracywhy do we continue so long to procrastinate about implementing the individual rights provisions of our national constitution as well as our traditional ideals of democracy why do we hesitate so long before a watchful world to practice what we preach to other nationsand to ourselves was ever a primitive tribe more reluctant to forsake the venerable but violent ways of its fathers than we are to give up the narcotic fruits of racial segregation will it take a widespread mixing of blood in death to awaken us from our insensibility to human feelings and human rights our national virtues are involved in conditions so anomalous that a searching inquiry into the rationale of segregation is unavoidable if we negro digest december are to escape a national tragedy and an international revulsion in facing the naked facts of the cruel degrading and demoralizing uses of segregation we should find the inescapable obligation and the necessary courage and determination to end its brutal practice why does segregation remain so popular in caucasian circles high and low primarily it is because caucasians are the segregators rather than the segregated the rejectors instead of the rejected the shunnersnot the shunned that makes a vast differenceall the difference and people who actively practice racial discrimination have either too much arrogance or too little imagination or both to put themselves into the shoes of those who are forced to walk the lonely humiliating path of segregation our lack of a vigorous application of democratic and equalitarian principles to the civic life of each of our citizens alike is ultimately due in large part to our preference for property rights over human rights basically our aloof attitude toward the negro springs from an anachronistic concept of property rights he was once a marketable chattel he is even now in most southern localities popularly considered to be a communal hand available for use by the white community at a price near subsistence level indeed in many rural areas of the south a strong vestige of personal ownership of negroes is strikingly revealed through the common method of identifying a colored person as one of mr broadacres niggers thats an old southern custom congressional members from the rabidly apartheid states are relatively few in number but strong in influence and power this is partly because they openly and boisterously voice notions of white supremacy held in varying degrees by many other members who nevertheless find democratic pretensions more expedient politically than racism thus our political democracy remains almost exclusively a white democracy but segregationists by no means abhor color instead they find it politically useful socially gratifying psychologically flattering and economically profitable their apparent aversion to color as such is only pious pretense and those southern segregationists who thunder loudest against color are only indulging in diversionary tactics of course they are not afraid of color as their forefathers did for long generations before them they live intimately with it they work with it eat with it play with it sleep with it love it and help to procreate it but of course all of these interracial relations must by all means conform publicly to the rituals of white domination and negro submission this old southern custom is the sole requirement for close racial communion neither do these superior race advocates really object to the de velopment of a mongrelized race that they do not in practice object to miscegenation anyone can see again the manner of doing it is paramount they do not object to the act which is generally a form of exploitation but only to legalizing the act see john dollards caste and class in a southern town such legalization would eventually raise the status of the lower caste to the point of endangering the whole caste system which is to them centrally fundamentally and vitally important though the motives for interracial sexual intercourse are doubtless diverse and complex sexual exploitation of negro women by white men even to the point of rapeis an old southern custom the basic importance of color lies in its use as an indelible badge that permanently identifies a minority group and thus makes its exploitation hereditary the fundamental role of color is not to generate prejudice but to bolster and perpetuate it and the bourbon segregationists of the south have no intention whatsoever of surrendering now or later their way of life they cant easily be divorced from the idea that the negro still somehow belongs to them they will have to be pried loose this is an ugly fact of american life which will not go away because we minimize it try to ignore it or deny it its an old southern custom to have negroes during the last decade more advice has been given to the colored people of the united states about the desirability and necessity of obeying and upholding the law than has been given to the southern segregationists on the same subject during the entire career of jim crow whose sun is now sinking but in one respectin regard to the civil_rights of negro citizens the rulers of the south have always been a lawless group for half a century and more they lawlessly and blatantly ignored the equal part of the separatebutequal doctrine in utter disregard of the fifteenth amendment they have persistently denied the great mass of negro citizens their lawful right to vote when this denial could not be accomplished by legal subterfuge it has been unhesitatingly lawlessly and unblushingly achieved by threats of force the free use of force in unmerciful beatings and mutilations or even by planned murder for generations southern folklore has taught young caucasians that they were not obliged to respect the legal rights of negroes equally with those of whites and any time a white mans prestige or power came into conflict with a negroes rights those rights were tacitly ignored or for emphasis more often arrogantly flouted depriving the negro of his citizenship rights is an old southern custom in fact the negro people in the south have had to live without the protection of the law to a degree unparalleled in the life of any people of any other great modern country negro digest december unless you call apartheid south africa a great country not only has the law failed to protect the negro it has been freely used to keep him in his placein bondage and for many decades public lynching was a distinctive folkway of the south it has now been practically replaced by clandestine murder and murder from ambush unless a prominent negro is thus murdered these methods of killing cause far less publicity than a neighborhood lynching in any case quiet murder leads to less criticism of the southern status quo regardless of the method employed murdering negroes remains an old southern custom away down south in dixie today lawlessness not only lurks in ambush and slinks through the night with dynamite it also stalks across the land in the guise of law and orderin uniform and police boots with a cattle prod in one hand and a gun in the other in civilized communities the police dog is becoming the segregationists best friend today segregation in the deep south is being maintained by nothing less than a reign of terror this white terror was plainly exposed for all to see by the summer project in mississippi last summer there courageous young democratic americans all dedicated members of the human race tore a shockingly revealing hole in the segregation curtainunmasking more than one old southern custom thus a century and more after the emancipation proclamation the negro is still dominated socially exploited economically and sexually shunted aside politically terrorized and then widely and loudly blamed for causing unlawful disturbances well of course it really is disturbing for the oppressed and dispossessed to protest vigorously enough to be seen and heard round the world both the philosophy and the practice of racial segregation have become so deeply embedded and so intricately entwined in the traditions the folklore and the customs of the deep south that the white man has been caught in his own segregationist trap he is now sweating and floundering between its jaws of fear and hatred and through practicing segregation against his colored neighbors he has become so stupefied socially so insensible to human values that he cant conceive of negroes as individuals with varying personalities as ordinary human beings with ordinary human attributes as persons fully entitled to all the rights and privileges of citizenship instead in his social stupefaction he sees them only as indistinguishable units of a mass of beings known collectively as niggers somehow not quite fully human and therefore incapable and unworthy of full citizenship only a half century ago the question does a negro have a soul was still current in the late confederacy around the turn of the century the rising segregationists driving hard to consolidate and consummate the undisputed rule of jim crow had arrogantly challenged the negros humanity in order to make his new bondage appear justified for instance a book by charles carroll in bore the title the negro a beast or in the image of god this campaign of vilification met with enough success that its psychological mark is still evident though the deepest infection and the most virulent manifestations of this social malady of racial segregation are in the south it affects the entire country in some degree and it impinges upon our foreign relations with an endlessly recurring discord getting rid of it is a task that confronts and concerns the whole nation now and no matter which way we turn it will still confront us releasing ourselves from the entangling and constricting grasp of segregation and its numerous attendant social evils is a tremendous job that calls for a strong and continuous effort to awaken the nation to the shameful and frightening realities of our social predicament it calls for a sustained effort in mass social and political education and reeducation it calls for a concerted and determined effort to apply impartially all of the protective and equalitarian provisions of our federal constitution to all citizens and to enforce our national laws in all of the states alike today in the heartland of jim crowwith its segregationist sheriffs its battalions of riottrained police and its thompson tank law and order has become synonymous with segregation the stranglehold which these fierce bayou segregationists have upon the negro people can be effectively broken only by a federal government determined to enthrone the majesty of the law throughout the defiant south and thereby actively insure the full rights of citizenship to every citizen by now this should be plain enough to everyone when you consider all the people of the south racial segregation is not simply an old southern custom venerable and harmlessthat has become a cherished way of life it has always been a rapacious practice for the negro people it has always been and still is a way of degradation humiliation suffering and death devoid of both compassion and justice segregation is a continuing monstrous social evil it is an affront to human dignity it is an assault upon the human soul a rape of the human personality how much longer will the american conscience and american justice permit the negro people to be shamelessly sacrificed upon the altar of the immoral and illegal old southern custom of racial segregationwhich is not so very old after all morality law and common human decency all demand that this soulless custom regardless of age be stopped now is there really a negro revolution persistence of nem gro oppression in one form or another stems fr m the way ne r es u as weu as whjtes have conceptualized or misconceptualized the entire problem of race relations in america this is especially true when it comes to the socalled negro revolution that is going on now why after all of these years is the negro not free why has not the negros struggle taken a more effective a more final mode it is because i submit the negro has accepted the white mans definition of how to achieve his freedom by this i do not mean that any single white man or group of white men are directing the negros struggle i mean negroes themselves have accepted in theory and practice forms of struggling or protesting that are defined by the modus operandi the way we do things over here of the american establishment in a word the freedom movement has become institutionalized itthe movementis governed and handicapped by the very mode of politics economics and everything else that governs and handicaps this nation the white establishment is not going to approve of let alone allow a mode of struggle that will lead to the effective and speedy overthrow of the white mans dominant position in society anyway the sheer machinery of the establishment the law politics economics etc sloppy though it may beoperates in such a way as to impede if not outright prevent any major and speedy success in the negros struggle to become free you see how long it took to get the civil_rights bill into law it will be years or more before the provisions in it can be universally enforced the institutionalization of the negro struggle is achieved in the following ways the negro struggle is made into a formal movement every effort exerted by negroes must be approved of one way or another by the legitimate establishment this negro digest december puts the negro in a position where he must reveal what he plans to do before he does it there are set channels and procedures in and through which the negro must go whenever and wherever he decides to do something about his oppression a tendency for the struggle to become ritualized ensues no matter what the situation is tha negro becomes accustomed to struggling against it in a fashion that is repetitive and most of all one that is easily predictable by whites this makes the struggle orderly which is a prescription set down by whites in the end a great deal of the effort exerted by negroes amounts to no more than empty ceremony a solemn parade or a turbulent demonstration where negroes suffer brutality from white mobs water hoses and hound dogs classic examples are the march on washington in the first instance and the birmingham demonstrations in the second instance the negro always has to sit down and talk this leads to compromise on whatever he is talking about which means the negro struggle is being arrested the common form in which this process occurs is the committee the committee is appointed by someone from the white establishment who is revered for his nonpartisanship the committee is composed of people of goodwill and high standing in the society or better yet from the community in question of late the usual thing is to set up a biracial committee during the negotiation it is the whites who givein less than the negroes then too the whites have a way of not keeping their promises meager as they might be when infrequently promises are kept it takes so ong to institute them another fact about negotiation is that a few of the blacks are usually encouraged to do something that smells like selling out this is a clear indication that the negro struggle is governed by the traditional mode of american politics currently quite a few negro leaders have assumed the role of race diplomats too many negroes in positions of leadership play the traditional role of uncle tom only now they are educated uncle toms and are not so easily detected they deal with the white and black communities in such a way as to protect their own self interest a doctor a preacher a president of a negro college especially in the south it is not unusual to find negroes in high places who softpeddle demands for freedom and equality in order to make their own positions secure in most instances nobody knows it but the diplomat and the few whites in question traditionally when white people of goodwill in the south wanted to stop negroes from doing something or to start something the pattern has been to call in the local doctor preacher or college president and negotiate all of this is done behind the scenes except in rare cases where the situation becomes public knowledge blows wide open the masses do not know what is going on until the negro returns and tells them that suchandsuch a line of action usually inaction or ineffective action is the best thing for them and is what they are going to do the nature of diplomacyfrom its historical beginnings to the presentproves one thing it is rare that a diplomat actually represents the entirety of his constituency the best he usually does is to represent himself along with his immediate coterie or peersthe class interest this allows for an explanation as to why after the suffering and struggling on the part of all negroes only a few usually middleclass really benefits every time the negro does something to achieve his freedom the response is lets study the situation this means all activity by negroes must cease while the study is in process nine times out of ten white people do the study or administer it which is the same thing it takes a great deal of money which of course must come from the white establishment what the study boils down to is this whites are going to tell about how whatever the negroes want will create more problems than it will solve and above all about how whites and negroes simply cannot get along together some white sociologists or authorities on race and their staffs earn a great deal of money the authority gets his findings published in one of the journals or better still in newsweekall about what whites think about negroes never the other way around then he publishes his study in book form receiving high acclaim and ultimately as a consequence of his monumental work he assumes the chair in social sciences at one of the larger universities this also applies to the few negroes who from time to time get the chance to head up a study meanwhile years have passed the stockpile of our knowledge on race relations accumulates like debris in the archives of the dead bring the struggle out of the streets and put it in the courts first one must sit and be intimidated by the bigotry of southern courts local judges and other officials then if one is lucky one comes up through the state courts and finally to the supreme court this takes years and more money than any single negro or local group of negroes can ordinarily afford an avalanche of litigation red tape is unavoidable and still even if the supreme court decides in your favor there is no certainty on the local level that you are actually going to get what is now legally yours the adjudication of the negros rights works in such a way as to prolong the granting of those rights the negros struggle to achieve his freedom tends to be conceptualized in mythological terms negroes do this as well as negro digest december whites the struggle is defined in terms of mystical measures such as love those who hate you the need for understanding suffering forgivingness we are told that the problem is in the hearts of americans those who make speeches employ such phrases as go down moses go tell it on some kind of mountain i have a dream etc etc negroes are told that prayer is a powerful weapon against oppression and that god is on their side all of this makes for some fine oratory and more times than not sloppy poetry what it means in too many instances is that the negro has adopted a view towards alleviating his oppression that tends to prolong that oppression a christian approach towards solving the race problem can do just so much nonviolent methods of struggling can do just so much then the law of diminishing returns sets in anyway negroes are not living in a land of ancient kings singing about go down moses and if i had a hammer might call up in the negro a powerful sense of his suffering but it also tends to transport the negros concentration away from this world and this time a world and a time that if he is to become free he must deal with in an objective secular fashion this equally applies to black nationalism backtoafricanism and black muslimism any solution to negro oppression that does not provide realistic means towards that solution is a mythsolution the poetic and symbolic rhetoric of the freedom movement often indicates its nonmilitancy therefore the threat of violence in coercing compliance with negro demands is not being utilized this is what happened when because of the very secular language in which john lewis chose to state negro demands his speech was heavily censored at the march on washington in addition to this the progress that negroes make tends to be generalized in such a way that when one negro achieves something it is played up as if all negroes have achieved it sidney poitier has definitely achieved but the rank and file of negroes has not achieved anything the same goes in the case of jackie robinson ralph bunche and so on this type of thinking represents tokenism in negro progress it is a form of vicarious progress and not real progress no matter what the negro says he wantscivil_rights fair employment better education human rights and so onthe white man especially the southerner never fails to bring up the question would you want your daughter or your sister to marry one this question seems to sufficiently caution if not inflame all whites against integrating negroes into the mainstreams of american democracy it seems to me there is a trend on the part of some civil_rights groups to place an undue amount of emphasis on policy more and more the freedom movement is becoming involved with bureaucracy bureaucracy often confuses communication and impedes progress the leaders and other personnel of the movement are beginning to look and act like organization men what organizationism does is to coerce every small or local group to conform to policy this prevents or limits spontaneous action and independent thinking the negro freedom movement tends not to tolerate protest action or demonstrations that veer from its current policy of nonviolence and of not offending or embarrassing white friends of the movement this is known as negro liberalism of course the policy of nonviolence and negro liberalism is a direct reflection of the influence that the white establishment has upon the negro struggle negroes go along with this policy because i am afraid it is the only one that liberal whites approve of and mainly because negroes have the same values as the white establishment i have already mentioned how john lewiss march on washington speech was censored and disapproved of because the speech made a radical departure from the agreedupon policy agreed upon by whom by whatby white liberals and negro liberals who did not want to say or do anything that would offend the white establishment and most of all john f kennedy and company another example occurred when one branch of new york core decided to stage a massive automobile stallin on major transportation arteries on the opening day of the worlds fair there was much debate amongas well as betweenthe major civil_rights groups the local chapter of core made an effort to go ahead but the stallin as such was a telling failure i do not know if any heads rolled i do know that the local chapter was expelled or suspended from the larger body instead of intensifying the aggression against the wider society many negroes feel that they must get themselves ready must prepare for integration and equality they must acquire good manners and in general they must learn how to act before they can expect whites to treat them as human beings what this means is that too often negroes assume toward themselves the same attitudes that whites have frequently the psychology of the negro is that of a freak striving to achieve equality with normal people the normal people whites define the terms of the freaks equality the negro accepts these terms he abandons his own qualities his manners and habits and strives to imitate the values habits and behavior patterns of white folks it is this viewpoint that tends to color or usurp every phase of the negros struggle for human recognition in america considering everything i have asserted so far how may one evaluate the current wave of negro protest as a revolutionary movement the answer is inescapable there is no black revolution a revolutionany revolution is a ruthless program of aggression on the part of the oppressed masses against the very foundation of the powers that oppress a movement with revolutionary intent seeks not to reform certain limited aspects within a society but to destroy or overturn the entire organizational structure it leaves in its wake the ruins of not merely the one institution that is directly identified with oppression it makes havoc with the entire socioeconomicpolitical complex because revolutionaries know that it is the complex which is ultimately responsible for oppression or freedom you cannot escape hatred and oppression in a world of hatred and oppression that world has to be destroyed that world has to be reorganized from top to bottom both materially and psychologically there is no revolutionary mentality in america americawhite and blacklacks the kind of imagination that creates revolution the leaders the organizations and groups that are in the forefront of the negro struggle and which are accepted as legitimate by the white establishment are not clamoring so much for individual liberty freedom as they are for uniformity in social status and public treatment equality these kind of negroes want to be accepted in and by white society not as individual personalities but as if they were white themselves they have the same values that whites do this attitude necessarily puts a straitjacket on how far the negro will go out on the limb in throwing off his oppression freedom for most americanswhite and negroespecially middle class negroes has a madison avenue meaning it means material comfort and while the majority of negroes are not actually middle class they are definitely middle class oriented james meredith for instance has repeatedly stated that the main motivation behind his endurance at the university of mississippi was the very american desire to get ahead to be able to function as a lawyer in his mississippi hometown and to acquire the material comforts propagandized as common to our american way of life just as any white man would do this is the crucial point most negroes want to throwoff oppression within the context of the american establishment the negrow is not yet willing to run the risk of a total assault on the culture to find that many of the things for which he has fought and is fighting will no longer be available that is within the socioeconomic and political framework that now characterizes this nation it is a question of values whether it is best to completely do away with oppression as undesirable and find that other desirable values are also done away withor to deliberately or unwit tingly protest in such ways as to prolong in some form or another the existence of the race problem and thereby retain many of the more desirable features of the american system this is the real american dilemma at this moment in our history it pertains almost exclusively to the negro for contrary to what myrdal asserted in his book an american dilemma the vast majority of whites in the united states have never had any bones about the discrepancy between the american creed and what they actually did in real life it was only when someone tried to significantly change the status quo that whites became alarmed it is largely the same today there is on the other hand a revolutionary force in america but it is a force locked within itself because it has been and is alienated from its own powersthe powers of violence i am referring to the black massesthe ignorant impoverished unrefined bottomrun negroes in the south and in the black ghettos of the north these are the final people historically anywhere in the world the only power the masses possess is the power of violence or the power which is the threat of violence the black masses constitute per cent of the negroes in america these are the people america will ultimately have to deal with these are the people that negroes the liberals and middle class orients will have to deal with these are the extential negroes beause the negros struggle tenus to be institutionalized on every level and in all respects the masses of colored people are largely excluded from receiving any of the gains that middle classoriented negroes are now making this is true in all but a few isolated instances one notable exception was the montgomery bus protest movement when the deal went down allnot one or two or a fewall negroes rode the bus in montgomery they still do on the other hand take birmingham the masses of negroes endured the water the dogs the brutality of the mobs when the deal went down they had nothing concrete to show for it but their scars i believe two negroes got jobs and one lunch counter was desegregated the birmingham situation is not the exception but the rule until the violence of the masses of negroes or their potential for violence is felt throughout the nation there will be no negro revolution we will be experiencing a revolution when civil economic and human oppression in a very concrete way is lifted from the lives of the black masses but this will involve much more than just a black revolution it will be an american revolution whether one describes the current activities of negroes as the negro digest december civil_rights movement the freedom movement the negro upheaval or by any other phrase is not purely a question of semantics there is something going on there is a great deal of activity a tremendous amount of noise since there are peopleblack and white who refer to all of this as the negro or black revolution it is not enough to show that they are in error one has the responsibility of trying to understand what the term means to the people who employ it in relationship to what is actually happening and most of all one must unearth why people are using this term when its real meaning does not apply to the situation it was around that louis e lomax negro reporter and author published an article called the negro revolt in one of the better slick magazines the article was then made into a book published under the same title largely the revolt that mr lomax was talking about had to do with the younger generation of negroes revolting against the older type negro leadership the young predominantly college enrolled negroes sitinners were thumbing down on the orthodox leaders as being too slow and conservative and they were beginning to take things into their own hands a new militancy developed the term negro revolution seemed to have come into prominence subsequent to lomaxs book revolt revolution as time passed and more and more negroes took to the streets the term began to appear in the white press with mounting frequency i believe also that the cuban revolution had a suggestive impact upon all americans especially white americans so that the term slipped into the press to describe what negroes were doingalthough quite unaware of the psychology involved and to be sure although there was a world of difference between what castro did and what negroes were undertaking to realize this is to see clearly what the white press either consciously or unconsciously was and is doing in labelling the activities of contemporary negroes as the negro revolution the whole thing begins to make sense a pattern begins to emerge american white people tend to view anything the negro does to achieve his freedom as being revolutionary it is at once a fear reaction a sort of racial reflex response in lieu of protecting their dominant position and a conscious or unconscious attempt to illusion the negro so that he will not really become revolutionary if negroes can be made to think they are being revolutionary they will become satisfied with what they are getting or will become illusioned as to the exact nature of what it takes to really make them free and what it is really like to be free when one or two negroes as a consequence of mass demonstrations sitins liedownins and so on receive employment as construction workers in a very real sense for whites this is an ex ample of the negro reflation negroes rhapsodized by masr media and perhaps by the intoxicating effect of assuming a collective consciousness are lulled or excited into viewing their behavior also as the black revolution another factor which lies behind the rhetoric of the negro revolution is sensationalism five years ago judging from the mass media one would have had difficulty saying for certain that negroes lived in america except for rapists murderers thieves and other criminals today the news about negroes dominates the media radio television newspapers magazines everything at last the negro is commercial the black gold rush is on so much is being published about the negro that one simply cannot keep up with it all life time newsweek look saturday review harpers saturday evening post and on down the line the publishing houses are rolling the stuff out i will hazard that during the last five years more negro material has been published by the american press than in any other twenty years taken altogether most of it is little more than garbage but who cares it sells noticeably the new york times began to carry much more news about negroes shortly after its west coast edition flopped there has been no other time in the history of publishing not even during the leftwing s that so many negroes have gotten into public print as during the past five years many of these negro authors do not even profess to be writers whites also are exploiting the unprecedented commercialism of negro subject matter in fact there is an underground animosity developing between negro and white writers despite the negros superior knowledge of the subject whites seem to be cashing in on negro material with much less difficulty from publishers reviewers and the public than most negroes hollywood has made black like me written by a white man into a movie nobody to my knowledge has dared to film ralph ellisons invisible man with reference to the socalled black revolution itself whites are infiltrating the movement wherever there is a negro sitin wadein prayin or any sort of protest or demonstration whites are to be found among the ranks at least onethird of the marchers on washington were whites even the black muslims whose attitude towards whites is unmistakable are plagued by caucasians clamouring to join them i know there are some white people who are genuinely dedicated to the cause of freedom i also know there are too many whites who are aligning themselves with negroes simply because they have a pathological craving for attention and publicity many whites are downright jealous of the attention negroes are currently receiving via the mass media they join the movement because i am afraid they negro digest december have no other means of acquiring recognition i am reminded of a young white man who is or was an official of a brooklyn chapter of core the young man was brought into court tried and given a short sentence for civil disobedience he sat down on the floor of the court room and refused to be moved the judge advised him to leave or be charged with contempt the white zealot refused to budge and called the entire court including the judge members of the ku klux klan growing impatient and peeved the judge added ninety more days to the sentence whereupon the zealot went into a tantrum and had to be dragged from the floor of the court he received plenty of attention the next day his name appeared in the new york papers and his face over the television networks since it is now receiving more publicity than at any other time in history the negro movement in two many instances becomes a bandwagon for white crackpots and misfits this is equally true of some negroes who incidentally are playing revolution they are jumping on the bandwagon there occurred an incident in harlem where some negroes were picketing a small restaurant owned by a puerto rican working there were one negro dishwasher in the rear and threeskinned puerto ricans up front the negroes were demonstrating to have a darkskinned negro employed up front unknown to the public there was some fuss as to who was the leader of this demonstration there were two preachers contending for leadership they were at each others throats suddenly a policeman informed one of them that he had to move his automobile that was when the newsmen and television cameras converged upon the second leader i watched him on television he knew his picture would be in the papers he knew his statement would appear in the press he was so aware and proud that his face was being televised i made an observation that man should not have been the leader of that demonstration any more than ross barnett should have been the governor of mississippi there is some question in my mind as to whether the demonstration should have been or not yet i wonder in as much as barnett was the governor of mississippi then that porkchop preacher should have been the leader of that demonstration dead water an dead sand contending for the upper hand as long as the dispossessed masses of black people remain dispossessed as long as the american establishment does not provide an avenue through which the ignorant utterly depraved portion of the negro and white community can realize a sense of personal dignity and social worth in terms of the humanity of man it will go on it may never end at the present rate before it gets better it will get worse the sensationalism and commercialism of the freedom movement serves to obscure what is really happening there is some progress being made how much and where it is all leading is difficult to say also no one knows or has tried to discern what all of this is doing to and unleashing in the emotional chambers of white southerners mississippi for instance is now a virtual nazi state awaiting the final solution no one as far as i know is preparing for the worst between blacks and whites in the south and north except the cops and the racists we are too busy being sensational and making money why it remains to be answered at this particular time in our history is the negro so commercial in the media why does the black revolution seem to be the most saleable thing that is happening in this country without bringing in the international situation which limits whatever analysis one might make there seems to be a news deprivation an excitement vacuum in america which the current negro upheaval is filling secretly we are on pins and needles waiting for the next headline the next radio announcement the next bloody photograph in the tabloids waiting for the televised barbarity between blacks and whites to boom into the boredom of our living rooms obscenity this is what we are reduced to i suggest that it is not horror that we feel when we see in the media black men and women being maimed in the streetsit is prurience the pornography of black and white bodies clashing together to wit most americans especially whites perceive the intermingling of negroes and caucasians as something extremely lewd to witness it acted out via the mass media not in love but in hate and violence constitutes a vicarious ecstasy of the most depraved nature before me i have the new york times on the front page is a photograph of white men in st augustine florida beating a group of negroes with bottles and sticks what has come over us i am a negro and i will not submit m body to that kind of twisted pain if i were white i could not participate in that form of orgy let me make one more observation about the black masses as they relate to the socalled negro revolution at a new york rally shortly after a white minister was accidentally killed by throwing himself down in front of a bulldozer during a negro demonstration in cleveland ohio malcolm_x refused to declare a period of silent prayer in reverence of the ministers death a white man from the audience had suggested the period of silence malcolm_x refused to honor the negro digest december request he stated that unnumbered negroes have been and are being murdered and nobody has offered up a prayer for them while this is not altogether true malcolms attitude had a tremendous effect upon the audience most of which were bottomrun lowerclass negroes they leaped to their feet and cheered i discovered something during that rally malcolm is apocalyptic his words are brute concrete secular and he communicates with the masses whether you or i like it or not he can become the most followed negro of our times he has an anticharisma that recriminates radical whites and middle class negroes and he electrifies the common masses here are his words in a merica whites go around with the attitude t am white in the sound of their voices in the essence of their beings it is impossible for a white person to believe in capitalism and not believe in racism you cant talk this negro revolution jive to me when youre not ready for it when the deal is down most of you arent malcolm_x is the only negro who talks like whether he is or not a real revolutionary meanwhile drew pearson is calling dick gregory and adam c powell too radical he says that whites are forming a solid block against negroes and that negroes are losing understanding and sympathy from whites in the north as well as in the south the white backlash precisely it can be this kind of attitude among other things that might bring an abortive end to the current stage in the freedom movement unless one is insane he hopes it does not come to that nevertheless it seems as if drew pearsons attitude or was it an observation is the growing tendency among more and more whites and i fear we will not become sufficiently aware of the meaning of what is happening inand tous until it is too late the current struggle constitutes the precipitating stage unless we do something now one way or another to free those millions of blacks whom i have spoke of as existential negroes there may not be a revolution but there will definitely be armageddon psychoanalysis revisited the thunder of the helit g copter landing on the r rooftop of my office buildin sent me div ing headfirst under my desk as papers scattered in all directions a lot of people think that those of us in the psychiatric profession dont have our own little fears too but im here to tell you that we do and the thought of having an airplane land square on the top of my skull is mine ill bet it gets a rise out of you too anyway i didnt even peek out from under that desk until i heard the sound of the skylight opening and saw this guy making his way down this ropelike ladder thats aheh hehpretty dramatic way to make an entrance i said sheepishly crawling out from under the desk get right to the heart of the thing i always say the stranger answered no need pussyfooting around hung up in all that automobile traffic so i fly my own plane did it in world war ii still an air corps reserve man i see i said and began picking up my papers and shuffling through them i trust you have an appointment i cant seem to find your name here do i have an appointment hah ive had an appointment for two weeks thats impossible i said ive been booked up for a month we psychoanalysts are busy people nobody could have made an appointment with me in the last two weeks you think not he snapped you hired a new receptionist two weeks ago didnt you well who do you think slipped her in here she worked in an appointment for me first thing thats the way i operate get your own people in first and thenwham as he spoke his arm came swooping down upon the desk with a bang so loud i dropped my papers again i paused for a long moment to study my visitor he was tall and squareshouldered with an indian arrowheadnose set in a tanned face topped with silver hair his voice was tight with a western flavor and he had the cool clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth i waved him to the couch and switched off the overhead fluores cents then i switched on a small lamp near us conserve a little electricity i remarked ah a conservative eh i like that he replied well now i said when we were both settled whats your problem the world is my problem he snapped russia red china vietnam social security medicare civil_rights the cold war the hot war yes yes i interrupted in a patient tone these are trying times in which we live and i can understand your concern but in the hour or so we have together today let us just discuss your major maladjustment or in the argot of the layman whats bugging you oh he said and i could see his manner slowly beginning to change as if he werent so sure of himself ohwell you see i have a feeling that a lot of people dont like me well i said slowly persecution complex huh i know how it is seems like some days everybody is against you its nothing to worry about we all go through that now and then and its just no no you simpleton he shouted i dont mean in just an ordinary sense i mean literally thousands and thousands of people dont like me many of them even seem to be afraid of me and its important that people like me millions of them have to like me as he talked i thought i saw a tear form in the corner of one eye well now thats a little ambitious isnt it i said to ask that millions of people like you i mean nobody has millions of friends look you jackass he snarled i didnt come in here to listen to a bunch of liberal platitudes i want some hard answers and i want em quick what are you headshrinkers anyway a bunch of pinkos or are you just too lazy to go out and earn an honest living ill bet if we defoliate these downtown office buildings wed turn up a bunch of you guys i could see he was getting pretty excited and talking a little irrationally so i tried to calm him down a bit psychoanalysis is dangerous work you know i mean if a guy goes off his nut right there on your couch and starts swinging you can get clobbered let me get you a drink of water i said after i managed to calm him a little i walked to a water cooler at the corner of my office took a paper cup and pushed the button nothing happened hah hah i laughed weakly with embarrassment ill bet i forgot to pay the water bill again and theyve cut it off im kind of forgetful about that theyve cut off your water he asked incredulously getting his hackles up again why id never stand for a thing like that if i were you id get a couple of marine buddies and march right down there and turn that water back on i dont think that will be necessary i said ill just put a check in the mail to them tonight all right coward he said lets get back to your problem i suggested why do you think millions of people should like you because i know whats good for this country he declared besides im a straightshooter and im for home mother flag and the buffalo nickel they dont make buffalo nickels anymore i said you see he shouted thats whats wrong with this country nothing is the way it used to be weve got to get back to basics but times change i argued nothing stands still like the commercial says progress is our most important product or in the words of president johnson shut your mouth he screamed and for a moment i thought he was having a stroke look i said who sent you to me anyway or did you just pick my unlucky name out of a phone book a friend of mine recommended you he said quieting down some short darkhaired little fellow was in to see you about a month ago he was having these hallucinations sometimes he would get to thinking he wasif you will pardon the expressioncolored oh that one i replied i remember him well but dont tell me you are getting that kind of complex too no you silly bastard he shouted i told you what my problem is for some stupid reason people dont like me sir i said adopting a very formal air i can understand your concern and i realize that you are a paying customer while i am only a poor servant of the people nevertheless i do not feel that you need to conduct yourself in this hostile manner i find your attitude belligerent and your language reprehensible he gave me a cold stare namecalling in the pursuit of a competent analysis is no vice he declared and scampered back up his ladder tribute to a freedom fighter thr ee courageous young men were viciously murdered this summer while fighting for freedom a nation grieved their fate and so did i on sunday august i attended funeral for a young man named wayne yancey who also died while fighting for freedom but a nation did not grieve there were however those of us who did he didnt die from a bullet and his death didnt bring any headlines but there was something as dastardly in his death as in the deaths of the other three wayne yancey was a yearold negro volunteer in the mississippi summer project he was killed in a headon automobile collision august in red bank mississippi while carrying out a project assignment i find the details of his death rather insignificant and i suggest that a speeding automobile was only a symbol of what really killed him he quite like the other three fell victim to a very sick society a society which preaches brotherhood and principle while practicing bigotry and intolerance might very well be symbolized by a speeding automobile both are extremely destructive i met wayne several months ago while working on civil_rights projects in chicago we never became close personal friends but we worked in the movement together and we conversed from time to time in march we were among a group of chicagoans who attended the sncc conference in atlanta and together we talked about the forthcoming summer we intended to spend in mississippi now so suddenly it seems wayne has passed on from this challenge i known as life to that unknown that awaits each of us now i am left with impressions of the young man and in his death i have discovered that i knew him much better than i realized during his life this to me says something of life and lifes final act death and my impressions of wayne seem to reveal something about my people about my country and about this humanity to which we are indebted by the very nature of our breathing wayne yancey exemplified the victimization of my people by this society which has so long tolerated racism he often talked about his past and the things he hoped to do in his future one of the most poignant memories im left with is his having said to me in atlanta in march again back in chicago and once again on the night before we left oxford ohio for mississippi that after the summer in mississippi he wanted me to join him and a few other fellows in a civil_rights project in a town called paris tennessee he used to say its a small town and in a few weeks we can really shake it up i knew wayne traveled a lot engaging in rights activity and consequently i made no special connection between him and the small town in tennessee and so on sunday august i went to paris tennessee and there learned for the first time that wayne was born and raised in the little town he wanted me to help him shake up this young man who had actively participated in the struggle in chicago new york atlanta and mississippi hadnt forgotten the place where he first learned the bitter lessons of being black in this country he hadnt forgotten the little town where he was introduced to the mental lynchings we have all endured during our struggle against oppression although the little town was no longer his physical hell it somehow stood between him and freedom and such seems to represent the very cruel psychology this nation has forced upon black men and so i went to paris as wayne had asked but my journey was premature and my mission was not the desired one we went to paris tennessee to bury a young man whose existence in this world was far more honest than his surroundingsa young man whose words to me so vividly portrayed the alienation that once engulfed him wayne left paris tennessee a few years ago finished high school in chicago tnd struck out against a society which had deprived him the same society that killed him in the only way he knew he joined a gang in chicago and allowed his anger his hate and his frustration to flow but he never stopped searching and he found something he could truly identify with something that would give his life a meaning society had prevented it from attaining he found his road to the manhood society systematically denied him and seemingly intended for paranoiac reasons that he should never have yes he found the freedom movement and there is no doubt in my mind that the movement did indeed become his life he chose a gallant way of living with his anger his hate and his frustrations and he enabled himself to control his feelings while finding the courage to go about making a better life for himself and others this was his alternative to destroying himself yes he rose above many adverse situations he became a man by the very fact that in his short years he discovered a way to contribute to a society which had disparaged ostracized and punished him from his very beginning siipply because he was born black yes black men must pay special dues to this society and wayne paid more than his share he was aware of and concerned about the evils in this society and although he died trying to help it i must ask was society aware of or concerned about him i am somehow afraid that to society he died a stranger i find great significance in the circumstances which brought wayne to that fatal moment and i assert that his presence at that scene represented his struggle for not his freedom alone but for yours mine and all mankind i insist that he died for that which killed him and consequently we stand indicted i am assured that we are indeed a sick society shall be sick until we look at rrfen like wayne yancey and begin to face the reality that each of us every human being on this earth is equally importantand just as equally unimportant when we are delivered from this sickness we will then be indebted to men like wayne yancey iy the end it is only we who can insure that he did not die in vain my last thoughts of wayne are what i believe in my mind and what i feel in my heart i believe he was a black man who only a few years ago felt there was no hope for him and his people in this country i can only hope that he died believing that there is hope just as i believe there is at last no in his death there were no headlines no fanfare and very little said or known but in his death in his life there was a certain greatness that we must attempt to understand and learn from im certain that in that great unknown wayne was embraced by andrew goodman james chaney and michael schwerner and somehow i could hear them saying to wayne welcome brother the supre me race race is a haunted word bloating with pride burdened with suffering clouding the reason of commoner and ruler alike it is also a term of biologic science in its latter potency it lends a flavor of objectivity to statements about innate race differences invented for political and economic purposes popular race concepts lag far behind current progress in the fields of population genetics and physical anthropology now human groups can be evaluated in terms of qualities with clearcut inheritance these new and forthcoming facts cannot be dismissed as troublesome they may not fit into our view of equity but they remain unyielding facts of nature and we had better try to understand them ageold race concepts founded on skin color stature facial traits and hair characteristics seem to fulfill some primary requirement of classification a central african pygmy would soon be recognized as a stranger among eskimos of alaska the differences are real and easily recognized turning to details we find an enormous variation within geographically defined populations some europeans rise above the stately nuers of eastern africa others are short or actually dwarfed often enough short parents have short children all of us can easily remember the stubby parents of some rangy friends though stature has some heritable basis we must turn to the extremes to discern simple modes of inheritance thus chondrodystrophic dwarfs in marriages with persons of normal stature have normal and dwarfed sons and daughters in equal proportions nobody would come upon the idea of referring these dwarfs to a pygmy race some thirty per cent of all europeans cannot taste dilute solutions of phenylthiourea at least one fourth of the brothers and sisters of a tasteblind person reveal the same deficiency we would not classify them as belonging to a tasteblind race why not are we reluctant to refer a fixed proportion of a persons brothers and sisters to a different race we need a definition now turning to webster we find race defined as a division of mankind possessing traits that are transmissible by descent and sufficient to characterize it as a distinct human type let us admit that defective bone formation with resultant dwarfness is insufficient to characterize a race negro digest december we can dismiss the tasteblind race on the same ground but questions of this type whether classification grounds are sufficient or not meet the scientist today in his study of physical anthropology two hundred years ago men were conveniently black brown red white and yellow but hindus and north europeans with their different hues shared the classification as whites or caucasians a subdivision seemed reasonable but it had to stop somewhere if every shade of pigmentation served to separate a specific race we would meet such absurdities as several races within the same family of palefaced tawny and dusky europeans the number of races would soar rejecting color as the sole racial division line physical anthropologists turned to such traits as hair texture proportions of head and face form of eyelids and shape of nose long skulls came together on the museum shelves with separate sections for round and intermediate skulls such criteria cut across the ancient race line then the anthropologic classification resorted to clusters of traits among europeans tallness goes with a blond complexion and a long head a nordic race with these characteristics may have existed but never in pure form when people from northern and western europe are compared with inhabitants of the central parts of the continents differences are observed in stature body proportions and head form a rough distinction between northwest europeans and an alpine type may be accepted on such grounds similarly an east african population can be set off from the majority of the sudanese people using pigmentation hair form and series of measurements physical anthropologists have defined some thirty different races no observer of human diversity can easily free himself from the question why stop with races we could add some geographically welldefined groups and get a round number of perhaps racial groups could be named or let us return to these questions a little later armed with new facts now we accept the anthropometric division of mankind as convenient if somewhat arbitrary it is founded on sets of traits generally of a graded character sufficient to characterize fairly distinct human types in addition these traits are transmissible by descent but how what is inherited we do not inherit long legs what we receive from our parents are series of genes that control growth one set of genes interact to form a long and slender build other genes combine to check growth and produce a stocky figure genes are chemically active sites in molecules of known composition they form us during early fetal life they pilot our vital pur poses they fix our natural life span accidents called mutations change single genes to dodgers such as the mutant gene responsible for chondrodystrophic dwarfism in this case a single gene profoundly affects growth an exceptional situation what has been said about growth and stature holds in the case of skin color series of genes are at work producing varying amounts of pigment in skin hair and eyes exceptionally one distinct gene mutates and produces when it goes with a similarly changed partner gene the general lack of pigment called albinism both these abnormalities dwarfism and albinism are easily analyzed growth is stunted by one mutant gene inherited from one of the parents the coloring matter of skin hair and eye falls short when another mutant gene is inherited from both parents otherwise the graded characters studied in classical anthropology are determined by syndicates of genes of unknown number sure enough such inheritance is accessible to its special kind of analysis in view of the general and fervent interest in skin color it seems rather remarkable that pieces of main importance are indeed lacking in our knowledge of pigment genes it is certain that we can measure and classify people without resort to distinct gene differences if we limit our analysis to graded characters we discard however our most powerful tool for weighing the gene content of human populations we carry a maximum of two counteralbino genes in each ordinary cell some people have one plus the albino gene the rare albinos carry two albino genes only thus close to per cent of all sites for this gene in north americans is occupied by the normal counteralbino gene and the rest sevenperthousand is the frequency of the albino gene such statements would be void of meaning but for our potent tool the stability rule under random mating if marriages are contracted without regard to the presence or absence of a certain gene its frequency remains constant from generation to generation we cannot apply this rule to shades of skin color but it tells us something about the chances of marrying a carrier of a single gene for albinism they amount to the double product of the two gene frequencies we have to count with normal and albino thus unobserved carriers of the albino gene come to a thousand or almost one and a half per cent how can we use such knowledge a parent of an albino intends to marry a second time with the risk of onein to wed another carrier of the albino gene this is true if he does not marry a relative if he marries his first cousin the risk that she is also a carrier amounts to one in eight he should know that in this case he runs close negro digest december to nine times the normal risk such calculations have been applied to many diseases caused by mutant genes when the inheritance is recessive as in the case of albinism the risk that the first cousin of a known carrier is also a carrier never drops below one eighth or per cent the frequency of unknown gene carriers can on the contrary vary considerably in the general population when different abnormalities are compared in the case of albinism it is of some consequence that marriages are not contracted entirely at random in the meaning that anybody can wed any person of the opposite sex some observations point to a higher frequency for the albino gene in some intermarrying groups than in the general population of the u s now we are back to our first problem that of characterizing human groups obviously gene frequencies lend a specific meaning to such classification when they account for differences in disease predisposition to characterize populations we need common genes such as those responsible for the blood groups here we can calculate gene frequencies the genes a b and o alternate on a specific chromosomal site and all of us belong to one of the four blood groups a b ab or o today all major populations have been examined with respect to blood groups striking differences occur thus american indians largely lack this gene in eskimos its frequency comes not much above one per cent in china and india on the other hand the frequency of the b gene amounts to twenty per cent while such differences may have as we shall see a profound biologic meaning two points must be stressed first the same genes occur in all populations though their frequencies vary in small groups like pure chippewa indians the b gene frequency actually sinks to zero secondly a person cannot be referred to any race on the ground that he belongs to a certain blood group we note such differences without neglecting the agreements eskimos and egyptians have about the same frequency of the a gene with the study of gene frequen cies physical anthropology won a deepening insight into the composition of human populations the rh blood group system with a chromosomal site different from that of the abo system soon proved useful in anthropologic work and now a dozen systems have been used in the course of this genemapping of the continents five major races were distinguished they fitted roughly the old concepts of american indians australoids caucasoids mongoloids and negroids this way of characterizing races has flaws it fits some major geographic regions but only roughly so the basques in northern spain and southern france are caucasoids but endowed with extremely low b and high rh negative gene frequencies they seem to be the remnants of an early european population gene frequencies reflect historical and prehistorical events thus the b gene reaches eastern europe with a broad front of high frequencies diminishing through central europe but still distinct from a low frequency in western europe the great invasions the migrations of nations and the social intercourse with neighbors resulted in extensive outbreeding and reshuffling of genes careful evaluation of gene frequencies defined no pure white race the study of blood groups has shown that men are brothers under the skin whether they like to admit it or not recent improvements of chemical analysis have revealed striking differences in the minute composition of blood proteins the latter include the haptoglobins serum proteins capable of combining red blood pigment the first mapping of human populations revealed that one gene in this system hp occurred at a rate of about per cent in europeans increased to per cent in some west african regions from a generally high frequency in africa and was rather low in asia the haptoglobins and several other newly detected serum protein differences fit the concepts established by the blood group techniques thus differences do occur between roughly defined major populations these differences are mainly quantitative populations differing with regard to gene frequencies major races are not pure as long as we have been close enough to exchange blows and wares we have turned over genes this new anthropology armed with improving methods for the study of gene differences tends to disclose an increasing number of inherently distinct groups within nations and geographically defined populations again we meet differences in percentages rather than inequalities between individuals such minorities may establish their divergent gene frequencies by chance fluctuations in very small original groups or by settling as immigrants among foreigners whatever its origin the diversity tends to be maintained as long as marriages as a rule are contracted within the group the lapps in northern scandinavia constitute a minority with distinct gene frequencies here the relative isolation is due to traditions language and nomad life the mabaan people of the upper nile province sudan look and speak like their neighbors the dinkas nuers and shilluks but they differ in blood groups in this case a wide wilderness separates the mabaans from their neighbors negro digest december scores of similar instances are known we may add different jewish groups with their own gene frequencies and religion together with customs and environmental attitudes as the more or less rigid boundary line gene differences between indian castes have to do with agelong social demarcation all these facts add up to an unavoidable arbitrariness when it comes to defining a race anthropometric traits could release a rather unhampered subdivision of populations if they were used for race criteria now we meet much the same situation when we apply gene frequencies let us remember that human nature is too rich and varied to be caught in any meshwork of artificial definitions it is true that neighboring groups differ slightly and distinct groups decidedly many students of human diversity hesitate to designate the small inbreeding groups with distinct gene frequencies with the loaded word races are all differences in gene frequencies due to chance and diversity in origin no anthropologists have long been aware of the possibility that some such differences are adaptive one population meets other conditions of survival than the inhabitants of a climatically different region it was thought that body build and skin color were the end results of the cruel winnowing by hardship in past generations today some wellfounded doubt meets the thought that any gene is without advantage or disadvantage when it can be observed in alternate forms genes which seem good under some conditions may be bad under other circumstances one striking example of the relative value of a mutated or changed gene is presented by the s gene in the hemoglobin series the coloring matter of our red blood cells hemoglobin occurs in various genedetermined forms of which only a is unconditionally normal in adults when both parents carry the hemoglobin s gene in a single dose onefourth of their children develop a severe blood disease sickle cell anemia as these children do not build families the gene would slowly disappear or almost so new mutations tend to keep the frequency of a detrimental gene at a low but constant level in many african populations however the hemoglobin s gene is quite common this is true of peoples in tropical africa where subtertian malaria is or until quite recently was of permanent occurrence millions of children and adults in these regions carry the hemoglobin s gene in a single dose rendering them resistant against the parasite plasmodium falciparum which causes the predominant form of malaria in these regions this was the first wellestablished form of inherited superiority in geographically defined populations in north america the gene for hemoglobin s is decreasing among the descendants of africans of no advantage in regions free from malaria the gene is tapped off through early deaths of doubledose carriers thus the superiority bestowed on africans is sustained under special environmental conditions only recent investigations reveal that the hemoglobin s gene follows the distribution of the falciparum parasite rather than nationality outside its broad belt of high frequency across tropical africa the hemoglobin s gene occurs along the mediterranean shores on the arabian peninsula in southern india and northern thailand the relatively high hemoglobin s gene frequency does not set off an exclusively african malariaresistant race the s gene in one of the two hemoglobinregulating chromosomes produces a moderateand in malaria regions beneficial quantity of the special blood pigment when it occurs in duplicate the hemoglobin s gene kills its bearer thus any people with a high rate of this gene pays for its survival with a high child mortality if the hemoglobin s gene conferred an unconditional advantage it would in a limited number of generations establish itself as the normal gene this is nowhere the case no people in africa or else where can claim a general biologic supremacy still could my people not be endowed with a series of distinct if relative advantages in a biologic sense yes much forthcoming experience points decidedly to this possibility valid for any people let us remember that extreme hardships and an uneven struggle for subsistence fell to the lot of most people a few generations ago existant high level equilibriums between gene frequencies are remnants or symptoms of this struggle for survival as a tribe or a people often at the cost of the individual a possible symptom of presentday adjustment appears in northern ghana with its peak incidence of hemoglobin c this chemically distinct hemoglobin seems to be limited to the peoples of west africa and their descendants on the caribbean shores and in the u s the search for new cases of balanced selective forces was greatly stimulated by the discovery of a connection between malaria and hemoglobin s in mediterranean countries thalassemia an inherited hemoglobin disorder has a remarkable peak distribution in recent malaria regions the same holds good for a certain enzyme deficiency of the red blood cells cradles of the malaria parasite in southeast asia hemoglobin e occurs at a high rate and seems to offer some advantage to the heterozygous gene carriers the wellknown blood groups negro digest december a b ab and o usually occur at such frequencies that even the rarest of them cannot be maintained by new mutations in other words we seem to be forced to conclude that the common blood groups are at the play of beneficial and harmful forces that balance each other the actually observed increased risk for ulcers in the stomach and small intestine of persons with blood group o is only a forerunner of so far very fragmentary information there is no lack of clues however and much more will become known about the influence of blood groups upon health vigor and longevity when it comes to mental traits our measuring devices are at the very best comparable to the yardstick such measurements can be used for genetic analysis but not for the calculation of gene frequencies the essential problem here consists in the sifting of cultural and educational factors from biologic endowment the latter consists for all we can grasp with a thinking tainted by biologic experience of the universal human blend of strengths and weaknesses when analysis arrives at primary mental abilities some of them may spell conditional advantages transformed to handicaps in other surroundings on a cruder level every human group has its bullheads some of whom if winds came colder be loved for their staunchness we all have to make the best with what we have got under present conditions it is illboding for any youth to come out with the idea that his lineage has supplied him with an innate superiority or inferiority whatever his race may call itself it has supplied him with genes tens of thousands of which are common to all men he also has genes perhaps scores of them that are more common in his own people some of them may confer a conditional advantage he may find his way to use it from a biologic viewpoint race grants very little and dooms to nothing in its immense and sightless power nature has culled survivors from groups with varying degrees of genetic diversity some of these survivors have remained in their original surroundings keeping up a precarious balance with beasts and plagues and droughts among them on the outskirts of progress we may find what would correspond most closely to the idea of pure races the unfathomed dynamics of the present population growth and the subtle powers of the everchanging terms of modem life will mark the emerging populations in a way we can hardly predict our hope for a future meeting us with sudden and extreme hardships or alluring ease lies in the great diversity within all major populations of today whatever comes some gene combinations will empower their bearers with endurance and uplift earth will always belong to the supreme race the race of man washingtons african museum it is more than fitting that the first museum the in me united states devoted completely to the art of africa should occupy the premises of the former town house of frederick douglass

collections and various institutions possibilities for expansion of the collection are limitless most of the african nations which have gained independence since world war ii have embassies in the nations capital and it is not unlikely that they could be persuaded to make contributions to the museum shortly after the museum of african art opened in the old town house once owned by frederick douglass another douglass home in the capital became a part of the national park system the room douglass home located on an eightacre hilltop lot officially was transferred from the douglass memorial and historical association to the national park service of the department of the douglass had occupied this home from to when he died the national park service is in the process of restoring the suburban douglass home and its impressive furnishings all of which were preserved by the association books and historical documents are stocked in the rooms at the museum of african art a restful garden is one of the features spectacular pieces of african sculpture are distributed over the grounds collections of african art similar to that in the museum can be found in several museums in other cities notably the university museum in philadelphia penn a group of detroit artists and citizens recently opened a campaign to establish a special african section in the citys art institute there are impressive collections of african art in the major new york museums last spring national educational television presented african writers of today a series of programs surveying the literary scene in contemporary africa one of the programs featured an interview with the south african writer ezekiel mphahlele author of an autobiography down second avenue a book on current problems of african culture entitled the african image and a collection of short stories the living and the dead born years ago in the squalor of a segregated black south african township near pretoria ezekiel mphahlele grew up to know the scourge of racism and poverty all the anguish which ezekiel mphahlele carries in his soul as a writer had its beginnings here in his autobiography mr mphahlele recalls his childhood on second avenue in marabastad where he scavenged after the funeral when buddy and ernestine got home and she had kicked off her shoes they punched a couple of cans of beer and sat negro digest december around for a long quiet time they were thinking about jamie and it seemed right when a person had just been buried to think a lot about them to think thoughts hard enough to last because they wouldnt ever come to mind like that again jamie had been born right there in harlem and had almost never gotten out of it he had grown up therefirst in the one furnished room with a hotplate then the two rooms then the four rooms on the second floor where his mother and father moved when the old man had become foreman he grew slowly and he grew quieter as he grew up he was a slim small boy for his age when he was fourteen and he ran hard and played hard and played hooky when he could and could get away with it but he was too quiet for his age and it wasnt just a timid quietit was a sullen caged quiet that bothered people he got under their skins when his eyes just stared at them like a dumb and furious animal and he was speechless they used to mock his tight mouth that only grew tighter into a mean pucker under his dark wide eyes the kids who played with him used to mock him until when he was fourteen he swung a baseball bat at one of them because the boy had mocked him and then he ran home with his eyes still dryly soberly mad when they found out it wasnt a skull fracture but only a large knot on the boys head that would go away the boys parents dropped charges against jamie but jamies parents were tired anyway they were tired of the oppressive heat and airlessness tired of their lives and helplessness tired of jamies dark fits of silence and the black sullenness of his pride tired without hope they decided he should spend the summer with an uncle down south and they sent him it m was the first time he had been outside of harlem he didnt stay a summer he stayed a year he stayed although his mother wrote him and told him how lonely she was and how nicely his room had been arranged with all his baseball pictures on the walls and his father wrote that his allowance would be raised he stayed until he was almost sixteen and then he came back to harlem to school again they went downtown to meet him and they almost didnt see him when he came up the ramp from the trains he was older and taller and thinner than ever and his face with its smooth long cheeks drawn toward his narrow chin seemed less mobile more confirmed in its sorrow than ever he stood there awkwardly in a too small suit that still managed to sag unhappily everywhere a cardboard suitcase bulging in one hand as the crowd about him turned away his mother dragged his lean hard ribs to her bosom and his father shook his hand and then they just stood as though waiting but it wasnt long before his mother looked into his eyes and saw what was missing it was that mean darkness that had troubled her heart like a stiff fog and it was gone he smiled then and it rolled back his lips from dull close teeth they saw his hand slide into a pocket and then saw a glint of silver as he raised it to his mouth but they didnt recognize the mouth organ until he blew the first hoot upon it a hard gusty chord that burst in their ears with a sensation like plunging into the silent pressure of water and the liquid jovial ragtime notes poured at them in a talkative challenging flow as he danced a little jig in front of them it wasnt just that the silent resentful pride had left him that was only a part of the truth and then only the negative part what mattered was that he had found a voice he had found it somehow during his year away and the hard uncertain things that had struggled in inner darkness struggled no more his parents soon found out that jamie and the mouth organ were already inseparable he was no more talkative than ever and his mother came to accept the harmonica as before she had accepted his silence but where she had loathed the brooding silences of her son jamies mother came to listen for jamies mouth organ on the stairs its tempo telling his mood lovingly as though it were in fact his voice its facile eloquence had beguiled her it was a colorless object now dull characterless except for the life the brightness or dark moody blues that jamie blew into it it was a barometer that registered every change and pressure and his parents listened at the closed door of his room as the random chords recorded and charted the unembarrassed weather of his soul negro digest december a year passed a year of school of homework of regents the cold drab city blocks pasted with a grey winter slush then warming with the drop and glassy shatter of icicles the flush of water down papermatted gutters finally spring and the small budding of isolated saplings on the city street and the heat beginning to press the tenants onto fire escapes roofs the broad sidewalks where an endless procession of tireless children played the mouth organ had been lusty and imperishable it snorted and roared all the husky jazz notes that it held that it had caught swelling upward from jamies breast and the jangling strings of buddys guitar on the roof with him accompanied that was when buddy had first known jamie and had known him well and close as two boys can only be perhaps for a summer buddy was the one friend they had made jamie and his harmonica he was jamies age but already he played the guitar with the leisure and insouciance of precocious age they played in their own passion and the urgent sharp harmonies leaped above the blocks of grey indistinguishable buildings rutted by the narrow lanes of butting autos they mingled with many dark nights with clear air above the close greasy apartment smells with many white stars some that dripped like bright celestial tears down the dark face of the night buddy was the first one to mention bringing girls up to the roof one night the organ swooned barked sardonically but buddy could remember with the bubbling expanse of beer inside him that there had been another sound in the instrument a nervous quaver like a quickened pulse like a giggle too and the first girl came it was near the end of summer in the first steaming days of september that buddy brought ernestine one night up to the roof she popped out through the door ahead of buddy and buddy said i brought ernestine you know ernestine dont you jamie shook his head with a disjointed snatch of a pop tune loosed from the organ i was in your math class this spring she murmured jamie nodded an acceptance a slow smile before ernestine sat beside buddy and buddy bobbed his head meaning to begin the night had still been dusk when they arrived as the darkness became complete the stars brightening ernestines head drooped upon buddys shoulder and the guitar quieted became a subdued rhapsody no longer taciturn and apart but with a tremulous muted concern after awhile jamie felt urged away from them as the guitar strings sunk to a whisper over which the voices of buddy and the girl mingled endlessly he got up with a boastful strut of dixieland that took him to the roofs edge where he watched the streaming lines of traf fic in the streets below but irresistibly the bravado suspired from the organs voice sinking toward a husky seeking blues the guitar strings idled but from the hand cupped over jamies mouth a flood of insistent notes lapped at the nights distance seeking in its darkness something more when buddys guitar shattered his solemn melody with a sudden raucous clatter jamie turned to the couple leaning together over the guitar it rang with a loose jarring refrain a bitch crying buddy called it and jamie fell silent before it it was not until he went down to bed and lay on his back waiting for sleep in the sweaty blackness that he pressed the line of square holes against his lips which parted over the salty silver of the casing and blew a tune softly so softly like an echo returning to its source spring had come again a climactic spring before he met julie like ernestine she had been in his class all semester and one day she had spoken to him in the waning days before graduation he had not even known until one of those now infrequent times when he and buddy stopped to talk in the halls between classes that she was vicepresident of the senior class and he had forgotten it again for months when she was waiting outside of his building one morning of the last week of school he found out that she lived in the next building his parents heard the new moodiness of the mouth organs refrain the restless agitated whine of it which came and went between odd jumbles and snatches of melody as though a constant struggle toward order were being waged and lost and mourned they bought jamie a new suit for graduation because the one job that his father had found for him he had mysteriously indifferently lost and he still had only an allowance and they saw him take the diplomalooking very handsome they thought if he would only smile and go back to his seat one hand thrust desperately into the pocket of his jacket the girl next to him smiled too warmly too proudly at him for his mother not to elbow her husband and incline her head although they did not know her yet especially did not know she already considered herself engaged to their son but then jamie did not really know that either yet howd he ever take up with julie anyhow i never heard him say more than two words to anyone all the time i knew him except to you and then all you talked about was music i dont know buddy said i guess it just happened jamie wasnt bad looking you know the girls all noticed him for his looks they just forgot about him after awhile because he didnt talk like the rest of us he never had anything to say to them julie was different though you remember julie you couldnt stop her her parents hadnt stopped her with their warning of her silent jobnegro digest december less suitor and his parents hadnt stopped her with their confidences about their awkward and unconfiding son and jamie himself hadnt stopped her with his remote privacy isolated behind the medley of the harmonica jamie told me he used to be quiet and not talk because somebody was always talking and nobody listened so he played and everybody knew what he was trying to say then and when they stopped to listen he could feel that he was saying it good julie had told buddy right after the wedding but i didnt listen i didnt let that stop me so i got through to him and he had to hear whether he wanted to or not she had bridged the flood of sound and had chipped away at the flinty silences until he had given her his class ring and then she had chipped some more you should hear my mother and his folks they act like hes already married to that harmonica they think itll drive me nuts theyll see they think hell never hold a job theyll see she had said and she had chipped some more and they saw graduation had changed things it sure did ernestine said she had kicked off one stocking and was rolling the other one down but she was thinking of something else she was thinking of how jamies father had gotten jamie and buddy jobs at the factory and how that summer she and buddy had gone steady and then they were engaged and how jamie and buddy had joined a little jazz combo downtown and buddy had saved money and quit the combo and married her and how buddy was now a foreman himself but buddy was remembering something else that summer hadnt been like the other summer when he and jamie had first met they had graduated in june and before two months were up julie had married jamie and somehow they werent friends anymore without anything having come between them after the combo had finished for the night and waiters were tossing chairs about stacking them he would cross the floor on the way home and jamie would be sitting there he just sat and he didnt seem to see anything with his head cocked like he was listening but there wasnt anything to listen to but the scuffle of polished wood and the tinkle of glasses being shelved behind the bar hey boy your womans waiting for you he used to say and sometimes he would get a drink from the bar and bring it over and sit with jamie in the dark club but jamie never finished a drink and he had nothing to say he would finger the harmonica and turn it and sometimes he would hold it up to catch the remaining light in the dim room and tap it but whatever he expected never came out and he used to shake his head like a bewildered man and looked at buddy with his empty eyes get some sleep boy see you in the shop tomorrow buddy would say not long after that ernestine had talked buddy into dropping out of the combo it was long hard hours and it wasnt getting them anywhere and maybe if there was a break later he would go back they gave him a party after his last show with them only jamie left before it was over buddy hadnt seen him go he had seen him sitting to one side in the smoky shadows of the club after it closed fingering the harmonica and then he had looked again and the chair was empty still sitting back from the table with a lighted cigarette on the table edge burning over an inch of ash buddy had already gotten his promotion so they didnt see each other in the factory anymore and they no longer called each other after work so he hadnt seen jamie again for a couple of months until he took ernestine down to the club he was surprised when he heard the combo they were never exciting the way reviewers called the more modem combos they played somewhat oldfashioned jazz but they played it well usually and those that liked to hear traditional jazz came back often to hear them but they were off and all at once he knew that it was jamie who was playing away from the group and he had never heard him off before not even when they were teenagers on the roof and that was when he realized something that he had known all the time but hadnt thought about before that even before he had quit jamie had stopped playing the organ to himself after each performance he would sit endlessly fingering the instrument without once bringing it to his lips time and again he would examine it as though it had become strange before his eyes it was no longer identical with him and he seemed to watch it with an evermounting sad suspicion buddy had even asked him why he looked at it so curiously i have to work with it he had said it doesnt say everything it cant say it all in another minute he had said julie cant hear it thinking about it buddy hadnt wanted to stay around to say hello to the combo he and ernestine had sat far back and had left early after that they heard that the club had replaced jamie and then they only knew of him from time to time when ernestine would come in with a rumor he had picked up a habit julie had someone on the side she was pregnant he had hocked the furniture she had miscarried he had lost his job and gone to lexington he was dead they had believed it when they heard he was dead even before they called julie the other things had been too incredible they didnt believe them they had nothing to do with the sad powerless shadow of a man they had known who only listened and played as though he were some secret keyhole through which an inner world revealed its jubilation and regret they had known for a long time that he was dead he had died in the memory of those who had known him like lights disappearing at night into the dark face of a tenement and finally they had the rumor and then the solemn black tuxedoed stranger with hollow grey cheeks in the shrouded box in the undertakers parlor to confirm it there was a knock on the door and buddy put his feet down off the chair seat when ernestine opened the door julie was standing there looking very pretty and carefully composed still in the black dress from the funeral she came in with an unsuccessful smile and sat down quickly on the edge of a straight chair buddy and ernestine waited a moment for julie to move to speak she seemed so precipitously arranged that she might fall to pieces at any moment then buddy stretched for the refrigerator handle and asked have a beer no thanks her rejection was quick and tidy what can we do for you julie ernestine bowed solicitously above her she looked up i wanted you to have this she said blankly to buddy she reached into the black purse and extended a small parcel shrouded in a womans handkerchief buddy unwrapped it and held up the tarnished harmonica for me i thought you used to be such close friends when you used to play the guitar i gave it up just when i had about given up hope ernestine said folding her arms warmly about his throat jamie never gave that up till the day he died id rather not keep it buddy decided abruptly and offered the harmonica back to julie who looked at him surprisedly with a stare as though she had been betrayed it wouldnt be right anyhow it was like a part of him like an arm or leg i wouldnt want to have it around maybe it shouldve been buried with him ernestine interrupted irrelevently he went at that thing like a baby to his bottle i tried to wean him julie said tried god knows i tried and she slowly shook her head he could have made something of himself he could have been somebody if he would have put down that damned thing well theyre separated now she said still refusing to take it back it should have been right there in the coffin with him buddy insisted again he gave a last look at it and slid it into the pocket of his shirt i remember jamie saying that when he played he was like a genie going into a dark blue bottle that the sound just bottled him up and then he was okay because nothing could touch a genie in his bottle no one could find it very funny though they tried to smile and after that there wasnt much any of them had to say finally julie rose from her tense perch and said she was anxious to get home and change she was hot and she left buddy opened another can of beer and then he took out the mouth organ and fingered it revolving it slowly between the thumbs and forefingers of his hands he laid it lightly against the toughness of his lips and blew a faint harsh buzz escaped and faded in the humid air a fly buzzed about the damp rings on the table he started to smack the fly with his hand and then he thought of the fly stoppered in a little blue bottle flailing uselessly toward some outpost of his tinted vista and his mind seemed to close over jamie for a moment he forgot that he had been thinking about him he put the harmonica on the table edge and the fly rose and droned away into another room unzip me ernestine said her back turned to him utomtomism or the bigoted assumption that african culture is intrinsically sexy savage and sinister portrays the dances of black africa in terms of myths the first myth envisions seminaked savages leaping and hooting by firelight in celebration of unspeakable rites of sexuality this hollywoodabetted image what are they saying asks deborah kerr of white hunter stewart granger while together they witness a supposedly erotic bit of african choreography in king solomons mines finds expression sadly enough even in wellintentioned writings on tropical africa but real african dances are not sex dances although occasionally they may turn rabelaisian for reasons of humor or social satire traditional africans normally dance several feet apart from each other and regard our method of embracing while we dance as indecent another myth imprints the common mind with a notion that war dances are important south of the sahara a misconception that probably tells more of the civilized white mans fascination with and inability to avoid warfare than it does of choreography the wardance myth would find apparent corroboration in two dances recently presented at the african pavilion at the worlds fair one zulu the other burundi in fact something like marte moritors description of watusi dancing flashes in the mind of many americans when they try to imagine what african dancing is like eyes defiant they rush forward as if carried by a single wave wildly shouting while stabbing an imagined foe then drawing back and again leaping forth how silly this might seem to say a kanuri of northern nigeria whose social dancing elegant and precise as a minuet has nothing to do whatsoever with martial intent finally the third cliche notion beloved of certain american cartoonists introduces the ferociously attired witch doctor in paraphernalia stemming from melanesia if anywhere who stamps and postures above an ailing patient lying prostrate on a mat lightyears removed from this point of nonsense are actual african medicinal dances on the mainland opposite the island of zanzibar people used to dance a round implausibly called pepo in which the patient himself not the shaman danced out a search for relief from neuritis and neuralgia with gay movement that resembled a simultaneous rendering of the shimmy and the samba we in the west are only now beginning to explore the legitimate therapeutic properties of dancing especially in the field of psychiatric disorder hopefully these uncle tomtomist stereotypessex war and jujuwill dissolve as an increasing number of subsaharan dances become known in the west as a natural consequence of the triumph of black nationalism the ballets ajricaines which brought the good earth of the republic of guineas folk dancing to the usa in the early sixties actually represented the merest indication of more to come as one of the most choreographic continents on earth wakes up to its deepest cultural potential no fewer than three pavilions at the worlds fair offered or will offer african dancing at the african pavilion one could witness exciting choreographic episodes from the ivory coast east africa and other places practically every hour on the hour in tropical africa the highest art form is the dance comparable to the place of symphonic music or architecture in our own culture writing in the twenties about the southern parts of nigeria ethnologist p amaury talbot was emphatic indeed amid the tribes of this region the dance may be taken as the chief method of portraying and giving vent to the emotions traditional africans know this of course as evidenced by the amiable boast of the kaleda dancers although all signs point to the capital importance of the dance in africa mention of this esthetic activity is almost entirely omitted from no less an authority than the international african institutes ethnograhic survey why perhaps because of the relative unimportance of dance in western european culture anthropologist james h howard admits candidly most ethnographers ignore the dance completely as something beneath their consideration howard suggests that one ought to accord the dance at least the same importance as it is given by the people you study by that criterion every working monograph on an african society ought it seems to me to indicate something about dancing until americans are exposed to frequent reports with critical focus on african choreography uncle tomtom with a leer on his face and a spear in his hand is likely to play havoc with the intellectual issues the dancers of the ivory coast zululand burundi sierra leone and guinea currently raise at the worlds fair for the eye is notoriously subjective and the uncle tomtomist sees only what he wants to see this is so pervasive a problem that when one dance troupe came to the usa from africa the press found nothing more substantial to report essentially than in which cities the girls were allowed to dance with bared bosoms and in what cities they were not how urgent is the solution of this problem very for the dancers of africa are already features of the worlds fair uncle tomtom not only downgrades authentic materials but negro digest december grants wide latitude to african and afrolatin phonies as well thus at least one american negro has donned nigerian robes memorized a few ethnic beats mostly from haiti culled from lps and chanting africa with a short american a beguiled teenage safaris by afternoon and adult safaris by night into believing they had just made contact in a nightclub with base line african music then enter his dancers throwing their respective pelvises in all directions grunting and stamping and posturing sexily with a touch of interpretive via india with these and other problems in mind i have attempted to write a brief sketch of some of the more salient aspects of african dance one hopes that these suggested traits will serve as grains of sand around which the intelligent amateur of african dance can spin at the fair the pearls of his own appreciation here they are apart dancing it is worth noting reported monsieur f de kersaintgilly in that in negro africa man and woman never put their arms around each other while they dance as we do in france this puts a finger upon the key characteristic of west african dance suppose we call this trait apart dancing by which is meant that although two or more persons may dance facing or beside each other contact is rarely established and never prolonged observe for example the ivory coast traditional dance called digreba at the fair a young female dancer heavily painted with kaolin and splendidly attired in rattles a necklace of large beads loud yellow raffia bra and cloth skirt dances among equally colorfully dressed young men but they never form a couple each dancer remains a separate entity and acts for the most part independently of all others a far cry indeed from the european embrace dance part of our culture from the moment we learn the foxtrot which seems to have evolved from the sixteenth century drehtanz turning dance in central europe almost from the beginning this remote ancestor of the american teenagers cheektocheek stimulated the invectives of organized moral indignation thus stubbes in his the anatomie of the abuses in ailgna for what kissing and bussing what smouching and slabbering one of another what filthie groping and uncleane handling is not practiced in those dancings by contrast for what chaste distance one from another is not maintained in the ivory coast digreba at the african pavilion the association of dance with sexual proclivity is a largely european problem what dance bigots refuse to recognize is the impertinence of this preoccupation when applied to subsaharan dance tradition wherein man and woman if they dance in the same company at all always dance apart from one another when we watch the ivory coasters and remember that three basic traits of couple dancing in the west are linked or embraced position synchrony of movement and limited body english ours eyes are primed to savor the complex implications of african apart dancing the apart dancer as it were unlocks his arms from the european embrace and gives them back to the dance his torso is equally liberated this sets the stage for the second basic trait of tropical african dance total body movement when the zulu male dancers perform at the fair at times all of the muscles of their bodies seem to be used incessant wavelike ripples activate their shoulder blades arms and backs even the zulu women when seated in a dance vibrate their bodies from the waist up amidst a rich mosaic of song offbeat whistling and a marvelous female vocal effect called ukuyiyiza to incite people to defend themselves or as a sign of happiness total body dancing is handsomely attendant in the negro new world one scholar finds that the whole body is used in afrobrazil courlander describes gross direct movements in haiti and the wittiest report of all marshall stearns has portrayed one especially vibrant united states jazz dancer as a oneman laocoon doubtless one of the most accessible repositories of the africanism which links in spirit not genetically new york to zululand is spanish harlem mambo thus in the early sixties practically every wednesday evening at the palladium on broadway one could observe earl lovell a brooklynborn negro rattling his shoulders waving arms bent at the elbow shimmying his kicks in short activating most of his body this parceling out of dance rhythms to every part of the physical frameso evident in the work of the female dancer of digreba at the fairis the choreographic equivalent of the west african musical trait of dominance of percussion there is a lot of percussion and several meters to get around in west african music listen carefully to the musician on filin gbe a giant drum from bouafle country in the ivory coast at the fair and it will become clear he is playing a different time signature against the meter followed by his confreres on smaller drums the body cannot absorb all these meters in the feet as in the foxtrot or even in the arms and legs as in the highland fling but must interpret them through the head shoulders hip and torso too dances of derision clearly the dancing at the fair is a mere sampling and one element of african dancing that i sorely missed there was the dance of derision choreographic equivalents of the african song of allusion a form of social control whereby a soloist or negro digest december a group sings about the pretensions or misdemeanors of an individual to make him literally face the music and inspire him to behave or recognize his fallibility are one of the most striking practices of tropical africa kaigh calls them dances of domestic oddities and found them among the zulu of south africa they dance after any event white or black which takes their fancy i have seen danced imitations of myself and party too veracious to be flattered or even comfortable after i had lost a steeplechase by being thrown from the horse my boys danced the accident so faithfully that i came away a sadder if not wiser clown the boy who took the part of me was most embarrassingly accurate as to detail these boys had danced a sly dig at their white master announcing in dance movement a sabotage of the myth of white supremacy pride and pretension are as much a target of the west african as well as south african zulu dancer as they are of the singer one wishes the zulu at the fair would dance a satire of some of the sunburnt tourists from darkest america who push and crowd about the dance pit at the african pavilion and smirk at what they see the colonial authorities of northern rhodesia were clearly aware of the purpose and force of the dance of derision or so chapter section of the laws of that area implies no person may organize or take part in any dance which is calculated to hold up to ridicule or to bring into contempt any person religion or duly constituted authority dances of derision have been reported across the face of west africe from mali where they have been described as satires in action to the capital of the nupe people in the northern region of nigeria now and then the young men will imitate with comic exaggeration a typical womens dance or caricature the walk and gestures of women this specific tendency may well have given the jazz dance some of its special flavor thus leadbelly the famed negro blues guitarist was also expert at countrystyle buckandwing clog dancing in one number he would imitate the gait of all the women of shreveport high and low pete seeger whether dreamt up in negro america or in nigeria these satires in action refer back to apart dancing as the key to understanding it is wellnigh impossible to poke fun at your partner or her dance by any means other than vocal when you are tightly locked to her in western embrace position my friends at the african pavilion tell me that they know several satiric dances and may incorporate one or two into their presentations before the fair is over next year posture one of the most frequent postures of west african dance is a matter of moving according to harold courlander with the feet flat on the ground the knees bent and the back swayed the female dancer of digreba at the fair is an almost classic demonstration of this point when she bends her knees and dances about with flywhisks in either hand there are other postures in african dance of course but the bentknees swayedback mode is certainly prevalent at least on the guinea coast thus an american if he wants to look for substance instead of smut at the african sierra leone guinea and sudan pavilions at the worlds fair can look for apart dancing total body movement dances of derision and typical posture all of the dances are apart dances and all activate the human frame in ways that demand great precision and wit in the corporeal exploration of polyrhythmic music with as professor paul bohannan tells us the head moving in one rhythm the shoulders in another the arms in still a third the torso in another and the feet in still another africans have evolved one of the most remarkable art forms on earth the folcroft incident the young man had t f y been married for four z years before he decided to look for a new home his daughter terri lynne was two years old and horace baker a technician for the radio condenser company of camden n j felt that it was time to take his wife sarah a yearold nurse at pennsylvania hospital away from west

came to delmar village and breathed the fresh air and created an allwhite community where there was no black skin to remind them of the slums when they did see a negro their out their old hatred sometimes in obscene children heard and also expressions came and learned to hate now the negroes were coming again thought delmar village it was fine for the church to preach that was its purpose but

returned to their homes to sleep the house at heather road was ready for horace and sarah baker some of these people have had unpleasant experiences with negroes said sarah baker all that is necessary is for them to see that we live the same way they do go to work come home and try to keep our home and property as clean as humanly possible said horace baker if we cannot live up to a challenge like this we will have no place to go the bakers were ready to move on the morning of august a glazier sent by a baptist church in philadelphia appeared with the first sunlight and replaced the first floor windows at heather road some groups of teenagers shouted at him for a while and then talked among themselves of what would happen if the bakers tried to move the rumors said the bakers would come to the village at am the glazier cut his hand taking out the broken glass state police were now entirely in charge road blocks sealed off all entrances to the area to keep out the curious major singleton schaeffer commandant of the th state police district surveyed the already growing crowd of informally dressed demonstrators and turned on his heel the major was dressed in civilian clothes and was smoking a pipe he was going to let the sun burn some of the anger out of these people an naacp leader william cecil moore president of the darby area branch criticized major schaeffer for the four hour delay of the bakers claiming the trooper was not a policeman but a politician it was a day full of resentment the troopers and their major though undermanned because of the labor day holiday and almost overwhelmed at one point later in the evening did an excellent job their first program was to gain the respect of the crowd they did this efficiently by snuffing each point of friction as it appeared during the long hot afternoon they refused to give an inch there was a healthy fear of the troopers by the time the bakers arrived members of a local naacp chapter approached a roadblock and were told not to enter the area they wished to stage a counter demonstration a peaceful strike im afraid there wont be anything peaceful down there said a state trooper at the barricade the crowd at heather road was restless someone was passing out copies of an american nazi party publication the stormtrooper numbering about eight hundred as the arrival time approached the gathering had the appearance of a harmless community outing a family entertainment children played in the street running among the legs of adults standing there teenage boys sat on the hoods of police cars legs dangling and wives with their hair in curlers pushed baby carriages up closer to the center of the festive excitement so they wouldnt miss anything as always when there is any kind of audience to appreciate humorless slang humor adolescent toughs shirts unbuttoned and tails hanging over pegged trousers put on a spirited verbal rebellion against authority the troopers and this time they had the approval of their parents there were women agitators also their shrill complaints were half for the benefit of their neighbors and half for the stern impassive faces of the troopers a slender woman arms folded across a pink blouse hair in curlers delivered all of the following in one continuous burst of indignation you wouldnt want them living next to you now would you they come in and right away make it like trash i wouldnt never mind a nice clean white man but i dont want niggers i hate them i know youze aint niggerlovers you just got a job to do but still i dont see negro digest december no black state troopers the police moved restlessly alert in their grey uniforms only occasionally turning their backs riot sticks dangling from their wrists a trooper walked slowly down the long line of jeering young faces and in each hand he carried a blackjack a pile of rocks bottles eggs and vegetables was collected on the lawn in front of the bakers home as the crowd was searched for anything that might become a weapon later on students from crozer seminary in chester and ministers from several local parishes came silently to protest the demonstration and to welcome the baker family a stone glanced off one of the new windows and a fresh round of eggs splattered against the walls the five members of the clergy moved up the terraced lawn and stood in front of the threatened home to face the jeering swearing mob the barrage continued five state troopers went into the mob and pulled out one man forcing him into a folcroft patrol car driven by chief myers if you take that man chief youre out of a job you a niggerlover too the car drove away father chapman also came in the morning and walked among his parishioners talking to those he recognized they were out here doing what he had told them was a sin they did not understand but they are black they said and shattered all the windows in the home father chapman went away and did not come back again gee i sure wish theyd come said a tall young thing dressed in pink curlers and shorts she leaned against a chain link fence listening to a transistor radio and chewing her gum waiting im so fed up said a folcroft patrolman who was guarding a street into the village id shoot the first black bastard that even looked at me funny a darkhaired tough walked up to a reporter and showed him a series of scratches on his leg lookit what the black bastards did to me why dont you print that in your papers two of em over in darby cut me with a knife the crowd waited but the bakers were not there on time several of the women and a group of kids sat down in the street and chanted two four six eight we dont want to integrate mocking the southern protests a boy carrying an american flag led his gang in a march up and down behind the troopers we want our freedom too they dont really know what the hell theyre doing said a trooper none of it made any sense it was getting late in the afternoon and uncomfortably warm there was a reporter from the pennsylvania guardian who had a full beard as he stood beyond the line of state police with the other members of the press he suddenly became a communist agitator and a niggerloving pig a housewife pointed out this fact to the others and they took up the cry communist agitator you can smell that pig from here senator mccarthy must be smiling in his grave said the reporter it still works none of it made any sense it was almost pm and many of the demonstrators had tired of waiting then all the troopers were given lastminute instructions major schaeffer had given the goahead more troopers came down heather road using their cars to force the crowd out of the street and onto the sidewalks someone leaped on the hood of a moving police car and four troopers burst through its doors and carried him into a waiting police wagon major schaeffer cleaned his glasses and walked the length of the now howling seething mob looking for another candidate this was it there could be no mistake this time or someone would get seriously hurt pipesmoking niggerlover if you dont come home and eat your dinner i wont let you come back and then youll miss it all a young mother told her son a cordon of troopers cleared the lawn and street in front of heather road here they come here they come hey theyre really cornin waitll you see this young voices announce the news of a moving van in the village the bakers follow the truck and are greeted by a fresh burst of insane catcalls go home niggers stay with your own kind we dont want you here niggers nigger nigger nigger ignoring the ugliness of the sounds and the faces of their new neighbors the bakers walk up the cement stairs to their new home accompanied by phillip savage director of the tristate naacp isabelle strickland president of a local chapter and t s clements a baptist minister the white clergymen who have been waiting at the door of their home greet them and shake hands they enter as a hail of stones and vegetables bounces from the walls outside people have come like locusts running calling to each other in the excitement filling the street and the alleyway next to the home the bakers are at home five minutes later the only two whole windows in their home are gone in ten minutes the rear window of their car hit by two bricks is shattered into dust and chrome strips are pulled from its sides the police meet violence with violence pulling a teenager from the crowd and pushing him into the car which is waiting for him look they got new furniture the black bastards hey scum can you hear me in there its just a matter of time wait till the troopers leave we want freedom in only a few minutes a bored audience of has become a dangerous mob of almost troopers are hit by bricks coal cherry bombs eggs and saliva what we shoulda done is put the women and children right out in the street to block them off thats what the niggers do we shoulda planned this a lot more said a raging little woman who then turned back to the matter at hand and continued to shout niggerlovers at the top of her voice there are some calm voices who do not share in the hatred right now i am ashamed to say i live here said mrs arlene crecco a resident of the village for five years me and my husband dont see eye to eye on this but im disgusted at what theyre doing to their children said mrs crecco when they start to teach kids like that hatred where do they draw the line thats what id like to know she said a trooper took a hunting knife from one of the toughs two delmar village wives walked away from heather road all the bakers furniture was now inside the battered little home now that one of them has got in all of them will start to come said one of them to a group of reporters we hadda work hard to pay off our homes here and now the niggers will come and ruin the value of our property why dont you print that its the truth the family of william e myers moved into levittown in august and successfully weathered a hail of curses and stones and burning crosses the myers were the first negro family in levittowns community of and were greeted by an eightday riot today there are a total of nine negro families in levittown property values per unit have risen as much as and higher there have been no new incidents since the disturbance the moving van left and troopers braced themselves for an exhausting evening the afternoon of waiting in the sun had weakened some of the mobs anger and many threw their remaining curses at the greyuniformed cordon and returned to their homes for the evening meal it was friday and the smell of sea food was in the air all a them is on the side of the niggers explained one particularly furious little woman who had offered periodical bits of opinion all during the afternoon this time she referred to members of the press still clustered on the bakers lawn and theyre all trying to brainwash every one of us you me everybody she told a trooper every time you look in a paper or turn on the television what do ya see or hear about niggers thats what they talk about giving them rights and freedom but at the same time they take away all of our rights that barnett is right weve got to fight all this brainwashing look at the niggerlovers theyll m never tell our side of the story how would you like to be married to that one said a trooper shes been out here screaming all afternoon a long night was about to begin for the bakers darkness came bringing fresh courage for the demonstrators early in the evening the crowd reached full strength more than one thousand angry and curious people as the fury of the bottlethrowing mob reached its highwater mark major schaeffer called for all the help he could get at midnight it subsided leaving the lawn in front of the bakers home covered an inch deep in broken glass and garbage p james mosley a white senior student at crozer seminary in chester who was among the clergy who drew the crowds anger by their presence in front of the bakers home stayed with the bakers during their first evening at home he helped sweep away the debris saturday morning no i dont think any of us were afraid mosley other ministers phillip savage and the bakers but they did get awfully close to the house i had begun to wonder if the police were keeping anyone away said mosley at saturday morning troopers arrived to reinforce the deadtired troopers already on duty what remained of the mob was told to return to their homes twelve mounted troopers trained in handling riots were dispatched to patrol delmar village streets we kept our sense of humor through the whole business during the night we thought up more crazy jokes than dick gregory will think up in ten years he said yeah said savage if the negroes started a campaign to buy burial lots in allwhite cemeteries the civil_rights theme song would change from kwe shall overcome to we shall undertake vjrf it is the day after glass is being swept from the floors inside heather road mounted policemen lift children onto their saddles and give them rides as they patrol the long lines of row houses the man stands on his front porch and sees the litter on his lawn the screen door will have to be replaced up the street children are running in the early sunlight soon he will bring his own daughter to live here when it is safe the next step is to go along with life said horace baker the tension and hatred that did all this will die down in time no insult no intimidation no threat no nothing will make me leave he said troopers came up the stairs bringing food to the embattled couple and protestant ministers arrived with the they had collected to help repair the damaged home the only traffic in delmar village was families on their way to mass every citizen of this great nanegro digest december tion of ours has the right to select the home of his choice said protestant and catholic pastors to their sunday flocks in the afternoon male home owners of the village met and issued a statement saying that they deplored the violence of the demonstration outsiders were to blame but that they planned boycotts of any business which serves or deals with the bakers we do not welcome the baker family into our community they said because of the way they arrived perhaps this small borough can show this great nation that the federal government cannot force social integration upon the population another naacp plot said delmar village tuesday september the bakers went shopping in a local shopping center the press reported the community was adjusting rapidly collections taken by clergymen of all denominations went over the mark to help the bakers repair their home the local delaware county aflcio council started raising funds to pay union tradesmen to work on the damage they reported another monday september mayor mcvicker said the borough has made a marvelous recovery it was the same day the bakers went back to work for the first time since moving to the village they also brought terri lynne home to live with them it was safe reporters at the incident took a long look at the character of the rioters they make me sick said a cameraman they make african tribes look pretty good from here i think you might be wrong said an old reporter dabbing at a stain on his shirt where he had been hit by an egg theyre out there right now making my good opinion of them look bad but their only real sin is a lack of imagination of intelligence this makes them try to find answers in a hurry through violence he said another tv editor took the pipe out of his mouth to agree sure he said give people just like these some good cause and watch them then they go without food and sleep and money to dig two guys out of a mine cavein the fellin mine near hazleton pennsylvania but he added tell them they have a chip on their shoulders which many of them do or quick tempers and theyll knock out half the teeth in your head to prove how mildmannered they are the sad thing is that theyre out here throwing rocks and garbage because they dont understand said the old reporter one last observation on thursday august after the bakers had made a first attempt to reach their new home a postman walked through the mob carefully sorting a handful of letters he glanced at and then crossed the street easing the strap from his worn leather bag further up on one shoulder someone called his name and he nodded except for that no one seemed to notice him at all but when you think about it whats so unusual about a colored mailman i have a dream said the reverend martin_luther_king theres too much hypocrisy on civil_rights i think the time has come for some plain speaking on the prob lem of civil_rights words have a way of losing their fundamental meaning through overuse for instance the words freedom democracy and security lose the strength of meaning with repetition and so we find that when people speak of civil_rights they seem to be saying it in a rather casual way one gets that sort of feeling when listening to some of these heated discussions on civil_rightsthat too many of the people dont quite mean what they say or dont quite know what they mean they have carried from their early school years an acceptance that civil_rights is a basic right of all the people they regard civil_rights which is another word for human rights as something that they are of course for and that every decent person must be forand there can be no question about their position on it unfortunately this ready acceptance all too often blows sky high when some of these same people become involved in a civil_rights matter in a personal way at such a time they come face to face with the problem of what amounts to a separation of attitudes on the one side is the right of privacy and all the many privileges that go with it such as the choice of company choice of club choice of friends and whatever social categories with which one elects to associate but on the other side is the attitude they are obligated to practice outside their homes and clubs here their freedom is subject to the other peoples rights and public policy here rights to free action must be accommodated to the rights and freedoms of othersand anyone who would refuse to go along with that commitment is going against the current of american present day thought and action again our rights of privacy and the privileges of free social choices we may enjoy in our homes are inviolateand there we can do and say as we please but when we are out in public and deal in such areas as public transportation public parks public schools hospitals housing and such our rights are limited to where they do not infringe on the rights of others regardless of the color of their skin or what neighborhoods they come from in the eyes of the law and under our system there are no levels or degrees of privilege the protection of the dignity and freedom of one man is as sacred as that of the next man if we are to enjoy all the benefits of equality there can be no special publicly privileged class or any discriminations there are those among us who are still afflicted with the prejudices and primitive hostilities of a bygone age which transcend their other good intentions and good qualities for example whom one eats with or where is a personal choice whom one invites to his home or private club that is a social matter and it is of no concern to the community but when it comes to public places and facilities involving the health education and economic opportunities of all the people thats something else again there is no room here for prejudice bigotry or special pleading and no unfair discrimination personal likes or local hostilities should bar any citizen and that means every citizen regardless from obtaining an education seeking any job he is capable of holding and being entitled to a decent place in which to live and to bring up his family in considering the broad question of civil_rights some of us tend to confuse our likes and dislikes with what is right and wrongand as a matter of fact in our public behavior toward our fellow citizens as well as to mankind everywhere it is necessary to understand and practice to do what is right and not what we happen to like or not to like too often the things we either like or dislike turn out to be wrong so what we must understand is that we are dealing with the differences of right and wrong and what amounts to the difference between fair treatment or mistreatment of our fellow man as james m barrie expressed it the secret of happiness is not doing what one likes but in liking what one has to do from the early beginnings of our history we as a nation have been dedicated to the belief that all men are created equal and that differences of race color religion or national origin should not be cause to deny anyone equality of treatment and equality of opportunity this nation has been from its very beginning a haven for the oppressed of other landsand surely we cannot tolerate oppression in our own land we have managed to produce a highly successful and stable society under our system of government in preserving a free and open society to help maintain that way of life we need to balance our personal liberties with group authority for practical purposes we operate generally under a majority rule procedure but we learn from past history that majority rule if unrestrained could lead to tyranny and oppression the founding fathers understood this very well they made sure this would not happen when they provided for the protection of the dignity and liberty of the individual by attaching a bill of rights to the constitution this made it a matter of the basic organic law of this nation that all would enjoy freedom of worship freedom of peaceful assembly and equal participation in the choice of government on all levels the question naturally arises as to why we are continuing to experience resistance from some quarters in putting into full working practice these rights which we have been duty bound to do for over one hundred years perhaps one of the answers is that under our thin coat of company manners we are preoccupied with selfishness in other words we are still living by a double standard there are in every community the social snobs the economically overprivileged the selfserving political bigots to whom human rights are revolutionary subversive words these are people with special problemsand we understand them for they regard themselves above the crowd but i find it difficult to understand some of those able and intelligent men who speak for those southern states in a manner truly representative of those statesand surely not of these times if their hard unyielding position on the civil_rights bill is the customary delaying action and yet another contest to defer the inevitable i think these men are badly mistaken and are hurting the nation where it is most damaging i would hope that they would choose instead to cooperate with the inevitable and hasten the day when as a united nations we can pursue many other urgent tasks which need to be dealt with for the security of the nation we have had all the sectionalism and needless local rivalries we can stand we have enormous tasks ahead of us to meet threats from without without having to weaken our position by senseless divisions among ourselves we are flanked by two gigantic powers one on each side of us communist russia and red china they are driven by a fanatical zeal to impose their archaic system on the rest of the world they are determined to destroy us if we fail to resolve the issues of civil_rights between states and the federal government we shall surely be extending the new tyrannies a helping hand we are faced with many complex internal problems which will tax our courage and intelligence for many years to come one of these serious problems has been developing in our industrial centers where chronic unemployment is rapidly reaching a critical stage due to the growth of automationthe machine age another crisis is developing on our farms where mechanization is resulting in a great new productivity and an ever diminishing farm force these men on the farm added to the men in the factories who are being displaced by machines should not be dismissed as unfortunate casualties of the industrial age and abandoned to a life of tragic idleness for which they were in no way responsible i know of no area of public concern that requires more urgent attention than the need to find new ways and areas into which to channel these millions of unemployed where they can be restored to usefulness and productivity where they can retain their dignities as gainfully employed members of our society then there is the as yet unsolved problem of how we are going to meet our responsibility for guarding and protecting the publics health this has been put off too longmostly for no good reason we should be concerned with the problems of health as they affect the lives of all of our people the life and health of each of us must be regarded as equally important to all of us there continues to be a serious maldistribution of doctors nurses technicians and facilities in all fields of medical care every industrial nation in the world has seen to it that this need which could not be left to discretion and control of privately organized medicine had to be supported by a nationally sponsored program yet in this country regarded as the most advanced of nations we are being held back from adopting a program of general welfare by the faulty logic of organized pressure groups which make no more sense than the arguments advanced by those who would deny all citizens their civil_rights these are no longer partisan political problemsthese go beyond political debate the time for that has long passed we have put off action far too long it is over sixteen years since i proposed to deal with the problem of civil_rights during my presidency at the time i directed the military to abolish segregation and proposed to the congress to enact a civil_rights program we have been trying to advance that cause step by step but it has been painfully slow i hope that we can now proceed to put into effect the comprehensive program now before the congressso that w we can get on with the many other urgent tasks before us we have had too much talkit is time for action the negro americas abstract man until a few years ago a favorite game of mine went something like this id make a mental listing of all the generalizations american white people were known to entertain about negroes then proceed in my every contact with them to behave just the opposite at first glance this would seem old hat for a large number of american negroes already act out this role and its necessity has remained one of the real tragedies in their daytoday relationships with whites but my game was subtler more confounding i would take the reverse stereotypes and in turn reverse them without somehow returning to the starting place thus where many negroes were supposed to be officious and over dressed i strove to be relaxed and casual or where i was expected to covet things like automobiles i made it quite clear my values lay elsewhere the reward for this absurd behavior was of course to watch in delight while the white mans carefully constructed universe crumbled beneath him a spectacle i still find extremely gratifying and compelling there was however still another more urgent motive the desire to somehow convince my fellow american that i was in the final analysis just a human being not a victim or a moral or a clause in the constitutionbut a plain old natural phenomenon like him and this is where it ultimately failed me this little game of mine i was a private in the army a friendship developed with a fellow soldier from boston and the matter of his whiteness and my negroness couldnt have seemed more remote for our relationship was based on a sound enough premise a likeness of background and temperament then one day the training ended and the discussion as army discussions will fell to the matter of womenin this case the female population of the little white community near the installation it was then that i made an amazing discovery that in the mental world of this intelligent perceptive and socially conscious young person i existed in a fantastic manner one as strange and eerie as all the re gions of the mind on the one hand in our relationship was my immediate self a kindred spirit with whom he talked and drank and damned the army while on the other hand was the negro i stood for something different altogether something vast impersonal and ultimately terrifying and to be dealt with independently it was then i discovered what every american negro must eventually discover and try to accept that defy the stereotypes though i may confound to my hearts content all his neat generalizations nothing i really said or did or thought of myself could ever begin to destroy that carefully designed pattern of thought that appears so vital to the american white man in his view of the negroa view that has become less a representation of the real world than a myth a symbol an abstraction and which is at the very root of what we call the race problem for we are of course ducking the real issue if we deny that the only possible reality of this persisting question is its existence in the minds of the majority population thus nothing will be solved so long as we persist in employing the abraham lincoln approach in place of the more realistic more painful freudian frame of reference but history has nonetheless assigned statesmanship to the task and a great deal of the negros rage i think springs from his dim awareness that this is a deliberate scapegoat and it no more represents the real confrontation between himself and american race prejudice than the imposition of social reform as a cure for paranoia for the th century american negro obviously is less a man than an idea to his countrymen he is firstly the negro and only secondly the physician the socialist the bastard or simply mr jones should he write a book of win a nobel peace prize or climb a flagpole in his undergarments it is invariably noted that a negro has done these things somehow not an american somehow not a man it is this abstraction moveover which renders him so easily a victim to injustice and atrocity that he is somehow not a fleshandblood human presence like bill jones next door but a vast impersonal lifeless abstraction and even his countrymens acts of good faith are thereby suspect offered as they invariably are on the basis of justice freedom or one of the other noble principles which testify so plainly so offensively to the impersonal manner in which he addresses himself to the negro it is this abstract approach i think which is the basis of james baldwins reference to the white mans impertinent assumption that he must accept you an assumption that dodges altogether the all too obvious fact that it is he not you who is in need of salvation this assumption be it noted is far from conscious so that when an american says he believes in the intrinsic equality of the races more often than not he is telling the truthso far as his conscious faculties tell him it is true but cast away the abstractions allow one of those intrinsically equal beings of his own accord to behave as such allow one to say establish a more than casual relationship with a white female a perfectly natural phenomenon even negroes often forget between animals of like species and opposite sex or to aspire to goals outside his reservation to exercise his intrinsic right to live where he chooses seek the neighbors friends inlaws of his own sovereign choice allow one to even exhibit a little more than middling intelligence sensibility valor insofar as these exist outside his own restricted category of the universe outside the abstractions in short allow one to behave in any way as though he too believed in his intrinsic equality and had determined to arrange his life accordinglyand something quite remarkable takes place within his countryman something that defies all his rationalities something as old as the civilization of europe let us cite a few examples of this abstract approach and how conveniently it masks the real confrontation between negroes and whites there is for example the case of congressional representative adam clayton powell whose petulant words they never forgave me for leaving the plantation stirred up such indignation a few years ago irrelevant was the outraged replyand irrelevant they most apparently were as a defense of the charge at hand some infraction or other of the code by which congressmen supposedly behave yet not ultimately irrelevant the fact is that of the some americans who make up our national house of representatives powell has remained by far the most intimidated and harassed and relevant or irrelevant his complaint invoked a basic truth about the attitude of nearly all american whites to just about all american negroes an attitude held over from the feudal days of our country when their universe was quite differently constructed so that even today it is one thing for a negro to become a congressman and address himself to the affairs of this country as though they were in some measure his affairs too but quite another thing for that same negro to claim a committee chairmanship and to marry a caucasian and and but powell is the happy exception here for the most tragic effect of all of the abstract approach and its resulting ghetto has been its awful stain on the negros own psychology how he looks at the universe and his place in it while still a soldier i happened to be passing a weekend in st louis the local negro ywca had been conducting weekly dances for servicemen in the area and a companion and i had planned to attend as we often did during our excursions to the city this time however we were informed the program was discontinued and advised to try the downtown y which had a similar recreation now you would have to have been born a negro in america and reared in a ghetto to have attended segregated schools churches social clubs to have planned your entire future your marriage your job where you intended to live all in accordance with the fact that you were indeed a negro in order to understand the genuine mental crisis this prospect caused my companion as far as he was concerned this boy out of a northern ghetto the evening was overfor the downtown branch was white and we who were not white did not really belong there and there ultimately is the productthe final grotesque product of one of the most sustained and unrelenting systems of racial quarantine in the history of western civilization and all the more merciless for its good faith for its smiling american camaraderie and goodfellowship a situation that renders frustrating even mental protest one so carefully cloaked in abstractions the victim often loses sight of what it really implies about his utmost being as it turned out he happened to be right my prudent friend for no sooner had i arrived and completed the first dance than i was approached very respectfully by a gentleeyed middleaged woman whom i took to be the hostess and given a remarkable offer if for some reason i was not having a good time she would be only too glad to refund my moneyfifty cents in this case of course i assured her i was having a tremendous time and appreciated her concern what i then asked was the cause for this concern this was obviously unexpected and for a split second i think she was compelled to look squarely at the situation well she said at length recovering as it were her frame of reference to be perfectly frank its difficult for the girls to dance with you before the implication of this could sink in she quickly began the old spiel about tradition and attitudes and eventual understanding and the other cloaks behind which such white people hide the remarkable distress of their inner lives and there followed that smile that nervous distraught american smile that every reasonably sensitive negro has felt in his deepest entrails to be the most rending insult of them all you understand dont you she beamed appealing oddly to my reason but what was i really to understandthat i was a kind of subhumanthat i was somehow a shameful natural phenomenon whose very presence in human traffic heralds disaster this i was unready to understand moreover this is not at all what i was called upon to understand by regarding me fundamentally as an issue and not a kindred human being she was quite unable to see the appalling reality of her offer she was not humiliating a fellow human being an american soldier in uniform she was upholding moderation in the mixing of the races and in that regard her conscience was completely untouched this incident is important not only because of its ghastly testimony of the nations foremost spiritual sicknessand one which ultimately will defy any ratiocinative solutionbut because it indicates how subtly its real face has been hidden behind issues behind abstractions the antagonist be it noted was no ruffian who is much more easily dealt with but one of those christianly matronly types one often finds around ywcas and other institutions of good work the kind that raises such a sincere fuss over racial atrocities in the south the kind even to perhaps actively protest some particularly odious injustice yet who herself was able in all good faith to inflict an atrocity every bit as inhuman in its own way as a mississippi lynching not all such insults are so obvious some are less immediately felt yet ultimately just as destructive as one of those glaring we reserve the right notices that so impersonally rob the american negro of his human legacy and place him in a special category of the species as a newspaper reporter in washington d c i was assigned one day to cover a hearing by the house unamerican activities committee subpoenaed were a dozen or so u s students and young adults including paul robeson jr son of the negro concert singer who defected to europe the group had been accused of antiamerican demonstrations at the russiansponsored world youth festival in vienna and included the usual array of bearded youths and ponytailed coeds actor yul brynner happened to be in the audience and the entire assembly as is often the case at hu ac sessions was rather a gay festive theater gathering to these merry young people robeson contrasted sharply a sober mannerly youth in plain suit and tie his protest was very different from theirs less theoretical more immediate we talked several minutes before the hearing with robeson and his counsel explaining the details of their case suddenly the lawyer glanced at me and asked of course youre from the afroamerican a more conventional phrasing might have been what newspaper do you represent or something but no offense was taken at least not by me beneath his calm reserved exterior the youthful and sensitive robeson had recognized it for what it was another case of the american need to classify to categorize of the sort that perhaps had sent him off to vienna in the first place and falling so carelessly from the lips of the very person assigned to defend his protest a lawyer of no small reputation locally as a champion of negro causes robesons resentment was infectious and so as to make at least a middling comeback i rejoined of course youre from the aclu american civil liberties union childishness perhaps but maybe not consider such assumptions multiplied a thousand times dominating the negros every encounter with whitesreflecting a vigilant awareness not only of the obvious differences of appearance often of dialect etc but some kind of cosmic difference decreeing that the negro journalist is really less a journalist than a negro journalist or that an american leader who happens to be a negro is necessarily a negro leader and so on in short decreeing that the negro is fundamentally an abstraction and only secondarily a man hollywood has helped sustain and therefore contributed to this national illusion by keeping the negro an abstraction at first glance it would almost seem contrived remembering that one out of ten americans is a negro it is difficult to otherwise explain his almost complete absence from any account of american life outside of those which involve him in the abstract as an issue or as a shadowy servant there is of course no conscious contrivance this is simply the only manner in which the negro impresses himself on the average american not that he would consciously make the exclusion it simply would never occur to the ordinary casting director to launch a film in which the protagonist or the villain or any minor character just happened to be a negro in the sense that the bank teller just happened to be bald or the private detective just happened to be wearing a checkered overcoat it simply would never occur to him that any negro had a thing at all to do with life in america other than slavery oppression intermarriage passing or one of the other insulting abstractions with which he identifies nonwhites in general and negroes in particular of course it might be argued that hollywood didnt create the world least of all america that in american life the negro does by and large pose some problem or other either of his own making or the white mans that he is not just an american just a man yet this argument when really examined reflects still another of the limitless assumptions with which the american white man addresses himself to the negro does it raise the question for instance as to whether the negro considers himself anything beyond or below an american a man i personally know many negroes who qualify as americans to an almost alarming degree who are just as freeenterprising and castrohating as the most provincial midlander who share the national pride fears and myths with every bit as much fervor as any daughter of the american revolution and yet they are not really americans for they in no way exist as such in the minds of their countrymen a feature of the current emancipation commemoration has been the vogue among orators to cite the all too obvious fact of the negros continued enslavement but only the sharpest insights most notably james baldwins have pointed to the far more pertinent factthat negroes are enslaved in turn by slaves the american white man is bound to a system at best pragmatic even in its heyday and which now lives on as a useless and imbecillic relic grotesquely dictating his psychology with the same inevitability it did in as for the intervening century it goes without saying that had normal developments taken place there would be no negro problem in the first place for the perfectly logical reason that there would be no negro except in the purely biological sense the normal cultural giveandtake would have swallowed up the negro into the mainstream of american life in exactly the same manner the absence of such barricades has liquidated the italian and to a lesser degree the jew and even the prospect of a negro attaining the presidency itself would raise as few eyebrows as say the election of a descendent of irishmen the late john f kennedy the difference of course has been the extraordinary antiamalgamation theory and its lingering influence on the white mans psychologyan influence that compels him to look at his fellow citizen not as the fleshandblood phenomenon that he is but as a huge lifeless and menacing abstraction to be dealt with accordingly now of course this system has not been entirely destructive isolated from mainstream values the american negro has been spared many of the more notorious characteristics of the th century american white man including what has been coined as the cult of conformity and its attendant mediocrity of outlook and poverty of soul they have remained indeed part of that great nonwestern world which from all visible indications is about to resume its proud chapters in history the american negro denied the decadence of prevailing manners barred from the appalling comforts of the suburbs has retained a kind of equilibrium a kind of easy serene skepticism born of healthy privation and lack of powers illusions nor can one who has grown up in the ghetto fail to appreciate its own peculiar lorenot just jazz and good times but a kind of realistic and very nonamerican way of reckoning with this terrifying world these things speak well for the ghetto but they in no way justify it for quite apart from its poverty and consequent crime and moral laxity is the harsh psychological effect of the ghetto on a people who realize that for some unexplained reason they are forced to live their the entire lives in quarantineor in a special category of their countrymens mind commenting on the soulless nature of unsleeping history as apart from the human souls who nonetheless make that history the late aldous huxley has made this point when such institutions are left to their insomnia when they are permitted to function according to the laws of their own being subordinating individual insight to collective tradition they become madnot like an individual lunatic but with a solemn traditional and systematic madness that is at once majestic and ludicrous grotesque and terrifying and who can fail to see the wide chasm between institutionalized american racial attitudes and the insight of the average individual american who nonetheless contributes to and sustains that institution every waking hour of his life the real tragedy of course is not mississippi or any isolated area or event in the whole of the system isolations which really provide only convenient scapegoats by which the system can escape the menace of selfreckoning the real tragedy is that million civilized vigorous and apparently talented people are being lost to historysimply because their country is terrified to look at them and find out who they really are chinn is one of jr the footnotes of his tory a lovely phantom who has eluded all but l fc fc w a the professional historian a beautiful skeleton rattling around in the closets of political greatness in the era of andrew jackson she was as important as the scandalous peggy eaton but today her name exists only in a few musty old county records and in the longforgotten accounts of the election of who was she who was this lady who was talked about behind the closed doors of washingtons female society who was ignored publicly as though she did not exist and yet was directly the cause of the collapse of the political career of one of the countrys outstanding liberals julia chinn was the common law wife of richard mentor johnson vicepresident of the united states during the first administration of martin van buren julia chinn was the second lady of the land in the period preceding the war between the states and a negro many southerners of this period had relationships with their female slaves many raised backyard families but these relationships were always pseudoclandestine their white wives were always obligingly blind to their husbands extramarital activity not so richard mentor johnson he could not marry julia legally but he took his obligations to his wife and two children seriously and treated them with every courtesy and consideration he was proud enough of his daughters to try to introduce them to washington society to use his influence to gain them acceptance in the ballrooms and banquet halls of the socially illustrous what a stir he must have created one account tells of how he was refused permission to seat his daughters on the reviewing stand where he had been invited as guest orator the girls waited in the carriage while he spoke as soon as he had finished his speech he strode from the platform and drove off angrily with them ignoring the rest of the program and the festivities held in his honor how naive is the historian who writes that richard mentor johnson never married and then proceeds to give an account of how he deeded to his children money and property and slaves legend has it that richard johnson had fallen in love with a poor seamstress and had been refused permission by his mother to marry the girl because of her lowly position in a fit of pique he took on the arrangement with julia a lovely slave who had been raised by his own mother whatever his motivation he accepted the alliance with solemn devotion was he a great man the people of kentucky would have responded with a violent negative his socalled doctrine of amalgamation exemplified by his own marital arrangements offended them to their peculiarly chivalrous senses he would have been more of a gentleman if he had sold his family on the slave block as many of them did to the westerners he was a great herothe slayer of the indian warrior tecumseh at the battle of thames during the war of severely wounded in this battle he carried scars for the rest of his life in spite of his reputation as an indian warrior it was he who had the compassion to organize some of the first indian schools even acting as a superintendent of one of them to the downtrodden eastern debtors he was a virtual savior advocating measures to aid them and to abolish debtors prisons he was devoted to the underdog as one colleague remarked the people loved him because he loved them first his views on many subjects including that of women in society was that of the most liberal of thinkers today he was an anachronisma misplaced progressive a contemporary and friend of andrew jackson he expressed ideas that might have been regarded as extreme today many questioned his relationship with julia chinn and speculated that it might have resulted from his failure with other women this is highly unlikely since he was handsome desirable exciting a white woman friend commented on his pleasant geniality and his strong masculinity a big man sturdy and capable he was looked on with favor by many washington ladies but he preferred julia his sweet and cherished mulatto wife as mistress of the great brick house at blue creek records show that there was a certain glamor in his careless dress the scarlet vest he always affected the cane the slight limp the steady smile his love of literature was wellknown and he spoke clearly in a language full of powerful metaphor the speech of a man who admired fine words and fine expression a writer of sorts his compositions were used as texts for the children of virginia he was also commissioned to record the history of battles and campaigns in which he took part he inherited a love of music from his mother and he had more than a passing knowledge of many instruments his greatest pleasure was to sit by the fire and listen to julia as she played on the pianoforte both the sight and the sounds were lovely his marital position was accepted by his colleagues in fact it apparently was of little importance to anyone andrew jackson had had his own troubles but won out despite charges of adultery that had been leveled at him and his wife rachel jackson had died brokenhearted still shunned by washingtons ladies jackson the widower president had become the defender of peggy eaton the lady who had scandalized society as a divorcee and by marrying the man who was supposedly the cause of the divorce the fact that her new husband was the secretary of war did not give her an automatic entry into the homes of other officials president jackson believing in peggys innocence and still rankling over the past insults to his rachel tried to force her down the throats of the wives of the other cabinet officials he chose as the champion and ambassador of his cause richard mentor johnson feeling that he had the right touch to handle this delicate situation the fact that johnsons own affairs were an affront to the mores of washington society seemed to have been overlooked at least they were overlooked until the election of it was then that the opposition felt they could gain political advantage by publicizing the story of johnson and julia and their two daughters imogene and adeline johnson had never denied his relationship to the two girls he had in fact reared them carefully hiring a white tutor who remarked frequently of the girls beauty and gentility he also remarked that as a stranger he would never have suspected that they were the children of a colored woman johnson could easily have fabricated a story and passed them off as white their education was vastly superior to the females of that day in accordance with their fathers standards julia was part of johnsons property inheritance from his father his mother a kindly talented woman had raised the slavegirl in her own genteel manner teaching her all the things that made her admirably suited to be mistress of blue creek she even managed the choctaw academy in johnsons absence she corresponded with him frequently giving him reports as to details in running the plantation and the school and he responded with suggestions and orders he sent the girls gifts and encouraged them to mind their lessons and learn both girls later married white men and their father deeded them each an estate adeline received blue creek and imogene land to the north it was natural perhaps for the southern states to object to johnsons candidacy for vicepresident in the newspapers of virginia screamed against his nomination saying that the negroes would have an esther at the throne to speak for them most of the other arguments were less polite however so great was johnsons popularity that he was chosen despite his domestic arrangements the election was a tie and went to the senate to be resolved there he was elected by a large majority his southern colleagues found that their loyalty to their party superceded their moral convictions most of them were not distressed by his relationship to a negro and a slave in fact many of them had the same sort of relationship their complaint was his lack of willingness to hide his indiscretions in the meantime during the period of the campaign julia was stricken with cholera in one of the great epidemics that swept the country and died shortly afterward johnson also lost his elder daughter he was extremely lonely and his whole life began to change stories of his degeneracy began to filter back to washington an old man physically unkempt living in a house he had let go to a shambles he had taken to himself a nineteenyear old negro girl after her there were others his public appearances became disgraceful he was slovenly his speech was disjointed vague desperate his oncekeen grasp of affairs was gone and only a fuzzy muddled mind remained his oncegreat appeal as the slayer of tecumseh was overshadowed by the great hurrah for the legendary general harrison the most promising liberal of the s was the hasbeen of the s the democratic party saw no profit in defending his action and as the second van buren campaign began johnson was dumped as candidate for the vicepresidency his whole career had ended with julias death what was her real role in his life she had been raised by his mother undoubtedly had many of his mothers mannerisms and ideas was it possible that she was his discipline a sort of reincarnation of jennie johnsons beliefs and standards did she set the pattern by which he lived and which disintegrated when she died there can only be speculation over her place in his life because records are so sketchy however while she lived johnson led a wellordered life attending to all the details of his many personal interests and to his political responsibilities with great expertness his skill and political value were great enough to allow his colleagues to tolerate his offenses against their standards but without julia he was only the remnants of a man who had missed greatness julia chinn is and perhaps will always remain only one of the interesting shadows that lurk in the pages of history the jim crow christ the pastor said he would rather see us afterward in his study we said wed wait we had plenty of time when we were alone with him he sat silent and then sighed and said what you say is true only too true but if i invited negroes to come to our church youd have to beg them to come said harry the crazy irishman they dont go for that halfhearted invitation stuff were here to ask you to beg them to come a look of quick pain passed across the pastors face as if his toe had been stepped on and then he began again if negroes came to our church our white members would fall away from what said harry the crazy irishman from their antichristianityour church said the pastor ignoring harry the crazy irishman would be empty except said harry for the least of them and for christ my church would be empty said the pastor you have got to understand my position what is your position said the crazy irishman are you running a box office or a house of god you have got to understand my position said the pastor still ignoring harry a minister can not be too far ahead of his congregation are you the shepherd of the flock or one of the sheep said harry the pastor by this time appeared to be inured to harrys impudence of course i agree with you gentlemen he said with emphasis on the gentlemen that the segregation of our colored brethren is deplorable we didnt say it was deplorable said harry we said it was antichristian deplorable said the pastor and this time there was a note of firmness in his voice that suggested that the crazy irishman was beginning to get to him but we have got to face the fact that the church can not get too far ahead of society if it is going to remain effective i now wait a minute said harry ill pass that one about the church remaining effective but a minute ago you said the minister cant be too far ahead of his coni gregation and now youre saying the church cant get too far ahead of society which do you mean both said the pastor sharply the rest of us all glanced at each other the pastor had been caught off guard and had answered harry directly somebody had to shut harry up or hed ruin us but hed ruin the pastor first none of us said anything how far ahead of the jews was moses when they built the golden calf how far ahead of the disciples was jesus when he went the route and they all ran out on him it was harry the crazy irishman of course the pastor was getting mad im not here to discuss theological questions he said well we are said harry but maybe were in the wrong place maybe we should have gone to the pub and talked to the publican that was too much for the pastor he turned on harry and said young man a little christian humility wouldnt hurt you a little christianity would hurt you said the crazy irishman and thats why you wont practice it harry got up clapped his hat on his head and went out the rest of us sat there as red as the pastor he pulled his frock coat together as if he was going to button it and straightened himself up in his chair that took time enough for his face to fade from red to white you will have to excuse me gentlemen he said but i have a meeting i want you to know that you are always welcome here and that i am always at your service that after all is my humble function here and i want you to know also that i approve heartily of your ideals if not of your methods you know gentlemen and now he began to spread out in his chair again as if we were settling down for a long talk these things are complicated complicated he shook his head obviously regretting that though what he said was true he had to say it these things take time two thousand years is long enough it was the voice of the crazy irishman coming through the first floor window from the sidewalk this time the pastor looked as if hed been stabbed in the back and harrys voice as a matter of fact had come from behind him goodday gentlemen goodday harry was dancing around outside im sorry if i spoiled your teteatete boys he said if it hadnt been for me you might have got a cup of tea out of it but you wouldnt have got anything else and you know it what did we get out of it this way said somebody ill tell you what we got out of it said the crazy irishman we let him know that we know that he isnt a christian isnt that enough for one day i sympathized with the parson myself he has a big family a big house a big car and a big congregation he doesnt do any actual harm and i know he does a lot of good in a quiet way hed even stood up a time or two on the race issuewhich is more than you can say for most of them the only place he cant stand up is in his own church well thats a terrible way for a man to have to live but we all live like that more or less we dont want to be crucified and it seems as if the only way to avoid being crucified is to crucify that parson doesnt want to be like christany more than you or i dohe just wants to sound like christ hes got to liveor at least he thinks he doesand he isnt fit for anything else than preaching hes a oneskill man just like you and me if he lost his job hed be in a tough fix we havent got any more right to condemn him than he has to condemn us wait a minute i dont know about that he undertook to preach the gospel of jesus christ and he isnt doing it that sounds worse to me than not listening to it which is bad enough as between the jim crow pastor and the jim crow churchgoerneither of them christiansi suppose the one that undertakes to preach the gospel to the other is the more damnable the only extenuating circumstance i suppose is that the pastor didnt know what he was undertaking when he undertook it the ministry is so strictly a trade in our time that the poor devil probably flipped a coin to decide between dentistry and preaching and preaching won be ye perfect as your father in heaven is perfect ill bet nobody ever bothered to tell him when he was young that if he wasnt willing to be perfect he should go into dentistry you never hear any of them any more trying ot justify their crucifixion of christ the way they used to especially in the south saying that cains sin was marrying a negro woman or that the negroes are the children of ham who was cursed by noah and condemned to father a progeny of servants and i suppose that its something gained to get them to stop perverting scripture but it cant be much in gods sight we are made of one blood all nations of men we are all one in christ jesus we are all members one of anotherthey cant ignore scriptures like that not while god is around christ died to save all men and there is no distinction of persons or races in holy writ there was the darkskinned king at the epiphany the man of ethiopia when philip baptized in acts and the ethiopian counsellor who persuaded the king to let him deliver jeremiah from prison if these three men were negroesi cant find any others in scripture and im not sure these three were they were among the most glorious of christians they were among the elect racism and christianity dont mix a man can run a jim crow restaurant or a jim crow college and be nothing worse than an ene my of democracy but the man who runs a jim crow church is an enemy of christ and theres no getting around it his business and his only business is to bear witness to christ if the christian church isnt christian it ought to go out of business and if it werent for bingo book reviews and box suppersnone of which has anything to do with christs witnessit would have been out of business long ago and there is nothing the negro can do about it except pray to god who has hardened the hearts of the jim crow pastors and the jim crow churchgoers to soften them the negro christian who wants to save the christian church cant save it by forcing his way into it if god has willed its destruction it will be destroyed and there is no reason for the negro to be sorry for himself he is not deprived of the kingdom of god which is of course within him he is deprived only of the opportunity to associate with unrepentant sinners and to be contaminated by them if the negro is going to be sorry for anybody he should be sorry for the jim crow pastor who has to crucify christ in order to hold on to his job and the negro should be sorriest of all for the jim crow churchgoer who hasnt got the excuse of having to hold on to his job but is free whenever he wills his own salvation to walk out of the jim crow church and never reenter it if my parents hadnt supposed ghosts to be a melodrama about a haunted house my introduction to ibsen would have been much delayed but on my thirteenth birthday at the brighton beach theatre i saw my first professional production of a playthe ibsen classic starring alla nazimova then and there began my love for theatre and my deep interest in ibsen and his work it was pirandello who said after shakespeare without hesitation i put ibsen first so do i fourteen years after my exposure to ghosts in english and fortified with norwegianenglish dictionaries and grammars i decided to plough through ibsen in the original language all the way from catalina to when we dead awaken the battle was long exhausting and rewarding a twomonth european vacation in allowed two weeks for norway landing in bergen norways second largest city i took one sweeping look at those mountains that surround the city breathed the sharp clean air saw the beautiful harbor alive with boats and stayed the whole two months in the land of the midnight sun armed with a letter of introduction to mr and mrs tancred ibsen given to me by one of my former teachers at the american theatre wing mr romney brent i arrived in oslo several weeks later tancreds father was the son of henrik ibsen and his mother was the daughter of bjornstjerne bjornson hows that for lineage tancreds wife lillebil ibsen is one of norways leading actresses the ibsens gracious and charming introduced me to many of norways leading actors and directors i remember meeting ellen isefiaer and congratulating her for her outstanding production of look homeward angel little did i guess that miss isefiaer would direct me in othello six years later at den nationale scene norways oldest theatre when the vacation ended i returned home to new york bringing with me a great love for norway and its people and a determination to learn to speak norwegian as well as i could read it actually my vacation had been much more than that for in the summer of bjarne andersen artistic administrator of den nationale scene in bergen invited me to play othello there during the spring of happily i was playing the role at the great lakes shakespeare festival and in my spare time had worked on mem orizing it in norwegian when during one performance i noticed a strange expression in iagos laurence luckenbill eyes and heard mutterings in the audience i realized suddenly that i had transposed the norwegian text with shakespeares original the next day i cabled herr andersen my acceptance of his offer to my ears norwegian is somewhere between english and german what it lacks in vocabulary it more than makes up for in the intricacy of its phrasing and inflection tonefall at the beginning of the run playing othello in norwegian was like shifting gears i was sometimes tempted to think in english while playing in norwegian and that would have been disastrous because my norwegian tonefall would have as a result gone straight out of the window but as the run went on playing in norwegian seemed quite natural and i actually wondered what it would be like to play othello in english again othello at den nationale scene the national stage was the most wonderful experience of my life under ellen isefiaers inspired direction the production was swift clear and exciting lasting two hours and fortyfive minutes with one long intermission after iagos i am your own forever jeg er for alltid deres per fjelds set was simple yet evocative three arches and three platforms of varying heights all mounted on a revolve which allowed great freedom in choice of playing areas pers colorful rich costumes and his wonderfully imaginative light plot worked like a charm we ran for two months playing every night including sundays to packed houses i shall never forget those warm receptions the norwegians may stem from the vikings but their enthusiasm is anything but polar i shall never forget per theodor haugens superb iago anne gullestads beautiful desdemona heartrendingly moving in her last scene and astrid schwabs warm beautifully spoken emilia i shall never forget our last performance after which bjarne andersen unveiled a bronze bust of me as othello which was placed at the top of one of the staircases in the foyer of the theatre just across from a bust of henrik ibsen woweeee even though norway is a small country in terms of its population a little over three and a half million people the theatre is and has for a long time been in the mainstream of norways cultural life the beautiful theatre buildings themselves radiate permanence and importance when you enter them every visit to the theatre is an occasion for the norwegian he is proud of his theatre most norwegian theatres are subsidized by both the national and municipal governments for example nationaltheatret and det norske teatret in oslo den nationale scene in bergen and the trondelag teater in trondheim are subsidized the government has no artistic say in the doings of the theatre but it does encourage the theatre to pay its own way as much as possible for example a theatre can receive a larger sum in subsidy from the government if it has played to per cent or more of capacity during a season the actor signs as a rule a twoyear contract at one of these theatres which can be cancelled at the end of that time by either the actor or the teatersjef artistic administrator who has sovereign sway over the artistic side of the theatrecasting choice of plays etc it is not too much to say that once a norwegian actor has made his mark at a theatre he doesnt have to worry about where his next job is coming from small wonder that i found the norwegian actor less tense about his outlook on his lifes work than the average american actor i was struck too by the versatility of the norwegian actorand versatile hed better be because even the greatest hit cannot run consecutively for more than three or four months the population of oslo for example is a little over half a million this means that a new production must be ready to take over every two months most of the time however the norwegian theatre plays in repertory per theodor haugen rehearsed a radio play from to am then rehearsed iago from to pm and then at played bill in kiss me kateall on the same day the average production is rehearsed for two monthsfour hours a day am to pm according to the rules of norwegian actors equity mention must certainly be made here of the riksteatret which tours professional productions all over norway even bringing theatre to towns and villages with only three or four hundred inhabitants and norway remember is a very long country flip it over and it would reach all the way to sicily the ibsen tradition is of course woven into the fabric of norwegian theater productions of his plays are heatedly discussed long after they have closed the norwegian actor measures his talents against the characters of ibsen much as we measure ours against the creations of shakespeare the heartwarming affection of the norwegian people must leave its mark on any man and bring with it the desire to reciprocate in kind to show them that we too know and love our theatre and have a heritage perhaps one day a company of norwegian actors will come to new york and play ibsen for us in their own language we would understand it i am sure meanwhile this actor is especially grateful to den nationale scene and to our own state department which made my travel possible mississippis freest man s not the prettiest town in the ij mississippi delta eso d pecially in the autumn icom glare of a long drouth with dirty cotton curls from a bumper crop edging the curbs and gutters like dust still the streets are wide and the green and gracious trees sometimes nearly meet across

the hub of negro downtown crosses this poor and squalid block with another succession of hidden offices cafes and the fourth street drug store the fourth street drug store its windows halffilled with drug advertisements sundries and posters proclaiming vote for freedom and aaron henry for governor is crammed with a fountain jammed center shelves and two other counters lining the big room behind them is a narrow office space the width of the store walled with drug supplies and cut off by another breasthigh counter in the drug store it was dim crowded and closelooking like the rest of the street but when aaron henry looked up from the counter of his office smiled and spoke in quick cordiality the place expanded brightened and hummed with life his smooth nearly black face round and gently receding under a wide nose and mouth opened with the sweet eager look of a man who likes everybody who will let him and his vivid voice rose in welp come owner of the drug store mississippi president of the national association for the advancement of colored people and candidate for governor of mississippi henry who is fortyone years old looked to me like the freest fellow id seen in a long hot dustplagued journey through mississippi and after we had talked for an hour i figured he is the freest man in mississippi notwithstanding his rigid segregation house and store bombings and shootings threats law suits jail sentences and other white persecutions indeed his white neighbors have done everything that mississippians can do to a nonviolent negro revolutionary trying to lead his people to the ballot except kill him they might have done that henry has heard last june when medgar evers mississippi field secretary for the naacp was shot in the back and killed i heard it was a flip of the coin decided whether it would be medgar or me he said with a shrug i was in texas making a speech anyway we totted up the attacks on the henry family in the last two years trying to record every intimidation damage and threat since his leadership in the statewide negro drive but he couldnt remember every one and the repeated terrors became tedious his home a pleasant and comfortable frame house in a grassy neighborhood a mile or so beyond the fourth street district has been shot at three or four times bricks and homemade bombs have broken his store windows half a dozen times he pointed up to a rectangular hole in the ceiling as yet unrepaired since the last bomb attack when he was meeting with friends in the back of the store shortly after the first such evidences of white displeasure over henrys interest in negro voting his insurance policies were cancelled after a long saturday at the store our busiest dayin march a year ago henry left for a meeting with freedomstruggling friends at a funeral parlor and then went home we ate dinner he recalled and turned on the hit parade rebecca his young daughter and i were dancing and fooling around and then i undressed to get some rest before i started out again noelle mrs henry lay on the bed beside me and rebecca came back and said daddy somebodys flashing lights around the front and i said its nothing baby dont pay any attention to it i didnt want her to get scared then she came in and said somebody was at the door and noelle went and came back to the bedroom and said ben collins the chief of police wanted me i put on a robe and went to the front and he said he had to take me in i asked him what for and he said he didnt know so he followed me to the bedroom and stood there while i dressed he took me to headquarters and i still didnt find out the charge then he drove me to bolivar county and locked me up and next morning i was hit with this morals charge i was supposed to have picked up this white boy a hitchhiker on the highway and asked him to get me a white woman when he said he couldnt then they said i made advances to him i tell you i really blew my top collins and dave pearson the coahoma county solicitor were there i said along with some cussin language collins you cooked this up they just took my cussin and didnt say a word shortly however chief collins and pearson sued henry for libel not apparently for his explosive epithets but for saying they had framed him pearson got a judgment and collins a one neither has made any effort to collect but collins has approached henry to let him insure his life a proposition which he rejected can you imagine henry asked his high forehead wrinkled in wonderment the gall my life wouldnt be worth two cents henry was convicted of the morals charge on the word of a transient teenage white boy despite testimony of witnesses who were with henry on the afternoon he was alleged to have picked up the hitchhiker then the state court of appeals reversed the verdict a few days later the court of appeals reversed its own judgment after henry says pressure from state politicians the case is now on appeal to the u s supreme court henry recovered from his shock and disgust at the charge and convictions wtih the resilient tolerance and unfaltering fight which seem to sustain him in his leadership and with a perspective which convinces him that every pain and loss in the struggle advances the negro cause a philosophical stoicism with a broad streak of humor has inured all three of the henrys to the daily telephone calls with threats of death obscene insults and such fanciful falsehoods as that of a man who told rebecca your daddys dead and down at the funeral home little rebecca with equal spirit sasses and scoffs at the callers mrs henry amuses herself by quoting scripture to the anonymous enemies or promising to pray for them one wonders if all of white clarksdale approves and supports the savagery of police and vigilante attacks on the henrys and their colleagues we havent got one white friend in clarksdale henry said in brief and bigeyed sorrow but then as if he were obliged to remember white fears and difficulties to save himself from rage and despair he shrugged and explained that is no white man who can come out publicly they got their problems it aint easyyou know businesses jobs families pressures of course theres hal brownstein of the seed company works for the city park commission he makes sure the negroes have some balls to play with and horseshoes to throw a nice fella the paternalistic kind of thing a lot of em come by here one at a time and tell me quietly theyre sorry theyre ashamed and express sympathy but nobody can lift a hand or speak out for us the carr boy who threw a bomb in my house came by and told me he was ashamed and asked me to forgive him if i could he said he didnt know the boy he was driving had a bomb for my house the boy had told him he wanted to collect some money from me young carr said when the boy threw the molotov cocktail there wasnt anything he could do but drive him off i said sure i forgive you no hard feelings henry seemed disturbed like a man with a fresh wound that throbs through his efforts to ignore it at the recent killing of ernest gells and the unanimous indifference of the white community the police take credit for the shooting gellsa boy twentyone not in the freedom struggle never had an arrest or any recordgot in an argument about a banana at the fair deal grocery store a white mans store in the negro section as i understand it the white man broke for his gun and gells ran out of the store the grocer began shooting and the police took up the chase and shot at him too the boy had several holes in him anyway he died they tell the fantastic tale that gells had a rifle pointing it at the grocer can you figure a colored boy going to a white grocer for a banana with a rifle on him anyway we filed fifteen or twenty affidavits from witnesses on what happened and sent copies to local businessmen we didnt hear a word from a one of em henrys most recent encounter with the clarksdale law was on the occasion of an august march of eightysix negroes including boys and girls as young as fourteen on the city hall a demonstration against the entire system of segregation which reflects itself in continued abuse of the negro population police ordered them to disperse which they did not and all were arrested for parading without a permit henry got nine days and was put to tipping garbage a chore he assumed with his customary humor and ebullience to the wry laughter of freedomfighting negroes over the deep south and his clarksdale constituents and presumably to the gratification of ruling whites the henrys seem quite unafraid rebecca a golden brown blackeyed little girl rolypoly like many twelveyearolds dimples as the henrys laugh at the grisly telephone calls mrs henry a gravemannered young woman with a rare and pretty smile did get nerv ous when medgar evers was killed up until then i would just laugh she recalled i had thought of it that way as just insults and some attacks but not much danger and i wasnt necessarily scared but after medgar was killed one woman kept calling and telling me my husband would be next so she extracted from aaron the promise that he would never go out alone after dark armed friends now take turns guarding their house at night henry talked thoughtfully to me of his life his awakening to his passion for freedom and equality and his faith in the negro movement i was born right here in coahoma county on a farm we worked hard as childrenhoeing planting and picking and going to school it was happy childhood lots of outdoors and hard work and we didnt know about anything else my first heartbreak about this race thing came when i was six years old my best friend was a little white boy i played with constantly we were inseparable and i loved him with all my heart his family lived near us and we visited back and forth and they tell me our mothers would leave us at each others houses as babies and that sometimes my mother would nurse him and sometimes his mother would nurse me well when time came to go to school they told me we couldnt go together that was just how it was he had to go to a white school and i had to go to the negro school i cried and cried and i reckon he did too i think i didnt realize the negro thing but just that wed be separated but as soon as school was out hed run right to my house and we spent all the rest of the time together hes out in california now and we keep in touch christmas cards and that kind of thing henry remembers the inspiration of a high school teacher who talked of negro rights democracy and american equality shed give us books to read like richard wrights black boy and persuaded the senior class to join the naacp his interest in history in high school and college also illumined the negro situation for him and fired him with a resolve for justice and liberation he spent two years in the army in world war ii in california and the south pacific after his service he met this chick here at a methodist vacation bible school program a slender quiet girl the color of dark honey and she really got me they were married after he finished xavier university in new orleans with a degree in pharmacy and returned home to open a drug business with a friend later he started his own business which became a rendezvous for colored youngsters and a headquarters for the clarksdale freedom movement at xavier he was awakened and stimulated by his scientific studies more history some sociology philosophy and literature and particularly by the friendship of a nun whom the students called sister bill some of the negroes hadnt had the preparation for college work he recalled and shed take us on to tutor us and fill us in so we could keep up whenever we got in any trouble academic or any other kind we could count on sister bill going to bat for us and if we couldnt pay for lessons it didnt matter shed keep on working with us a zestful methodist and a leader of haven methodist church henry is chairman of its social concerns group and his study and programs in this methodist effort also have sharpened his commitment and sped his crusade for freedom he believes in god with easy convictionoh surebut not in the sense of a pipeline up there not that kind of stuff wistfully but also in a tone of affirmation as if to remind himself that good things may be possible again he remembers easy days in clarksdale before the supreme court decision a time of fond and free friendship with whites a deep south anomaly now destroyed in white fear and oppression for former negro friends sure we associated he said wed get together at each others homes sometimes we even took the kids and visited back and forth but not any more during the recent gubernatorial campaign in which democratic candidate paul b johnson vowed to k o kennedy and preserve white domination against federal interference and republican candidate rubel phillips repudiated past liberalism and as loudly defied negro aspirations and federal law the negro freedom ballot campaign conceived by a federation of the civil_rights organizations in mississippi advanced aaron henry for governor and reverend edwin king a young white methodist chaplain and dean of students at negro tougaloo college near jackson for lieutenantgovernor the night i heard henry speak to negroes and a sprinkling of whites at jackson amid the harsh noise of the white campaigns and against the dark backdrop of statewide negro persecution he sounded like an insouciant sort of saint a massive bellvoiced old brown minister reverend r l smith introduced henry with some highminded remarks of his own we are not fighting alone and will not win alone we dont hate anybody we try to love everybody we hate the lies and doubledealing that are going on against us we are grateful for every decent man white or black and thank god for a few nativeborn mississippians who are with us it is a new day in mississippi for here is a nativeborn white american reverend edwin king who says he wants freedom for all there is something great in aaron henrya man willing to walk out and take a stand for you and me who served time on the chain gang and that didnt stop him the kind of man who made america great mississippi needs such a governor she wont be ashamed of who wont stand in the door but who stands at the door and beckons all men to come in henry dark dapper and smiling rose and hailed the intimidations and difficulties the reverend king has sufferedwhich are in fact considerable including jail and abuse in jackson for demonstrating with negroes he also praised robert moses his campaign manager a young new york negro now nearly three years in mississippi working for voter registration and head of the council of federated organizations national and local civil_rights groups joined in the struggle to vote moses a victim of many beatings and jailings himself is henry said fool enough or brave enough or whatever you want to call it to run this campaign and the way he works me he must have been my granddaddys slave driver on june th henry continued swiftly and solemnly one of the best friends i ever had had his life snuffed out by a coward who waited in the bushes and shot him in the back he fell his full six feet two inches and he carried us exactly six feet and two inches down the road to freedom we will never have to replace or gain again that six feet and two inches because medgar evers carried us that far with his life weve worked hard to secure the rights were now applying for candidate henry said because for generations we worked all year for nothing today we want our payment when the white businessmen say negroes dont pay taxes well if theyd pay us the overall wage due us theyd live forever tax free henry spoke emotionally of our terrific love for this country of ours and pointed out that black people in africa secured their freedom by driving the white people out when we secure the freedom which is ours he promised to applause our white brothers and sisters will be right here with us with emphasis and applause he declared the freedom vote is a vote for the right to vote and a political reform by which you can make a senator javits of senator eastland he espoused the cause of love for white and black brothers and sisters and said we have no prejudice against white people because theyre white we cant get to firstclass citizenship by such secondclass means we cannot live in yesterday we forgive the white men for their past we want equality and freedom for all of us upstairs after the meeting a dozen youngsters clapped danced and sang freedom songs laughing the black boys began the old spiritual im gonna sit at the welcome table bye and bye and concluded with the mississippi version vm gonna marry barnetts daughter bye and bye man one boy bent over in mirth his daughter she bout thirtyeight years old in meetings throughout his campaign henry pointed out that in a close race the to negro votes could decide the election the negro freedom ballot campaign plan was for registered negroes to write in henry and king on the official state ballots thus voiding them under mississippi law once we withdraw our votes henry explained and the man who loses figures that if wed voted for him hed have won then the next time hell do something to get those votes of ours henrys big appeal however was for the freedom vote a straw ballot of to which would show the country and the state that mississippi negroes will vote if they let us of mississippis persons are negro with a sixty per cent majority in the delta if we get a civil_rights bill with protection for voting we can change this whole state henry fervently predicts weve had more than fifty mass meetings around the state over this thing yes ive had a ball i enjoy campaigning and the crowds and enthusiasm weve got this organization now from districts right on down to city blocks we know every negro voter thats registered and all the campaign workers and well keep our eyes on the election now and this campaign is aimed at a lot of uncommitted congressmen people from north and south dakota utah other states up there without any negroes if we show them what were up against and that this dixiecrat crowd doesnt represent mississippi then we may get their votes on the civil_rights bill if we get set back on the civil_rights billhenry looked worriedi dont know therell be a reaction therell be more of the black muslim psychology infiltrating and we cant defend against it no we dont have any black muslims now he laughed freedom in mississippi sure i believe in it henry declared with earnest emphasis we can turn this state upside down and really have us a place to live in and be proud ofa place for everybody jobs education equality freedom and politicians who represent all the people that we wont be ashamed of the white folks will be free too i think well be through this thing sooni give it four or five years will they get me he mused undismayed as if he had considered the question many times and come to terms with it well i find if you keep on standing up to em they arent as rough on you i feel like things have eased up a little for me but if you take a stand and then let em cow you down they got you sure i might die you got to be prepared for that but i figure medgars death advanced us twenty years in negro support and white reaction it was one of the biggest shocks the state of mississippi ever had why they couldnt even have a parade in jackson until medgars death and then or negroes walked in that memorial procession what few concessions weve got in jackson his death brought about if i get killedso everything contributes said henry a man of faith and freedom the november freedom vote with ballot boxes on the plantations in town and country churches in poolrooms and votemobiles pulled some mock votes from disenfranchised negroes many of them henry jubilantly noted from black cottonpickers heretofore scared even to write their names down three weeks of campaigning also gave us an organization so we got our hands on every registered voter and nearly every negro who wants to vote here clearly is a formidable group of politically potent citizens awaiting their liberation and negro mississippians and furtive white liberals figure it gave them henry an engaging politician of highminded promise for soul brothers emancipation proclamation four score and like f y twentyone years ago the bearded white father moved in on the happenings with a new pact hung up in human dignity and cut out on the pattern that all soul brothers and soul sisters drop off the balls and chains now we are caught up in a great big hassle testing whether our group like the ofay group should have a right to latch on to some justice and freedom we have won victories to that effect like in the law courts we have got eyes to throw out the laurels for those who went to their last lay down pad blowing the horn for integration its crazy man crazy that were on this kick but in an offbeat sense we cant make out we cant clue in we cant even talk up this jazz the freedom fighters with us and down under who slaved here have sounded off too nice for us to ever add our say the segregationists are not hip to this bit and they dont dig this talk we talk but like its for us the freedom bound to grab up the horn and keep on blowing like its rather for us to keep jamming the sounds and beating the rhythms which those longgone rights leaders gigged and wailed that from these wayout characters we jump up to the cause for which they went and blew their gaskets that we here riff the tune that these crucified soul brothers shall not have got wasted in vain that this nation under equality shall ever more be swinging and that a jazzy new group of freedom fighters of the members by the members and for the members shall not cut out from the scene by william melvin kelley the barbershop was t warm enough to make carlyle bedlow sleepy and smelled of fragrant shaving soap a fat man sat in the great chair his stomach swelling beneath the striped cloth standing behind him in a white hairlinted tunic which buttoned along one shoulder garland the barber clacked his scissors garlands hair was well kept his sidebums cut off just where his wire eyeglasses passed back to his ears hello carlyle how you doing he looked over the tops of his glasses so you decided to let me make a living huh yes sir carlyle smiled he liked garland taking advantage of bronx misery sir mean when folks is having trouble getting their cars dug out you making money shovelling bronx snow oh yes sir garland was always teasing him because carlyles family had moved recently from harlem to this neighborhood in the bronx he maintained carlyle thought the bronx was full of hicks okay youre next ill take some of that snow money from you he returned to the fat mans head carlyle leaned his shovel in the corner stamped his feet took off his jacket sat down in a wirebacked chair and picked up a comic book he had already read it and put it down to watch the barber shave the fat mans neck with the electric clippers the fat man who had been talking when carlyle came in continued cant see why hed want to do that can you garland but aint that just like a nigger he was very dark the skin under his chin was heavily pocked and scarred and just like a white woman too man these cats marry some colored girl when they starting out just singing in joints and dives she supports him while hes trying to get ahead but then he gets a hit record or a job at the waldorf and bingohe drops her quick gets a divorce and marries some white bitch white chicks know where its at they laying in wait for him when he makes it theyll cut in on a good thing every time anyway it wont last a year and you can quote me on that garland finished cutting great patches of hair from the mans head and started to shape the back a short lightskinned negro opened the door and leaned in hello garland he did not close the door and cold wind blasted in around him say man how you doing you after the boy there all right he continued to work hardly looking at the head in front of him he could cut hair blindfolded the short man nodded and closed the door behind him he removed his coat put his gloves carefully into a pocket sat down and stretched only then did he take off his hat his hair was straight and black he did not seem to need a haircut i read in the amsterdam how mister cool and his white sweetie finally got shackled yes sir we just talking about that garland reached behind him touched a switch and from an aluminum box lather billowed into his palm aint that just like a negro and like a white bitch too the fat man added dont trim the sideburns just around the ears ill trim the sideburns myself garland nodded man i seen the same thing happen a thousand times a negro making more money than a white man starting to act foolish like a white man even though he should know better i guess it aint really that negros fault all his life he been poor and a nobody garland put the lather behind the fat mans ears so as soon as he gets some money its bound to mess up his mind dont touch the sideburns garland the fat man shifted un der the striped sheet yeah i think you right and them white bitches is waiting to ambush him the short man folded his thin arms across his chest well dont all a colored mans problems begin with mister charlie and miss mary mostly when miss mary wants to make time with her nigger chauffer or handyman and mister charlie finds out about it he dont blame miss mary for it thats sure the fat man leaned forward garland stopped shaving reflecting mostly when you find some white woman being nice to you nicer than she ought to be then watch out he started to shave behind the fat mans ears them white women know where its at the short man nodded yeah but i cant see why no colored mand want to marry no white chick on purpose like mister cool did not when theres so many fine spade chicks around garland agreed i like my wornen the way i like my coffee hot strong and black the fat man jerked his head i guess he thinks he taking a step up now he thinks he better than all the other boots standing on the comer hes got himself a white recording contract with a big white company and a booking at a fine white nightclub and a white cadillac and an apartment on park avenue painted all white and a white bitch too why man he almost white himself except for one thing he still a nigger they all laughed uproariously slapping their thighs it seemed much colder with his hair cut short his neck shaved clean carlyle trudged flatfooted planting his feet firmly so as not to slip up the middle of the carless street through the shadows cast by the snowclogged trees he wished he could go home take off his wet shoes listen to records and read the paper that each night his father carried home tucked under his arm he knew too that the later it got the angrier his father would be his father liked to eat as soon as he came home besides his father would want him or his little brother to clear their own driveway and carlyle had not asked to take the shovel he decided then walking along the rutted street he would not waste his time with small jobs he would look for a long snowbanked walk of a house set way back from the street this is what he finally found down a solitary sidestreet lit faintly by a single streetlamp at the middle of the block the house set back on a short hill that surely in the spring and summer would be a thick lawn perhaps bordered with flowers snow clung to the empty blackened branches of a hedge concealing a grotesque iron fence the house too was grotesque painted gray its gables hung with daggerlike icicles he hesitated a moment looking up at the house there did not seem to be any light burning and he did not want to wade twenty or thirty teet through shindeep snow to find no one at home going further on up the sidewalk he found a lighted window down the side near the back and he returned to the gate and started up the drifted walk the porch was wood and clunked hollow when he stamped the snow from his feet he climbed the steps gingerly and peered at the names on the doorbell if there was a mans name he still might not find workwomen living alone or old couples more usually needed someone to clean snow there was a womans nameelizabeth reubenand a mans too but his which was typed had been recently crossed out with a thick smeared angry pencil slash carlyle rang the bell no longer walking his feet got cold very quickly and when after what seemed a long while the door openedand then only a crack he was hopping from one foot to the other yes what is it he could see a nose and one eye could hear a womans voice miz reuben he slurred the miss or missus so as not to insult her either way yes would you like to have your walk shoveled he moved closer and spoke to the nose and eye there was a pause while she looked him over up and down and inspected the shovel he held in his hand no im sorry i dont think so well uh there was nothing else to say he thanked her and turned away wait it sounded almost like a scream and then softer young man wait he turned back and found the door swung wide the nose and eye had grown to a small plumpish white woman of about forty in a pale blue wool dress she was not exactly what he would have called pretty but she was by no means a hag she was just uninteresting looking her hair was a dull brown combed into a style that did her no good her eyes were flat and gray like cardboard on second thought young man i think it would be nice to have my walk cleaned off im expecting some visitors and it will make it easier for them to find me she smiled at him but come inside you must be frozen solid walking around in all this snow and cold thats all right maam ill start right away he took a step back and lifted his shovel you do as i say and come in the house this very moment she was still smiling but there was enough of a mothers tone in her voice to make him walk past her through the door which she closed behind him rest your coat and shovel there and follow me im taking you into the kitchen to put something warm into your stomach he did as she ordered and walked her down the hall lit by a lowwatt bulb in a yellowing shade the first thing he noticed was that the kitchen smelled of leaking gas there was a huge pile of rags and bits of cloth on the table in the center of the room there were more rags on the window sill and stuffed at the bottom of the back door she saw him looking at them its an old house it gets very drafty she smiled nervously wringing her hands now are you old enough to drink coffee or would you rather have hot chocolate he had remained on his feet she bustled to the table and swept the rags onto the floor with her arm sit down please he did now what would you rather have hot chocolate please hot chocolate good thats better for you she headed toward the stove almost running it was big and oldfashioned with a shelf for salt and pepper above theburners whats your name dear carlyle maam carlyle bedlow carlyle did you know you were named after a famous man no maam i was just named after my father his names she was laughing shrilly unhappily he had said something funny but did not know what it was it made him uneasy what dear you started to say something i interrupted you nothing maam he was wondering now what he had said and why she was being so nice giving him hot chocolate maybe she was giving him the hot chocolate so she could talk to him about things he did not understand and laugh at his ignorance it was just like the men in the barbershop said most of a colored mans trouble began with white people they were always laughing and making fun of negroes do you like your hot chocolate sweet carlyle i can put some sugar in it for you behind her voice he could hear the milk sizzling around the edges of the saucepan could hear the gas feeding the flame yes maam i like it sweet the milk sizzled louder still as she poured it across the hot sides into his cup she brought it and sat across from him on the edge of her chair waiting for him to taste it he did so and found it good with his minds eye he followed it down his throat and into his stomach is it good her gray eyes darted across his face yes maam she smiled and seemed pleased that puzzled him if she had him in to laugh at him why was she so anxious to get him warm why did she want him to like the hot chocolate there had to be some other reason but just then the chocolate was too good to think about it he took a big swallow well now lets get down to business ive never had to hire anybody to do this before i used to do it myself when i was younger and then there was a man here whod do it for me but hes not here anymore she trailed off caught herself how much do you usually get for a stoop and walk that long she smiled at him again it was a fleeting smile which warmed the corners of her mouth and left her eyes sad ive been very nice to you i should think youd charge me less than usual so that was it she wanted him to do her walk for practically nothing white people were always trying to cheat negroes he had heard his father say that cursing the jews in harlem he just stared at her hating her she waited an instant for him to answer then started to figure out loud well lets see thats a long walk and theres the sidewalk and the stoop and the steps and its very cold and i probably cant get anyone else its a question of too little supply and a great deal of demand she was talking above him again id say id be getting off well if i gave you five dollars she stopped and looked across at him helplessly does that sound fair i really dont know he continued to stare but now because he could hardly believe what she said at the most he would have charged only three dollars and had expected her to offer one she filled in the silence yes five that sounds right he finished his chocolate with a gulp but maam i wouldnta charged you but three really three that doesnt sound like enough she bolted from the table and advanced on him well ill give you the extra two for being honest perhaps you can come back and do something else for me she swooped on him hugged and kissed him the kiss left a wet cold spot on his cheek he lurched away surprised knocking the cup and saucer from the table the saucer broke in two the cup bounced rolled lopsided and crazy under the table no maam he jumped to his feet im sorry maam thats all right its all right im sorthats all right about the saucer she scrambled to her knees and began to pick up the pieces and the cup once she had them in her lap she sat staring away at nothing shaking her head now he knew for certain what she was up to he remembered what garland had said when you find some white woman being nicer than she ought to be then watch out she wanted to make time with him he started from the kitchen maybe he could leave before it was too late wait young man she stood up ill pay you now and you wont have to come inside when youre through she pushed by him and hurried down the shadowy hallway he followed her as before but kept his distance her purse was hanging on a peg on the coatrack next to his own jacket she took them both down handed him his jacket averting her eyes and fumbled in her purse produced a wallet unzipped it pulled out a bill and handed it to him but its a five maam he could not understand why she wanted to pay him that much now that he was not going to make time with her she looked at him for the first time her eyes wet i told you id pay you five didnt i yes maam all right do a good job and remember dont come back yes maam you let yourself out she started to the back of the house even before he had finished buttoning his jacket by the time he opened the door she was far down the hall and as he closed it behind him and stepped into the dark twinkling cold he could hear her in the kitchen she was tearing rags the next evening the white woman was in the newspaper a boy trying to deliver a package had found her in the gasfilled kitchen slumped over a table piled high with rags carlyles father who saw it first mentioned it at dinner had a suicide a couple blocks from here he told who and where carlyle sat staring at his plate his father went on white folks man if they had to be colored for a day theyd all kill theyselves we wouldnt have no race problem then white folks dont know what hard life is whats wrong junior she was a nice lady his parents and his little brother looked at him you know her junior his mother put down her fork she was a nice lady mama i shovelled her walk yesterday she give me five dollars oh junior his mother sighed five dollars his father leaned forward crazy huh have some respect his mother turned on his father angrily carlyle looked at his mother are white people all bad theres some good ones aint there mama of course junior his mother smiled what made you think sure there is junior his father was smiling too the dead ones is good a black poet in europe beyond the time and space of this small cafe in paris there lies a world which threatens to steal my manhood that is why i am in paris at this hour while i speak my roots ache inside of me through my day and throughout nightfall i walk the streets of paris alone among throngs of chattering people i glimpse faces of others who need paris as much as i do we have gathered and gathered our tender pieces of flesh and come down and away from that intoler able paramount of a homeland dying from things symbols and sorrow we have descended to paris to her warm sun to this cafe from which i write you discovering on some illfated hour the valley of death spread out before us burning our eyes recalling our dreams painting our faces black again sending newer and blanker dark hours we are sitting on rue de saint germain i have counted my francs carefully we wait for the sun to fall it is the flaming height of paris golden hour the paid for moment of a lovely womensummer her cycle all paris is bright and clear we wipe dry our faces and smell the seine the winding streets appear rust brown and dry brownness is everywhere we are the blackbrown jewels found here loved and feared forgetful about what the case was so very very long ago only the healthy looking prostitutes and men from africas loins appear contented in the evening when we have tasted our fill in loneliness we shall drift back to our rooms strip laugh broadmouthed at the heat think of home our separate harlems of fun rejoice at our good fortune then sleep and hope to dream of places dark men and women poverty race hatred sweet waters our mothers humming intermittent spirituals a white man enters a door we dream heavy this man is our father killed and love singing his way through our lives an emasculated shadow pleased to be alive we shall grow to love him in our hate he is our father and our blood fathers are without genuine sons a short hour passes we arise and walk several miles the nerve center of paris is human life human possibility begins anew for us and this is the difference between a walk at home and a walk here anything can happen in europe at home you return to bare the bareness of empty closets and cheaply papered walls long bright cars outside kitchen smells of greens and blackeyed peas here then you are or want to be here is paris dreamed of your previous life blacked out no blackness here no nigger no postfreudian words to examine you and the burden of your sorrow becomes furiously free only the loss of a passport dare destroy you now we are still sitting on the rue de saint germain i have counted my francs carefully for the second time there is enough left for a round of vin i find difficult to pronounce i am still waiting for the sun to fall soon my guest will begin to drift away in paris one buys drinks for friends and strangers alike my hotel is located three blocks away for a few dollars a day i survive its aura of lunacy high school french has no meaning here only the language separates our souls it dawned upon me before leaving america that a language problem would exist and in many places throughout europe i would be alone i rather fancied the idea considered it a part of my roundtrip ticket as a tourist and potential expatriate the rules did not apply to me i thought in the new and exciting labyrinthines of the olde world i would be no more the stranger than in the last europeans prefer presliced bread to no bread at all but they can survive especially in paris on no bread at all bread served hot or cold round square oblong diced in america we failed to incorporate into the charter of european tradition we politely stole a concern for ingredients bread is bread man is alone we dare not mix our religion and historical experience with food nor anything else our faith is built into things god help us in europe especially in small villages bread is a way of life in america i had a number and size some few friends some bad ones some hard times i never supposed that europes mystique would descend upon me like an all cleansing angel and deliver me from paying my dues or experiencing my fate at the foot of her cross admitted i was naive one reads a thousand prospectuses before embarking i went one step farther and researched quite extensivelyeven to the point of reading literature exclusively written by men of color who came same as i looking for solidarity or any of the tools of communication that americas inhumanity fails to offer the black man nailed to her wall i hungered for bread the sun finally falls and i write quickly the gargon comes to add a franc to my check for it is past six oclock and the price of vin goes up incidentally have you tasted american bread lately the one bad odor in paris smells of money the rat race exists there tenfold paris is hell when hunger sets in the streets talk back to you children run through the alleys of your childhood mercy like existence precedes essence a first trip abroad can be termed hot or cold but always and always the king is dead you are free the strange thing about paris is that people do emerge from places one does not ordinarily expect people to emerge from they fall out of the woodwork africans africans i look about me now count them by fives we are located at the first table so to speak evening has arrived you can tell it by car horns grunts and groans by extra gargons quickly snapping on vests the lack of children in the streets above all the steady downpour of americans there are richlooking americans poorlooking ones like me more of them than any others the french are not unaware of us the poor ones we are all rich to them true to their hollywood legend there is no protestant face or jewish face or catholic face or negroid face the faces are parisian until you find out better i understand now and only as of this moment why proust and gide and longlost oscar wilde peered into paris limpid blue eyes only to find white pearls from limbo henry miller found real bread how can one hope to explain paris there is a point of demarcation that is all one could possibly hope to do with mere words with a camera she comes alive even then her pores tighten up we must come we must taste of her or remain unborn to our desires i am writing you all sorts of gewgaw which de gaulle knows you dont need to hear my intention was to fulfill a promise i made to you some time ago and to let you know that your poetry follows me as i go marching happily along was that a song i have a copy of annie allen with me at times she has been my manumission baldwin had bessie smith i have annie richard had mississippi the gargon cleans my table for the third time several au revoirs have been exchanged the others fled i am destined to pay an extra franc because this letter makes my day meaningful this evening much later on i look forward to hearing gordon heath sing you may remember him from broadway some years ago he runs a small club with just enough room for artistry with a voice worth much more cash in the states if things were not the way they are tonight promises to be my first early trip on other occasions i arrived too late or much too full of apathy a franc is worth twenty cents and the french have a way of not letting you forget what you are worth without their precious currency i enter my third month in europe and my last in francs i am thinking now of what i shall really think in the future about this longdreamedof trip it germinated in high school followed me like the hound of heaven through college not once have i asked myself how i really got here my salary and budget certainly didnt pull it off certainly both helped but most of the credit lies with that savage resource of guts that only a black boy in america gets a chance to use if at all admitted other minorities have a time of it also but a lot less conspicuous they see us we have learned how to live invisibly yes guts and nothing else but guts o father who are in guts mighty is thou name give us more guts guts for our souls guts for our dreams deliver our tarnished guts from weaker guts and give us enough guts to remake an old world or at least give us enough guts to influence the new one acoming hemingway had nada eliot old sweeney guts for us i stray again forgive me the gargon comes once more slightly irritated deux vins one for me and another to keep the table private do you really want to know what i think about europe have your gifted powers diagnosed my case well let me put it to you another way i dare not ask europa what she thinks about me anyhow to whom would i direct my question certainly not a fellow white american who doesnt know me at home never a european they know too many white lies about us now the ugly americans really prove true to form some negro gis are still requested to show their tails o tis true when i was in the united states army long before my private war i was stationed in georgia i remember my first day offpost proud of my uniform wanting to be noticed because in my pockets i had several white certificates telling me that i had completed without injury or disgrace boot training i knew something about the southland id been there before never like then a man just a guy in uniform without any serious qualms no racial bugaboos cluttered my mind i felt neither northern or biggity black nor white needless i suppose to say to you at least i returned a whimpering naked dehumanized speck of a man ralph ellisons theory of invisibility is one thing aloneness is another nobody really saw me too many soldiers in town little to do with color just too many damn soldiers in town we knew the price of southern coffee we could not buy but we assumed tea was in order color is often times an excuse used to accept defeat quite pleasantly how many black men do you suppose threw the towel in before the verdict reached an impartial jury i became indifferent like any good black soldier would do under similar circumstances during peace time where was the war i dont suppose there was enough misery for us in the world i cant forget that night a strange sense of similarity confronts me now too many of us wear our uniforms in europe they strip us bare and see our souls made of things cars toasters credit cards cheap taste and a profound ignorance of life and liberty far exceeding our wealth i am back in georgia now miller called paris a whore the native son called it salvation i can never call it home i have come to europe to see myself and one quick look is adequate one sees what the camera catches there can be no other freedom a private hell closed

unaware that bread is not enough weve cooked in far too many kitchens to suppose that a panacea lies in flour what brings me home is the will to live beyond my countrys expectation of me and so the story goes on the poems bum flames i read from your little book everyday and i destroy my blues its good to be free temporarily my letter is full of holes please close them up with sympathy and blame those vacuums on my youth ignorance and new born freedom in at the height of the climactic year of the negro revolution the worlds attention was focused for the first time in history on an insignificant little town in maryland called cambridge several times the nation waited nervously caught up in a terrible tension for the city hung perilously on a thread of violence which like a lighted fuse connected to a series of vast ammunition dumps threatened to racial holocausts across the ignite land and at the center of the holdingas it werethe tension lighted match stood a tall angular handsome woman who looked like anybodys sinewy sister but who in effect was the centennial symbol of the emancipated negro woman and it was she who refusing to be mesmerized by logicalsounding platitudes put cambridge in the spotlight by insisting that freedom is not a commodity like a beef roast to be parceled out in pounds and ounces or sold at auction to bidders but a right granted all americans by god and the u s constitution now and forevermore for refusing to sell her birthright and that of ultimately all the people of cambridge and of this nationfor half a loaf of freedom gloria richardson won the enmity of racists and their numerous editorialists everywhere but she also won the everlasting gratitude of all those with vision enough to know that freedom cannot be compromised now a year after cambridge was first catapulted into the world limelight it is relatively quiet and comparatively peaceful there but all the people who in any way were touched by their towns moment of history know that neither the town nor any of them can ever be the same again the negroes however poor or deprived walk a little taller and considerably straighter knowing that they are men and women and that they now have power as well as dignity the whites whether rich or poor racist or otherwise understandperhaps for the first timethat cambridge is not alone their town that they must share its problems its responsibilities and its glories with all those people on the other side of race street in time of course only the archivists will remember gloria richardson those who come after her who reap the rewards of her labors will accept as their just due and rightly sotheir participation in the total life of their community such is the way of things and in sliding into a kind of obscurity gloria richardson will be taking her honored place in a long and illustrious line of negro women who have served their race and their nation above and beyond the call of duty indeed she is only one of a group of valiant leaders who in just the past decade have brought added lustre and importance to the deservedly vaunted image of the negro woman her sistersinstruggle include daisy bates the arkansas lady who led the nine little rock children through the long bitter violent seige at the high school where hate defied even the national guard but eventually surrendered to courage and the business ends of bayonets rosa parks a mild little seamstress with a motherly mien who made up her mind one morning that she was either a woman like any other or else she was nothing at all and when told to move to the rear of a montgomery alabama bus chose to put up her stakes and because of her decision launched the old capitol of the confederacy on its long slow painful journey toward becoming a decent place in which to live diane nash bevel a beautiful broth of a girl who understood as so few like her have ever understood before or are likely to understand again that every single human being in this country who calls himself a negro from insurance magnate to porter from almost white to blackest black is threatened and diminished by any act or law or ruse which arbitrarily withholds from any man any part of his rights as a citizen and as a man and who wrapped her beauty in sackcloth and plunged openeyed into the heart of the racial storm braving the fire hoses and the snarling dogs and filthy jails from nashville to jackson so that the oppressed might know that they are not forgotten and thatto borrow a wellworn phraseall they have to lose are their chains it has been said that revolution or indeed any great conflict breeds men with the necessary dimensions for leadership and the negro revolution is no exception to the ranks of the old guard leadershiproy wilkins james farmer a philip randolph whitney young jrhave been added the fine minds and special abilities of relative newcomers like martin_luther_king jr wyatt t walker james forman robert moses and john lewis they are free in the sense that they are unafraid in the sense that they know what they are doing and are confident that one fine day the nation that now resists their efforts to help it realize its own dearest dreams will have grown enough in maturity to be grateful this is indeed a new kind of negro man he arrived at this place over a rugged tortuous route beset with every conceivable danger and along the way he had only one ally one helpmate without whom he would have perished this friend this lover this savior was his woman somehowthrough a strength of character and endurance which seem in restrospect more than human she managed to endow him against all odds in spite of a culture which deliberately demeaned him with a sense of selfrespect and dignity because of her the greatgrandsons of men who were owned by other men and who were never intended to share with their owners the joys and responsibilities of normal family life stand now as paragons of manhood these bright young men of surpassing charity who possess hope and faith in truly admirable measure have brought real meaning to an old and abused concept the concept of love to their country now and to the world they offer examples of how men of all faiths and colors and races may live together in peace and with honor they nobly carry the torch borne so long and so well by their women and why is the negro woman different how did she get to be that way why has her influence on negro men been so great and so farreaching why has her role been so crucial in the struggle for equality the answers to these questions lie in american historyin those chapters few historians dare write so damning and revealing are they of dark and secret places in the american psyche dr e franklin frazier the late author of the definitive book on the negro family helped to explain the negro womans role during the period of slavery the biological tie between the negro mother and her offspring was the only human relationship among the slaves that could not be disregarded altogether he wrote after emancipation when the whole social fabric of life crumbled and the very economic basis of negro existence was destroyed it was the negro woman often alone with her children but always aiding her husband when there was one who made the survival of the negro possible even when the negro men began to assert themselves for a brief period in politics but more especially in the negros independent church organizations and lodges the negro woman became the main support of the institutional life of the negro during the years of strife and struggle of negroes for rights as citizens or even to be treated as mere human beings when negro men were lynched and not permitted to play the nor mal masculine role in an american culture the negro woman achieved a position of dominance and dignity in the lexicon of southern folklore negro branch a popular proposition holds that only white men and negro women have ever been free the freedom of the white man of course was absolute the freedom of the negro woman on the other hand was interpreted in terms of her special role in the societyas a kind of omnipresent guardiangoddess both servant and mistress wetnurse and concubine possessor of a unique power born of an intimacy as terrible as it was tender the white woman mother of her race dwelled in the cloudy sphere of myth imprisoned by the proposition that she was pure while the negro man the black lurking shadow of conscience became the eternal enemy the living breathing hotblooded threat to the regions delicately constructed house of mirrors and to the white mans mastery of his own soul the white mans ascendancy in his own fantasy demanded the degradation of the black man and so it was it was left to the woman of this degraded man to rise to those heights forbidden him and this she did knowing in her great wisdom that the sons of her loins inevitably must rise with her however late or scarred she rose she became mary church terrell the stately district of columbia schoolmarm who at the turn of this century showed a whole generation of embattled young people how to carry the struggle against racial bigotry she was mary mcleod bethune v homely little carolina waif whe built a college to train the souths despairing youth and went on to serve the nation in its greatest hour of need as advisor to the wartime president and she is pauli murray yale university law school professor lorraine hansberry playwright jeanne l noble city college of new york counselor and constance baker motley naacp attorney having long carried the beacon for her disadvantaged man the negro woman serves beside him now that he stands firm and tall on his own feet she is there on the picket lines doing battle in the pta forums and prodding reluctant boards of education in the dangerous rural areas of mississippi and georgia she is there leading the way to the polls and serving time in the jails for her pains and on another front she is awakening a welcoming world to her beauty broadening the scope and meaning of the word the whole american society today stands at the borders of a new frontier in human relationships and it has only to step over to regain for the world a new hope and a new vision if it happens that the american society can bring itself to make this move it will owe much of the rich rewards it finds to the courage and determination of the negro woman so quaint really used to git i f tired of miss lucy your people are so quaint it was her allday study look like sometime i

dreamylike an say your people theyre so qu jes that quick miss lucy was gone you know sometime i think i really liked miss lucy but i does think she was quaint south when religious members of the slave community absented themselves from the sinful activities of the more secularly inclined however just as the jordan had changed in the minds of a great many negroes to something immediate and material so these rent parties were no longer sinful but vulgar or at least wasteful i can see my grandfather now making such a pronouncement instead of the fabled existential happy carefree negroes there were now some black people who were interested in what was around them and how to get to it the people who wanted the white mans god had made these same separations in the old societyi am bound for the promised landbut they had long been losing ground in the new cities negroes appeared whose promised land was where they were now if only they could save a little money send the kids to school get a decent place to live the further movement into america and this movement this growing feeling that developed among negroes was led and fattened by a growing black middle class the migration north was of course the main reason for the rise of a black middle class in america since there was in the north that space that the increasing subtlety of the paternalistic society allowed there was greater room for progress but even in the slave society there had been the beginnings of a privileged class of negroes the house servants were extended privileges that were never enjoyed by the majority of field niggers the house nigger not only assimilated massas ideas and attitudes at a more rapid rate but his children were sometimes allowed to learn trades and become artisans and craftsmen these artisans and craftsmen made up the bulk of the black freedmen at the beginning of the civil warthese house servants as i have mentioned were the first to accept the masters religion and were the first black ministers and proselytizers for the new god the christian church in slave times represented not only a limited way into america but as it came to be the center of most of the slaves limited social activities it also produced a new ruling class among the slaves the officials of the church the church officials the house servants and the freedmen were the beginnings of the black middle class which represented and represents not only an economic condition but as is true with any stratum of any society a definite way of looking at the society in which it exists the black middle class from its inception possibly ten seconds after the first africans were herded off the boat has formed almost exclusively around the proposition that it is better not to be black in a country where being black is a liability all the main roads into america have always been fashioned by the members of the black middle class not as products of a separate culture but as vague featureless americans i pointed out earlier why negroes in north america were able to adopt the customs and habits of the masters so much more quickly than their brothers throughout the rest of the americas but still another factor was that from the very beginning of afroamerican culture in north america there have always been negroes who thought that the best way for the black man to survive was to cease being black first it was the stench of africa these aspirant americans wanted to erase then the early history of the negro in america the african gods were thrown into disrepute first and that was easy since they were banned by the whites anyway as always the masses of black men adapted rather than completely assimilated appropriated rather than traded one god or one culture for another the freedmans bureau published none of the secular songs of the negro but only the religious songs and then those that were quite readily recognizable as pickups from pale white protestant hymns it was the growing black middle class who believed that the best way to survive in america would be to disappear completely leaving no trace at all that there had ever been an africa or a slavery or even finally a black man this was the only way they thought to be citizens for the creoles and mulattoes of the south this was easier there was a quickly discernible difference between themselves and their darker brother since it was the closeness of their fathers and mothers to the masters that had produced them in the first place many of the freedmen were mulattoes and many of the mulatto freedmen and gens de couleur even had black slaves themselves but the darker members of the fledgling bourgeoisie had to work out their salvations under much more difficult circumstances the real black bourgeoisie was always lashed irrevocably to the burden of color hence the hopelessness and futility of erasing all connections to the black society when it was always impossible to erase the most significant connection of all many freedmen had moved north even during slavery they made up the majority of the northern black middle class even after the emancipation the movement north brought not only the impoverished masses but also many members of the middle class some because they thought to make an even deeper entry into america some like the church people because they had to follow their flocks or they would be out of luck whole churches moved north and the first thing many of the poor negroes did when they reached that promised land was to pool their meager resources and set up their church again and get their preacher a good place to live the storefront church was a northern phenomenon simply because in the cities these country people found it was impossible to just buy some wood and build a church as they had done in the south and many churches such as the one my parents went to progressed as their members moved up the economic ladder in the industrial north from storefront or apartment to huge albeit quixotic structures the middleclass churches were always pushing for the complete assimilation of the negro into white america middleclass baptist and methodist churches strove with all their might to do away with any of the black appropriations of christianity that rural southern negroes had affected a white christianity was after all the reason for existence of these churches and their directors always kept this in their minds many churches split once they moved north because of conflicts that arose among the members as to whether they wanted the church black or white many of the new emigrants had to set up churches of their own because they were not welcome in the black middleclass churches of the north in the s in beaver falls pennsylvania where my grandfather and his flock moved from alabama they had to build their own the tabernacle baptist church when they found that they were unwelcome in the established black baptist church because they were southerners the black residents of beaver falls wanted nothing to do with the south and its terrible memories of slavery they would cut off their own people to have a go at america the morality of the black middle class was not completely the result of a spontaneous reaction to white america it was also carefully nurtured and cultivated by certain elements of white america behind a great many manifestations of the temperament of the black middle class sits the carefully washed wisdom of the early protestant missionaries who not only founded the black christian churches but also quite consciously instilled the postrenaissance religious dogmas into their new black congregations the educational philanthropies were also attended and shaped in their beginnings by these same missionary elements who sought to show the savage heathens how through thrift prayer and work they might somehow enter into the kingdom of heaven even though it might be through the back door the paradox and perhaps the crudest psychological and cultural imposition of all was the inculcation of this puritan ethos on a people whose most elegant traditions were the complete antithesis of it of course the poor and the unlettered were the last to respond to this gift but the strivers after america the neophytes of the black middle class responded as quickly as they could in effect the way to puritan protestant heaven only existed for the black man who could pretend he was also a protestant and a puritan when the supernatural goal of the society black and white yielded to the more practical positivistic ideals of industrialized twentiethcentury america salvation belonged to those who realized that the worth of man was his ability to make money the black middle class responded to this call as it would to any call that would insure it respectability and prestige and their concomitant privilege but religious or positivist the adjustment necessary for the black man to enter completely into a white american society was a complete disavowal that he or his part of the culture had ever been anything else but american the cruel penalty for this kind of situation is the sociocultural temperament of america today where the very things that have served to erect a distinctive culture on this continent are most feared and misunderstood by the majority of americans but the fact was that by the time of the move north and precipitated in part because of it the oppression the negro knew america capable ofhis indestructible bond with this countryand the space and light he saw it capable of producing sat dictating the narrow path most negroes could travel on their way toward citizenship for negroes the oppression was an historical imperative informing each response they could make to whatever situation the society proposed but their everwidening knowledge of the country and its most profound emotional characteristics made any withdrawal impossible even the poorer negro had moved to the point where he thought perhaps he might one day live in this country as a person of certain economic capability with almost complete disregard of the color of his skin this is a brilliant yet desperately conceived hypothesis but its validity has yet to be demonstrated however the moralreligious tradition of the black middle class is a weird mixture of cultural opportunism and fear it is a tradition that is capable of reducing any human conceit or natural dignity to the barest form of social outrage it is uncomfortably symbolic that there were some negroes absent from the rent and barbecue parties just as it is analogous of the social microcosm that at twelve oclock in the old tin type hall in new orleans around the turn of the century when the ball was getting right the more respectable negroes who did attend went home then bolden played a number called dont go a way nobody and the dancing got rough when the orchestra settled down to the slow blues the music was mean and dirty as tin type roared full blast it was not only the creoles purely political made social response to a negro music but the feeling of the black people themselves that there were things much more important than the natural expression of a vital culture in the north before the migration that hurled all the deepest blacks of southern negro culture into america at large the northern negroes had to a great extent secured themselves a leaky boat of security from these reminders of the slave culture most of the negro population in new york then around had either been born there or had been in the city so long they were fully acclimated they were trying to forget the traditions of the south they were trying to emulate the whites you couldnt deliver a package to a negros front door you had to go down to the cellar door and negroes dressed to go to work they changed into work clothes when they got there you usually werent allowed to play blues and boogie woogie in the average negro middleclass home that music supposedly suggested a low element and the big bands with the violins flutes piccolos didnt play them either one of the funniest and most cruelly absurd situations to develop because of the growth and influence of a definable black middle class in america is the case of black swan records black swan was founded and run by a negro harry pace during the early twenties it was the first negroowned record company in the country and it quickly grew into a moneymaker its success based to a large extent on the popularity of its star performer a young girl named ethel waters black swan also recorded numerous other blues performers and advertised its products as the only genuine colored record others are only passing for colored a wild turnabout but many negroes especially those in business brought pressure on pace to change his position since they thought that the job of a negro recording company would be to show how dignified negroes really were and of course blues were not dignified pace tried to use all kinds of other material that was not strictly blues for this reason ethel waters with her torchy pop style was a godsend but the popularity of the company waned because the audience to which the records were largely aimed did not care as much about the dignity of its musical tastes as the negro business com munity finally black swan was sold to paramount a white company which had no qualms about recording the rougher less dignified blues performers the space the city provided grew quickly vertical the idea of society or at least divisions within a social milieu grew more common among negroes the earlier mulattofreedmanhouse servantfield servant division that became so fixed within the slave society was of course broken down but the new strata forming within the free black societies proved to be equally as rigid the new society based its divisions almost completely upon acquisition reflecting and reacting to the changed psyche of twentiethcentury america in the black society the change was effected almost exclusively by the mass movement north and the openness of the new industrial culture the older stricter divisions of black society based on certain mythological characteristics of colorcaste and the importance of less menial positions within the slave culture were broken down because many field niggers and money men darkskinned africanlooking negroes could go into mr fords factories and make a day just like a white man the white societys need for negro laborers and the resulting scramble into the great northern cities smeared the caste lines of an older black society and began to form a sprawling bourgeoisie based on the pay checkan almost exact duplication of the way in which the earlier caste system of white america was debased but the white society still had some semblance of casteits first families intact although frequently as heads or captains of industry negroes could not become captains of industry and could never have belonged to any first families except perhaps as family retainers so it was the professional mendoctors lawyers ministerswho were the heads of the new black society and these people wanted more than anything in life to become citizens they were not ever satisfied with being freedmen or former slaves they wanted no connection with that stain on americas past and what is more they wanted the right which they thought they could earn by moving sufficiently away from the blacker culture to look on that stain as objectively as possible when they had to and to refer to it from the safety of the basitions of the white middle class they did not even want to be accepted as themselves they wanted any self which the mainstream dictated and the mainstream always dictated and this black middle class in turn tried always to dictate that self or this image of a whiter negro to the poorer blacker negroes the effects of these attempts by the black middle class to whiten the black culture of this country are central to my further discussions on the sociological significance of the changes in negro music but i think it might be useful here to consider also the effects this whitening had in other cultural areas i think it is not fantastic to say that only in music has there been any significant negro contribution to a formal american culture for the most part most of the other contributions made by black americans in the areas of painting drama and literature have been essentially undistinguished the reasons for this tragic void are easy to understand if one realizes one important idea about the existence of any black culture in this country the only negroes who found themselves in a position to pursue some art especially the art of literature have been members of the negro middle class only negro music because perhaps it drew its strength and beauty out of the depths of the black mans soul and because to a large extent its traditions could be carried on by the lowest classes of negroes has been able to survive the constant and willful dilutions of the black middle class and the persistent calls to oblivion made by the mainstream of the society of course that mainstream wrought very definite and very constant changes upon the form of the american negros music but the emotional significance and vitality at its core remain to this day unaltered it was the one vector out of african culture impossible to eradicate it signified the existence of an afroamerican and the existence of an afroamerican culture and in the evolution of form in negro music it is possible to see not only the evolution of the negro as a cultural and social element of american culture but also the evolution of that culture itself the coon shout proposed one version of the american negro and of america bessie smith proposed another swing and bebop as i shall attempt to point out propose still another but the point is that both these versions are accurate and informed with a legitimacy of emotional concern nowhere available in say what is called negro literature the reason is as terrifying as it is simple the middleclass black man whether he wanted to be a writer or a painter or a doctor developed an emotional allegiance to the middleclass middlebrow culture of america that obscured or actually made hideous any influence or psychological awareness that seemed to come from outside what was generally acceptable to a middleclass white man especially if those influences were identifiable as coming from the most despised group in the country the black middle class wanted no subculture nothing that could connect them with the poor black man or the slave literature for most negro writers for instance was always an example of culture in the narrow sense of cultivation or sophistication in an individual within their own group the negro artist because of his middleclass background carried an artificial social burden as the best and most intelligent of negroes and usually entered into the serious arts to exhibit his social gracesas a method or means of displaying his participation in the serious aspects of western culture to be a writer was to be cultivated in the stunted bourgeois sense of the word it was also to be a quality black man not merely an ordinary nigger early negro novelists such as charles chesnutt otis shackleford sutton griggs even though he was more militant pauline hopkins produced works that were potboilers for the growing negro middle class the books were also full of the same prejudices and conceits that could be found in the novels of their models the white middle class the contempt for the lowerclassed negroes found in these novels by black novelists is amazing and quite blatant and as robert a bone points out it must be understood at once that the early negro novelists believed substantially in the myth of anglosaxon superiority pauline hopkins writes surely the negro race must be productive of some valuable specimens if only from the infusion which amalgamation with a superior race must eventually bring chesnutts and griggss heroes were usually refined afroamericans as bone shows further in several of the early novels there is a stock situation in which a refined afroamerican is forced to share a jim crow car with dirty boister ous and drunken negroes the idea of the separation the strata had developed within the group the thin division of field hand from house servant had widened and the legacy of the house servant was given voice constantly in the work of the early negro writers as bone says when all the sound and fury of these novels has evaporated what remains is an appeal for an alliance between the better class of colored people and the quality white folks and an amen could be heard to that sentiment throughout the rising black churches of the north of course the negro novelist ceased to be so blatantly patronizing and disparaging of most negroes when the social climate in the country itself became more liberal no longer would a member of the negro middle class be idiotic enough to write as shackleford once did in his novel lilliam simmons she could understand why jim crow cars and all other forms of segregation in the south were necessary but she could not feel that it was fair to treat all colored people alike because all were not alike by the twenties spurred again by the movement of negroes to the north and the change that had made of a basically agricultural country an industrial giant thereby transforming the core of the negro population from farm workers into a kind of urban proletariat a great change also took place among negro artists and intellectuals even though they were still fundamentally the products of the negro middle class and still maintained rather firmly many emotional and intellectual ties with it the negro novelists of the twenties at least began to realize that the earlier attitudes of the black middle class were the most agonizing remnants of the slave mentality it was now that the middle class demanded through its spokesmen the novelists and the more intrepid educators at least equality it was the beginning of what was called the negro renaissance and the emergence of what alain locke called the new negro but if now the more cultivated members of the black middle class began to realize that the old stance of whiter negroes could not effect an entrance into the mainstream of american society these writers in fact rebelled against the entire concept of a slavish disparagement of the negro by negroes as a prerequisite for such privilege this rebellion still took form within the confines of the american middleclass mind even if those confines had been somewhat broadened by the internationalism imposed upon the country by world war i even the term new negro for all its optimistic and rebellious sound still assumes that it is a different kind of negro who is asking for equality not old rastus the slave there is still for all the race pride and race consciousness that these spokesmen for the negro renaissance claimed the smell of the dry rot of the middleclass negro mind the idea that somehow negroes must deserve equality the spirit of this renaissance was divided as an emotional entity into three separate and easily identifiable reactions corresponding to the cultural stratum of the particular negroes who had to interpret it the rising middle classspawned intelligentsia invented the term new negro and the idea of the negro renaissance to convey to the white world that there had been a change of tactics as to how to climb onto the bandwagon of mainstream american life the point here is that this was to be conveyed to white america it was another conscious reaction to that white america and another adaptation of the middleclass negros selfconscious performance for his ever appreciative white audience there was a loud sudden but understandably strained appreciation for things black by this intelligentsia the harlem school of writers attempted to glorify the lives of the black masses but only succeeded in making their lives seem exotic as literary themes it produced a generation and a tradition of lafcadio hearns the reproduction of a black america as real as the white america these writers seemed to sense as the norm was never realized a white man carl van vechten mechanized and finally straitjacketed a good part of the negro renaissance when he wrote the novel nigger heaven which many negro writers have never ceased to imitate for poorer negroes as i have mentioned before marcus garveys back to africa movement represented the renewed sense of race pride the concept of the new negro represented for the middleclass intelligentsia garvey thought and persuaded a great body of the negro masses that equality could never be achieved in the united states and the negro should seek to embrace his older truer african traditions and eventually set up an independent black state in africa although garvey ultimately failed his call to mother africa inspired thousands of negroes though of course the middle class would have nothing to do with him not only because it did not want to be associated with a movement that involved the poorer negro but also because any mention of africa only conjured up frightening visions of undigested tarzan movies the middle class reacted to the growing nationalism among poorer negroes and the intelligentsia by adopting a milder kind of nationalism themselves and even though most were startled at first by the kind of radicalism that the niagara movement which led to the eventual establishment of the naacp and people like w e b dubois represented they did begin to protest in earnest about jim crow and the brotherhood of man they eventually took over such organizations as the naacp aided by the dependence of such organizations on the philanthropies of white liberals and molded them to their own purposes but from the beginning when the black middle class began to realign itself toward an american from which they could ask equality instead of privilege they had oriented themselves as wouldbe citizens rather than freedmen or exslaves and this is the fundamental difference perhaps even the single line of demarcation separating the black middle class from the rest of the negroes living in the united states the middle class accepts the space the openness and or liberalism of twentiethcentury america as the essential factor of its existence in this country as citizens but when the recognized barriers to such citizenship are reached when all their claims to equality with the rest of america on the one hand and superiority on the other to their own black brothers seem a useless and not wholly idealistic delusion because in the end they are still regarded by this society as only negroes they are content with the name secondclass citizens this at least shows them with a foot in the door if somehow still having to battle to get the rest of themselves in always in behind the calm facade of white middleclass america for the black intelligentsia the term secondclass citizen was a meaningless hoax and the poorer negro never even considered the idea of citizenship as something that could be extended in this country to a person with a black skin the poor negro always remembered himself as an exslave and used this as the basis of any dealing with the mainstream of american society the middleclass black man bases his whole existence on the hopeless hypothesis that no one is supposed to remember that for almost three centuries there was slavery in america that the white man was the master and the black man the slave this knowledge however is at the root of the legitimate black culture of this country it is this knowledge with its attendant muses of selfdivision selfhatred stoicism and finally quixotic optimism that informs the most meaningful of afroamerican music my burdens so heavy i cant hardly see seems like everybody is down on me an thats all right i dont worry oh there will be a better day the most expressive negro music of any given period will be an exact reflection of what the negro himself is it will be a portrait of the negro in america at that particular time who he thinks he is what he thinks america or the world to be given the circumstances prejudices and delights of that particular america negro music and negro life in america were always the result of a reaction to and an adaptation of whatever american negroes were given or could secure for themselves the idea of ever becoming americans in the complete social sense of that word would never have been understood by negro slaves even after the emancipation such a concept would have seemed like an unamusing fantasy to most negroes since many times the very term america must have meant for them a place they dont want you america for negroes was always divided into black and white master and slave and as such could not simply be called america and so there have been since slavery two americas a white america and a black america both responsible to and for the other one oppressed the other the oppressor but an even more profound difference between these two americas has been their awareness of each other or the degree to which the one america is aware of the other the white america has never had more than a cursory knowledge of black america even during the days of the negro renaissance as i have pointed out the knowledge of black america obtained by white america for all the talk to the contrary was never more than superficial but the black american has always had to know what was on the white mans mind even if as a slave he had no full knowledge of what america really was the negros adaptation to american life has been based since the emancipation on his growing knowledge of america and his increasing acquaintance with the workings of the white mans mind the negro american had always sought to adapt himself to the other america and to exist as a casual product of this adaptation but this central concept of afroamerican culture was discarded by the middle class after the move north and the sophistication that that provided it was assimilation the middle class desired not only to disappear within the confines of a completely white america but to erase forever any aspect of a black america that had ever existed the separation i spoke of between the freedman and the citizen is basic to any understanding of the evolution of black america from a relatively homogenous social cultural and geographical unit existing strictly apart from white america negroes became a group of diverse americans forming a psychological chain that begins with a complete awareness of and dependence on what is now called a folk culture and moves to a completely antithetical extreme to those negroes who are completely dependent upon the culture of mainstream america it is a psychological chain much like a spectrum that begins at deepest black and moves easily into american gray there was a period of transition however when for the majority of negroes the chain did not stretch completely into gray america but the separation the cleavage within black america was beginning to be quite apparent the beginning of this cleavage within black america was demonstrated in microcosm in new orleans even before the mass exodus of negroes northward new orleans with its coexisting complex of social cultural and racial influences predated the modern postworldwari northern city in many ways french spanish english african and caribbean cultures existed simultaneously within new orleans and all were thriving within what could be called the black society there was already the extreme cleavage i have mentioned based for the most part on socioethnic considerations most easily verified by color the creoles gens de couleur and mulattoes existed both socially and economically as the more generalized black middle class was to do in later years they encouraged the separation between themselves and their darker usually poorer halfbrothers and they emphasized this separation as formally as they could by trying to emulate as much as possible the white french culture of new orleans the downtown people acquired most of the european instrumental techniques and disparaged the vocal blues style that raged uptown in the black belt but the repressive segregation laws passed at the turn of the century forced the light people into closer social and economic relationships with the blacker culture and it was the connections engendered by this forced merger that produced a primitive jazz the black rhythmic and vocal tradition was translated into an instrumental music which utilized some of the formal techniques of european dance and march music later the merging of the southern blues tradition with the musical traditions of the northern negro produced an instrumental music similar in intent to the early jazz of new orleans and when the instrumental innovators themselves began to be heard in the north the music jazz had already developed further aided by the architectonic and technical ideas of ragtime into a more completely autonomous music the important idea here though is that the first jazzmen were from both sides of the fences from the darker blues tradition and a certain fixed sociocultural and most of the time economic stratum and also from the white creole tradition and its worship of what were certainly the ideals of a francoamerican middle class also the negroes who hired the blues men into their dance and society bands in the north were ofttimes byproducts of the desire of negroes to set up a black middle class so were many of the musicians who were influenced by the dirty way of playing this meant that as jazz developed after the early twenties in this country it could only be a music that would reflect the sociocultural continuum that had developed within negro america from blackest black to whitest white the jazz player could come from any part of that sociocultural spectrum but if he were to play a really moving kind of jazz he had to reflect almost all of the musical spectrum or at least combine sufficiently the older autonomous blues tradition with the musical traditions of the creoles or the ragtime orchestras of the north and thus jazz could not help but reflect the entire black society such a thing as a middleclass blues singer is almost unheard of it is it seems to me even a contradiction of terms jazz as it emerged and as it developed was based on this new widening of afroamerican culture in the best of jazz the freedmancitizen conflict is most nearly resolved because it makes use of that middle ground the space that exists as the result of any cleavage where both emotional penchants can exist as ideas of perhaps undetermined validity and not necessarily as ways of life first there was after the emancipation an america then there was a north and after world war i even places and sets of ideas that were not american that was in one sense as far as the blues would go as a completely autonomous music the blues as a fully integrated american experience was what was called classic blues publicly as american performers the great lady blues singers of the twenties brought blues to a social and cultural significance that it never has had before or since the jazz people took over from there blues in its most significant form again returned underground into the house parties and black cabarets that existed in the new black communities of the north with all the wild unamerican abandon which was supposed to typify the premiddleclass negro society without the jazz players blues would have existed as an american music ie considered as such by the mainstream only during the time of the classic singers before their time and after it autonomous blues was the product of a subculture given the necessary social involvement with american culture negroes themselves would have drifted away from blues since it no longer was an exact reflection of their lives in america for the developing black middle class it was simply the mark of cain and just another facet of negroness which they wished to be rid of but jazz even with its weight of blues could make itself available as an emotional expression to the changing psyche of the modern negro just as in less expressive ways it made itself available to the modern american white man during the twenties when jazz was first beginning to be heard in the north and in whatever diverse presentations throughout america it was still in a period of transition the older blues people were still coming into the northern cities the classic singers were at their peaks and the newer city blues was also developing as the expression of a new subculture as well as the spontaneous piano music boogie woogie or the eastern stride piano style that was concomitant with it but the jazz players were also coming into these towns and a whole new generation of negroes was born into this transitional culturethe first generation with a preponderance of citizens rather than exslaves these were the people who had to decide what was to be done with blues and what weight it would have in their lives at the same time there were still a great many negroes who had known slavery personally or knew it as the emotional idea on which any experience of america had to be based all these negroes existed as black america the extremes were the rentparty people at the one end of black society and the various levels of parvenu middle class at the other jazz represented perhaps the link connecting the two if they were to be connected the verticality of the city began to create two separate secularities and the blues had to be divided among them if it was going to survive at all my fellow americans v on yesterday i went before the congress to speak for the first time as president of the united states tonight on this thanksgiving i come before you to ask your help to ask your strength to ask your prayers that god may guard this republic and guide my every labor yesterday is not ours to recover but tomorrow is ours to win or lose i am resolved that we shall win the tomorrow before us so i ask you to join me in that resolve determined that from this midnight of tragedy we shall move toward a new american greatness our system has passed you have passed a great test you have shown what john f kennedy called upon us to show in his proclamation of this thanksgiving that decency of purpose that steadfastness of resolve and that strength of will which we inherit from our forefathers what better conveys what is best for america than this on saturday november when these great burdens had been mine only hours the first two citizens to call upon me and to offer their whole support were dwight d eisenhower and harry s truman since last friday americans have turned to the good to the decent values of our life these have served us yes these have saved us the service of our public institutions and our public men is the salvation of us all from the supreme court to the states and how much better would it be how much more sane it would be how much more decent an america it would be if all americans could give their time and spend their energies helping our system and its servants to solve your problems instead of pouring out the venom and the hate that stalemate us in progress i have served in washington years years yesterday i have seen five presidents fill this awesome office i have known them well and ive counted them all as friendspresident herbert hoover president franklin d roosevelt president harry truman president dwight eisenhower and president john f kennedy in each administration the greatest burden that the president had to bear had been the burden of his own countrymens unthinking and unreasoning hate and division so in these days the fate of this office is the fate of us all i would ask all americans in reverence to think on these things let all who speak and all who teach and all who preach and all who publish and all who broadcast and all who read or listen let them reflect upon their responsibilities to bind our wounds to heal our sores to make our society well and whole for the tests ahead of us it is this work that i most want us to doto banish rancor from our words and malice from our heartsto close down the poison springs of hatred and intolerance and fanaticismto perfect our unity north and south east and west to hasten the day when bias of race religion and region is no more and to bring the day when our great energies and decencies and spirit will be free of the burden that we have borne too long let us today renew our dedication to the ideals that are american let us pray for his divine wisdom in banishing from our land any injustice or intolerance or oppression to any of our fellow americans whatever their opinion whatever the color of their skins for god made all of not some of us in his image all of us not just some of us are his children this is our challengenot to hesitate not to pause not to turn about and linger over this evil momonet but to continue on our course so that we may fulfill the destiny history has set for us our most immediate tasks are here on this hill first no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor president kennedys memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil_rights bill for which he fought we have talked long enough in this country about equal rights we have talked for years or more yet it is time now to write the next chapterand to write it in books of law i urge you again as i did in and again in to enact a civil_rights law so that we can move forward to eliminate from this nation every trace of discrimination and oppression based upon race or color there could be no greater source of strength to this nation both at home and abroad as one who has long served in both houses of the congress i firmly believe in the independence and integrity of the legislative branch i promise you that i shall always respect this it is deep in the marrow of my bones with equal firmness i believe in the capacity and the ability of the congress despite the divisions of opinion which characterize our nation to actto act wisely vigorously and speedily when the need arises the need is here the need is now i ask your help i know we meet in grief but let us also meet in renewed dedication and renewed vigor let us meet in action in tolerance and mutual understanding civil_rights struggle i look toward a p one fact is unmistak ably clear the thrust u u jj emancipation will increase rather than decrease the immediate assessment against the backdrop of the summer of could easily be one that anticipates less activity because some measurable gains have been made in hunone relates directly to the other on thanksgiving weekend sncc workers gathered in washington to discuss the ways and means of bringing some measure of economic independence to rural negroes at a threeday conferencewell named for food and jobssncc workers from alabama mississippi georgia and across the south discussed techniques of fighting employment bias of fighting the political and economic stronghold racists have on the american scene and finally new ways to protest against this unjust system of segregation sncc workers who had been beaten kicked some who had been tortured and shot at gathered to discuss formation of an america where no man is hungry none jobless where no man beats another where no one goes to jail because he attempts to register to vote nineteen sixtyfour will see the beginning of a new political awakening among negroes no longer will urban negroes feel their votes are flowing downward into a machine and no longer will rural negroes be afraid to brave police clubs and guns to stand all day in line to register in the negro movement will become the peoples movement a movement for all the hungry all the poor all the voteless in we will remember president kennedys words a man must sometimes sit down for his rights in order to stand up for themdreds of individual communities as well as across the nation however closer scrutiny of the negro revolution will reveal that the awareness of his gains has only whetted his appetite for more gains and more quickly an ancillary force is the fact that whereas a year ago only a sprinkling of cities south and north had been involved in demonstrations picketing etc now there are nearly cities where under the banner of nonviolence some baptism of fire has taken place the negro as a community has increased his skill tremendously in quantity and quality the civil_rights legislation now before congress will feel the intense focus of negro interest it was born in the streets of birmingham amid snarling dogs and the battering of fire hoses it was fashioned in the jail cells of the south and by the marching feet in the north it became the order of the day at the great march on washington last summer the negro and his compatriots for selfrespect and human dignity will not be denied if a filibuster occurs the nation might well fasten its safety belt once the bill is written into law there will still be the matter of implementation state by state and community by community then of course there is the matter of wider use of the technique of selective patronage as popularized is at this moment an elaborate plan to broaden the base of selective buying in order that the power of the negro consumer market can be used as a lever to pry open the door to wider employment opportunities the negro has learned his lesson well if you respect my dollar then you must also respect my person the advent of monstrous automation coupled with the negro comprising the largest segment of americas semiskilled and unskilled labor force makes equal employment opportunities one of the priority concerns of the negro community in the innovation for this year will be largescale selective buying programs aimed at the giants in the consumer industry i do not foresee any widespread turning of the negro to violence this will perhaps be a glowing commentary on the success of the nonviolent method in bringing about social transformation that produces tangible results the last years record has demonstrated that nonviolence is more than pious injunctions to do good for evil it is also a practical technique that has maintained a sense of hope in the american negro community that america can realize the dreams of the founding fathers should compound the gains realized in in projecting the shape of things to comealways a perilous ventureone needs not only the guidance of the past but also a comprehension of the social economic and political factors fashioning todays patterns in no era of contemporary american life are these factors more in flux more erratic than in race relations the one definite thing that may be said is that winds of change along the civil_rights front are blowing throughout the nation theres no present indication that they will subside in by the end of it was abundantly clear that the two most powerful instruments for change possessed by the negro are the ballot and the dollar the problem confronting the civil_rights organizations in as the effective mobilization and utilization of these resources in the fight for freedom there will of course be supplementary activities but the main thrust will undoubtedly be political and economic the national association for the advancement of colored people has already ordered steppedup voter registration campaigns by its branches in every state in which negro citizens reside in sizeable numbers that is in every such state except alabama where a state court injunction still bars naacp activity the naacp is the only national civil_rights organization which has carried on a steady voter registration campaign year in year out since it has had roving staff members one working out of richmond va and one out of memphis tenn organizing and supervising voter registration drives in scores of localities to achieve the goal of maximum registration requires not only money but also thousands of volunteers to perform the necessary drudgery of doortodoor canvassing in local communities rallies and speechmaking are helpful but they are not enough alone to get additional names on the registration rolls important too is concentration on the goal of registration and the avoidance if at all possible of provocative sideline activities that may stir certain communities and result in publicized brushes with law enforcement officers but which do not actually add names to the voting lists the kind of civil_rights law that emerges from congress will in large measure depend upon how convinced members of congress are that we mean business as far as voting is concerned the earlier we get effective campaigns under way in the new year the stronger the law there is now no doubt that a civil_rights bill will be enacted in the question is how strong a law the goal of the naacps nonpartisan political program is the election of candidates committed to civil_rights irrespective of party label the votes the naacp seeks to mobilize will be for the man and what he stands for and not for the party the other major front on which decisive action may be anticipated in is the economic not only negro consumers but big business also are beginning to realize the potency of the races billion purchasing power properly mobilizedthis immense economic force can open up new employment opportunities for negroes at all levels exploration should be made also of the further mobilization of the financial resources of the race to provide capital for retail businesses industrial and manufacturing ventures distributing systems and financial concerns there will be intensified economic action in particularly in local communities there may also be calls for nationwide action against products the manufacturers or processors of which engage in discriminatory practices recent surveys reveal an increasing responsiveness among negro consumers to proposals for such action other important programs will be required in to stem the excessively high unemployment rate among negro workers these include legislation to stimulate the economy to provide public works and to institute a massive retraining program for workers displaced by automation discrimination against negroes in apprenticeship training programs and skilled employment must be halted either by legislation court decisions or direct action certainly publiclyfinanced construction cannot continue to bar negroes from skilled jobs abolition of such discrimination is a imperative in addition to political and economic action there will be important activities in other areas in the civil_rights struggle as the need arises there will be demonstrations to gain specific objectives the fight for open occupancy in housing privately financed as well as public will continue as will the struggle to eliminate segregation in education in nonsouthern states as well as in dixie the outlook for substantial civil_rights gains in is as of this writing more promising than ever before there is a new national administration committed to civil_rights legislative and executive action and with presidential elections coming up an enlarged negro electorate will be able to exert greater influence in the political arena an increasing number of southern cities having learned well the lessons of birmingham and jackson are prepared to make adjustments in accordance with constitutional requirements there is also growing awareness that the supreme courts antisegregation decrees cannot be permanently circumvented and above all the negro remains firmly determined to forge ahead unrelentingly in the struggle for full equality the year probably will be known as the i t year of the passage of the first civil_rights legislation accommodations provision i expect that the bill will be passed in the second session of the present congress it will also are beginning to realize the potency of the races billion purchasing power properly mobilizedthis immense economic force can open up new employment opportunities for negroes at all levels exploration should be made also of the further mobilization of the financial resources of the race to provide capital for retail businesses industrial and manufacturing ventures distributing systems

forge ahead unrelentingly in the struggle for full equality nineteen sixty three has presented a confrontation with every american citizen as to the dimension of the problem the intensity and the alternatives no american can now be indifferent the future of race relations both immediate and long range will be dependent upon the response to that confrontation rights bill is not passed at a much accelerated pace even if the bill is passed demonstrations will be necessary to insure its implementation and enforcement in the new year there will be several new emphases in addition to those of the past a drive will be made to broaden the base of support for the civil_rights revolution more allies will be sought from other minority groups and from sympathetic american whites the revolution will move into an important new stage of noncooperation with segregation and discrimination the demonstrations will continue to exhibit and show the depth of feeling on this issue which exists in the negro community to increase motivation and unity among our ranks and to spotlight the problems for all america to see but in expanded ranks and new allies will be urged in the words of thoreau to see to it that they do not lend themselves to the evil which they condemn in other words there will be selective buying on a larger scale than ever before investments will be withheld from institutions which subsidize and practice segregation the revolution will not be fully completed in but it will be moved a full measure forward i predict further that president lyndon b johnson in spite of being a southerner will prove to have convictions and feelings in behalf of civil_rights at least equal to any of his predecessors we will not always agree with him and will not approve at all times of his actions at such times we will of course say so but i expect him to be a positive force in the civil_rights situation rather than a negative one let us all be black together i am your child and yet i v alien from you you are comfortable educated negroes uninvolved in movements j mtu and that sort of stuff and you have made me comfortable well groomed soontograduatefromcollege but we are different as different as black and white this feeling of alienation came upon me when i returned to home and school in the north after a summers work with the student nonviolent coordinating committees voter registration projects in georgia and mississippi i left a place where people risked their jobs and personal safety so that they could vote and returned to one where the right to vote was uncontested and people wouldnt even try to develop significant black political strength i left a place where people shared food with me when there was not enough for their own families and came back to one where negroes have to be cajoled with the promise of a picture in the newspaper so that they will give to help their own people a place where social workers say you know we actually go out in the streets and talk to those people and i felt alone why what happened one answer has presented itself i learned in that summer of dirt roads pavement ends where the negro section begins jail demonstrations efforts to help people see that they had a right to vote and mass meetings that i am black while you in your minds are white i am black in that i am proud of my roots in africa and in slave america and in that i am involved in the fight for the wellbeing of black people you are white in that you live and operate within a framework of white values many of which are not applicable to the condition of our people most of us are pretty tightly bound to the negro race and to its progress or lack of progress some may escape into a white world by way of intelligence money or luck but most will remain bound together by the ghettos by customs by color like it or not at this point in time in history negroes and whites are not alike the differences go much deeper than mere color we are a different group of people we are not the economically stabilized socially developed group that isif we are to believe the sociologiststhe white americans whether we are to believe them or not is a color of another horse what is important is that this concept of what americans are has led to the adoption and maintenance of values which are not applicable to us we cannot be highly stable secure people when negro unemployment is twice as high as that for whites when counties in mississippi have less than two negro voters each when in greenwood miss negroes have no access to a public library when men make a day picking cotton in season and children are taken out of school to work in the cotton fields we are not this stable group and yet your values are those of such a group for example you have asked or will ask how can we insist that a man serve us at his own lunch counter the answer is that private property is inviolable only if the society is so highly developed that most property needs are taken care of this is not so for us right now people are preparing in mississippi in alabama to bcold and hungry because winter is here the value of the privacy of property cannot be strongly held by people in such a situation such a value must be generously mixed with the proposition that as long as what you have affects me and my serious need i have some influence to exert over it many of you are afraid to go to jail because you have built up in you a respect for law the respect is good but the laws being attacked were made without any consideration of you and are enforced to keep you down why should i respect a law whereby i could not even walk with nine people outside the negro section of albany ga there is another white value held by you which is of great importance at this point the term white must be qualified a strict division of black people and white people is not meant the reference to white values is to values of the large part of american society which is white that is that every man should go for himself this ideal holds well if most men are able to satisfy their needs but consider the fact that many men in our social group are not able to do for themselves in the first case the white case the social group can maintain itself and grow using the every man for himself value but in the second such a rule is senseless now in the light of our disenfranchisement in the south poor schools everywhere joblessness it is into this second case that we fall and the point is that the negro people cannot flourish and develop if we hold to the value that everyone should make it on his own that is a white idea appropriate perhaps for a white society certainly inappropriate for a black one we must instead make it a value to help one another continuously this may be taken religiously but that is not my emphasis the emphasis is on a more worldly point that you must become black a legitimate response to this cry of alienation is that one should expect to be alone when he becomes involved in a cause but the issue is not really the aloneness rather it is that we cannot afford its source your white values we must be black together if we are not to run this race

and mr rowan promptly broke all the traditions taking the capital by storm but he would have taken helsinki by storm in any case for carl rowan happens to be a negro in fact the news of his appointment had set all finland buzzing not because of any racial prejudice for none is evident but because of a curiosity about a race rarely seen here and so the press informed the nation on the rowans arrival that the ambassador and his sons are chocolate brown and that his wife is considerably lighter but it was soon apparent that the finns felt that color aside this ambassador was definitely out of the ordinary he went on a constant round of speeches travel receptions bull sessions bowling golfing and taking the steam with university students and others in the sauna mr rowan is convinced that as a spaceage envoy he should undertake anything that might help provide a broader understanding of america and what it stands for the usual career ambassador in helsinki quietly settles into diplomatic routine after the stripedpants procedure of presenting credentials and paying ceremonial calls upon fellow diplomats and finnish officials but mr rowans traditions are not from the world of diplomacy he was catapulted into his ambassadorship after years as a newsman and two as a state department custodian of press relations as deputy assistant secretary of state for public affairs hurtling into diplomacy with all the furious energy of a kennedy election campaign the fledgling ambassador crammed five major speeches into his first six weeks along with three forays into the finnish hinterland to pay official visits to southwestern and northern cities from the outset newspapers and magazines featured pictures of the ambassador of his wife vivien sons yearold carl jr and yearold geoffrey and miniature greyhound gomez many of the pictures were of diplomatic activity finns had never seen before his excellency was shown for example walking atop an iron fence with his boys or hunting through a neighbors back yard for a baseball while the lady of the house hung up the wash a popular magazine after his first week here ran a feature article headlined the most colorful ambassador in helsinkia headline that caused mr rowan to toss his head back in laughter at the end of his first month however he was happy to note that his whirlwind brand of diplomacy was beginning to be reported without reference to his race but he says even in that first month when finnish newspapers almost invariably described him as darkskinned he only rarely had any consciousness here of being a negro the few times that he did were when he listened to voice of america or bbc broadcasts on race riots in the united states or when he had to discuss them at news conferences he won admiration for declaring that he was not ashamed to speak of the riots even though they were a national disgrace he stressed that the negroes of america had made great progress in the last two decades and that they now had more government support than ever before at the same time finnish newsmen who had the opportunity to participate in a bull session with him were flabbergasted by his willingness to tell stories at his own expense about his experiences as a negro in the united states one that caused special astonishment was an account of mowing the lawn of the house he had while he was with the state department in washington a white woman driving a big car pulled up to hail him as boy and ask how much he charged his only pay for mowing the lawn he replied was the privilege of sleeping with the lady of the house mr rowan surprised helsinki in other ways as well he does not give the impression in closeup of an aggressive personality likely to make a fastpaced debut as an ambassador heavy set he seems to move almost languidly speaking with a slow drawl bearing the stamp of his native tennessee he seems much older than his years he says he grew old at an early age he was in his late teens before he set out from his redclay home town of mcminnville tenn where he had romped barefoot along streets filled with sharp stones these days he sometimes looks i i i ii speculatively at his two sons about the best dressed boys in helsinki and wonders if they will ever amount to anything for they have never had to go barefoot he left mcminnville with cents in his pocket carrying his clothes in a cardboard box his road led first to a summer job in a nashville hospital then to a negro college and it being wartime on to a united states navy officer training school as one of the first negroes to be admitted under what was then a new policy he was the only negro in a class of he says and that ages you fast but world war ii in which yearold ensign rowan served as a communications officer on two vessels in the atlantic turned out to be his big break it got me out of the race situation for it led to his move north he went on to win his bachelors degree from oberlin college in ohio his masters from the university of minnesota and a job with the minneapolis tribune on which he achieved acclaim for his reporting on the negro in the south and on social conditions in india and other asian countries his articles became the bases for three books he received honorary doctorates from simpson college in iowa and hamline university in minnesota attracting the attention of president kennedy he was appointed to the state department in february named ambassador early this year he came to helsinki determined to judge for himself whether there was justification for the suspicions often encountered in washington about finnish relations with the neighboring soviet union he was not content to let the usual circle of business and uppercrust finns and some other selected leaders dominate embassy functions in a bid to talk to as many finns as possible he is struggling to gain something of a conversational ability in the exceedingly difficult finnish language since most people in this farmerdominated northern country speak only finnish he said in an interview that he had nothing against the elite he and his wife like culture and good cognac as well as the next people he declared but he thinks that the revolutionary changes that the world has undergone in the last two decades have also changed the requirement of diplomacy making it necessary for the spaceage ambassador to reach the masses in a great variety of ways it is just as much an ambassadors job to go bowling golfing or to a track meet he said as it is to go to the endless number of teas and diplomatic receptions finns in general appear to be impressed and pleased with ambassador rowan and his accent on public relations one official has already compared him with john moors cabot now united states ambassador to poland who has been highly popular wherever he has served because of his insistence on meeting and discussing america and its ideals with as many people as he could managehere in the early nineteenfifties and subsequently in sweden colombia and brazil mr rowan has also made a deep impression here with his speeches which he writes himself aware though he is of finlands delicate position between east and west he deems it his duty nevertheless to express his countrys views without equivocation and so in a speech in which he decried the sovietled assault on the united nations he suggested that it had been mounted because of clear evidence that the uncommitted peoples these new members of the un have by and large exactly the same goals as do the people of the united states and the rest of the free world such remarks would scarcely seem extraordinary in the united states but to many finns accustomed to the increasingly careful finnish pronouncements of recent years they appeared a bit startling though welcome what does mr rowan hope to accomplish here he has no grand strategy but already his pattern of diplomacy is clear his is a mission largely to the finnish masses but he also wants to get on such a casual basis with finnish government leaders that he can telephone for an appointment just to chat and not only when he has official business to transmit the ambassador apparently can take partial credit for one of the most significant publicrelations triumphs the united states has ever scored in finland the outpouring of proamerican sentiment by the unexpectedly large and enthusiastic crowds that greeted vice president johnson during his september visit before leaving washington for helsinki mr rowan had pressed hard for more attention to finland by highlevel americans going abroad the johnson visit was said to be an indirect result of this in general besides trying to enhance if possible the already excellent finnishamerican relations mr rowan wants to be aware and make washington aware of any way in which the united states can act to assist the finns in achieving their fundamental goal of maintaining their independence this he said may mean doing nothing but for a man with a record of vigorous action doing nothing appears unlikely reminiscences of a white man for a long time it seems f the people of this coun try have listened to g what the white man carcsx said a bout the negro you got the feeling that it didnt make very much difference what the negro said about himself and of course no one cared what the negro said about the white now the tables appear to be turned whites and negroes alike are listening to what the negro says about the negro and what he says about the white as well they may not like what the negro saysthey may not even like to listenbut they have to listen and they do its possible that no one is really concerned about the experiences of whites any more about how and why they react to negroes it was this lack of concern that caused me to begin to do some thinking of my own experiences with negroes i began to wonder how typical they were and if i were to talk about them what they would sound like would they seem hypocritical or immature or prejudiced or oldfashioned or what at first i tried to think of significant things you know what vital impressions did i have from my childhood and adolescence but could only remember a few and in retrospect they didnt seem nearly so consequential but i thought id jot them down and mull them over a bit for example i recall that in college i debated whether to ask a negro girl out for a date it was a particular negro girl and she was very pretty but i suddenly decided against it because i realized i had thought of her as a symbol and not as a person a few years later when i did have my first date with a negro she wasnt nearly so pretty and the party was stilted and boring not because of her being there in any sense but just because it was a dull party and i never asked her out again because we just didnt click several years ago i was at a small gathering on a hot stuffy cleveland ohio night except for my date and myself and one white husband of a negro girl the guests were all negro a lawyer and his wife an urban league counselor half a dozen others we were sitting around some on the floor and a few in chairs drinking beer and munching fritos listening to some faraway jazz on the record player suddenly i became aware of a new note in the room a tone of hostility an edge of tensionid never felt this before the conversation had slid from the comfortable agreement on race relations and the unfair treatment by whites to a deep hurt resentment the talk had left its intellectual level and was crying out in anguish even the vocabulary had changed the speech was no longer crisply northern but was slurred and casual i recognized that my skin had been forgotten that the heat and liquor and generations of hurt had conspired to bring to the surface a side of my friends which i had never seen before which produced a strange feeling of confused guilt within me and made me unhappy in knowing that a door was barred to me for me it was a weird experience one which ive never been able to communicate in words to anyone who had not also experienced it i was looking into a deep abyss and could not see the bottom but i still knew that my friends were staring at me from that abyss and i didnt know how to meet their eyes the topsyturvy evening quickly righted itself and we were soon deep in a discussion of the city government but i never forgot the look into that abyss what am trying to say can any of you help me when i was in seventh grade i lived in a moderately wealthy long island community where negroes entered only through the back door and very few people ever thought about an alternative one day it was on the lawn of our house perched on a small rise and looking into a lovely green canyon that i had a furious argument with a temperamental redheaded friend named frank cummings frank insisted that negroes were as intelligent as whites and i insisted that he was wrong suddenly he shouted oh you stupid bastard and he jumped on his bike and shot away i guess i was a stupid bastard because i later learned that he was right but at the time i was confused and upset i cant pretend it was a major factor in my development but it occurred over twenty years ago and i still can recall the incident vividly i wonder if frank ever realized the chain of thinking that his furv instigated in the days when maids were a month every thursday and every other sunday off we had a regular girl my parents decided once to hire a negro girl and i hated her because she pushed me around like none of the white girls had ever done they got a second negro when the first left and this one was worse i swore to them at least as a sixyearold can swear that i hated all negroes and never wanted another negro maid did this early experience scar me from liking negroes forever i dont think sosomehow those girls just didnt belong to the category negro but to the category maid psychologists have frequently pointed out that actual contact with members of a group seems to determine attitudes less than the learning that occurs through the parents alberts father was a gardener for a familv near our home and the entire gang of fifthgraders played football together in a nearby park no one ever questioned alberts right to play with us albert was the fastest most agile and most likely to fumble and he was usually picked second or third out of the eight or ten of us who gathered together one day albert tried a takeout block he missed and rolled over several times then he began to holler and shriek and writhe snaking along the grass on his legs his thighs his buttocks his head everything but his feet he groaned and cried and yelled and the tears were streaming down his face anxiously we crowded around him trying to find out what he had broken his head or his leg finally he stopped his gyrations long enough to look at us through the gushing tears i swallowed my gum a moment later eight white boys and one negro boy were hollering shrieking writhing snaking along the grass other events stick out in my mind the first negro guest i had in my home when was a college freshman and how concerned we all were that he feel at home i hope he did a year later i happened to be hitchhiking near his home in chester pennsylvania late christmas afternoon i called him and was quickly invited for turkey leftovers the home was in the shadows of some immense mills dirty and noisy and as l hitched back to baltimore that night i contemplated some of the inequities of life hes a medical doctor now i recall taking a couple of attractive white dancers to a small cabaret in the negro section of cleveland a squarebuilt negro entertainer little and lithe did a dance to the most raucous music ive ever heard and the dance itself was about as subtle as a striptease well one of the white girls got up and started to dance with him one of those wonderfully spontaneous things where the sex symbolism was so obvious that it was almost too real to be symbolic the place went wild and a few dollar bills floated down to the floor along with a lot of small change we tried again two saturdays later but you just cant recapture those things the first negro girl i made out withthe front seat of my car on a dimlylit street in front of her house each touch carrying the fear that her father or brother would peer out the window it was just like the times i made out with white girls the reverend james hargett used to be in honolulu before coming to los angeles one afternoon when we were chatting in his office he told me that a local negro not one of his parishioners came to see him in great distress he told the reverend that supposedlydemocratic hawaii had many people with racial prejudices and that even a little old japanese lady turned him away violently when he was looking for an apartment to rent the negro a lightishcolored fellow said that he asked to see the rooms whereupon the woman muttered in pidgin no room hereyou cuttype man and she drew her first finger across her throat then slammed the door little did the poor negro know that he was not suffering from antinegro feeling but that he was mistaken for a filipino a group in hawaii which has a reputation for knifefights and sporadic violent killing the irony was pointedthis negro receiving discrimination because someone thought he was not negro karamu theatre in cleveland has mixed casts in its shows and the casting is frequently done without any regard to skin color sometimes this leads to gross miscasting such as the dark negro woman who played a swedishamerican housewife with a thick pseudoscandinavian accent ineffectually disguising her georgia speech but one of my favorite stories was told to me by an actress at karamu a lovely and lightskinned negro girl who played a romantic role opposite a somewhat darkerskinned man one evening after the show a heavily rouged middleaged woman approached her and said pityingly i think you did very well my dear but how can you stand to play a love scene with a negro man my friend retorted casually because im a negro woman when last seen the matron was scurrying to the parking lot we never even had a chance to tell her that the male romantic wasnt negro but a white but my favorite story was told to me by two friends who lived in savannah georgia for a year marianne had hired a cleaning woman one day a week a person she contended was both more intelligent and better educated than most of her neighbors after a couple of weeks marianne and clare came to respect each other and they formed the habit of eating lunch together along with the baby greg and fouryearold sheila after about six weeks of this sheila announced abruptly at the weekly lunch mommy janie told me clare shouldnt eat with us we shouldnt have a nigger at the table mariannes heart disappeared through her shoes as her face colored like the setting sun clare stopped eating suddenly looked at her plate sheila then turned to her mother mommy whats a nigger clare and marianne laughed so hard they almost collapsed but with different parents sheilas learning in prejudice might have begun in earnest i also remember ralph bunche speaking at my college graduation eugenes concern when he took his family to tennessee to teach a white man in fort worth who contended that the bible didnt apply to negroes because they werent human the negro physician who lived in my lilywhite cleveland suburb and his daughters who made the most of their high school the allnegro audience at karamu that laughed at the wrong parts of take a giant step and threw my cues completely off the acute fear of a friend when we doubledated to a cleveland blackandtan spot josh white his cigarette tucked traditionally behind one ear talking and singing with us until four in the ayem whats the purpose in all these disjointed vignettes nothing of significancenothing with the impact of the negro contacts with the whitesnothing of the drama of the sitins im just trying to tell you some of the things that happened to me these may be typical of the middleclass selflabeledliberal collegeeducated white perhaps they irritate you perhaps they amuse you perhaps they have provided you with a few noteworthy insights into me letter from an awol soldier i am a negro a gi i v and awol having lost some seventeen j pounds in weight after suffering a recurrent chronic back ailment coupled with longlasting headaches generally feeling rundown and weak and not being able to get a long enough break to somewhat arrest my condition i then went over the hill awol after two weeks of rest and recuperation in seclusion the headaches are gone and ive regained most of my weight my chronic condition is also somewhat relieved during the idle hours of the past few days ive had a chance to thoroughly analyze myself as an american negro soldier and what i see amazes me i remember sitting in a classroom one morning during basic training after having just heard about the sunday morning bomb killing of four young negro children in birmingham on the radio listening to a white chaplain and an officer literally stand on their heads preaching the justices of democracy how we must defend our freedom if we want to remain free how we should be willing to lay down our lives to protect our country and our way of life i looked at them and marveled i wondered to no end in complete amazement how white democracy can deny a black man nearly all the rights they put him in uniform to defend while at the same time expect him to perform his duties ungrudgingly to a country and a system which seemingly strive to deprive him of his dignity and i wondered silently if all the white people in america thought i should be willing to let them send me to germany with an ml rifle in my hands to stand ready to guard the white germans freedom and liberty with my life or willingly let them send me to vietnam to perhaps die in defense of vietnamese and so that the oriental there could live in freedom when either a vietnamese or a white german could come to the shores of free america grasp from me the freedom which i went to his homeland and died for he would then be more free than i who have lived here through years of slavery segregation lynching bombings discrimination patriotism and bravery through a civil and other wars and still i would be the hopeless rightless citizenless nigger at the bottom of the barrel contented but then i realized that there were few blacks in the class me being a rather dusty darkie im sure the sick disgust was quite evident on my face i wondered what the chaplain thought of my intelligenceif he thought i had any if he really thought id be willing to lay down my life for secondclass citizenship to prevent some enemy from taking it away from me and finally there being only a few blacks in class if he was at all aiming his talk at us we had quite a few of these orientations or brainwashing sessions as i secretly referred to them if a man is free and democracy is all the things they tell him it is and if he has lived it he will know it it would not be a necessity to constantly pound these things into his head at this late date if democracy meant everything to me they told me it does i would know it no one would have to tell me over and over again but then on the other hand maybe these orientations were aimed primarily at us darker ones many times i wonder about my shadowy future in america as a nineyearold child in the south i wondered i wondered when i went downtown with my mother to buy the weeks groceries why it was that we had to drink from a separate fountain one marked colored i wondered why we had to sit in a separate back room when she took me to see the dentist and why she called me back in anger when i went to peep through the divider at all the white people sitting in their section i also wondered why all the white people we passed on the streets looked at us that way and why my mother always dropped her head and would scowl at me for not doing likewise i wondered why we always went through the back door of the towns only drugstore and why i got slapped across the mouth when i asked mother why in front of white people she later explained apologizingly in a choking tone of voice we cant come through the front door son because were not white sensing the fright and hurt in her eyes i pretended to understand she patted me on the head and i held her hand tight as we walked back hometo protect her i thought from all the white people who wished her harm for reasons i did not understand and i wondered why my teacher punished me the next day at school when i refused to place my right hand over my heart lift my left hand and point it toward the flag pledging allegiance to it one nation under god with liberty and justice to all i was at a loss to explain to her why i refused but something within my young mind held me back i was not bitter then for i did not understand then but today i am alert aware observant and i understand yet i harbor no bitterness only sadness grief and a desperate confused longing to know who i really am i am not a communist nor a black muslim though i cannot condemn all of that black sects teachings but i shall never in all the days of my sanity believe that we negroes will be able to push all the white people back into the sea then get on their vessels and sail back to africa from whence the white man stole us and give this land he stole from the indians back to them i am not a member of the communist party so i take it im not a communist however i find it difficult and confusing to distinguish the difference between the definitions of communism and democracy i am told that under a communist system a man is told where he may or where he may not work a man is told where he may or where he may not go a man is told where he may or where he may not live a man is told with whom he may or with whom he may not associate i was bom black am still black was told and am still told that i am living under a democracy which is in complete contrast to communist teachings one would have to be of rather minute intelligence if he is black and is not puzzled by these definitions when applied to his daytoday existing if it seems that my mind is twisted and warped and i am an idiot i extend to you my most humble apologies but i was born in america in the little backwoods southern town of conway south carolina where racial discrimination and segregation kept me in the niggers place where each day meant a tougher fight than the day before to hang on to my pride and selfrespect where many a night my elders would pray to holy god that out of the coming of the black night would not commence a raid on our section of town by a group of white men who called themselves ku klux klan to remind us that their cruelty was our way of life because we were black and they were white that it was not so much for us to fear allmighty god but rather the allmighty white man if i am not yet ready for most of the human rights white people take for granted how then have they arrived at the conclusion that i am ready to serve in their army if i am told that my mere presence would lower the standards of their neighborhoods then it confuses me as to why my mere presence does not also lower the standards of their armed forces the question booming inside my mind now is not what the army will do to me when i get back for im sure ill receive whatever punishment white democracy will deem justified the question most frantically booming away inside my brain now is can i find the strength to serve a society which so boldly denies me most nearly all that which it says im obligated to preserve a champions lost ambition the day of the march on washington for jobs and freedom my thoughts turned back years to a day in when as sports editor of the baltimore american i met a herford for the first time uncle al was the manager of joe gans who died in and to this day still is rated the greatest lightweight champion of all time in boxing i visited with herford in his office and asked him why gans a negro was so deeply revered in his home town at the top of the south where negroes had little or no opportunity i had been in baltimore only a short time but already several boxing men had pointed out to me the open market where gans as a boy had scaled fish and shucked oysters the folly theater where he had his first fight and the goldfield hotel which he had built for negroes with his purse from a memorable round fight with battling nelson which he won on a foul at goldfield nev in these places were spoken of almost as shrines the manager went to his safe and dragged out several large scrabooks filled with clippings and pictures of gans career which we pored over let me tell you a story that will answer your question he said joe was every inch a little gentleman he never flaunted his position and the white people loved him for his humility baltimore went wild when he won the championship with a oneround knockout victory over frank erne at fort erie in telegrams of congratulation deluged us and informed us that a royal welcome awaited our return home with a band salute and street parade and a public dinner to follow as our train neared baltimore joe and i were seated opposite each other in a parlor car joe was wrapped in deep silence his sad expression even more doleful than usual isnt it wonderful joe i asked being champion and all that it means to have all of those folks enthused about you and all of the money you are going to make ill bet your mother is proud of you joe didnt say anything for a long moment then he said wistfully yes mr herford it sure is wonderful but do you know what im thinking what i asked that id give it all upthe money the fuss the championship everythingfor just one thing whats that i asked for a white boys chance in the world paradise lost and missiles fell upon g a v the earth days and nights and they g blotted out all swarm ing creatures and animals and birds of the air and fish of the waters and all mankind but two only mr sippi was left and the woman who was with him at the last bomb shelter on the earth now the woman was darkskinned and she stood in the front of the last bomb shelter on the earth and the man was whiteskinned and he sat in front of the last bomb shelter on the earth and because the skin of the woman was not white the man had enmity to ward her and he would not let her enter into the shelter for which he was the registrar he said unto her go to your own bomb shelter negra this shelter is for whites only but there was no other bomb shelter in all the earth for her to go to there was only one and it was segregated now the last missile on the face of the earth had been launched and even as the man spoke to the woman it was flying toward them from a distant land the men at that launching site had tried to launch another missile but it had exploded on the site blotting out the men and they had been the only living things left in that land and so it came to pass that the darkskinned woman and the whiteskinned man mr sippi the registrar were the only living things left on the face of the earth now there could have been other living things in the part of the earth where mr sippi was the registrar for his bomb shelter was a good bomb shelter and it would have given protection to those creatures who could have been in it for forty days and forty nights while missiles fell upon the earth but the shelter was in a part of the land where men and women were darkskinned and mr sippi would not let them enter into the shelter because it was segregated and so they were all blotted from the face of the earth the darkskinned creatures had had their own bomb shelter one for colored only and many had gone into it before the first missile fell it was separate but not equal and it had caved in on them and blotted them out even before the first missile fell now mr sippi was a smart man and that was why he had given up the name of governor and taken the name of registrar so that he could be close to a bomb shelter and he knew that the missile was flying toward his part of the land and that any living person inside the shelter would not be hurt but still he would not let the darkskinned woman enter into the shelter because of the color of her skin the woman said unto him oh mr sippi suh if you do not let me into the shelter the last woman will perish from this earth and only you will remain and then you will die of old ageit is possible suhand all mankind will be blotted from the earth mr sippi said unto her i will go to jail before i integrate this bomb shelter the woman wailed unto him oh mr sippi suh let us go into the bomb shelter where it is safe and cleave unto each other and multiply and give new fruit to this destroyed land you will be a second adam and i will be a second eve now when mr sippi heard the words of the darkskinned woman his enmity became so great that he forgot about the falling missile and fell upon her with fire flashing in his eyes and the demon in his breast he smote her until she cried out for mercy but he did not give her mercy he blotted her from the earth gods will be done he said and with his words the last missile fell on the last man on earth and blotted him out and the earth became again without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep all gods children almost tom morgan bent his t p lanky body and g switched off the little y portable radio there would be other news but none as vital as that first flash papa what does it mean morgan looked down at his twelveyearold son it means he said carefully that in the fall youll be able to go to the white boys school his lean hard right arm dropped protectively around the boys thin shoulders joey twisted his neck to look up at the satinyblack face so like his ownthe proud jaw the generouslymoulded mouth the liquid black eyes were tranquil yet alive with intelligence and deep thought had left its tracings on the high forehead joey searched the face but could find nothing to justify his disturbed feeling he shifted his sneakered feet uneasily but the nameless fear kept growing to hide it from his father joey dropped his face and pulled away from his fathers arm he crossed the bare floor of the small living room away from his father away from the radio away from the lumpy slipcovered sofa where his mother sat nervously rolling and unrolling a corner of her apron joey sat down in the old wicker rocker and set it in motion the room was divided by two panels of dusk creeping through the unshaded windows facing the fields and was quiet except for the rhythmical creaking of the rocker then joey spoke above it i dont want to go to the white boys school his fathers deep voice was studiedly impartial its more uptodateyou could learn more i dont care joey rocked forcibly youd be a fullfledged doctor in no time the rocking stopped four years ago joey had gashed his hand chopping wood a dignified man with a black bag had come to the house immediately the man had stopped the pain with a big needle then sewed the cut with small measured stitches as dainty as his mothers prizewinning embroidery then and there joey made up his mind to be a doctor his mothers soft voice cut through with hands still fingering her apron and cocoavelvet cheeks flushed with anxiety she said tom the new lawit doesnt say a boy has to go to the school if he doesnt want to does it tom sighed he could understand even though he didnt entirely share ellas distrust of whites he sank down on the soft beside her gently his powerful black hands reached over stilled the quivering small brown ones lifting them both into one palm and covering them with the other ella he said joey isnt obliged to attend that schoolnot according to the state law but this country has a more powerful law the rocker creaked as joey strained forward to hear the words were addressed to his mother but directed to him the declaration of independence continued tom rules that all men are created free and equal words words words exploded ella snatching her hands away from toms they dont mean a thing ella tom said slowly remember the day i got my promotion in the air force those words had meaning then didnt they ella stared sullenly didnt they persisted tom that was different she mumbled not so different her husband pointed out then i took a step forward now joey can help all our people take a step forward think what this will mean to our little alice when shes ready for school the room was gloomy morgan snapped on the table lamp at his elbow and looked across at his son you see that dont you joey youd be helping alice and others like her the boy didnt answer isnt that what a doctors supposed to do prodded tom help people joey nodded reluctantly sat silently for a minute then flashed a smile of singular maturity at his father i will change schools he said quietly the summer slipped away and with it much of joeys courage his mother had a pinched look and she no longer laughed as she had before every night long after joeys nine oclock bedtime he could hear her shrill tones mixed with the low angry ones of his father with each passing day joey got more mixed up one minute he dreaded the opening day of school the next he could hardly wait for it finally it was at hand an unusual september morning for the south frostbitten and windy it was hardly dawn when his father called him so we can have a little talk before you leave he explained joey didnt mind he hadnt been asleep the water in the scarred tub was icy but joey bathed thoroughly then dressed with great care he had to be equal at least from the skin out the kitchen was cozy and warm and joeys favorite breakfast was on the rickety table but he couldnt eat much and his mother ate nothing at all after breakfast with the wind whipping at the tiny window they got down on their knees ella morgan now oddly calm in a low sweet voice talked to the lord about her boy then tom said a few words they prayed a long time when they got to their feet joey saw that it was nearly time for the school bus he grabbed his cap and the presents from his parentsa shiny lunch box from his father a bright red pencil box from his mother he kissed them and started out the door his fathers husky voice called after him dont forget son were all gods children joey got on the school bus he was the only colored boy but the driver gave him a smile and a pleasant hello there joey sat down on the only empty seat next to one of the boys there was a snort of disgust as the boy untangled his crossed legs and lurched across joey in frantic haste to push out into the aisle from then on the fivemileride was a nightmare whispers scornful laughter and eyes that glared with hate at last the bus pulled up in front of the school through the window joey saw lines of people grownups girls boys some of them carrying signs his legs stiffened so that he could hardly get down the bus steps as he stalked through the crowd they pushed hooted and waved signs in his face joeys blurring eyes couldnt make out the words for some reason all he could think of was his fathers line were all gods children joey wondered back in the little house ella morgan watched the clock when it was past the hour for the school bus she consulted her husband hes probably riding home with somebody we know tom suggested or maybe he decided to walk you know how he loves to walk the afternoon deepened at dusk tom rose abruptly ill go and meet him as his loping stride carried him out of sight ella slipped to her knees to pray she couldnt leaping to her feet she flew out the door and down the road she had been running a long time when a station wagon pulled up at the wheel was josh brannon the white man from the big house on the hill he peered out curiously anything wrong mrs morgan hysterically ella gasped out the words with great kindness josh helped the trembling figure into the station wagon now he instructed cheerfully you catch your breath little lady well find that boy of yours they raced along the dark road suddenly ella shrieked the car screeched to a stop at the side of the road on his knees was tom morgan in front w of him was a small still form josh brannon had only to glance at tom morgan to know the man was in shock he was staring blankly at his boy ella screamed piteously as she rushed at her child brannon pulled her away and felt for a pulse it was faint but joey was alive tenderly he gathered up the little figure and called sternly to ella and tom this boys got to get to a hospitalhurry ella pulled her dazed husband into the station wagon as the doctors carried joey into the emergency room brannon put his arm around ella and led her to a bench joey will be fine he said but joey wasnt fine joey morgan was dead the doctor told them death had come from a welldirected rock thrown with such force it had crashed halfway through the skull ella was stunned dead she kept repeating you mean joeys gone and wont be back you mean hes not here that hes in heaven brannon fought back tears yes he said im sure hes in heaven but brannon was wrong joey was not in heaven not quite at that moment he stood before the pearly gates his name had just been given to the recording angel who went to tell st peter its joey morgan reported the recording angel age twelve st peter looked down the pages of the golden book you must be mistaken he said it couldnt be joey morgan the recording angel insisted i just talked with the boy cording to the book a doctor joey he spelled his name for me morgan was to be welcomed here st peter looked bewildered at the age of one year after he thats very strange he said ac discovered the cure for cancer by mike thelwell mitch came out of the cool dimness of the bar and started down the block to the bus stop the city heat which seemed sticky and grimy was reflected off the pavements scarcely tempered by a slight breeze which was itself hot and dusty beer always relaxed him and he walked loosely jauntily with an athletes grace full of confidence in his own youth and power he came up to the bus stop with a casual arrogance hardly noticing the people loosely grouped around he thought of the letter in his pocket the committee has voted to make available to you a year in europegoddamn the spook halfback isnt doing so bad all you had to do was to learn to manoeuvre in their world speak their language his hand went automatically to the back pocket of his jeans for the book which he had found as necessary a part of the use of the transit system as the token the book was by some white psychologist who had probed into the psyche of an old tribal chief in south africa and seemed to have been shocked to death at the levels of conscious disguised and subliminal hate that his probings had disclosed and him a psychologist too mitch thought sourly the white mans innocence syndrome again such incredibly childish and outrageous naivete serves him right what in hell else did he expect he found the book a trifle obvious unless of course you were ofay in which case you could be discomfited by the africans image of yourself and your world mitch knew that he wasnt really reading the book that while his eyes leaped over the words his mind was detached he became aware that he was in fact brandishing the book it made a symbol because of the angry bold words of the title and the corrugated black face at once barbaric and pathetic which adorned the jacket the picture of the chief with his collapsed untidy old mouth which even bitterness couldnt firm up and his ancient and murderous eyes was startling strange how fidgety people could become when confronted with anything real like hate and death or any symbol of these things its like white americans when confronted with anything negro that wont fit the accepted justifications and myths maybe it is just because they have been too insulated too wellfed have been made to feel too fraudulently secure entombed and comforted in the pink and white pastel blandness of their white society for too long that a thing like a snarling black face can disturb them mitch thought and closed the book the knowledge that he himself was compensating projecting being smug feeling superior was amusing hell he had every right to his own prejudices and resentments like everyone else he let his glance deliberately and overtly challenging rove over the faces of the people around him at the bus stop the usual city groupthe same gray armoredup faces and the same shabby perpetually soiled look that the nonaffluent members of the affluent society seemed to wear like a membership badge in some secret organization that existed for the perverse pleasure of giving the lie to the societys assumptions mitch noticed with some disappointment that nobody appeared affected by his defiant glanceand such arrogance in the gesture too like a flamenco dancer or a matador and no one noticed so remote and tired they seemed so damned remote and tired each one turned in on himself completely caught up in the closed backreaches of his own concern the community of the city hah how mechanical somehow listless and enervated they were mitch found himself changing position quickly and impatiently as though by doing so he could assure himself that he was as yet undefeated and vital and that there was a force an energy in him that would not let him be still he recognized his posturing for what it was and grinned sardonically at himself you shouldnt have to prove it baby you dont have to prove a thing whats it bouf said in the blacks they arent really white but shades of pink and yellow and grey he began to amuse himself by staring openly at his companions to see how accurate that pronouncement was that little man christ hes bright yellow probably takes the sun at coney island with a fat shapeless wife and a horde of kids on sundays and two little boys discussing da movies in adenoidal brooklynese they were colorless their faces marked by an urban pallor a girl in her early teens standing slightly knockkneed her braced teeth chomping on a wad of gum her hair in curlers stood gazing vacantly at nothing she was whitish and pink in streaks and patches mitch noted and in a few years she will probably be beautiful or at least chic from nine to five anyway until she gets married then back to baggy shorts and daytime curlers then he saw the woman she was tall and wellfleshed with a strong wellformed face mitch looked into her frank gray eyes and looked away surprised she had actually seen him actually looked at him this sudden and totally unexpected contact surprised him he retained the image of rounded womanly arms a simple sleeveless cotton dress belted at the waist like an ancient greek tunic and light sunstreaked blond hair preparing himself he allowed his eyes to move methodically across the group until he was looking directly at her the sunlight shone off her hair and dress and she appeared strangely clean her face untouched by makeup she returned his gaze from eyes that upset him by their unexpected serenity he realized grudgingly that she was not to be easily reduced to selfconsciousness and he returned to looking at his book she is he thought a wholesome looking woman but it isnt the neuter kind of sterile wholesomeness that madison avenue uses to sell its beer and cigarettes no its something more personal a fullysexed carnal cleanness that is altogether outofplace among such soiled looking city people he tried to engross himself in his book but he could not forget the alert liveliness of the womans eyes oh well i guess some of us manage to retain some humanity he thought yet for some reason the womans tranquility jarred him she defied the neat compartments into which it was his habit and his defense to fit and therefore dispose of all white people hell they were either smug deluded and completely out of touch with their own existence or hyperanxious and neurotic this woman clearly did not fit into such categories his reflections were broken by a new sound introducing itself into the steady drone of the street noises a little negro man very drunk who might have been years oldthe signs of his drinking showed too plainly in the destroyed facewas babbling at the woman youre a nish girl ah like you dont you like me have a drink now he was leaning on a signpost precariously close to the woman offering her his flat bottle half full of a vellow wine mr here baby have a drink he insisted dribbling saliva youre a nish girl lets have a drink uh a tense silence held the crowd for a minute nobody seemed to want to look at the drunk except for two little boys who were grinning two middleaged women were now a part of the crowd mitch hadnt seen them join the group but somehow they had become conspicuous backs stiff stringy necks bristling with a suppressed yet communicated outrage they stared up the street with their lips moving silently yeah mitch thought disgraceful disgraceful what is the world coming to i agree with you you old hags the drunks voice was growing louder its initial wheedling intimacy beginning to harden into anger mitchs first impulse was to laugh the woman was so much taller appeared so much stronger than the wasted little drunk that his approving almost condescending youre a nish girl was funny but it wasnt really funny oh well maybe she is his girl mitch thought snickering at the absurdity of the idea and if she isnt its like the man said tis a consummation devoutly to be wished it wasnt working the mental wisecracks did not relieve the embarrassment he felt growing and his anger at himself for feeling vulnerable and compromised by the actions of some drunken negro he didnt know fed his discomfort the woman was behaving rather well he observed with a twinge of resentment she had pulled herself erect stepped away from the drunks breath but she had not lost her composure she caught mitchs glance and her eyebrows arched in a tolerant whatcanido expression which whatever it was supposed to do only succeeded in crystallizing mitchs anger he jerked his eyes away furiously dont look at me bitch im not involved he wanted to say the other people at the bus stop were stubbornly maintaining their detachment nothing was their business yeah but what are they thinking the slobs heres food for all the prejudices you want and need so badly to cling to mitch thought something to go home and tell your friends about and cluck over and to remember on the day i come into the neighborhood the drunken monotone continued ranging in a pathetic burlesque between courtship and rape at once threatening and cajoling youre a nish girl dont you like me the drunks mind seemed finally to register the snickers of the two boys a humiliating testimony to his own presumptuousness and ineffectuality his voice grew louder his stance mockmenacing and he tried to introduce a note of toughness into his voice he appeared to want to walk away but now that the incident had become public he seemed unable to do this or to accept the rejection that only his drunkenness could have disguised as less than inevitable he tried to threaten not gonna ask you again gawddam have a drink he waved his bottle belligerently ish good stuff i tol you we kin have fun dont you like me stop it you stupid sonofabitch mitch thought stop it you are giving them excuses still he felt an unreasonable compassion for the little man if only the bitch seemed threatened how goddamn composed she is he found himself wishing that it was night that the area was secluded that the drunk was niggerbig razorscarred and evillooking what would happen to her goddamned miss ann composure then he thought and yet she was reacting with unusual patience leave her alone man dont do this to yourself to her hit her rape her anything but stop that goddamned whining stop begging not like that man not like that and you white woman be disgusted or uncomfortable or best of all afraid but not so damned unreachable at least recognize his existence some other way call a cop even another headwhipping in the basement of some precinct wouldnt scar the poor drunk as deeply as this public evidence of his own futility then hed be a threat or even a pestsomething to be stamped on but he would have broken in he would be something the drunk was trying to be mean now his voice grew louder and he caught the woman by the arm desperately trying to be tough to evoke some reaction but in his bleary eyes were tears maybe from the dust and glare maybe from shame at the absurdity of his role watching him mitch knew sickly that this was no new role for the little man the woman gently disengaged her arm from the drunks grip and walked to the other side of the bus stop nearer to mitch she managed as she did this to give the impression that she was acting more for the drunks protection than for herself the drunk stood gaping at his empty hand then removing the cap from the bottle took a long drink letting the wine run down his stringy neck he stood in the middle of the sidewalk shaking his head and noisily clearing his throat there was a look of foolish drunken bewilderment on his face as he stood there blinking and now mitch saw that his late victim was looking at him with concern disgust he thought angrily or anger thats what you are supposed to feel not pity its way too late for your pity way too late for that oh hell if he starts again i should stop him she doesnt deserve to be molested and embarrassed still he knew and was confused by the knowledge that had the drunk struck her hed have been outraged he would have stopped him and been truly sorry and maybe even felt a little guilty but he would not have been sickened in quite the same way oh goddamn this messedup schizophrenic rubbleheap of a society this stupid screwedup accumulation of inherited guilt and hate and endless retribution for that poor conflicted ineffectual drunk incapable of being lover or defiler destroyed denied full growth and in his warpedness not even malignant enough to evoke disgust what is left him and the woman why did she have to be embarrassed and me caught in the middle between them mitch looked at the drunk a shabby forlorn figure now as he stood outlined in the glare ten yards away isolated when the drunk passed his hand over his face his eyes cleared for a moment and mitch felt the physical presence of vulnerability and sadness that somehow shone from his eyes in a sudden moment of clarity it passed and he was coming over to the group again mumbling and slobbering his face set in lines of drunken stubbornness the sunyellowed little man saw him coming and a look of hesitance flickered across his face then apparently reaching a decision he started toward the drunken negro oh a defender of white womanhood too mitch muttered now where does this little schmuck think hes goingto set things in their proper perspective aloud he said easy pal just stay where you are ok and he caught the wouldbe knight reassuringly by the arm his grip as strong as he could make it and he noticed the man wince as he checked his movement mitch wasnt sure why he stopped the man except that it was action a way of declaring himself but he felt certain that the man was grateful at being spared any involvement above all mitch did not want the drunk to swallow another defeat and at the hands of such a seedylooking little white man he stepped deliberately in front of the blond woman then his back almost touching her making it impossible for the drunk to reach her he folded his arms and pretended to read scush me man gotta see someone mitch pretended not to hear the drunks voice grew angry as he became aware of what mitch was doing ah said outta ma way man whats the matter anyway oh oh im sorry sir excuse me mitch did not move whaddya tryin to do man who do you think you are anyway the drunk sounded really indignant now suspecting that mitchs action was telling him that he was making a fool of himself triggered the first anger that mitch had noticed in him mitch realized that he was glad to see this change it was a hell of a lot better than the shamed halfservility halfanger of a few moments before he felt a fierce compassion for the little man yet he knew that he would hit him if it became necessary now whos defending white womanhood he thought bitterly and something close to hatred rose in him for this woman who had done nothing but be white and desirable man dont do it please dont do it i dont want to have to mitchs voice was low insistent almost a whisper for some reason he did not want the woman standing just behind him to hear it was very important that she did not dont do what what are you talking about the drunk demanded with drunken truculence outta mah way jes who the fugg do ya think ya are he was obviously finding in mitch a more legitimate object for his wrath mitch wanted to throw his arm across the thin shoulders to lead him away and to say be cool man im with you dont do this to yourself dont do it to me like we stand together man lets forget it instead he stood in front of the little drunk feet spread arms folded feeling his face harden and his eyes growing hostile the bus was stopping behind him he heard the doors open and people entering the drunk looked past him and something much like relief reflected in his eyes to be immediately replaced with blustering anger he started to speak and mitch cut him off mister he said im not sure what i did to you but im sorry i really am he tried to make his voice and manner convey diffidence if i can only give this cat back something he thought the drunk contemplated the sudden capitulation blankly for a few seconds scarcely able to hide his surprise and confusion mitch wondered how long it had been since anyone had thought enough of the derelict to be scared of him youre lucky the drunk growled jus never try to be so lucky again youre one real lucky young punk messing wid me hah he punctuated the last phrase with a jabbing finger thanks thanks sir mitch said as he stepped into the bus through the window he saw the drunk point a final warning finger in his direction before turning away poor screwedup little guy probably feels real tough now mitch found a seat and immediately riveted his eyes to the book he couldnt shake the engulfing sense of personal loss and of being somehow diminished himself excuse me her voice was clear but hesitant i just wanted to thank you for she broke off when mitch shook her hand from his wrist and levelled into her eyes a steady hostile stare i hope you dont think i did you any service miss their eyes locked for a short time and mitch wondered does this broad think im going to apologize for the drunk does she think i did it for her cant she understand that it might have been for the drunk or for me or even for the goddamned race but not for her he felt like the betrayer of some vaguely understood bond his mind groped frantically for the word the gesture some way to establish clearly to her and himself that he had acted only out of a desire to save something of the drunks pride to keep him from another encounter with the white mans jail but he could only glare into her earnest gray eyes under the seething inarticulate fury of the glare she flushed slightly and lowered her eyes somewhat appeased mitch continued the pretense of reading scowling down at the book mister i think you might not have understood and what might i not have understood miss he stared at her again that and her voice faltered again before his mute hostility that ii think i understand i dont blame him oho she understands he thought what the hell does she understand a generous compassionate tolerant white woman well shes either too late or too early who in hell needs her compassion or understanding hope she chokes on it dont you think you should blame him miss no man has the right drunk or otherwise to molest a woman or is his case special the woman looked astonished no no she said i just mean that well that it wasnt his fault it wasnt mine either oh lady how could anything be your fault i dont know what you are talking about mitch rudely changed his seat asking himself as he got up now what the hell are you mad about now james baldwin the writer i am the man i suffered i was there runs the quotation from whitman that introduces the reader to james baldwins second novel giovannis room then what did he bring back and if suffering can be said to have a depth how deeply did he suffer the answers are to be found in his books and more recently in his meteoric rise as a public figure i know these questions in an article on a writer printed in a writers journal could be answered very simply if somewhat evasively by merely listing baldwins accomplishments in the field mentioning a few anecdotes about his personal life and quoting a handful of his multitudinously pithy sentences this would be a relatively harmless albeit academic approach and the result would be appallingly innocuous at best a kind of childs garden of james baldwin at worst the deadly list of a pallid bibliographer or a landscape architect i choose a more personal track in the hope that with luck i might accidentally succeed in giving the reader a little of the feeling of the man i suppose this is to venture into a nomans land to move out precariously beyond the wire and to hope however naively that whatever fire i may draw will be badly aimed my point of departure is some years back in denver before i met james baldwin although i knew and greatly admired his work which at that time consisted of two novels go tell it on the mountain and giovanni s room and two collections of essays notes of a native son and nobody knows my name his powerful third novel another country was nowhere in sight except for a few oddments scattered throughout the quarterlies and the vitriolic yet loving indictment of america the fire next time hinted at in small asides in most of his essays was not as yet a glint in anybodys eye that time in denver at which i have chosen to begin i was sitting in a grubby bar drinking too much beer and smoking too many cigarettes the piano player who sometimes blew a sweet coronet and dug around in the bass of the piano accompanying himself with his left hand had just launched into a blues of his own composition his name was kenny whitson he wore an auburn goatee short cropped hair and his eyes were very bright and intelligent he sang a little off key in a flat nasal voice you got to lissen to yousef ever time you talk if it aint the truth brother then turn you back and walk i was struck by these blues and writing about baldwin now with three novels and three collections of essays to his credit a collection of short stories to be published this fall and also his first play it seems to me that if these blues were meant for any living writer they were meant for him he does listen to himself painfully im sure and carefully sifts out as much truth as he can get hold of and nobody not even the very saintly gets a full dose he listens sounding himself and his rage and pain his courageous hope and loving concern all the seasons of his emotions are lucidly contained in his straightforward and gracious and aristocratic prose a prose without peer in contemporary english and graphically embodied in nearly every national magazine from mademoiselle to life to the cover of time we have a visual record of the man and his passion during his grueling whistlestop stumping for the congress on racial equality core baldwin has had the audacious tenacity to explore and attack two of our most sacrosanct totems sex and color and if he has like any writer approached his subjects with a revolutionary attitude still he has written about them with all the tenderness integrity love and courage befitting his care for america his concern for its destiny and future there is no easy way for americans to think about the subjects of color and sex because americans are used to thinking about both topics only as americans the only way we can think and we are an odd race whether the opiate is religion or sex gin or beer lsd or hallucinatory mushrooms we always find an excusecalling it a reasonan alley in which to hide or a diaper with which we gird our barely controlled loins we wear armor when we should go naked when silence is all that is required work because leisure causes anguish and fall asleep when labor is demanded all this is not meant to suggest that americans are somehow more stupid or less enlightened than say the french the swedish or the japanese rather as baldwin has pointed out innumerable times i want to suggest that no matter what your particular country may be there is always the special and unique problem of having to reevaluate the institutions of your land in terms of yourself not in the terms laid down by society as constituting your self social institutions and rules are i suppose always normative but when they become sacred and totemic they are totalitarian and dictatorial and what makes the initial venture in the examined life another country entirely so difficult and dangerous and often fruitless and destructive is that when one comes to criticize the totems of say sex and color one is immediately confronted with a seemingly insoluble dilemma you discover you are thinking in precisely those terms which the cause of your enquiry has already rejected as inadequate but this is if i understand him the journey baldwin has invited each of us to undertake the unexamined life is not worth living i conceive of my own life as a journey towards something i do not understand which in going toward makes me better he wrote in nobody knows my name i conceive of god in fact as a means of liberation and not a means of control and in the fire next time he returns to the concept of god grown totemic in the intervening years if the concept of god has any validity and any use it can only make us larger freer and more loving if god cannot do this then it is time we got rid of him james baldwin is a thin short man he is in his late thirties his face is a long oval his lips thick and broad and his two front teeth are divided by a gap his mouth is as conrad wrote of kurtzs voracious and his eyes are lively protruding from his head as if squeezed out by their thick lids it is his voice that surprises you at first then it is his concentration and the passion with which he delivers his sentences he speaks softly as if off the top of his soft palatte his rs come out as ahs his os with an aish sound and his face is softly composed almost maleable in its expressions but hard and determined from listening to himself he speaks easily and clearly and he is always willing to say that he hasnt an easy answer to that one or that his interlocutor is confused the terms are wrong we cant talk clearly about that yet and his face may break into a broad warm smile or he may laugh with a visceral ebullience peculiarly his own he is a beautiful man and a very brave one and a writer we should all be proud of especially when he presses our faces into slops of our own making in one of his finest essays a love letter to norman mailer called the black boy looks at the white boy baldwin makes a distinction marking out the difference between mailer and himself that will later appear as one of the fundamental axioms of the fire next time there is a difference though between norman and myself in that i think he still imagines he has something to save whereas i have never had anything to lose or perhaps i ought to put it another way the things that most white people imagine that they can salvage from the storm of life is really in sum their innocence it was this commodity precisely that i had to get rid of at once literally on pain of death i am afraid that most of the white people i have ever known have impressed me as being in the grip of a weird nostalgia dreaming of a vanished state of security and order against which dream unfailingly and unconsciously they have tested and very often lost their lives this essay caused an apparently irremedial rift between mailer and baldwin time and again mailer has snipped at baldwin in print baldwin has never replied the split came over baldwins criticism of mailers white negro the maileresque portrait of the american hipster and existentialist somewhere in the rebel albert camus wrote that every act of rebellion expresses a desire for order and a nostalgia for innocence and mailer and baldwin mutually enjoy the rebellious existential stance both are concerned with the same issues but their divergence is so radical and drastic that it often seems they inhabit altogether different worlds where baldwin is religious in some fundamental rockbottom sense mailer is romantic where mailer has gone into the penumbra of experience where he has traveled to the very edge and lingered too long and been wounded perhaps fatally baldwin has moved from the outskirts of the city into its epicenter and made his uncomfortable residence in the groundzero of the american heart consider the difference in the ubiquitous figure of the white negro mailer has come to terms with atrocity by romanticising it out of focus his hipster is white with a black soulwhich is junky the essence of hip his hipster lives we are told continually with the terms of death his benighted unconscious stamped with a limp metaphysical version of the extermination camp and the possibility of thermonuclear destruction that fire next time and his hipster is concerned with transcending the maddening mechanism of time of kicking it entirely and entering what cummings called the one hell of a universe next door the only example of such transcendence mailer has produced is sexual orgasm in short whether mailers effort is a brave one or a useless one his nipsterthe salvation of this cancerous worldis sadistic anally erouc an orgyhunter murderous and benumbed to such an extreme point that his only source of real pleasure lies in committing sexual atrocities but wnen atrocity becomes thus palatable and sweet however romanticised and apologised for one has produced the monstrosity of an intellectual buchenwald where true to their penultimate calling mailers hipsters are the guards at the outermost periphery of experience giggling in their towers and clutching their machine guns like a young lover his new bride necrophilia is not a way to come to terms with death and a romantic abstraction of the ghoul or necrophile is neither very hip nor very existential the pity of all this is that a fairly competent talent is wasting itself by merely reveling in the signs of a creeping putrefaction he diagnoses all around himself the american bedroom has become a private concentration camp baldwin said talking quietly on the themes of color and sex and sexuality sexual morality and sexual responsibility is one of the biggest themes an american writer can undertake its part of his responsibility as a writer an obligation to himself i suppose i put it in this way because america at least in its conversation comes on as so sexually enlightened and sophisticated well it simply isnt true baby in giovannis room a novel ostensibly concerned with a doomed homosexual relationship baldwin explores the notions of responsibility and morality in the beginning of the novel david meditates on his life with giovanni and on giovannis imminent death on the guillotine people cant unhappily invent their mooring post their lovers and their friends any more than they can invent their parents life gives these and also takes them away and the great difficulty is to say yes to life this and a few other sections from giovannis room have been recorded recently on calliope records on the back of this record there is a short illuminating quotation from the new york times in which baldwin states his attitude toward writing i think i really helplessly model myself on jazz musicians and try to write the way they sound i am not an intellectual not in the dreary sense that word is used today and do not want to be i am aiming at what henry james called perception at the pitch of passion in giovannis room and his third novel another country baldwin comes close to realizing this desired perception another country explores the problems created by color and sex in the lives of eight new yorkers it is written in a straight thirdperson narrative style and its hero and protagonist is a woman ida scott she is the only character in the book that baldwin simply presents to the reader unlike the other characters baldwin never analyzes ida revealing her motives and weaknesses to the reader encapsulated in several paragraphs ida reveals herself and she moves through new york like a fallen angel waiting for its wing to heal she has no delusions she is aware of her need for love and she is equally aware of the limitations imposed on her solely because of the color of her skin even this knowledge does not cause her to live or love resignedly she is to use an archaic phrase courageous and unlike the doomed giovanni or david ida also wounded and betrayed is still able to say yes to life without having to lick her wounds she has not made a peace she lives in a world of wartorn emotions and has come to terms with her world perhaps because she is such a stride forward for baldwin idas strength is in fact so great that she has forced life to come to terms with herself the virtues represented by ida scott become moral and philosophical principles in baldwins latest and most controversial book the fire next time fire is part autobiography part doomsday prophecy and part exhortation the spirit of rebellion camus writes in the rebel can only exist where a theoretical equality conceals great factual inequalities and the rebels most persistent gnawing question is is it possible to find a rule of conduct outside the realm of religion and its absolute value this is one of the basic questions posed in fire and in terms of this searching query the factual inequalities of the racial situation are brutally unmasked god gave noah the rainbow sign no more water the fire next time fire is a tough grim book its message is love and what gives the book its body and sinew is baldwins personal experience as an american negro incarcerated in harlem a ghetto in which he was set down to perish simply because his skin was black the details and symbols of his life constructed and preestablished for him long before his birth this is the more grisly aspect of a functioning totem and harlem in baldwins eyes is a kind of unguarded extermination camp in which the victims undo themselves because they have allowed themselves to believe what the man whites has said about them it is one thing and not an easy one by any means to be an american it is entirely something else to be both american and black yes it does mean something something unspeakableto be born in a white country an angloteutonic antisexual country black once we have learned to love each other then according to baldwin we shall no longer require the negro as a symbol and a scapegoat an essential ingredient in filthy jokes and a pornographically murky symbol of sexual prowess but if we refuse if we continue to hold the negro in abeyance the result might possibly be disastrous if one is permitted to treat any group of people with special disfavor because of their race or the color of their skin there is no limit to what one will force them to endure and since the entire race has been mysteriously indicted no reason not to attempt to destroy it root and branch this is precisely what the nazis attempted their only originality lay in the means they used it is scarcely worthwhile to attempt remembering how many times the sun has looked down on the slaughter of innocents i am very much concerned that american negroes achieve their freedom here in the united states but i am also concerned for their dignity for the health of their souls and must oppose any attempt that negroes may make to do to others what has been done to them whosoever debases others is debasing himself that is not a mystical statement but a most realistic one which is proved by the eyes of any alabama sheriffand i would not like to see the negroes ever arrive at so wretched a condition italics baldwins throughout this piece i have often compared baldwin to camus this comparison i believe is apt and precise baldwin like camus before him is staking his life on life itself and without the help or hindrance of religion he is looking for human nobility and grandeur in a world that is possibly heading toward selfdestruction nobility graciousness courage candor and bravery are pretty unhip concepts sin love and guilt have been laid to rest on the analytical couch and the spirit of rebellion has been totemised into managerial conformity but in the strong pen and compassionate heart of a small wiry relatively ugly man called james baldwin a kidnapped pagan we have a voice that embodies the dilemmas of our epoch in the same way that camus represented ourselves to us perhaps if the bones roll right in the future america will be very proud having produced a black replica of camus at this point i suppose all one can do is offer baldwin a few prayers the groundzero of the heart is far more dangerous a place to sit than the nomans land of the mind by robert baram after almost a century of blissful indifference only rarely jolted by an unavoidable headline the civil_rights story has made the front pages the american press failed to sense the big story until the sharp barbs of the news were so painful and so

ross barnett as the prototype politician the inexcusable fact is that the american press one can generalize in this instance waited stoically and in situ for the civil_rights story to come to it rather than going out aggressively and courageously to meet it it was so easy to locate irrespective of ones point of publishing even in our shiny makebelieve world of sports it was not the writers with their unique space and language prerogatives who brought jackie robinson and his brilliant afroamerican counterparts to the national pastime this small but significant act was written and produced by a quietvoiced retirementyears figure named branch rickey who some eight decades after appomattox smashed the long tolerated colorline in baseball true one could point to the finelypenned stories of the magnificent jesse owens and his championship efforts in the olympic games in then nazi germany but even then before and after the same sports writers were mentioning the negro leagues and some of their nonpareils more as gestures of curiosity than of shame or perish the thought to crusade they couldnt hide owens and his super achievements in the face of the socalled super race but it was easy to write off the other outstanding athletes of his race the willie mays hank aarons larry dobys and ernie banks of that era merely could look longingly at the minor and major leagues frustrated and ignored even in new england the press was supine new england where the underground railroad had flourished where william lloyd garrison and his liberator had championed the cause of slaverys abolition where humanitarian row stood mutely but majestically on brattle street and its environs the reverse freedom riders and some effective public protests finally have stirred editors to awakening and to action in june of this year the very able and respected associated press news analyst james marlow commented in one of his columns the great flurry now by the government churchmen mayors businessmen and others to speed up desegregation raises an embarrassing question for white people north and south why didnt it happen sooner the government and some churchmen mayors businessmen and othershad been moving but at a snails pace to end racial discrimination but negroes had to force on them the realization they hadnt done enough fast enough it is not irrelevant that marlow failed to include his own profession in his righteous denunciation even thoughtful and concerned journalists of marlows high character tend to view the responsibility of the press from the inside looking out only occasionally do its members take that exceedingly difficult look from the outside looking in and then they do so privately some correctly note that the american newspaper world has been no more the procrastinator in its belated recognition of the civil_rights issue than the other three professional estates this is the weakest and most cowardly rationalization of all the press is not a vast complex of community house organs designed to attack critical issues only when the management or the establishment feels that such action is inescapable a responsible press is obligated to move unhesitatingly into the arenas of controversy and calamity irrespective of whose oxen are gored surely one of the big stories within the civil_rights story itself was the escapism of members of the legal profession the teaching profession the religious and those of industry and government all of whom refused to use their special training and influence to tear the cancer of bigotry and inequality from the breast of the nation but where was the trenchant pen of the editor the cutting unrelenting coverage of the reporter the challenging paragraphs of the columnists the driving inspiration of publishers reporting of the civil_rights dilemma has been and still remains to a great degree highly sectionalized in style and in content hodding carter hazel brannon smith and recent pulitzer prize winner ira harkey jr join with georgias ralph mcgill and a handful of others as beacons in a sea of southern despair the three mississippi editorpublishers are not necessarily what one would term integrationists but they have at least had the courage to report the civil_rights story without a builtin hominy grits chittlins and chess pie bias they have shown unwillingness to move with the mob in the middle of red neck country in the face of economic sanctions very heartless and effective ones too the vilest of insults and the loss of lifetime friends their respect for the realities of the news in concert with mcgill little rocks harry ashmore and a select few have shown that the pages of the press may indeed be used to report fully and with fairness even in the terrifying face of hatred and fanaticism many southern editors and publishers are quick to point to the insipid or complete lack of birth control news reporting in northern newspapers this comparison is used as a rationalization for their own inadequate and myopic coverage of civil_rights although they are unquestionably correct about the spinelessness of most northern newspapers when the subject of birth control is whispered the analogy is as worthless as a chocolatecovered syllogism two ugly editorial wrongs make nothing right in life or in journalism more guilty than most have been our fabled columniststhey of the crystal ball set the rearvision mirrors the magical sources and the supernatural ouija boards where were lippman reston lewis jr lawrence the alsops and so many of them during the recent generations even these the socalled elite you classify them according to your own preferences touched the civil_rights story rarely followed it through not at all missed entirely in many cases in unwitting concert with the more bourgeois members of their journalism dailectic there is a tragic touch of stubbornness within the heart of the story of the press failure one finds that a great many members of the press are as unwilling to admit their belated awakening as the segregationists are unwilling to concede that a society that terms itself democratic cannot tolerate a slave system de facto or de jure one highly regarded magazine editor said to me i think that the american public was slower than the press on this one and that the press has pushed as hard as it could in view of audience interest which is always an inhibiting factor thus the old and battered canards are again put to useaudience interest and the slow american public slower than the press when editors talk that kind of drivel in it is not difficult to understand why this number one american story withered so long on the communications vine our newsmen cannot claim sudden awakening almost a quarterofacentury ago there were some highly regarded american reporters who recognized that the pressure cooker of civil_rights history in our nation was in danger of exploding a number of the nieman fellows at harvard university in the late thirties gathered regularly with some negro students to deliberate and discuss that subject among the harvard members of that exploratory dialogue was then law school grad student and currently usia legal counsel samuel allen allen recalls that the newspapermen concluded even then that civil_rights was americas priority news beat william lloyd garrison was saying that almost a century earlier he recognized the newsworthiness of the story and reported it in undiluted doses suffering the manhandling of a boston mob who found garrisons unrelenting jabs at their conscience most unpleasant civil_rights was and still is for many who prefer comfort and security above all an unpleasant subject the kind one would prefer to push aside or camouflage despite their special responsibility above that and beyond that of their readership the members of much of the press have subscribed to the same brand of escapist philosophy and immorality some of the northern newspapers have editorialized a good deal but close scrutiny reveals a fascination for afghanistanism as they point their aroused editorial anger at their southern neighbors ignoring the de facto segregation in their own natural circulation area were journalism a religion of orthodox character there would be a long and somber line to the confessionals for the great majority absolution would be highly unlikely to most new yorkers today to whom the word means anything fort greene means the fort greene flouses the largest public housing project in the city which stands between downtown brooklyn and the brooklyn navy yard to the eye it is mostly negro though the official figures show that a fifth of the apartments are occupied by whites and another fifth are occupied by puerto ricans it would probably surprise new yorkers who recall stories of gang fighting in the fort greene area to discover that above the housing project in a little park stands one of the major monuments in the city it commemorates the prison ship martyrs of the revolution and was designed by the great architects of new yorks age of elegance mckim mead white who also built the university club the columbia university campus the nyu hall of fame the pennsylvania station and the brooklyn museum this monument contains a great central column standing amidst urns and eagles a magnificent staircase down which one may approach the project a comfort station designed like a greek temple which puts the utilitarian structures of mr moses to shame from the site one may view the entire housing project and a good deal besides all this provides a rather grander setting for gang rumbles than they usually find it does not pay to extract too much symbolism from the accidental coming together of a mostly negro housing project and a great monument erected by an earlier city and yet one does not have to force the symbolism because between the new york represented by the monument and the new york of the housing project there is a close intimate link historical irony makes the elite of that older new york and the poor negroes of the project both for the most part protestant indeed more han half the protestants of new york who are only a quarter of the population are colored and since the work of the city is so often divided along religious lines it means that the old elite and its institutions churches charitable societies hospitalsoften find they have inherited a special responsibility for the negro fort greene is rich in symbols bordering the park to the south stands the huge bulk of the brooklyn technical high school one of the specialized high schools of the city system which have often served as the first step in the economic and social advance of many boys from earlier immigrant groups it is the potential bridge between the project and the monument numbers in the city had negroes there had been an increase of in ten years coming after an increase of during the s during the s the white population of the city dropped by almost a halfmillion the new york of was oneseventh negro see table new york of course is not alone in this great shift in population in deed it has a smaller proportion of negroes than other great northern cities in chicago was per cent negro philadelphia was more than onequarter negro and cleveland and detroit had even higher proportionsboth per cent new york is so enormous that even large population changes affect the proportions slowly in newark for example which is a city of the negro population increased by between and and newark became onethird negro but the kind of change that transforms a city the size of newark is for new york only a neighborhood shift the negro population is younger than the white though not as young as the puerto ricans thus it forms a higher proportion of both the school population and the juvenile delinquent population for demographic reasons alone there are of course other reasons why there are more negro juvenile delinquents in the next decade owing to the fact that about threetenths of new yorks schoolchildren almost all white attend parochial and private schools the negroes and puerto ricans will together exceed the rest of the public school population the negro population is still in large part new to the city in half of the entire nonwhite population of the city above the age of had come from the south these americans of two centuries are as much immigrant as any european immigrant group for the shift from the south to new york is as radical a change for the negro as that faced by earlier immigrants the negro immigrant has not had the good fortune of arriving with useful skills and strong institutions nor has he found a prosperous wellorganized negro community to help him the negro community in the city is indeed an old one but age has done nothing to prepare it to meet the problems of mass migration in before the first decade which saw a sizable migration from the south new york had negroes less than per cent of the population negro writers who remember that antebellum new york negro would often write about it with something like nostalgia but in those days aside from a tiny negro upper class of minor government employees and professionals the community consisted almost entirely of domestics laborers waiters unskilled workers negroes accepted an inferior place in society and in this inferior place despite the existence of distinctions of class and status poverty was matterofcourse and segregation was universal this group could do little for negroes coming up from the south and from the west indies during the first war the negro population increased rapidly in it was about per cent of the population in the s mass immigration from europe came to an end and the negro population of the city more than doubled the migrants poured into a new york in which they could not eat in a firstclass restaurant go to a firstclass hotel or get a job in the white world aside from some specially reserved government jobs above menial labor and yet the city did offer a large variety of jobs at pay much higher than negroes could get in the south and as important it offered harlem a more exciting and stimulating environment for negroes then than any other place in the country segregation helped make harlem alive it is hard to envisage as one walks the streets today with the buildings forty years older and the population greatly changed what harlem was like in the s in those days negro entertainers and musicians were a rarity on broadway and one had to go above th street to find them because of the unbroken pattern of segregation harlem included everyone in the negro communitythe old tiny upper class the new professionals and white collar workers the political leaders just beginning to take over the old political clubs the artists and entertainers and writers as well of course as the domestic workers the laborers and shady characters writing in james weldon johnson described a harlem few of us would now recognize but he helps explain the enormous attractions of new york even though the city did not offer the advantages of jobs in heavy industry available to negroes in chicago and detroit in nearly every other city in the country johnson wrote the negro section is a nest or several nests situated somewhere on the borders it is a section we must go out to in new york it is entirely different negro harlem covers one of the most beautiful and healthful sites in the whole city it is not a fringe it is not a slum nor is it a quarter consisting of dilapidated tenements it is a section of newlaw apartment houses and handsome dwellings with streets as well paved as welllighted and as wellkept as any in the city the question inevitably arises will the negroes of harlem be able to hold it will they not be driven further northward residents of manhattan regardless of race have been driven out when they lay in the path of business and greatly increased land values harlem lies in the direction that path must take so there is little probability that negroes will always hold it as a residential section this makes strange reading today it made strange reading only ten years later when another major negro writer claude mackay wrote a book on harlem ten years of depression had been for the negroes a disaster that almost rivaled slavery mackay quoted estimates that per cent of the population was on relief per cent held wpa jobs dependent on casual labor and household service without salaried jobs without businesses harlems residents suffered far more from the depression than any other part of the city white workers knew what it was to go two or three years without steady work but a case of special distress in the white world was the norm in the negro world harlem became more frightfully crowded than evereven though there were high vacancy rates in adjacent east harlembecause the population was so impoverished the negro population continued to rise through natural increase and migration but much more slowly than in the s in on the eve of world war ii it stood at with the war a new period in the history of the negro in new york city began the age of harlem as the seat of the negro renaissance and of depression misery drew to a close as new areas of negro settlement in brooklyn the bronx queens and the suburban counties were opened up and rapidly increased the war created a new new york for the negroesnew in the kinds of neighborhoods where they lived the kinds of jobs they held the role they played in politics and social life and in their image of themselves and their relation to other groups central in this transformation of the negro position was a revolution in the level of income that was typical and in the kinds of jobs that became accessible leadership politics intergroup relations whatever the situation in other communities the negroes of harlem and other new york communities are deeply involved in politics they register and vote in substantial proportions their newspapers keep up a continual flow of political news they are active in club membership and in the support of political leaders clearly politics is seen as an area in which to advance the interests of individuals and the group what do negroes want out of politics what everyone else wants jobs on all levels from the most humble to the highest recognition and prestige and the advancement of group interests it is perfectly clear on the national level what policies are necessary to advance group interests but new york is not washington and not the south there is no insuperable problem in getting almost any law or policy against discrimination in almost any area adopted and in getting it enforced the issue is will it really be helpful if it is a matter of getting the right to register and vote or integrating the restaurants political activity can be clear direct and effective but there are no such simple political objectives left for negroes in new york there are already laws against discrimination in employment and housing and while their administration can undoubtedly be improved the agencies that enforce them the city commission on human rights and the state commission for human rights have negro heads or high officials and negro staff membersthere is not much more to be done along this line the board of education actively tries to integrate the schools there is no discrimination in higher education there is probably no discrimination in restaurants and hotels it is hard to see how it could be maintained in the face of the influx of african emissaries and officials the committee on civil_rights in manhattan found in a sampling of east side restaurants in that more than twofifths were discriminating it rechecked in and discrimination had dropped to per cent since it has had only five reports of discrimination and it now considers this problem settled and the main problem to be housing in new york city it seems there are no easy problems any more or easy solutions the improvement of the negro economic position requires such complex and farflung operations that it is hard to see how it can be made a simple political issue it involves such matters as retraining the unskilled better education all along the line stronger motivation so that people will take advantage of retraining and education opportunities changing the structure of new yorks economy changing the role of the unions even if new york were to adopt a minimum wage of an hour the effect might well be to increase the level of unemployment among negroes to a midwest level rather than to improve their general economic situation in housing as in wages and employment the need is for radical policies that make improvement in the situation in general and these are not particularly attractive to negro political leaders in the city or any others for that matter they do not urge that lowcost and other governmentsupported housing be restricted to vacant land sites which is the one sure way of increasing the overall supply of lowcost housing in the city such a policy would mean that they preside over areas of decaying slums while their supporters escape to greener fields instead one finds the popular program of attacking landlords for inadequacy of maintenance proposing ever harsher measures to enforce good maintenance demanding more frequent and more severe inspections by city agencies these are worthwhile policies but to concentrate on inspecting a declining and aging stock of lowcost housing does little to increase it or to deal with the conditions that make it possible for landlords to get high rents for crumbling apartments the kind of political courage that would be involved in tracing out the real impact of rent control on different groups in the city is simply not heard of in american politics in effect there is little public discussion among those active in city politics of policies except in response to the most blatant scandals there is certainly no more than this low average of discussion among negro political leaders there is probably less in recent years the emphasis has been on political jobs all good things are scarce and involve conflicts and on the question of the proportion of jobs in city elective and appointive posts held by negroes we find rancor and bitterness and strains on old political alliances and allegiances there is nothing really new hereevery new group tries to get the nominations and jobs it feels it is entitled to and these are always more than the older groups which fought their way up to a certain proportion of jobs and nominations in the past feel the new group has a right to but who is to determine what is the right proportion congressman powell in demanded that negroes should get per cent of the jobs in a democratic city administration since per cent of the enrolled democrats in manhattan are negro he said they held only per cent of high political postscommissionerships board memberships judgeships even so negroes are doing better at getting political jobs in new york than anywhere else in the country chicago having about to negroes has only three negro judges new york having about negroes has seventeen judges two supreme court justices one general sessions judge four city magistrates three domestic relations court judges six municipal court judges and one city court judge this comes to just about per cent of the judicial offices in the city in addition in new york city unlike chicago many negroes hold administrative positions at the cabinet and subcabinet level whatever the strains in politics the clubs and committees form one of the most important arenas in which the people of different groups meet and test each others feelings and capacities and powers new yorks politics serves much more as such a meeting ground than its business certainly more than its formal social life and probably as much as its cultural life new york has good race relations and it has been helped in this by a number of factors the city does not have politically powerful neighborhood homeowning groups electing their representatives to the city councils to fight the spread of the negro community and the taxsupported expansion of social services in any case the city council in new york is weak it is the board of estimate dominated by officials elected by the entire city electorate and the mayor who wield effective powerand these are far more susceptible to the city wide negro vote the important role of culture in the city means that talent and genius have a status which transcends group membership and which is not found as commonly in other american cities and then the remarkably varied group life all through the citys history means that all the groups have been somewhat mellowed in their attitudes toward other groups and that new yorks irish and italians are probably somewhat more tolerant in their outlook than irish and italian groups in other cities this mellowness is aided by the large proportion of jews who traditionally and probably because of their traditional lack of power have learned to eschew violence and favor negotiation and conciliation and liveandletlive policies and yet within this context of overall good relations it is just in relations with the jews despite their generally liberal outlook nonviolent temperament and their similar experience as a minority facing problems of discrimination that an observable level of tension has recently developed it would be easy to exaggerate this tension sensitive just as the negroes are and also timid and vulnerable jews inflate small incidents then contributing to our awareness of this tension there is the fact that the jewish community supports as italians and irish do not professional organizations devoted to good intergroup relations this means that any sign of tension immediately becomes the focus of specialized professional concern sometimes from several different jewish groups and is rapidly brought to the attention of leaders in the jewish and negro groups and appropriate governmental agenciesscad coir the police the mayors office the governor perhaps so it is easy to exaggerate the degree of tension that exists between negroes and jews and yet it exists its existence at all is paradoxical and since it also involves to some extent the somewhat frayed relationship of the negroes to political liberalism in general it is worth examining to begin with antijewish feeling is endemic among negroes as professor kenneth clark and novelist james baldwin have at different times observed in the jewish magazine commentary because the negroes keep bumping into the jews in front and ahead of them expanding into jewish neighborhoods in manhattan the bronx and brooklyn less so in queens negroes become the customers of the many jewish shopkeepers that have remained behind they become the tenants of the jewish owners of property whatever the personal qualities of shopkeepers and landlords negroes are thus often in contact with jews who are making a living from them the tension between landlord and tenant in new york and particularly landlord and lowincome tenant is in any case extreme and it is understandable that it takes very little for it to become tinged with antisemetic feeling but in addition to this large range of unfortunate contacts the negro also meets the jew as an employer this is likely in a city that is onequarter jewish the likelihood is increased because of the heavy jewish concentration in the citys small manufacturing in garment factories in small plants assembling electrical products toys and novelties plastic products and the like the negro operative in lowwage jobs is likely to find he has a jewish employer once again here is a situation in which a natural conflict of interests can be interpreted in group terms and is likely to contribute to the strengthening of traditional stereotypes of jews to boot the negro is even likely to find in many of the new york industries in which he is employed that the union has a jewish leadership and jewish staff and he resents this thus in the lowwage laundry industry a negro and puerto rican working force is represented by a union whose top leadership is jewish the worker does not know nor perhaps is it relevant that these men may have built this union at great sacrifice twenty and thirty years before all he knows is where his dues are going and who is on the payroll there is one particular form of negrojewish conflict which is too important not to mention trivial as it may appear and that is the large number of negro women engaged in domestic labor for jewish housewives many of these contacts have produced good relationships but they have also led to the feelings of exploitation and resentment that are almost inevitable in the masterservant relationship in a democratic society one can hazard the guess too that the democratic ethos of jewish lifewhich explains why jewish waiters are the worst in new york probably also helps to make many jewish women poor employers of domestic help the democratic camaraderie of the jewish housewife with her negro servant alternating with the uncomfortable haughtiness of someone not used to a servant might both tend to create more resentment than the steady formal relationship maintained by housewives with a longer tradition in the use of domestic help perhaps too the liberal jewish housewife feels guilty in relationship to her negro servant and this too might lead to the complementary feeling that the guilt is justified in any case it is interesting that one study which has gone into this matter shows a stronger feeling of antisemitism among negro women than negro men and the authors suggest that this masterservant relationship may be the cause even the middleclass negro often meets the jew in a situation in which one is formally an inferior the other formally a superior as negroes move into the governmental agencies which are one of the most important areas of employment for the upwardly mobile they come into contact with all the groups that have preceded them but in particular they come into contact with the group that got there before themjews vho in the s entered government service in large numbers this means that the negro schoolteacher now often works under a jewish principal that the negro social worker very often has a jewish supervisor the top social worker james dumpson commissioner of social welfare is a negro on the whole these relationships between teachers and social workers whose training and work tend to develop a high degree of tolerance and insight have been productive of some of the healthiest and most satisfying interracial relationships that one may find anywhere nevertheless the relationship between inferior and superior in a hierarchy is inevitably tensionproducing and the conflict between different people is always subject to interpretation in group terms thus the dissatisfaction over social services for negroes and in particular the fact that they are run by whites and do not give sufficient jobs to negroes often takes the form of complaints against jews and jewish agencies an inevitable byproduct of the distribution of wealth teachers doctors and social workers in the city for example under a banner headline they let them die the amsterdam news reported on february dr raphael gamso the new superintendent of harlem hospital admitted to the amsterdam news that he ignored dr aubrey maynard director of surgery when he permitted resident doctors from mt sinai to enter harlem hospital and pick out a number of negro patients whom they carried off to mt sinai for experimentation what actually happened was that service at the city harlem hospital almost collapsed as a result of a shortage of physicians and mt sinai a jewish voluntary hospital agreed to take a number of cases it seems to have selected over dr maynards protest some of the more interesting ones a month later the amsterdam news attacked the higher horizons program and in particular its director daniel schreiber and its reporter wrote while the program experiments with negro children there is a dearth of negro teachers connected with the program particularly at the administrative or policy making level amsterdam news march disproportion in wealth and power introduces a hazardous element into the best relationships our latin american neighbors who know us so well and in so many ways seem capable of turning in the twinkling of an eye from friends to enemies so too in the case of negrojewish relationships the good relationships cannot help but be affected by the disproportion in power whatever the good will on both sides just as in underdeveloped countries governments insist that the foreign investor take on a certain proportion of native employees so have the political organizations of harlem insisted that the jewish storekeeper have negro employees and so too they now demand that he use negro salesmen they lack only the ultimate power of expropriation but if they did jewish and other white business might fare as badly in harlem as the american investments in mexican oil or in cuba we can press our colonial analogy a bit further for if the jews in an earlier parallel to colonialism may be seen as exploiters they are also paralleling the later development of colonialism those who help and assist the deprived group this role is if anything more exasperating than the former one negroes know that in new york jews play a disproportionate role in pushing for the kind of policies that help negroes it is true that these policiesfair employment practices fair educational practices fair renting practiceshad their origin on the agenda of jewish organizations at a time when they were as important for jews as they were for negroes but the fact is that as times changed as they became more definitely policies in which jewish selfinterest was less clearly involved jewish organizations with their rich resources in money staff and contacts continued to press for them very often negroes were drawn into these activities and while they played an important role the largely jewish liberal organizations pushing for these policies soon became aware of the very different levels of participation organization and moneyraising capacity in the two communities james wilson tells the story of the most effective of these organizations which had their origin in the activities of jewish liberal civil_rights agencies the fight for an open occupancy ordinance in new york city the bill banning discrimination in housing was led by the new york state committee against discrimination in housing nyscdh it was created largely at the instigation of the leading jewish organizations in new york in after the failure of a court attack on the stuyvesant town antinegro policies four major state laws and two new york city ordinances were passed in large part due to the efforts of this and related organizations white primarily jewish groups have been the most important single factor in the committee from the first an effort was made to involve negroes in its work and a sizeable number of prominent negroes have played important roles and occupied top positions most of this negro support has come from the ranks of negro professionals who are officers or executives of other organizations public and private with an interest in housing some important white leaders of the committee however wish in addition for negro grassroots support those who work together in such organizations represent part of that alliance of liberal and minority forces which has played such an important role in the city for thirty years but on the other side there are the grassroots elements who are relatively distant from such activities and the press and political leaders who talk to them and it is as easy to arouse resentment and prejudice against a more advantaged group that is being helpful particularly if there are other contributing factors as against another that is more distant more powerful and more hostile finally there is and again the colonial analogy is helpful the central problem of political representation jewish and of course nonjewish too political leaders who have for years represented neighborhoods that have changed to negro and puerto rican occupancy have discovered that regardless of their votes in civil_rights and other issues the negros want the job for themselves it is against this background that the exposure in of borough president hulan jacks connection with a jewish real estate developer and his trial for accepting a financial favor from him was particularly exasperating for it so happened that it was the crusading new york post that uncovered this relationship in the course of a longextended investigation into public policies affecting housing the new york post had a jewish publisher a jewish editor and a large jewish readership it is also true it has the most distinguished negro reporter in the city it had the only negro columnist on a nonnegro newspaper and a large negro readership but all this did not matter the post became the villain of the case of what was referred to darkly as the plot to drive negroes from public life and it was implied too that it was a liberal and jewish plotin view of the prevailing political outlooks in new york a jewish plot would have to be a liberal plot and vice versa meanwhile about the same time the longdelayed trial of adam clayton powell for income tax evasion came up even though jews had little to do with this and even liberals had little to do with it the threat to the top elective jobs which negroes held touched such sensitive spots that this was irrationally also considered part of the jewish and liberal betrayal of the negro and indeed there is a strong element of rationality in the irrational amalgam for whatever the attitudes of liberals on civil_rights in new york city they are tied up with good government forces represented best by the jewishowned new york times and a large part of the negro community will not feel very sympathetic toward those who search out every example of financial gain from public office while no leader in the group will openly favor illegal gain it may seem unfair to negroes that their representatives in public office do not get the gains from it that members of other groups have in the past alas times have changed and it is harder and harder to make anything from public office in any case whatever some negroes thought privately about hulan jacks dealings with unger hardly a voice was raised against him everyone supported himeven the ministers now admittedly everything we have to say to explain negrojewish relations is also true to some extent of italiannegro and irishnegro relations and yet there is less feeling expressed against the irish and italians perhaps for many negroes subconsciously a bit of antijewish feeling helps make them feel more completely american a part of the majority group there are probably other irrational bases for this antijewish feelingantisemitism is a complicated thingand yet the special tieup of jews with liberalism is certainly important but political issues as well as personalities symbols and the fate of private attempts at gain do play a role in the developing tension between negroes and liberals despite the fact that the battle over civil_rights is a regular occasion for northern liberals to match themselves against southern democrats at national political conventions negroes cannot help feeling that liberals do not quite do enough the liberals are part of the same party that includes the south as well as most of the new york negro voters and are always open to the charge of holding back in the fight for civilrights bills how much of ones time and influence should one devote to this issue how much else should one let go from the negro point of view whatever time and effort one devotes are hardly enough what this means then is a steady strain between the liberal and the negro which can often become quite bitter the bill of complain then is that the liberals frame the negroes they dont put up enough of them or give them enough recognition they dont fight hard enough for civil_rightsin fact they hypocritically fight just hard enough to get negro votes and the reaction has been a new rise of negro exclusivism and nationalism the feeling that negroes have to go it alone and should trust no one but themselves and the idea that any disinterested common action with democraticminded whites for public policies to improve the condition of negroes is an illusion an extremist element has been a permanent part of northern negro life since the s it has recently rapidly increased in strength stimulated by frustration over the south and the rise of independent african states the nation of islam black muslims and similar groups are not likely in view of the much higher level of education and sophistication among negroes today to be anywhere nearly as successful as marcus garvey was in the s more important however is the adoption of this exclusivist feeling by a wide range of negro leaders publicists and intellectuals this development has been as rapid and sudden as the leap in the number of independent states in africaand the two phenomena are not unrelated the impact of twenty independent negro states all with representatives at the un in new york is already striking and while some of the africans are patronizing the beauty parlors of harlem many american negroes going the other way are discovering that they can leave their hair unstraightened there is quite a difference between the subtle and complicated early essays of james baldwin on the relationship of negroes to america and his writing in scarcely less subtle but envisaging the possibility of a much more radical divorce of the negroes from white america than he had earlier contemplated there is an even sharper difference between the subtle and somewhat amused treatment of african nationalism in lorraine hansberrys play raisin in the sun and the passion of her advocacy of african and american negro nationalism in there are obviously many types of exclusivism and even so this is only one part of the spectrum of opinion to be found among negro leaders a philip randolphs american negro labor council organized in is exclusivist but it exists to exert pressure on a labor movement from which he does not wish if possible to isolate himself the leaders of the national urban league and the naacp and core resist the exclusivist trend and still include many whites though the proportion of whites in leadership and on the staffs declines as men of ability and training in the negro community grow more abundant these organizations still represent the old negroliberal alliance the local naacp branches in new york and elsewhere include few whites and are far more exclusivist in their outlook and the gap between them and the new nationalist groups is not so great it is to this grassroots nationalism and exclusivism that adam clayton powell and the amsterdam news appeal here when an attack is made on liberal allies the assumption is that they are not allies at all but enemies what the future of this exclusivist outlook and feeling will be it is hard to say but it does not seem that it can be more than a temporary tendency no group or interest gets very far alone in american politics particularly in new york city there are too many groups too many interests for anyone to adopt the attitude that its strength its numbers require little cooperation with and accommodation to others whatever the psychological satisfactions of the present mood it is doubtful that it is the way to get gains for the negro community in jobs in influence in prestige or in practical policies one can reject white standards of beauty one can devote oneself to the study of african history and culture one may support the policy of african states there will be more and more of this and this is all to the good but africa and nationalism and exclusivism will have as little to do in changing the conditions of american negro life as israel and zionism have to do with the conditions of american jewish life emigration is only for the few the problems are here and they must be solved here and the main impact of the nationalist mood sincere and passionately felt as it is will be to serve more flexible politicians and leaders in getting gains and concessions we have indicated often enough our feeling that negro communal organization is weak and insufficient to make much impact on the great needs of the poorer and disorganized part of the community as oscar handlin wrote in his study of negroes and puerto ricans in new york the ability of new groups to develop an adjustment that would assure the individuals involved a healthy creative life depended both on the nature of the hurdles to be surmounted and on the resources available for doing so the hardships of the negroes and puerto ricans arise from the fact that the hurdles are unusually high and the resources unusually meager one must read the negro new york newspaper with its regular appeals to the community to raise pitifully small sums for the local y or other institutions to discover how fantastically difficult it is to raise money in the negro community handlin points out that when sydenham hospital was integrated it also shifted from a voluntary to a municipal hospital two sets of institutions manage to raise money those fighting segregation and for equal rights naacp nul core though they raise less than they need and much of that comes from whites and the negro churches in the negro communities of new york as elsewhere in the country it is difficult to underestimate the importance of the negro churches when one says negro church it is possible the image of the storefront sect stomping and hollering taking outlandish names and twisting the common heritage into strange forms still comes to the mind of many whites it is not these churches that we speak of though they of course exist are important in the lives of the people involved and are also of some weight in politics we have in mind the large institutional churches in wellequipped buildings with various group activities with associated social services with a large membership and a prominent minister these churches which elsewhere in america for most groups and for most vital areas of concern are fifth wheels are in colored america and in colored new york in the center of things and they play a role in politics that the churches of no other group can aspire to or would dare to it is not unimportant that adam clayton powell new yorks first negro congressman is a minister that gardner taylor the only negro member of the new york board of education in was also a ministerand that both men lead particularly large churches baptist claiming members it is also not without significance that milton galamison former head of the naacp of brooklyn and one of the most prominent figures in the fight to desegregate schools is also a minister of a large church presbyterian james h robinson of the presbyterian church of the master ran for borough president on the liberal party ticket and was spoken of as a successor to hulan jack there are other ministers who play some role in politics and the new york negro minister is in general far less cautious in indicating his preferences from the pulpit than the white minister the negro newspapers regularly devote a great deal of space to church activities and report on the politics of the national denominations in the greatest detail in and there was a bitter struggle going on in the national baptist convention for leadership between gardner taylor of new york and j h jackson of chicago it was headline news in the negro press it is not untypical of negro church politics that after a wild convention in the matter ended up in courtbut the court refused to take jurisdiction this battle involved the fundamental question of the attitude of the church to the new militancy of negroes in south and north but the main point to notice is that it is not often that an issue that is as central as this to a group becomes the basis of struggle in white denominations when j h jackson was victorious in one of his first steps was to remove martin_luther_king from a position in the baptist organization we have magnificent descriptions of the old fundamentalist storefront church in literature for example james baldwins go tell it on the mountain and we have good sociological descriptions of these churches no one has yet described the negro middleclass churches which seem often to make up for the loss of fundamentalist fervor by becoming as heatedly involved in the secular political struggles that affect negroes it is this kind of church that is rapidly becoming the dominant type of church we find as part of the middleclass development among negroes that the same social changes that have made the city church a problem for white protestants may begin to make it a problem for negroes members are beginning to move away from the areas in which the big churches are located to the suburbs the church becomes to some degree the institution of an absentee membership and new ethnic elements move into the neighborhood around the church with no relationship to it and just as the white churches long ago had to consider what to do as their neighborhoods changedand the majority sold out and followed the membership with a few remaining to serve a peculiar function as city churchesso we find some negro churches considering the problem of a new puerto rican group around its doors here and there in brooklyn and the bronx negro ministers are beginning to think in terms of a mission to the puerto ricans just as some white churches are finally beginning to think in terms of a mission to the surrounding negroes and just as conservative members of the white protestant churches find it hard to think in terms of a universal church open to all so do some negroes used to the comfortable community church the only institution that is entirely theirs find it hard to envisage bringing in puerto ricans but the mere fact that negro churches must begin to think in these terms shows to what an extent they have become part of american protestantism participating in its intellectual and theological development and its problems gardner taylor has served as head of the protestant council of new york j archie hargraves minister of brooklyns nazarene congregational church became secretary of the board of home missions of the congregational christian church in since the same factors affect them that long ago made their impact on white protestants one may see the signs of the time when secularization and specialization will affect the negro churches as they affect the older protestant denominations and when these churches will be less flamboyant but also very likely less influential the day will come in the negro church when the minister is not wealthier than his parishioners and at that time the minister will not wield the influence that he does today interestingly enough even the development of elijah muhammads temples of islam suggests the change in negro religion and politics it does not have the flamboyance of either marcus garvey or father divine it emphasizes traditional virtues as do all storefront churches no smoking drinking women but less because these are sinful than because by saving his money and devoting himself to his business the negro may make himself wealthy and successful this is indeed a nationalist and racist movement but it is surprising how much of horatio alger there is in it tooand that reflects a great change in the negro community elijah muhammads young men remind some people of fascists and yet they wear dark business suits and are proud of their selfrestraint and their discipline the temple of islam service an admirer of the movement tells us is sober and restrainedonly handclapping greets a point well made thus even the most extreme of presentday negro movements suggests the extent of the shift to middleclass patterns and the power they now possess in a community of a million people one can see pretty much what one wants and this is as true for negroes as for any other group one can see the large mass of problems that are high up on the agenda of city government and civic groupscrime delinquency the breakdown of family responsibility and one can see the increasing numbers who achieve middleclass status and for whom the only problems are those created by the prejudiced and discriminatory behavior of others one can see demagogic selfserving leaders in politics and church and civic activity incapable of seeing any problem except those created by the white man and one can see an increasing body of competent leaders very often professionals on the staffs of private and public agencies quite up to facing directly and squarely the problems of the group and who yet give no ground in their insistence on equality one can see the huge ghetto concentrations and one can see the ever larger areas of integration in work civic activity politics housing one can dole out an evenhanded justice saying on the one hand there is this on the other that and it is true among a million people there will be enough examples for any argument and yet how do we cast the final balance how do we envisage the future here there are no agreedon scales there is only the judgment of those who try to see the whole picture in the light of past history and to discern future trends our own judgment is that in the north a new phase in negro leadership must begin the era of the leaders who sought accommodation to an exploitative white world has come to an end everywhere even in the south the era of the leaders of protest has been in full swing in new york for a good twentyfive years though it has only recently arrived in the south its achievements in the city have been great but it is now entering an era of diminishing returns and because there are as a matter of fact few additional gains to be made in new york city by protest the protest leadership shows a tendency to become irrational shrill and ineffective the situation in other citiesfor example chicagoand in the south is entirely different but the worst of it is that important tasks necessary ones on the agenda of american negroes are shirked and ignored these are tasks that conceivably no one but negroes can do it is probable that no investment of public and private agencies on delinquency and crimeprevention programs will equal the return from an investment by negroled and negrofinanced agencies it is probable that no offensive on the public school system to improve the educational results among negroes will equal what may be gained from an equivalent investment by negroled and negrofinanced groups and an increase in the numbers of negro teachers and principals it is possible that no effort to change the patterns of the negro lowerclass family will be effective at a time when the white family is in disorder when strong families of whatever kind native and ethnic show signs of disintegration but if anything can be done it is likely that negro agencies will be far more effective than public agencies and those of white protestants succeeding the period of accommodation then and the period of protest one can detect the need for a period of selfexamination and selfhelp in which the increasing income and resources of leadership of the group are turned inwards and already a few voices are raised to make just this point this is the argument that john h johnson publisher of ebony and jet suggested at the convention of the national urban league ebony it should be pointed out is itself rather more selfhelp oriented than the protestrooted negro newspapers and its circulation in new york is probably greater than that of the local new york weekly negro community newspaper the amsterdam news this is the argument of carl t rowan the distinguished negro reporter in an article in the saturday evening post everywhere in america the argument can be met by the counterargumentlet the white world reform itself first even in new york one can say this and most negro leadership does but the question is whatever the origins of the burden on whose shoulders does it fall and how can it best be overcome by rev c eugene askew recently i was asked to be a part of a tv panel on the subject should one vote for political candidates who profess no religion in a prebroadcast discussion of the topic at home my children rendered their verdict that one should vote for political candidates with no religion only if they happened to be the best qualified candidates it seemed perfectly obvious to us that our elected leaders should be those who best represent the total interests of all their constituents certainly a candidates religion is to be considered as one aspect of the data about him as long as one remembers that this aspect is only one part of the data it seems to me that one should approach in a similar fashion the question would i want my daughter to marry a negro the same answer should be given by white parents to this question as should be expected from negro parents to a similar question would you want your daughter or son to marry a white boy or girl the answer to both questions if one really has the happiness and welfare of ones child at stake should be only if he or she will make the best husband or wife among the available choices this discussion is not an academic one for me i have one son age and daughters ages and our family is an unusually happy and closelyknit one whoever marries one of four children is in a sense going to be marrying our family whether he likes it or not children in the united states do not always or even usually select mates according to their familys desires but i do not believe that any of our children will be permanently and happily married except to someone who in a reasonable way has the approval of i the other four children the choice of their friends therefore is a matter of continuing family interest furthermore the time of dating and courtship is not far away and in all likelihood will occur partially at raciallyintegrated colleges and universities the philosophy i and ideals of our family will be the primary influence we shall have upon our childrens actions in those crucial years therefore i repeat the question asked in this article is not academic it is a matter of great personal importance to every member of our family more than that however it is a matter of religious and social importance to people everywhere there are many religiously and socially liberal people both black and white who admit privately that integration and its foundation stone the belief in the brotherhood of manwill inevitably lead to the possibility of more racial intermarriages but they ask why disturb the progress being made in other areas of racial relations succeeding generations will not find intermarriage either a social or an emotional problem each individual will be accepted for his own personal worth in marriage and in all other areas without reference to color still others both black and white insist that what the negro wants is an environment that will produce freedom of movement and occupational educational and economic opportunities given this environment he will not either desire or seek intermarriage i cannot agree with either of these opinions although i am more in sympathy with the former segregationists in my judgment are entirely correct in contending that integration will inevitably lead to more racial intermarriage although i believe there may well be less sexual exploitation of the negro race and less illegitimacy quite likely negro young people may come to respect themselves more and act accordingly than has sometimes been possible in the past there will be no real and permanent equality until we quit thinking in terms of skin color if people really are equal why should the color of ones skin make a difference in marriage i can find no satisfying scientific or religious reasonsonly social and economic prejudices since social customs change slowly except under revolutionary conditions it is highly important that we get used to ideas which normally have to precede actions furthermore it is not only a matter of what the negro wants if the equality doctrine is valid then why should white boys and girls be denied the privilege of marrying some negroes who may have more to offer as marriage partners than some white boys and girls i am quite certain that some negro parents would not want their children to marry my children and viceversa even if other social prejudices in our environment were eliminated but where negro and white families do find compatibility there is no logical reason why their offspring should not marry across racial lines if all men really are brothers what i am now saying to the general public i have been preaching directly and indirectly for over years if i am not to be guilty of that ancient religious custom of giving lip service to one set of doc trines while actually living by another then i must not now reverse myself when the basic issues about equality brotherhood and love are on the verge of becoming personal in a way they have not yet been i must not encourage other people to do what i am unwilling to do myself fortunately however although as a native southerner i was reared in an environment actively opposed to the thesis of this article i find no difficulty in advocating intermarriage for my children nor will this article come as a shock to them they have been taught to discuss all issues openly and fully in an attempt to discover what is true and right for each particular situation they are being taught the pros and cons on both interracial and interreligious marriages and they know their mother and father love them and will love their mates whether those choices be white negro catholic jew atheist protestant hindu rich poor or previously married one should be able to work for ones convictions and to oppose bigotry effectively and courageously without ignoring the need for understanding of those whose opinions and actions differ from ours some people of this present age will never be able to face the problems presented by intermarriage our children however would think of a racial intermarriage except for present social complica tions as they would think of any other marriage they have been trained for the world of tomorrow where men will learn to live together as brothers or else live under authoritarianism or not at all our youngest daughters middle name is lakshmi the name of a hindu goddess deliberately chosen to remind her and her generation that the world no longer can afford racial religious and national prejudices several years ago i served three years as the minister of a racially integrated congregational church in new york state one of our young people there came from a fine religious family which was constantly growing in its view points recently this girl an attractive brilliant and talented graduate of an outstanding eastern college for women married a struggling ministerial student with an oriental heritage this was not surprising to my wife and me nor was it surprising to see the understanding way the girls parents leaders in their community reacted to the marriage a small town new york girl does not ordinarily marry an oriental boy especially when such a gifted girl could go on to further education and a promising career of her own but the girls marriage and the reaction of her family were logical results of her familys depth and her own training her church had prepared the way with its own inclusiveness of all races and of widelyvarying opinions several families including ours in that church used a dental clinic where white technicians worked for negro dentists with an apparent acceptance of the situation as entirely normal and right nevertheless there are always dangers in any marriage outside the group of ones peers religiously racially culturally nationally and financially pioneers in changing established social customs always pay a pricesometimes an exorbitant onefor their defiance of the status quo all priests rabbis and ministers to the best of my knowledge urge caution in such marriages sometimes partly out of bigotry but usually out of primary concern for the young people involved all of us are somewhat suspicious of and prejudiced against what is unfamiliar to us at best permanent and happy marriages are hard to come by as is evii denced in the high divorce rate and the large number of continuing but loveless and problembesieged homes even if young people themselves are able to surmount the barriers of picking mates from different backgrounds their idealism and daring is not always shared by their families parents do not have the advantage of the sexual aspect of love in judging their childrens mates and adjusting to them and as far as sex is concerned there is no guarantee that permanent satisfying sexual adjustments will be made in interracial marriages more so than in other more ordinary marriages many young people discover after marriage that the sexual compatibility they supposed they had is not the reality they had expected either through their rosecolored idealism or their possible premarital sexual relationships the problems of sexual adjustment can be serious indeed with the added complications of intolerant relatives in particular and society in general and the day will inevitably come when one has to face up to the psychological scars and other social punishments ahead for the children of intermarriageschildren never fully accepted in either negro or white circles i would like to urge my children also to be aware of possible confused values within themselves when i was a divinity school student in the early s i occasionally heard of some white girl who had granted small sexual favors to negro boysfavors which she would not have granted to white boys it is not the purpose of this article to compare present day sexual behavior of young people with that of my generation either favorably or unfavorably but whatever ones standards are and whether one is black or white those standards should not be lowered in one area in order to demonstrate ones ideals in another area this too is discrimination for example our family did not go as patients to the abovementioned dentists because they were negro we went because we believed that they were the best available dentists in the area if we had thought available white dentists did superior work we would have used them no matter who said we were prejudiced so i will be disappointed if my children date andor marry negroes merely because they are negro i also hope they will seek to find suitable dates andor marriage partners among young people most like themselves religiously culturally economically nationally and racially but if our children and circumstances decide otherwise my wife and i hereby pledge love and understanding to them their mates their inlaws their friends and our grandchildren it is going to be easier in the world of tomorrow for racial intermarriages to succeed but easy or not should our children decide to marry interracially we will be proud of them for their contribution to social conditions that must come in time life among white liberals these fierce days j nr v of combat between ii negroes and segregationiss t itle at tention is given to questionable white liberals while many liberals are truly on the level there are some who deserve closer scrutiny for it is imperative that negroes learn how to recognize and weed out liberal impostors just as it is important that genuine white liberals know how to behave when in the company of negroes understand me i have nothing whatever against white liberals it is only that they do not know quite how to stay in their proper places of course some of my best friends are liberals and i have watched them at close range from coast to coast while i found particularly useful the usual approaches of social anthropologists touring primitive tribes and similar aggregations i do not intend to subject the reader to the rigors of scientific anthropology suffice it to say then that while white liberals proved to be a rather mongrel breed they did fall into discernible categories ii any wealth of data poses the problem of just where to begin but let us start quite arbitrarily with the roving inquirers this species appears to be motivated more by a nosy streak an insatiable curiosity about the negro race than by any true devotion they consist of two distinct divisions those who know more about the negro than the negro knows about himself and those who only recently discovered that negroes actually exist one special faction of the negro encylopedists or the iknowyounegroes variety is the hep cat liberal or the groovy strain these amateur anthropologists delight in conversing with negroes in slangjive and are benignly pathetic in their endeavors to dance and twist and monkey in the manner typical of the negro masses being mainly middle class however they are much too inhibited to master the easy grace of the majority of negroes who are not middle class but this does not prevent the groovy liberal from becoming when in the company of negroes quite allnegro or alltoonegro the moment in fact that they hear the sound of a jazz note or blues tune or the gospel wail of mahalia jackson they automatically close their eyes snap their fingers and stomp their feet in superficial ecstasy at the same time they overwork themselves in the effort to acculturate to negroes and expect too often that negroes are obliged to return the compliment then there is the knownothing type parading as innocents who knew not even that negroes were dissatisfied with secondclass citizenship until the outbreak of the sitin demonstrations other inquiring liberals aside from expecting you to know each and every negro who ten years or so ago chanced to lunch with them in hong kong or casablanca corner the first negro in sight and set him up as a walking opinion poll they expect onthespot answers to queries about negro thoughts and feelings on every subject imaginable from what negroes think about lady bird johnson down to whether negroes really like watermelon and chitterlings ill a contrary variety of the behindthescenes liberal is the twofaced or sneaky liberal who quickly liberates himself from obligations of liberalism in the face of white ostracism only recently i was entering my apartment building trailing some distance behind a middleaged white couple and their daughter the gentleman held the door somewhat unnecessarily for it required a very long moment until i rushed to reach the door in order to honor his exceeding courtesy i thanked him and decided to check my mailbox which was soon discerned to be empty and so i followed the threesome to the elevator unbeknown to my liberal doormans wife wouldnt open the door for anybody else what is this she joked seriouslyhumorously in contempt the gentleman noting my presence tried desperately to inform her of the same while coyly brushing off her remark later however when we were alighting together from the elevator the woman herself attempted to hold the door for me also belonging to the insincere variety is the surreptitious liberal known otherwise as the piggyback or parasitic liberal they are generally fulltime exponents of nonracial causes however noble but failing to attract significant numbers of whites to their movements set out to capture negro discontents as last ditch substitutes piggyback liberals are in other words what might be called liberalswithacause this brings us to another burdensome bunch many prominent nonetheless in the negros protest movement mind you i speak only of a minority faction the big brother division or the umpiring liberal who really seeks to control or constrain negro rebellion while feigning to incite it one species of this genus is the good will liberal who acts as a selfappointed ambassador between whites and negroes the good will liberal counsels negroeswhatever he may say to whitesagainst going too fast and when once there is the faintest sign of progress in some sphere of race relations he breaks out in glowing glee tooting a gabriels horn of selfglorification only last year this tribe virtually took over the negros celebration of the centennial of the emancipation proclamation with much more intensity than the average negro displayed in all fairness however many were kind enough to invite negro leaders and preachers to sit on platforms during ceremonial programs and dedications to preside over closing benedictions and strut along in the chesty strides of cocksure parades many umpiring liberals predictably include scaredycat characters who operate often unconsciously on the ifyoucantlickemjoinem psychology functioning to dampen the negros discontent once when the first wave of college sitins was underway in the winter of a negro student leader from alabama state college in montgomery stopped off on a tour at the university of chicagos ida noyes hall to tell of his experiences at one point in the questionandanswer period a white liberal classmate of mine stood up and asked if white students would be able to take part in a proposed regional confab why yes said the negro student after a long and thoughtful pause of course you can take part but we would ask you please not to take over the conference this remark brought laughter and applause from the other liberals present iv on the other end of the continuum mind you are the sincere but equally onerous the overly familiar liberal or as some call them the boon coons no sooner than boon coon liberals are accepted as associates they fall victim to an inclination to leap over the wall of mannerable social distance they display disarming frankness on subjects normally taboo in the present day however unfortunate that may be between the racial groups in this country the cruder type for instance delights in a repertoire of colored jokes more sophisticated varieties of familiar liberals to indicate that they are so little prejudiced that they could themselves be regarded as negroes may remark come on out to california with me you could use a tan this species of the justplainnegro variety have no qualms about knocking the slats out from under a negro friend in order to conspicuously let down their own hair but probably the most disturbing are liberals who overdo the first name bit too prematurely not only that they also usually shorten the first name to some threeletter variation while there is nothing wrong with this on the surface it does imply a pretentious relationship between white liberals and negroes which too seldom exists in fact let us behold a bolder subdivision of familiar liberalsthe partycrashing character these liberals may drop by unannounced for the first time in months leading a pack of friends and relatives from distant points to show off a pretended closeness to negro intellectuals sufficient to allow such random droppingin once in they are likely to saunter over to the refrigerator or bar and remark loud enough for their white companions to hear nate you mean you dont have any of my favorite beer or to their companions can i fix you a drink marge bill pete sue chuck usually however they and their friends are hungrier than they are thirsty somewhat similar to the partycrashing liberal is the omnipresent strain who not only open your door with the rising sun but stay on so long that a negro host may choke back an urge to call the national guard robert kennedys marshals and the naacp to have the stayinner removed even excuses such as well ive got to go to a meeting now usually have no definite effect oh go right ahead never mind me the omnipresent liberal simply says i want to hear some ray charles anyhow ill just fix a sandwich and relax until you get back whereupon the negro host goes out to the nearest bar for the stiffest drink he can afford while faking away the hours necessary before returning to endure the unshakable guest the most likeable of all species of the boon coon liberal is the lovelorn variety lovelorn liberals can talk of little else but their inestimable love for negroes in general but the maid or the janitor in particular deprived of affection in the cold anonymity of their own white modern civilization they fall back on a compensatorytoo often phonyfondness for negro individuals others are simply bored and searching for distraction from routine such characters are intrigued by negroes mainly as objects of diversion and taboo quivering with guilt over the negros plight lovelorn liberals are given to masochistic rites they gather with similarly afflicted middleclass negroes to engage in marathon testimonials selfrighteously confessing to bygone prejudices now turned to love these guiltridden liberals place on negro companions the burden of supplying free a sort of interracial psychiatric couch during liquor and discussion one liberal broke down bawling in guilt and remorse but no sooner than he was in the presence of whites he became as dryeyed as a desert cactus and appeared as though nothing had ever happened but despite such problems of hypocrisy as the foregoing i have concluded that the true failure of white liberals rests on their incapacity for effecting negro equality they seem unable to do much more than negroes to correct the racial situation therefore the challenge facing white liberals especially in the years ahead will be the necessity for social dexterity in order to keep pace with new standards or changing requirements of liberal behavior the in the civil_rights crisis the th anniversary of the emancipation proclamation was celebrated in a most unusual way this momentous event in mans tortuous struggle for freedom and justice was not marked by a worlds fair and monuments of steel and concrete symbolizing mans rededication to the attainment of the ideals of justice and the preservation of democracy for all men in fact there were few formal ceremonies there was no dancing in the streetsno parades and no flamboyant patriotic speeches and certainly there were no rhetorical proclamations from politicians seeking reelection white america seemed curiously embarrassed by this centennial and sought to cloak its awkwardness with an uneasy silence negroes however chose to make the year of confrontation rather than celebration it was in this year years after the emancipation proclamationthat negro americans insisted that the unfinished business of human freedom and dignity promised years ago be delivered a century of broken promises cynicism and cruelty culminated in an eruption of impatience anger and revulsion against continued hypocrisy in place of ceremonies there were sitins in place of the free spending at the fair there were selective buying campaigns in place of dancing in the streets there was the march on washington we must be free by this goal was not fully realized during ten years after the supreme court school desegregation decision less than per cent of negro children attended desegregated public schools in southern states the majority of negro children probably over per cent in northern and border states are still required to attend predominantly negroor de facto segregatedschools the stark facts are that the supreme court decision has been honored more through the evasion of tokenism has been ignored completely in those communities in which negroes do not take the initiative in obtaining even token compliance and the few if any cases of good faith compliance with courts decision to desegregate american public education the selfdefeating anachronism of white schools and negro schools remains a part of the vocabulary and way of life of americans the majority of american whites continue to resist the negros demands that he be included within the total fabric of american democracy in both the north and the south negroes are systematically discriminated against by labor unions and employers in their quest for jobs and economic security through an effective conspiracy of banking and real estate interests negroes are confined within deteriorating and dehumanizing residential ghettoes negro children are not only still required to attend segregated schoolsbut these schools are still educationally inferior they spawn functional illiterates by the hundreds of thousands and contribute to the perpetuation of the cycle of personal damage community pathology and group ineffectiveness these general and fundamental problems of economic residential and educational discrimination and deprivation which make victims of negroes throughout the nation are compounded by special burdens imposed by the southern states it is difficult for any reasonable person who has not been distorted by american racism to believe that in the seventh decade of the th century there are states in the united statesthe leader of the democratic worldwhere negroes are denied the elementary democratic right to register and to vote for those who are to represent them in the halls of government although a criminal conspiracy of state officials and others deny the negro the right to vote in these states he is still required indeed compelled to pay taxes he must assume all of the responsibilities and obligations without the rights privileges and protections granted to white citizens this is a mockery of democracy this is selfdefeating cynicism this is tyranny the context within which this moral venom could exist includes an accepted pattern or rigid petty blind cruelty which demands that a fellow human being be denied ordinary courtesies in places of public accommodationsand that he be humiliated or assaulted if he seeks to enjoy conveniences which any white american can take for granted if he is able to pay for them the human degradation and tragedy inherent in this constricted view of mans responsibility to his fellow man is matched only by the tragic irony of otherwise intelligent sophisticated senators trained in our best universities and concerned with profound moral issues in our society when they are not defending a racist way of lifetrapped by the level of their constituents into making filibustering spectacles of themselves the racial crisis of has been described by many words probably the most frequently used word was the word revolution this is a dramaticbut a misleading term revolution usually connotes the use of weapons or some violent or military approach to social and political change in addition the term revolution usually demands some basic changes in the economic social and political system the negros demands on his nation do not meet these requirements he is not seeking any fundamental or radical changes in the american economic political or social system he is merely asking to be brought within the existing system he is conservative he is accepting the american system he is identifying with the american ideology and is insisting that the american protestations of democracy be taken literally seriously and be inclusive of him if he is not included american protestations of democracy and moral leadership cannot be taken seriously by anyoneincluding americans if the negro succeeds he will help to strengthen america if the negro fails the fatal moral weakness behind the facades of american military and industrial power and verbal democratic posturings would be revealed before the world the year therefore was a year of revulsiona year of confrontation of hypocrisy it was the year when the patience of the negro came to an end it marked the end of pretense and an increased crescendo of demonstrations and ultimate risks the negro went for broke he stated the issues of human dignity and human equality with such starkness that the american people and all of the people of the world were no longer able to misunderstand them it took years before the american people could prepare themselves for an honest dialogue on the issue of racebefore negroes and whites could face the awesome respon sibility of honest communication between the races american racism like other forms of superstition was based upon the deep primitive passions pretenses and distortions which seek to protect and perpetuate ignorance in the delusions rationalizations and wishful ideas of whites and negroes were torn away revealing terrifying truths of barbarity conflicts ambivalences and discrepancies between liberal words and irrational fears within the same person this was the year dogs fire hoses and electric cattle prods were used on human beings by other human beings this was the year when superior white men in the uniform of law enforcement officers had their feet on the throats of inferior negro women this was the year when medgar evers was shot in the back because he loved freedom enough to insist upon it this was the year when negro children were killed while in the church of god in the city of birmingham but this was also the year of james baldwin and a major breakthrough on the american conscience the drama of reached its climax on august when thousands and thousands of negroes and whites marched on washington to proclaim the paradox of continued faith in the ability of the american system of democratic government to provide the immediate remedy for their long standing grievances by their presence their discipline and their morale the leaders and participants asserted their faith that their goals could be obtained without major violence and bloodshed time will tell whether this was a realistic appraisal of the resilience and moral potential of our government or a childishly naive wishful thinking a significant clue as to which of these is correct might come from the actions of the senate of the united states on the civil r i rights bill which is now before it the negro in america has demonstrated that the civil_rights struggle cannot be stopped short of its goals by white segregationists he has faced and accepted all of their subtle and flagrant forips of cruelty and has remained unafraid and stolidly insistent indeed each act of cruelty and barbarity seemed only to intensify the negroes willingness to make whatever sacrifices are demanded for total equality the significant fact years after emancipationthe fact which should have destroyed a key stereotypeis that the negro was not afraid he has no weapons and therefore could not repeat the idiocy of seeking to obtain moral ends by the immoral means of killing his fellowman he has only the choice of insisting upon living with the full dignity of a human being or dying with dignity because of his insistence in waging his battle for freedom the american negro has only the weapons of courage the power of his personality and the moral and ethical validity of his cause there is however no guarantee that his demands for justice and full equality will prevail no one can yet say with certainty what are the limits of human barbarity or how corrosive of the positives of the human spirit is the cancer of pervasive racism william faulkner in an anguished honest expression of his own frailty published an appeal to negroes in a national magazine around or not to push their demands for equality too far because they would then cause the whites of the south to mobilize for a counteroffensive and if this happened he faulkner would have to get his gun and go out in the streets of mississippi and shoot down niggers fortunately this spectacle of one of our nobel prize winners involved in this type of barbarity was not necessary before his death recently we have seen liberal whites in such northern communities as new york boston philadelphia and chicago organizing themselves to protect the sanctity of their neighborhood schools it might be of some comfort to note that these organizations in these northern communities insist that their activities are not to be interpreted as antinegro or as prosegregationists but one does not know how deep beneath the surface are the furies of irrational racist fears and hatreds this is a calculated risk which the negro must take if he dares to challenge the racial status quo his chances of escaping the fate of the jews in nazi germany may be good only because america does not have a tradition of ruthlessly efficient authoritarianism and continues to insist upon the verbalization of the democratic ideals the dangers to the fulfillment and consolidation of the goals of the civil_rights movement appear to this observer to be more insidious ones than those which are available to the racists or the segregationists if the promises and goals of this movement are to be achieved then certain problems will have to be faced and resolved what follows is merely the attempt of this observer to identify some of the more obvious and subtle problems with the hope that this might stimulate serious discussion among responsible white and negro civil_rights and civic leaders these observations are offered not in the spirit of carping criticism but with the desire to contribute to increased effectiveness and positive resolution of an urgent national and human problem the civil_rights demonstrations of the last few years which culminated with the aweinspiring august march on washington were most powerful and dramatic methods of calling attention to the negros predicament in the united states these demonstrations were part of the world revolution against white supremacy colonialism and other forms of arbitrary and unjust use of power to subjugate or dehumanize human beings the american negroes desire for freedom and justice will and must continue until these goals are obtained but the momentum and dramatic impact of direct action nonviolent demonstrations will decrease these demonstrations appear to be more difficult to sustain psychologically than are military operations because they do not have the same pattern and total context of psychological reinforcement found in a sustained military operation the individuals involved in these demonstrations must also tend to the daytoday routine of living they must work and take care of their families these demonstrations are psychologically exhausting the more they are used the more they tend to become routinized and reach a point of diminishing returns in terms of impact and effect the positive value of these demonstrations can be conserved only if they are not permitted to become diffuse and unrelated to specific targets and goals and are engaged in for their own sake or as a form of emotional catharsis or blowing off steam it would be most unfortunate if these demonstrations became a form of bread and circuses which provide an outlet for negroes but did not deal with the basic social economic or political problems this would not only be a dissipation of precious human energy but would also be a cruel hoax in this regard one could look with suspicion on the tendency of some white political officials to join some of the more respectable demonstrations and the equally disturbing tendency of some negro leaders to embrace this type of surface but skillful neutralization of a protest movement another danger which threatens the future effectiveness of these demonstrations is the tendency to use them as vehicles for the projection of the egos and personal ambitions of local and wouldbe leaders of negroes these individuals who often do not have the responsibility for the effective functioning of a complex organization can assume postures of militancy and make flamboyant statements which appeal to the crowd without regard to the realities of implementation they need not concern themselves with such mundane things as planning strategy and followthrough it is enough that they have an arsenal of words and are adept at namecalling and are ruthless in their ability to ascribe nefarious motives to anyone who disagrees with them the most successful of these wild cat civil_rights leaders attempt to use the technique of demagogic intimidation of the more responsible civil_rights leaders to the extent that they are permitted to be successful they are serious threats to the effectiveness of the movement the potential anarchy of this situation is analogous to a military organization in which a corporal is permitted to intimidate or countermand the orders of a general if this type of disorganization and lack of discipline is permitted to develop and grow an important weapon in the civil_rights struggle will become a farce and unrelated to the resolution of the basic and serious racial problems serious thought must now be given to the problem of determining under what conditions certain techniques and demonstrations will be used this should be done not because these demonstrations will anger or alienate white friends this argument is unacceptable to thinking because white friends who are not angered by the injustices but become angry at attempts to remedy them are rather peculiar and clearly useless friends furthermore that type of white friend and admitted enemies are more likely to be angered by appropriate and effective use of demonstrations rather than by inappropriate and ineffectual ones the student sitins freedomrides and bus boycotts were successful in the south because these methods dealt directly with desired objectives they were clear and focused and directly dramatized a specific injustice the selective buying campaign in philadelphia is an example of effective protest because rev leon sullivan and his associates organized it masterfully pinpointed his targets was able to sustain and follow through on his demands and was able to measure directly the degree of his success the following would seem to be reasonable criteria for determining whether a boycott is or is not an appropriate technique to be used when it is directed against a product rather than a service when the economic damage or inconvenience is clearly to be borne by the proprietor rather than by the boycotters when the goals and demands are clear and obtainable when the action can be sustained until the demands are met when there is minimum inconvenience to persons who are not responsible for the injustice given these criteria serious consideration should be given to the use of the boycott technique in dealing with the problem of education there might be times when the boycott of schools is the most effective method of dramatizing and calling attention to longstanding educational deficiencies and illsbut this objective can be attained most effectively if the boycott threat is not abused the possibility of eroding the moral strength and power of the civil_rights movement is greatest if civil_rights leaders permit themselves to be caught in the trap and rigidity of militancy for its own sake given the fact that the negro in america does not have military economic and numerical power with which to wage his war for unqualified equality he must rely upon a cold calculating use of intellectual and moral power he cannot permit himself to be shackled to gestures postures slogans and oversimplifications he must be free to deal with the realities and he must be tough minded as he seeks every advantage in a war of maneuver and propaganda irrationalities emotionalism and rigidity in the name of civil_rights goals are no more acceptable than the irrationalities emotionalism and rigidity of racism the fight for racial justice is essentially the fight for the ascendancy of reason and logic over ignorance in man having said this candor requires one to say also that it is ironic to observe that more often than not it is the more irrational and emotional appeals and demands which are responded to positively by those in control of political power and educational institutions it raises a serious question on the value of a trained and disciplined mind when one is forced to observe that logical and reasoned arguments for social justice are so frequently ignored while the threats of the demagogue are responded to should our colleges and universities seek to become relevant to the realities of social change by giving courses in the theory and practice of demagoguery the civil_rights crisis in america has now itself reached a stage of crisis the passage of a meaningful civil_rights bill by the united states senate is mandatory the symbolic significance over and above the practical and realistic imperatives for the passage of this bill without emasculating amendments is indicated by the catastrophic despair and frustrations which will erupt in the negro people if this bill can be killed by a small cynical group of senators this irrationality can elicit terrifying irrationalities in the negro people but the crisis in the negros demands for full equality as american citizens involves the additional dimension of the need for comprehensive planning and strategy if these goals are to be obtained actually rather than merely symbolically this would seem to be true even with the passage of a strong civil_rights bill the negro organizations and groups are now required to address themselves to the difficult task of planning and implementing a comprehensive and coordinated strategy this strategy to be efficient and successful must involve the creation of effective coordinating machinery which has the responsibility of making decisions on specific objectives delegating responsibility to appropriate groups and agencies and evaluating performance and effects of action and if need be exerting discipline or exercising some controls over inefficient uneconomic or ineffectual activities certainly a comprehensive and coordinated plan and strategy must necessarily include decisions concerning the priorities and the energies to be expended and the methods to be used in eliminating racial discrimination and segregation in the key areas of education employment housing voting and citizen rights and responsibilities public accommodation a general appraisal of the present level of civil_rights activities would seem to suggest that it could be made even more effective through systematic programs for the gathering of information and intelligence public education and evaluation of effectiveness of techniques and programs it is increasingly clear that the civil_rights movement has received the maximum support that one could reasonably expect from the federal courts obviously there will be cases brought before these courts in the future but the basic legal decisions of these courts clearly establish the fact that race is not a relevant criteria in the enjoyment of the rights of american citizens it might be necessary however for the negro to explore and utilize the technique of using taxpayers suits to prevent southern states from using public funds to perpetuate directly or indirectly any form of racial discrimination and segregation the executive branch of the federal government within the past three years seems clearly to understand the gravity of the racial crisis in america there is little doubt that president lyndon b johnson shares completely the goals of the late president kennedy and has been using his extraordinary political skill and the power of his office in seeking rational and democratic resolution of these issues it is imperative however that negro and white civil_rights groups continue their vigilance in seeing that anyone who occupies this high office in the future continue this pattern more effective ways must still be found to influence the legislative branch of our federal and state governments so that they are more sensitive and responsive to the moral practical political and international imperatives of this issue a summary of the positives and the negatives in the present civil_rights crisis would seem to highlight the following as clear gains within the past two years religious groups have become more seriously involved in action geared toward the elimination of racism in our society the activities of the national council of the churches of christ in america and the intensified activities of the catholic church together with the clear commitment of the organized jewish groups have contributed significantly to the awakening of the dormant conscience of the american people there is also evidence that business and industry are now beginning to understand more clearly that it is not to the interest of the capitalist system to have onetenth of our nation underemployed and restricted from the consumer market in spite of the moral and ethical aspects of the civil_rights struggle the factor of the artificial reduction of the gross national product which inevitably results from racial discrimination in america may turn out to be the most pivotal determinant of change the vitality and growth potential of our economy may well depend upon the capacity to change old patterns of attitudes and behavior and make it possible to exploit constructively an underdeveloped area within our own nation one is reminded of gunnar myrdals recent observation that at this period in history practical economic imperatives and american idealism have converged on the minus side one still is confronted with the fact that american labor unions reflect for the most part a racial rigidity which is inimical to the national interest and of course is detrimental to the interests of organized labor this paradoxthis blindnesscan only be selfdestructive therein probably lies the hope for change continuing evidence of the pervasive moral apathy and political cynicism in the american mass culture must also be counted as a most significant negative in appraising the possibilities of serious success of the civil_rights struggle if the practical imperatives for constructive change were to be controlled by the chance and possibilities of profound moral conversion in the american people there might be cause for pessimism pragmatism rather than ethical and idealistic insights might be our only basis for hope in summing up it is possible that we cannot answer the question posed in the title of this paper with any degree of certainty whatever answer is offered might reflect only the wishes or the cynicism of the particular observer there seems to be no clear guarantees of unalloyed success of the civil_rights movement on the other hand it would be irresponsible to assert the certainty of failure or the perpetuation of hypocritical tokenism as the accommodation to the lack of any basic commitment to freedom and justice to this observer this is neither a time for hope nor for despair rather this is the time for realistic difficult and if necessary painful reappraisal planning and effective action negroes and whites who are deeply concerned about the future of mankind the future of our nation and the significance of the democratic idea must now redouble their efforts to be effective we now know that there is really no easy road to the attainment of social justice this is a tortuous and taxing process we cannot now settle for the form without the substance we cannot settle for the slogans without the actual demonstration of change to do so would reveal the moral emptiness which is the antithesis of social health and national vitality zambias prime minister the result of orderly elections on january missioneducated kenneth kaunda is destined before the end central african his united naof the year to join the list of african heads of state as prime minister of northern rhodesia which on december shared in the demise of the tenyearold federation with tional independence party successful in capturing control of the legislature assembly kaunda and his government now assume many of the responsibilities of governing the soontobe independent nation though for the present britain will retain control of external affairs independence is scheduled for some time during the yearold kaunda has been the driving power behind the march toward independence in northern rhodesia which he prefers to call zambia an intellectual and a firm believer in the power of nonviolence he possesses an eloquence of word that fascinates his african listeners he was born in the remote lubwa region where northern rhodesia borders nyasaland and tanganyika his father david one of those splendid nyasa tribesmen whose restless energy makes them the workers as well as the wanderers of central africa had come from nyasaland to serve as an evangelist for the church of scotlands mission in lubwa his mother a devoted servant of the church brought up her two sons and two daughters in what to her was a foreign land serving meanwhile as matron of the girls boarding school kenneth the bright boy of the mission school went away for further training as a teacher returned at the age of to become headmaster of the boys boarding school at lubwa had he stayed on there miles from the industrial life of the countryit is unlikely that he would have made the transition from teaching to politics but in he became a welfare assistant at the nchanga mine in the copper belt a move that marked a turning point for both kaunda and zambia in that year he says he experienced the full shock of industrialism the color bar and racial prejudice for the first time he found himself treated not as a person heard himself referred to as a kaffir a munt kaunda then turned trader buying and selling old clothes cycling hundreds of miles in the remote areas around his old lubwa home at the same time he was serving as an active propagandist for the african national congress becoming national secretary in even while he was fervently advocating freedom for zambia he was studying gandhis tactics in india which fascinated him as pointing the way to freedom without bloodshed ironically the basis for the prison sentence imposed on him in was his reading of seditious booksamong them an indian book about gandhi for all his gentle nonviolent approach kaunda has since been very sure where he is going in politics he split with his friend harry nkumbula because the african national congress party seemed to him to be compromising with the europeans then he formed his own united national independence party dedicated to a policy of one man one vote and to what kaunda calls a colorblind society as he told a public meeting sponsored by his party at kitwe in may we assure the nonafricans of their rightful place in this country by way of adopting a bill of rights we favor no racist policy and no oppression of one race by another will be tolerated we believe there is enough room in northern rhodesia for all people who wish to make this their home there is room for both private industries and partly controlled industries the only thing we shall ask of private industry is to feed the profits back into northern rhodesia to help develop more industry furthermore if we are going to build a healthy nation it is important to elevate the living standard of rural africans if kaunda harbored hatred in his heart during the years of his work for independence for zambia it was for the central african federation as governed by sir roy welensky for him as for many other africans the very term federation signified a trick devised by the white manin this case britain to perpetuate his rule in central africa when i talked with kaunda in his london hotel room on his visit to britain something over a year ago i found him not overtalkative at first but as we conversed he relaxed and showed himself to be a man whose smile flashed instantly when a word or idea struck him pleasantly he proved quick to reply in general conversation but mild withal i sensed why both friend and enemy refer to him as kenneth the hurt he suffered when he first encountered discrimination and prejudice in the copper country went deep but it apparently did not leave him with resentment in heart or mind obviously he looks on every human being as a person be he black or white in our conversation it became apparent that kaunda was a man of deep purpose convinced that his nonviolent methods would succeed he acknowledged that in the past he had contravened the law by calling unlawful assemblies like other african nationalists he is proud of his record as a prison graduate now that responsibility has come to kenneth kaunda perhaps sooner than he had expected when he was leading the fight against the federation the question faces him can he hold in check the wilder spirits of his party and persist in his policy of nonviolence will he be content as prime minister to govern in uneasy cooperation with nkumbulas more extreme congress partisans and with europeans now comes the test of statesmanship kaunda of zambia has many friends who are convinced that the answer to such questions will be yes and that he will be a real leader in the new life of central africa was teddy roosevelt a friend of negroes everyones attention was directed toward the national leader as he spoke on the racial crisis we believe that this country will not be a permanently good place for any of us to live in unless we make it a reasonably good place for all of us to live in our cause is the cause of justice for all in the interest of all one could easily assume that this statement was made within the last few months and could only question whether the speaker was john kennedy or lyndon johnson actually the words were spoken by theodore roosevelt as he addressed his friends of the progressive party in more than a half century ago although the murders marches and bombings of recent months have made the national racial crisis a matter of greater urgency and importance than ever before and have caused it to occupy increasingly more time on the agenda of the president the issue is not a new one to occupants of the white house it now seems timely significant and of historical interest to consider how other chief executives have dealt with the problem the historical background of a current day news event is always of great interest but beyond that it provides insight and understanding with respect to the present situation volumes have been written about lincolns attitude toward the negro and the liberal policies of franklin d roosevelt remain fresh in the memories of millions practically unknown to the general public however are the views and actions of theodore roosevelt with respect to this issue although a republican he was like john f kennedy a harvard graduate and was a young vigorous twentieth century occupant of the white house president theodore roosevelt had been in office scarcely a month when he became embroiled in a racial controversy by inviting famed negro leader booker t washington to dinner at the white house the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the question of possible future appointments in the south the incident would have gone unnoticed except for the fact that in accordance with customary procedure washingtons name was placed on the white house guest list when the reporters saw it the matter quickly snowballed into a national incident that haunted roosevelt for years t r was taken completely by surprise as he had had no idea the event would cause such loud repercussions referring to the tuskegee leader in his voluminous correspondence the indignant president said he would have washington to dinner just as often as he pleased and that i respect him greatly and believe in the work he has done i have consulted so much with him it seemed to me that it was natural to ask him to dinner to talk over this work and the very fact that i felt a moments qualm on inviting him because of his color made me ashamed of myself and made me hasten to send the invitation although the dinner had no noticeable effect on the north it put an end to all of t rs hopes of winning support for the republicans in the south the comment of the new orleans timesdemocrat was representative of southern reaction when mr roosevelt sits down to dinner with a negro he declares that the negro is the social equal of the white man roosevelt further revealed his feelings for booker t washington by laughing uproariously as he related to friends a true story about the negro leader it seems that a florida colonel as he had shaken hands with washington had said he was very pleased to meet the greatest man in america washington had protested that president roosevelt was the greatest the colonel had then objected strongly to this referring to t r as a demagogue because he had dined with washington although washington announced his support of taft during the presidential campaign of due to the fact that t r had condoned the seating of allwhite delegations from three southern states at the progressive party convention roosevelt continued to hold washington in great respect and admiration when the tuskegee leader died in roosevelt called him not only the most useful and distinguished negro in the world but also one of the most useful and distinguished americans of any race it should not be concluded however from roosevelts treatment of booker t washington that he was totally unbiased even though he accepted as equals those few negroes who at that time had become well educated articulate citizens and leaders he nevertheless revealed many times through his words and actions his belief in the inferiority of the negro race as a whole furthermore it must be remembered that to respect booker t washington as an individual was one thing but to support his philosophy was hardly to be a great liberal for washington believed that if negroes concentrated on education and character development whites upon seeing the progress that had been made would then grant them full civil_rights this view would understandably arouse little sympathy among todays more sophisticated negro leaders on the evening of august occurred an incident which subsequently revealed roosevelts racial views in a much more questionable light on that night a group of armed men shot up the town of brownsville texas killing one person and wounding two others since negro soldiers had recently been assigned to the brownsville post enraged white citizens immediately blamed them for the crime military investigations seemed to confirm that the negroes were responsible but it was impossible to fix the guilt on any individuals and all steadfastly maintained their innocence because of the persistent silence of the troops the inspector general of the army recommended that all three companies be discharged without honor although they included men with records of service ranging up to twentyfive years president roosevelt after studying all reports of the investigation decided to discharge all the troops the act of punishing all for the crimes of a few would have been enough to have aroused much criticism and resentment but to make matters worse roosevelt did not make public his decision until the day the congressional election in which the republican party was successful in retaining control of the house of representatives aside from the poor timing of the announcement the president maintained over and over again that his decision was in no way influenced by the fact that the troops were negroes and that he would have acted in exactly the same way had they been white he had a difficult time however in convincing negroes and many broadminded whites that his decision was free from racial prejudice the controversy was still raging more than two years later when a bill was introduced in congress to extend for a year the time limit within which the president could reinstate any man who was proved innocent this bill had roosevelts support but on the opposing side was senator joseph foraker of ohio who introduced his own bill calling for reinstatement of all the troops forakers famous april oration presented a strong case for the theory that shells used by the troops during target practice had been stolen by brownsville residents who then shot up the town themselves the president had earlier dis missed this theory as absurd but after forakers speech he ordered another investigation a few of the negroes were subsequently reinstated but the case was never completely settled the new york times seriously questioned the wisdom and fairness of roosevelts action in the brownsville case and seemed to sum up the feelings of many intelligent persons the final result is the absurdly inadequate punishishment of the guilty and the tremendously unjust punishment of many who were innocent of the crime another method of investigation with more patience and skill might easily have brought all the facts to light and resulted in evenhanded justice to all concerned time after time in answer to charges of racial prejudice stemming from the brownsville decision t r cited his political appointment policy as evidence of his belief in judging each individual on his merits as a man without regard to the color of his skin indeed he appointed a number of negroes to high positions but his successoi in the white house william howard taft was convinced that such a policy had not advanced the negro cause since the presence of negro appointees in the south was bitterly resented owen wister close friend of roosevelt felt as taft did that the president did not understand how deep were the wounds inflicted during reconstruction when t r appointed negro physician william d crum to the position of collector of customs at charleston south carolina the senate refused confirmation in the face of a storm of protest from charleston citizens refusing to give in roosevelt kept crum in office by interim appointment in a lengthy defense of his action t r told charleston banker robert rhett that it seemed to him that on the rare occasion when a negro proved to be qualified his good citizenship should be rewarded roosevelt touched off still another controversy in his handling of the indianola mississippi affair when an educated negro doctor arrived in indianola and began to take away negro patients from the lowest white doctors the whites by mob action forced not only the negro doctor to leave town but also mrs minnie cox who for some years had been the negro postmistress the leading citizens of the town who greatly respected mrs cox deprecated the mob action but did nothing to stop it instead of sending mrs cox back under an escort of federal troops roosevelt simply closed the post office thereby forcing indianola citizens to go five miles to the next town for their mail southern newspapers went into hysterics over his action calling it part of his plan for negro domination and miscegenation t r was at a loss to explain the southern mind two months after the indianola incident he remarked in a letter to owen wister that the same fools who turned mrs cox out of office were now depositing their funds in her husbands bank and also had him as one of the directors of a white bank those who would like to classify roosevelt as a white supremacist could find support for their case by quoting his lincoln dinner speech to the republican club in new york during which he spoke for preservation of what he called the high civilization of the whites and pointed out that civil privileges should not be confused with social privileges a far different thing they could cite his paris speech at the sorbonne where he spoke of inequalities in moral development and in social capacity they could also cite one of his letters to owen wister in which he clearly shows prejudice against negroes i entirely agree with you that as a race and in the mass they are altogether inferior to the whites on the other hand those who see roosevelt as a great liberal far ahead of his day can also quote from his lincoln dinner speech in another part of which he pleaded for the treatment of each man according to his worth as a man and in conclusion of which he made the following sincere statement i be lieve in this country with all my heart and soul we shall go up or down together and i believe that we shall go up and not down because i have an abiding faith in the generosity the courage the resolution and the common sense of all my countrymen they can cite his praise of the negro troops beside whom he served at santiago and they can point to his efforts to establish in the progressive party a more enlightened negro policy than that which characterized the two older parties in spite of these inconsistencies both in word and in deed it is difficult to see how anyone who has studied roosevelts speeches letters and other writings as well as what historians have said about him can doubt the sincerity of his desire to aid the cause of the negro although theodore roosevelt is today considered one of our greatest presidents seldom did he have the support of the majority of the people as he attempted to make some headway in dealing with americas race problem the victim of a steady barrage of criticism time after time he acted courageously in an effort to do what was right surely roosevelt would have applauded last june as president kennedy eloquently told congress why a strong civil_rights law is imperative in this year of of the emancipation centennial justice requires us to insure the blessings of liberty for all americans and their posteritynot merely for reasons of economic efficiency world diplomacy and domestic tranquility but above all because it is right planning ahead there is an old english saying fifteen shillings income fourteen shillings outgo security fifteen shillings income sixteen shillings outgo disaster translated income americanese you just cant spend more than you earn without getting yourself into a financial rut while youte working its easy to shrug off worries of the distant days of retirement when youll have to live on your social security benefits but when you are retired it is too late to start worrying then about what you could have accomplished earlier in life to assure financial security in your twilight years its a fact that many men enter the state of retirement with no more preparation than if they were going on a long weekend vacation then when they encounter the familiar problems boredom a place to live inadequate finances other problems those bright golden years not only become a little tarnished but with little to do after a lifetime of progress and activity they feel that they are not needed these are the men who die early rough talk yes but so true lee nashem an estate planner says i have seen many persons retire with success and achieve a happy comfortable existence others fail both in providing a comfortable life for their retirement years and in properly providing adequate security for their families life after or at the age of your retirement can be a vital period of enjoyment with new interests a sideline business perhaps new friends more time for hobbies and a time when the everyday financial pressures are not present nashems advice is to start retirement planning at an early age he says it is during your more productive years that you should start planning point towards a specific date and work towards it where would you like to live how much will be needed per month could any of present hobbies be turned into incomeproducing ones in later years actually this is just a jumping off point from here you must study your assets what is your current insurance and what will it be worth at retirement what can you expect to receive as social security benefits what can you expect in the way of a company pension what will all of these items amount to per month at retirement a budget must be worked out for present living one that allows you to live comfortably yet provides for some savings an advancement in your present job may increase your income but it could help you the rest of your working days if you only spend part of the increased salary and learn to put some of the increase away surplus funds should be invested and not kept under the mattress banks are the safest form of investment but the yield from savings accounts is small compared to other forms of investment bonds preferred stocks mutual funds and goodgrade common stocks can provide increased income and appreciation of capital as the companies grow and prosper a letter to any member firm of an established stock exchange will bring literature describing stock investments and explain the complexities of investments life insurance is an excellent means of providing a splendid safe sure retirement nearly all standard plans even ordinary life policies have annuity options an annuity form of insurance gives the largest guaranteed life income from any sum of money and if you are worried about inflation you can purchase a variable annuity one that doesnt guarantee your retirement income but pegs it to the purchasing power of the dollar at the time of retirement if your present policies were purchased to pay off mortgages in case of your untimely death to provide money to a widow and children or for childrens education you can cash in on all of this at your retirement by using the options provided in the policy and turning the cash values into an annuity ask your insurance counselor how to do this other hints for keeping your financial house in order buy in economic quantities patronize stores with cash operations avoid overbuying and spoilage dont buy overly ornate or fragile things wait for sales of standard items take advantage of postholiday sales dont buy stocks on hot tips pay cash

bringing in the yield you counted on is your hobby that you thought to be incomeproducing really going to produce any income at age sixty we come to roundup time a review should be made of the breadwinners will advice should be sought on estate planning all important papers should be kept in one place so that they are easily accessible all during your years proper medical attention was a necessity but now it takes on new importance care must be taken to watch for danger signals and the doctors advice should be followed as to diet and exercise in a stepbystep planning of your retirement you should have consulted legal financial and investment counsellors but you yourself must have done some research so that you can qualify as a financial handyman learning the sound handling of money is important for you are the one person most interested in your own financial welfare why do some retirement plans fail some fail because of lack of foresight others because of the inability to understand the simple rules of finance actually retirement security is not hard to come by millions have done it it requires thought and a real interest in having few worries at retirement remember your retirement from your job or business is only another way of saying that youve retired to a new life how much you enjoy it will be up to you a balletomane at a bullfight an aficionado im a q a good cook j in fact im the sort of partisan of la corrida who applauds the bull which of course is no way to win friends and influence people in spain i learned that the dangerous way at my first bullfight when the brave toro routed the matador and sent him fleeing most unvaliantly over the wall i sat there shouting and clapping with unrestrained glee only when my own voice floated back on a wave of dead silence did i realize that my delighted laughter was a faux pas all eyes in the stadium turned on me and in that uncomfortable moment i fully understood the savage lust for blood and guts that underlies the spanish passion for bullfighting but while i find bullfighting as bullfighting as boring as last nights beer i think bullfighting as ballet is as warmly stimulating as this evenings cool champagne aficionados go mad with rapture when witnessing a languid veronica or illusive chicuelina or a triumphant remate but take that ton or so of bruising beef out of the arena and what have you got movements as pure and symphonic as any ever conceived by diaghilev and though balletomanes for some baffling reason have not yet discovered the fact the most skillful matadors take the art of ballet into spheres unplumbed by giselle or the sleeping beauty of the matadors harvesting the oles on the iberian peninsula at seasons start luis miguel dominguin ranked as primo don so when the great dominguin condescended to appear in the plaza de toros at palma de mallorca in july just before the two gorings that laid him up toward seasons end my love of the dance dictated that i beat a hasty trail to the boxoffice to assure myself an unfettered view i splurged on a ticket pesetas that represented four missed meals to record the occasion for my dull and imminent old age i took along a borrowed motion picture camera it was all worth it i was sandwiched between a taciturn german and an effusive englishwoman mucho calor grunted the german in spanish complaining of the heat oh i hope all the blood wont make me ill gushed the englishwoman these people obviously were not attuned to the spirit of the coming danse macabre it is said somewhat maliciously that manana is catholic spains true religion and that only the bullfight begins on time whatever the merits of the first claim the latter can hardly be disputed promptly at six then the band broke out the gates flung open and the paseillo began a pageant straight out of the middle ages out pranced the proud beautiful stallions bearing officials as elaborately festooned as the swiss guards at the vatican behind them in time to the bands ancient martial music strutted the three matadors as slender as dior mannequins as richly plumed and as proud as peacocks attending the matadors marched the battalion of toreros and picadors no less elegant than their superiors in their brilliant silk tights brocaded jackets and pastel hose only a philistine could think of this gorgeous army as other than a splendid corps de ballet the procession ended the gate of the toril went up and a raging black bull stormed out snorting stamping a villain more magnificent than any the covent garden stage ever accommodated the illusion was perfect the animal seemed duly fierce but i wondered at its size memory sometimes beguiles but it seemed that my grandmothers guernsey had been at least as big in keeping with the inflexible procedure of this classical drama the army of matadors toreros and picadors ganged up on the bull teasing and taunting it with capes stabbing it with spears leaving steeltipped darts dangling in its shoulders in and out of the arena the assaulters ran fleeing behind barreras taking refuge on the backs of horses throwing up their pomaded heads jutting out their tightly bound behinds exciting mob scene really and then dominguin the stadium exploded as this great man this idol this prince of torerosthe man who had challenged the great manolete and seen his aging rival meet oblivion on the horns of a giant miura years earlierswaggered out to the center of the arena fresh assured luis miguel twirled his cape lured the lethal horns past his thighs past his fanny ole ole ah it was lovely nijinsky himself could not have pirouetted more gracefully glided and turned with more poetry the bull roared stamped foamed at the mouth so hot and weary and weak from his bleeding wounds that his knees buckled as he charged but charge he did again and again all but falling on his face a heartrending pas de deux but caught up in the beauty of dominguins line and grace it was possible to ignore the brutes cruel suffering it was even possible momentarily not to admire its dumb courage dominguin warming to his art ran through his repertory of grandstanding tricks he stood a defiant sylph a foot from the nolongersodeadly horns he knelt in the bloodsoaked sand seized the horns and shouted into the dazed brutes ear the fans were ecstatic they went wild then the hero faced his public handsome aloof smiling the prelude to the final act man against exhausted brute a pase natural a pase de pecho ole ole standing straight and imperious dominguin ordered his muleta and sword and then breathless silence man and beast faced each other on the edge of the moment of truth muleta in his left hand gleaming estoque raised in his right hand luis miguel struck a classic pose all grace all poise all valor then swiftly lightly executing a swansmooth jete he drove the steel blade into the solid hulk of valiant flesh somewhere behind me a female voice shrieked and a fainting body tumbled heavily in the stands i think im going to be sick groaned the englishwoman i drew my legs away from her i was wearing my last pair of summer trousers i was grateful i wasnt the man sitting in front of her it was over the toreros swept in and lifted dominguin to their shoulders and bore him in triumph around the arena a shower of flores sombreros and botes rained down from the stands luis miguel luis miguel screamed the crowd tu el primero tu el maestro suddenly impulsively i began to clap and cheer my applause blended with the mad ovation but i wasnt acclaiming the primo don of the ballet of blood and sand alas that spell was broken a team of horses dragged the body of that defeated beast across the arena and in spite of everything i was applauding the dead bull by arna bontemps the years w e b du bois spent at fisk university as an undergraduate left a lasting impression on him and on the college this was clearly apparent when he returned to the campus in may of to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of his class graduation and to receive belatedly the phi beta kappa key his college had been unauthorized to grant in his own time in the course of academic rituals a moment became grave with memories seventy years seventythree years to be exact he had come up the hill from the nashville railroad station in a horsedrawn carriage with poetry on his lips and laughter in his eyes an hour or two later a bell rang and he joined the rush to the dining hall confronted there by a glorious girl he suddenly lost his breath her name was lena calhoun and we now know that she was the grandmother of lena horne in any case a decade later after new york and boston berlin and paris du bois still remembered her as he confessed in one of his essays as the most beautiful girl he had ever seen naturally when he became editor of the school paper she was one of the students he invited to submit a contribution she consented and in due time he published her first literary effort an essay on the subject babies his college days like the rest of his long life are thoroughly often delightfully documented if we cannot account for every golden day of that happy period we can certainly account for every month we know for example what a fearful bout he had with typhoid fever in the autumn of his first year and the nickname the students gave him when pale and thin he was able to get up and resume his activities we know when he began to grow burnsides and something about the impression this made on his classmates and we can follow through his columns his articles stories and editorials in the fisk herald the awakening of his interests and the budding of his thought oddly enough the quality that stands out in his earliest writing is humor he was a laughing boy and he enjoyed nothing so much as poking fun his column sharps and flats while it ran was devoted to nothing else and one discovers as a sidelight that even a joke told in dialect didnt bother him when the point it made was sharp and valid in fact one of the things du bois cherished in connection with his attendance at a southern college after his new england upbringing was the exposure it gave him to the richness of negro folk expression as well as folk experience he treated it all gently sometimes lovingly in his youth du bois formed the habit of celebrating his birthdays by writing little testimonials to himm self as it were i am striving to make my life all that life may be he stated in one of these if this strikes us as a trifle serious in one so young so ostensibly carefree we may wish to recall that he was born just three years after the civil war that the span of his life was itself a kind of documentary of the first years of negro freedom that these personal memos were in an odd sense annual reports on the rise and progress of his race in america it was as if he watched the unfolding of a play within a play the drama of his own career within the epic of his people it was as a college student apparently that he acquired his lifelong fondness for allegory as a literary form and became impressed with the power of the symbol time and again as a campus writer and later as editor of the crisis the files of these publications reveal he produced in this genre pieces which never failed to make their point and some of which as his posthumous abc of color shows can stand very well as literature his use of the symbol however has little if anything to do with the socalled symbol mongering of some schools of literary criticism to him the symbol was a weapon of unmeasured capability in the nonviolent struggle against oppression this was as true of the symbolic act as of the word we dont have to be told what he wished to signify when he named the niagara movement or when he selected harpers ferry as the place to hold its second and crucial meeting and we may be equally sure that his use of the parable the symbol the allegory though not always so obvious not always explained did not necessarily end with these it may therefore be worth our time to read further references to life behind the veil ran through du bois early essays like a refrain anticipating by more than half a century the serious and provocative point about the negros invisibility in american life that has intrigued the best of our younger writers in this present decade his statement about the negros twoness growing out of the racial situation is echoed today as ambivalence and treated by a younger generation of writers as a discovery but it has not been stated more clearly than it was by du bois in the atlantic monthly in but he no longer needs these acknowledgements of our esteem we would do well to merit his carnegie hall feb a mission and a mule the photograph of scotty smith on this page is not very flatteringit was taken as he spoke of his experiences as a core worker in rural mississippibut almost everything else about the young man is deserving of commendation except that praise is the last thing he wants what he fervently desires first of all is that the negro people of this country become aware of the plight of their fellownegroes in the rural south and the ghetto north and then become concerned enough to do something about it as he sees it the fate of both the race and the nation are riding on the consequences of what happens in mississippiand the souththis summer smitty was in chicago pending appeal of a six months sentence plus fine which he drew in canton mississippi for disturbing the peace the charge grew out of his efforts to persuade the principal of a negro high school against punishing students participating in civil_rights activities scotty has been arrested before for his exploitsranging from encouraging frightened negroes to register to vote to distributing food and clothing to those who have dared to assert their desire to vote and have been fired from their jobs and banished from their homes as a resultand chances are very good that he will be arrested again but arrests intimidation and harassment are not likely to deflect him from his course like so many of those astonishing young people who have dedicated their youthful energies to bringing a measure of light to the morallydarkened south scottys determination has a mystically endearing fervor he confesses that he wants to return to college for the remaining two years of undergraduate study but an encounter with the degradedbut spiritually indomitablepeople in mississippi diminishes the urgency of both his own selfinterest and future right now this work is my life he says i love the people in the south their depth of spirituality and their great potential even their poor simple way of life scottys immediate motive in leaving madison county mississippi for chicago was to appeal for funds food and clothing for the hungry and dispossessed negroes in the delta once these people decide to opt for a genuine role in the civic life of their towns or counties they expose themselves to all the terror and viciousness the racists can muster they must move furtively meet clandestinely disguise their true feelings scotty an old hand now at eluding and frustrating the police who know him and will haul him in on any pretext they can think of gallops about the back country on an old mule using barbwire shears to enter the farms of friendly negroes without being observed the message gets through and the people gain courage scotty says he is most inspired by the simple fraternalism of the people who share what little they have with victims of the kluxers and the white citizens councils passing the word on until food clothing and funds are found much will be needed during the long hot dangerous

dave dennis lynch street jackson miss by dudley randall do you ever wonder what your barber is thinking when he cuts your hair or shaves you besides being artists of a sort we barbers are men of a thousand personalities talkative when you feel like talking respectful when you express an opinion silent when you want to be quiet we meet people of all types and talk to infants and octogenarians beggars and bankers cops and criminals but do you know what we are really like underneath our mask of politeness while you relax in the soft chair soothed with our hypnotic hands and the suave smell of balms and oils you unwittingly confess things to us and expose the secret nooks and crannies of your souls we know what goes on in your mind but do you know what goes on in ours as you lie helpless under our hands wielding the razor there was a man i had shaved for years i began shaving him when the first soft down appeared upon his cheeks and his skin was healthy and glowing after i had shaved him he would smile into the mirror and exclaim what a shave what a barber you are i would have a thrill of pride at a work of art well done i shaved him the day he appeared in his best suit to be married and the morning he came in disheveled after being up all night when his first child was born i enjoyed watching him mature and take on the responsibilities of a job a wife a family but somewhere along the road he began to falter his responsibilities were more than he was willing or able to bear he failed in his duties then he flouted them his hopes flickered out he became bitter and quarrelsome his friends avoided him his wife left him and took the children with her he was burdened with debts he began to drink his firm cheeks became flabby often after he had spent a wild night i would work over his strained face and look with regret into his bleary eyes i had liked him at first but now i began to dislike him he became repulsive to my touch i wished that i didnt have to shave him but it was a necessary job as he insisted on putting up a front to the world and having his daily shave i tried to avoid shaving him but he would always be there demanding his daily rite from me alone as if he were ashamed to have another barber touch him the shaves i gave him now were not so close and clean as they had been but he would only glare into the mirror with a spiteful word and come back for another shave the next morning sometimes he would not even care how he looked but would stagger into the street without even inspecting my botched job gradually i began to hate him i began scheming of little ways to hurt or disfigure him a slip of the razor here a little nick there where it would be the most conspicuous he would swear when i cut him or frown into the mirror and snarl what a butcher you turned out to be but still he demanded his daily shave his badge of respectability to flash on the world at last i began to loathe him it was then that i felt the temptation often as i scraped the keen steel over his chin i reflected that a little slip a little pressure of the wrist would cut his throat and end his miserable existence as i looked into his puffed features i imagined how they would look with a wide red gash in his throat but i thought who am i to take a life only god has the right to take a human life i wondered why i hated him so much god how i hated him i hated everything about him i hated him more than my worst enemy knew that possibly there were excuses for his degradation but i hated him anyway and the temptation to kill him remained persisted i thought about it all day and dreamed of it at night the vision of his red cut throat became my fetish i could hardly wait for the morning hour when i would shave him and feel his throat under my fingers his throat where like an artist i would carve my masterpiece one morning when this wretched creature was under my hands i could resist the temptation no longer with a quick deft motion i drew the razor across his throat some lastfractionofasecond feeling of pity or of fear perhaps made me lighten the stroke the wound was wide but not deep and did not prove fatal for the doctors tell me i will live by john s flannery got five of em i y tt it told sam as we flat ni nosed against the shop window gazing bigeyed at the ship inside the bottle and he says he wants that one more than anything in the world it must cost a lot sam said turning toward me with the whites of his eyes sparkling against his blueblack skin not so much i answered nonchalantly meanwhile futilely clicking the two nickels in my jeans pockets man told jim fifteen dollars i jist might buy it for him for his birthday next month the white areas around the brown pupils increased in diameter where you gonna get fifteen dollars oh i got some saved i told my pal as we reluctantly backed away from the window and proceeded toward the annapolis waterfront a block away besides i could probably make enough to buy it before his birthday thats almost a month off we wandered in silence looking at oyster boats and people listening to the mansworld talk and taking care to stay out of the paths of the bigger folks wed learned long ago that two tenyearolds dont attract much attention unless they get in somebodys way besides we were sort of fixtures there and on the academy grounds fishing in the severn river running errands for the shopkeepers shining shoes for the midshipmen and coming out pretty good when the middies threw pennies for luck to the indian statue tecumseh on their way to exams but we couldnt count on tecumseh for a while and there were plenty of other kids some bigger which made it bad in competition for the few jobs without admitting it to sam i knew that it would take better than average luck to make up the difference between the five or six dollars worth of coins in my mason jar at home and the fifteen dollars to get my brother jim that ship in the bottle she was flying the danish flag and grandpa jensen had talked denmark to jim and me ever since we could listen jim wanted to visit the old country so bad he said it hurt and next summer when he turned he was going to ship out on a freighter and get over there he said if he had that ship in his collection waiting wouldnt hurt as much we sat on a camel and dangled our bare feet in the oily green water listening to it lap against the waterdarkened wood sam dug a handline out of his pocket found a hunk of mashed plum near a fruit stand and baited up the rusty hook he lowered the green fishing line optimistically into the water and sat watching the cork sam fished every day and didnt catch much when he did he took it home and his ma cooked it for his supper even if it was a fish three inches long guess they didnt have much and sam said he didnt have a pa today his poor luck was holding or mashed plum wasnt a good bait and hunger ended our vigil before he had a nibble i about wore the two nickels out rubbing them together watching the bobbing cork then i decided they had to go lets go get something to eat ill buy it didnt take any time for sam to coil the wet line and shove it in a pocket of the oversized denims we walked to the fruitstand where the man let us pick out two bananas from a bunch for one of the coins when we hurried on to a shop where penny licorice whips and peanuts used up the rest of my allowance we sat on the curb in the warm sun and gobbled up peanuts licorice and bananas in no particular order then silently tried to forget that we were still hungry sam finally said formally thank you next time i get money ill buy i knew he would but i knew it might be a spell before he could he continued seriously right now i think ill help you get some money to buy that bottle of ship for mister jim its gonna take more than one person to get that much in the month you got we launched our project with all the enthusiasm two tenyearolds could muster and hunted for jobs it didnt work except for a dime one man gave us for cleaning fish for him then one day sam let it drop in a try for a job that were tryin to get enough money to buy mister jim tommys brother a bottle of ship for his birthday the shopkeeper threw back his head and laughed a long time then made the negro boy explain what a bottle of ship was sam told the whole story the shopkeeper listened and asked me why i wanted to buy that present i told him all about my big brother and he put us to work we cleaned out a storeroom for him and burned a bunch of old boxes and trash we got a quarter and a request to come back day after tomorrow we didnt make any money next day but we didnt spend any either cause a restaurant let us haul out their garbage and gave us each a hot ham sandwich for doing the job the chef even let us eat it in the kitchen where great kettles were steaming when we went back to the shopkeeper hed apparently been talking up our project we swept the place out for him got a second quarter and were told to go over to mr wilsons there we swept some more and were sent to a poolroom that needed a real sweeping plus some trash hauling magazines and newspapers that had been accumulating for several months sam was ecstatic man the way were going were gonna have enough money for mister jims present in no time his eyes would light up every evening when wed count the money then rush to the shop to see that the ship was still in the window one night after a particularly successful day we stopped just before splitting to go to our homes tommy said sam you dont i have to go into your bank at home id mentioned my savings there by next week well have enough to buy that bottle but half the moneys yours i started sam interrupted no it aint you been buying the lunches and besides i want to be in on the giving this is the most fun i ever had workin we let it go at that saturday before jims birthday mr schmidt at the fish market called us hear you boys need money for a special project he said with a twinkle in his heavilytufted round german eyes well ill give you whatever more you need up to three dollars if youll get me a bushel of softshell crabs here come back here he stopped us in our tracks and asked if we might need any special equipment we had everything but bait he gave us a quarter to buy some meat for the crab lines and we raced to my house grabbed a dip net and two lines and charged on to a special spot along the severn river we had a halfbushel by noon and a bushel by midafternoon we each took a handle and started off past high red brick walls toward the market singing happily at the top of our lungs we were crossing a small park when three teenagers stopped us what you kids got hey they been catching crabs by golly you guys are smart for tenyearolds hey jim come here and see what these kids got a figure got up from a group squatting along the curb some distance away and sauntered over our way i was relieved it was my big brother jim he recognized me too and hastily dropped a cigarette in the grass along the sidewalk i didnt know he smoked he walked up and said hi punk what you up to i told him we were making some money he wanted to know what for we gonna buy sam began who asked you nigger one of the others said but i will you shut up and let jim talk to his brother you little black jim whats the matter with you how come you take buttin in from a nigger yeah you turnin into a niggerlover like your brother one of the others joined in looking challengingly at jim jims face got red he turned on me you dont have to run around with him he turned and looked at a scared boy thats better jim give em hell this from a big leering blond jim sams my friend i pleaded besides we were just try in now dont tell me about your dealings with a nigger i dont know whats gotten into you all the white boys in town and you have to play with a jig he looked disdainfully at sams clothes soiled from the days crabbing and i saw something a look in his eyes that i couldnt remember seeing before you have to pick a dirty one at that one of the other teenagers moved closer maybe we ought to teach the nigger a lesson about running around with white boys lets start off with this he pushed sam over another boy who had crawled up and knelt on all fours behind my friend i kicked the kneeling boy in the stomach and the one whod pushed sam grabbed me better tell your kid brother to scram jim i yelled frantically until jim shook me and said get your butt home and stay out of this he gave me a shove somebody get one of those big crabs i heard him say as i started running for home and help well teach this little coon how to catch one by the claws i ran panting into the house and upstairs there wasnt a soul there i yelled at the neighbors house and nobody came out there wasnt anyone to help i thought about dads duck gun in the closet then remembered he kept the shells locked up i thought about a butcher knife and figured i couldnt beat that gang even with two knives by this time i told myself theyd probably let sam go anyway i prayed he wasnt hurt bad then i went out on the porch and got a box i took it up to jims room and put his five ships in bottles carefully in and carried them downstairs into the front yard i went into the shed around back and found a hammer i lugged it and a big rock out front beside the box and went to work methodically id set a bottle on the rock holding it by the neck id swing the hammer and shut my eyes to keep out the flying glass id next hammer the ship to splinters when i finished the five i went upstairs and got the bank i brought it down and worked on it with a hammer it gave after nine solid hits and i began to pick up coins with what i had in the pouch sam and id bought in the dimestore i had enough i was picking up the last scattered pennies when the gate creaked and i figured id had it i expected to get hit in the head but a gentle hand on the shoulder caused me to whirl in surprise it was my dad his sympathetic eyes cut away my fears hello young feller i hear you had a bad day mr wilson heard and saw most of what happened in the park and broke it up just when it was getting rough on sam hell be all right hes with his mother now well have a little talk with your brother tonight youve done a pretty good job of making him sorry already though his eyes surveyed the bits of glass thread and wood then fastened on the badlymangled bank looks like you were about to spend some money mind if i go along i shook my head and we walked through the quiet cobbled streets we came to the shop with the ship and i glanced in the window it was gone i raced in the door and shouted at the shopkeeper where is the ship wheres the ship that was in your window ive got to have it easy young man the whitehaired owner said winking at my father i heard a couple of young fellows were after that and i just put it in safekeeping wouldnt want the wrong persons to wind up with such a prize he reached under the counter and set the bluishgrey bottle in front of me shes a real dane and one of the last of her kind i counted the money automatically and pushed it across the polished wood then i picked up the bottle and with dad still silent beside me walked to sams house a sunburnedwhite framehouse with paint peeling and a broken screen on a side window we stepped on the creaky front porch and dad knocked sams mother came to the door kerchiefheaded a pained look in her eyes she didnt ask us in dad spoke i want to apologize for the actions of my older son somewhere along the line i failed and i want you to know im sorry he stepped back and i got my chance can i see sam please no the darkskinned woman said working hard to keep an impersonal tone to her voice sam dont want to see you hes learnt his lesson and will stay away from white boys from now on it shook me but i remembered the ship then will you give this to him i held out the bottle she took it without a word turned to go in the house hesitated a fraction of a second then continued into the dark interior i stood blankly gazing into the house then dads hands reached under my arms and lifted me i cried on his shoulder every step of the way home george moses horton slave this poem an impassioned plea for freedom was written by a negro slave who called himself an illiterate genius he addressed the poem to horace greeley and the famous editor published it in his paper the new york tribune george moses horton born a slave in northhampton county north carolina was characterized by dr collier cobb in his book an american man of letters as a slave who owned his master a poet ignorant of the rules of prosody a man of letters before he had learned to read a writer of short stories who was published in several papers simultaneously before the day of newspaper syndicates an author who supported himself and his family before authorship had attained the dignity of a profession in america this slave poet who styled himself an illiterate genius was the first writer in north carolina to support himself from his writings his book of poems the hope of liberty was the first book by a negro in the south george moses horton was born in slavery in north carolina about the property of william horton when he was about six years old his master moved to chatham county about eight miles from chapel hill the seat of the university of north carolina the young negro boy though he could not read or write began composing poems in his head these poems were composed to the meter of hymns he had heard in church hortons third owner and master hall horton the grandson of william horton allowed the young slave to travel the eight miles from the plantation to chapel hill to sell farm products the students at the university had a habit of amusing themselves by forcing the slaves to make speeches for the laughter it invoked the pranksters were greatly surprised and pleased when horton declaimed in original poetry all eyes were on me and all ears were open the slave poet later wrote and hence my fame soon circulated like a stream throughout the college the university students soon commissioned the young slave to compose love poems which they sent to their sweethearts back home since george horton could not write he dictated the words and the students wrote them down he received from to for his poems on the theme of love the following is a specimen of one of his earlier efforts which was dictated before he had learned to write the slave poet was to a large degree selftaught as revealed in his autobiography on well nigh every sabbath during the year he related did i retire away in the summer season to some shady and lonely recess where i could stammer over the dim and promiscuous syllables in my old black and tattered spelling book after studying spelling for some time horton taught himself to read at first he studied portions of the new testament later he studied miscellaneous poetry and the wesley hymns but the one person who taught the slave poet most about poetry and literature was a novelist from boston mrs caroline lee hentz mrs hentz had come to chapel hill as the wife of the professor of modem languages and she brought with her from new england a curiosity about slavery when the renown of the slave poet reached her ears she asked to meet him in her first novel lovells folly mrs hentz appended a note concerning horton saying that i have often transcribed stanzas which he would dictate with quite an air of inspiration and have marveled at the readiness with which he would change a verse or sentiment which was objected to as erroneous in expression or deficient in poetical harmony though familiar with the best classic works belonging to the fine libraries of the university he had not been taught to write a legible hand and was obliged to be indebted to others for embodying the dreams of his muse one of hortons poems that mrs hentz particularly liked was printed in her book lovells folly when mrs hentz left chapel hill it was necessary for the slave bard to secure another sponsor this was none other than the leading personality on the campus dr joseph caldwell the president of the university of north carolina dr caldwell initiated a campaign to purchase the slave poets freedom he interested some influential people including james k polk who had graduated in the class of by this time hortons owner had come to realize that he had an unusual property and the price asked for the slave poets freedom was very high since the money could not be raised the plans for hortons emancipation were forgotten and horton arranged to hire out his time that is he paid his master from his poetry money which he got from the students for the privilege of leaving the farm and living in chapel hill when he was unable to sell his poems to the students he worked either as janitor at the university or returned to the plantation to toil in the fields george horton never gave up his hope for freedom as is shown in a stanza from one of his poems that was composed shortly after the plans for his emancipation fell through on july at raleigh joseph gales and son issued hortons book of poems the hope of liberty this book was the first book ever produced by a negro in the southern states and it aroused much interest the preface of the book was the first instance in which the general public had been informed that a talented slave poet was in their midst george who is the author of the following poetical effusions is a slave the property of mr james horton of chatham county north carolina he has been in the habit for some years past of producing poetical pieces sometimes on suggested subjects to such persons as would write them while he dictated several compositions of his have already appeared in the raleigh register some have made their way into the boston newspapers and have evoked expressions of approbation and surprise many persons some of whom are elevated in office and literary attainments have now become interested in the promotion of his prospects they are solicitous that efforts at length be made to obtain by subscription a sum sufficient for his emancipation upon the condition of his going in the vessel which shall first afterwards sail for liberia george had heard of liberia and had often expressed a desire to go there he believed he could live a freer life and exercise his literary abilities to a fuller extent in liberia he wanted to be of greater help to his race and felt he could do it better there one of the best poems in the hope of liberty volume was entitled on liberty and slavery which also expressed the slave poets longing for freedom one of the men of literary attainment who became interested in the slave poet was horace greeley another who became interested in hortons poetry was miss mary youngs cheney from connecticut who taught school at warrenton north carolina miss cheney who later married horace greeley sent the famous editor the poem that begins this article it was a plea for freedom and is printed in its entirety at the beginning of this article the publication of the poem in greeleys famous new york tribune created some interest especially among the abolitionists but the enthusiasm soon waned and greeley himself lost interest in the slave poet only this one poem was published by the renowned editor and thus the slave bard lost his greatest opportunity for gaining his freedom the book of poems the hope of liberty was not a financial success and this left only one man for hope in gaining freedom this last patron dr joseph caldwell the president of unc died in and with his passing all hope of being a free man faded for the slave poet after the passing away of dr caldwell horton spent the savings he had accumulated for his anticipated trip to liberia on drink he began to beg the university students for money and began to write verses telling of the sickness and distress of his family in order to obtain money he would go from room to room in the dormitories and read these verses to the students always he would close with an appeal to lend a helping hand to the old unfortunate bard george horton became very bitter after all plans for his emancipation fell through and he wrote the following poem entitled the slaves complaint the old unfortunate bard lived on in the village of chapel hill for years after the publication of his book the hope of liberty in general william tecumseh sherman entered north carolina on his return from the march to the sea one day in the spring of one of hortons slave friends came to his shanty and reported seeing a large group of soldiers on horseback horton knew that these were cavalrymen and he made his plans to escape to their lines he went to his master hall horton and asked if he could carry some produce to the village he was granted permission mr horton was not aware that union cavalry was in the vicinity george then loaded his produce in a bag and slung it over the back of an old horse that his master had managed to keep through the four years of the war he headed for chapel hill until he got out of sight of the plantation and then urged the old horse in the direction his friend had said the union cavalrymen were located night had fallen as george arrived at the northern picket lines being unaware of how an army with sentinals operated he rode into the lines and failed to halt when he was challenged the pickets started firing and the old poet leaped from his old horse and lay on the ground this act saved his life george started to sing an old spiritual in a loud voice and the sentinels knew he wasnt an enemy he was allowed to come into the lines of the union cavalry and at the age of about he was free at last the old poet soon began to write poems for the union troops to send home to their sweethearts just as he had written love poems for the students at the university of north carolina his work came to the attention of a union officer captain will h s banks captain banks took horton to philadelphia and helped him in the publication of his final book it was entitled naked genius and was published in october in the preface captain banks stated that it would be offered to the public as one of the many proofs that god in his infinite wisdom and mercy created the black man for a higher purpose than to toil his life away under the galling yoke of slavery shortly after arriving at philadelphia horton was considered as quite a celebrity he was invited to speak at many meetings of people who were interested in poetry soon horton lost the bitterness he had known previously when his freedom was denied he was able to compose in a light vein as in his creditor to his proud debtor life in the city of brotherly love proved to be not so easygoing as in the sunny south for the illiterate genius the people of philadelphia soon lost interest in the negro bard and the naked genius was forced to seek means other than writing to earn his livelihood fame is such a fleeting thing that george moses horton the slave poet died about almost forgotten by all black mutiny go below and get some bread and throw it to the niggers captain ferrer roared believing the slaves hungry as he spoke to antonio the cook the mutineers emerged from the focsle shouting brandishing sugar cane knives they were not hungry for bread but for freedom through the rainy mist appeared cinque the bold insurgent leader his blade swished through the air striking the captain across the throat slowly ferrer dropped to the deck dead and in the grim darkness the men started out after the cook thus in august cinque son of an african chieftain started the amistad case which by the time it reached the u s supreme court numbered among the many inflammable events which helped bring on the civil war in his cabin awakened by the noise don pedro montez owner of four of the slaves grabbed a knife jose ruiz the other slave owner seized an oar montez rushed to the deck saw the situation then ducked below again wrapped himself in sail cloth and hid behind two barrels of sugar down the ladder crashed the angry slaves cinque in the lead there they are shouted one of the men cut their throats called another cinque stopped them take them alive he ordered turning to banna who knew a little english he said carry them to the helm montez a former sea captain was lashed to the wheel and told to steer for sierra leone on the west coast of africa at sunrise the hungry men broke into the cargo they wrapped themselves in magnificent silks and ate freely of the raisins olives and fruit but they also drank indiscriminately the medicines and the wine when some fell ill captain cinque put them on rations allowing them to eat only what he distributed at length another schooner was sighted cinque sent montez and ruiz below and told banna what to say africa mendi land banna called as the other ship drew along side no yelled back the puzzled captain new york pilot boat number three during the heavy storm the previous night montez had gently turned the boat around and headed northwest cinque wanted to get home as soon as possible but his ships stores were low the men needed water and food for four days they drifted along the south shore of long island looking for a place to put in finally they dropped anchor off culloden point near montauk dressed in silk loin cloths and blankets some of the men went ashore with spanish gold doubloons they purchased supplies from the nearby residents captain henry green of sag harbor who had read newspaper accounts of the vessel of suspicious character sighted off sandy hook and had heard whisperings about the black men with the gold doubloons ventured down to the beach with a company of his men through banna cinque asked if the country had slaves no captain green answered this is a free country any spaniards here banna asked captain green shook his head for four hours the men talked banna interpreting as best he could and cinque using sign language cinque offered to give captain green the schooner if he would sail them to sierra leone as the men talked a u s navy craft sailed into long island sound ruiz and montez the slave owners learned of the approaching ship broke from the hold and came up on deck from there they called to the navy vessel begging protection from its captain lt commander gedney spied the mutineers armed with cane knives and taking them to be pirates dispatched his officers aboard the schooner cinque meanwhile rushed back to his ship to investigate arriving on deck just as the navy officers were ordering his men below when he challenged their command the officers leveled their guns cinque turned ran to the rail and leaped overboard in a frantic effort to escape underwater he unfastened his belt and swam away for minutes he evaded the boats which were sent after him finally captured cinque was taken aboard commander gedneys ship the brig washington and put in irons cinque crown prince of mendi land a vast expanse near liberia became the feature subject of newspaper stories throughout the country and the sacred cause of the abolitionist movement commander gedney had towed the schooner amistad into his home port new london conn where on august judge andrew t judson of the u s district court summoned a grand jury aboard the brig washington to investigate erect the compact yearold african prince faced the jury as he and his men were indicted for murder and piracy commander gedney professed no interest in the slaves or what they had done but he claimed the cargo as salvage ruiz and montez demanded possession of the men and abolitionist committees sprang to their rescue professor j w gibbs of the yale divinity school undertook to find a man capable of interpreting the prisoners case frontbanna he learned the mendi words for the numbers one to then he caught a train for new york for days gibbs marched up and down the new york docks addressing every negro sailor he saw with the mendi numerals most of them shied away thinking he was either crazy or drunk but finally he found a fellow who understood the sailor was a mendi lad named naweli who had been freed from his portugese captors by a british man o war and who had later joined the british navy gibbs and naweli set out for connecticut at the hearing in hartford judge judson told the jury that cinque and his men had committed no crime against the united states the court he said would decide only whether the men were slaves or free the amistad case grew enormous in stature the spanish government demanded cinques extradition great britain which had allowed naweli the interpreter a leave from his ship asked leniency gibbs countersued montez and ruiz charging false arrest newspapers loved the rich human interest of the story and sent their best correspondents to cover the trial when the jury handed down its decision cinque and his men were freed but the government prosecutor appealed for almost a year while the case awaited a date on the u s supreme court calendar cinque and his men were held in a small jail in westville conn they were allowed a fair measure of freedom and local people taught them some english reading and writing almost daily the newspapers reported on their progress by february the case had at last gotten to the supreme court the eminent expresident john quincy adams was the defense attorney the supreme courts decision came quickly cinque and his men were declared not to be spanish subjects and hence ineligible for extradition further the court ruled that they had been enslaved in violation of the spanish decree of which prohibited slavery the captives were set free dismissed from the custody of the court and ordered to go without delay cinque returned to mendi land to his wife and three children soon afterwards he died there in today there is a mural at talladega college talladega alabama commemorating this historic freedomfighter i am a black muslim i and proud of it proclaimed cassius clay the new heavyweight boxing champion of the world and a lot of us were shocked no matter that young mr clay has yet to prove that he isnt in the words he himself applied to floyd patterson a cheese champion no matter that he won boxings richest most coveted crown because his opponent couldnt raise his left arm no matter that cassius is an unlettered overgrown boy no matter how you slice it mr clay is a karat celebrity one of the best known negroes in the united states and his public announcement that he belonged proudly to a fanatical negro supremacy group inevitably raised many hackles among the white majority the black muslims it is true represent a tiny segment of the american negro population all of the most respected negro leaders have disowned them some using extraordinarily strong words but that doesnt make the muslims go away theyre here quite probably to stay the black muslims despite mr clays naive statements to the contrary have no connection with the religion of islam they arent in fact any more muslim than the shriners their platform advocates black supremacy arguing that black is black and white is white and never the two shall meet ironically they share this belief with the diehard white supremacists both arguing that negroes and whites werent intended to integrate negroes have nothing to gain the black muslims argue everything to lose from associating with whites all whiteled efforts for civil_rights they say are a waste of time meant only to delude negroes to my knowledge no responsible leader white or negro considers the muslims seriously as a social or political force for one thing elijah muhammed malcolm_x and their associates are blandly vague when it comes to charting specific courses of future action except for immediate policies and postures they have little to offer the negro and most negroes are far too leery of the primrose path to buy another patent medicine just because the medicine men are black but the black muslims have a message for all americans unfortunately it doesnt seem to be getting through to many of us the muslims are a kind of symbol of the new negro mood a mood widely shared by negroes who laugh to scorn the muslim movement itself the new mood says this is the end of the line we want our rights now and please dont do us any favors the people who may be the most disconcerted by this new mood are the white liberals the friends of the negro those who have been on the firing lines for many years some since the early new deal days are especially rattled by the hard realism of the negro attitude not many years ago negroes appreciated the efforts of whites to gain their rights for them sometimes they were even grateful twenty years ago when i first encountered the racial justice firing line myself there was a were all in this together camaraderie between negroes and the whites who were battling alongside them the economic and social acceptance of negroes or even a negro by a group of whites or a white organization brought a warm glow in both groups those were the days when negroes and their white friends took unconscionable pride in the achievements of marian anderson ralph bunche and especially jackie robinson even then of course the winds of change were beginning to blow in the midforties an elderly white clergyman and i grudgingly sat up all night on a miserable train because hotels in the town where we were addressing a brotherhood meeting would not accommodate the third member of our trio a negro minister the two of us would have closed ranks with the latter more graciously if he hadnt been a thoroughly disagreeable man who wore his race like a badge and who all but dared us to yield our comfort to the principles we professed while this angry young negro may have temporarily arrested the cause of brotherhood in two white men of good will he might also have taught us that his rights were just that and not privileges today the negro has stopped being grateful for things that belong to him by right things which he has been illegally denied since the emancipation proclamation one hundred years ago and if they dont bristle like rednecked southern hill folk when they hear the expression of a finally emancipated negro attitude the white liberal champions of the negro can hardly be blamed for feeling a little like parents when they learn their grown children are no longer dependent on them perhaps not many negroes are as baldly aggressive as the comedian who purports to run a rentanegro service for people who want to have an integrated party but the humor in this jibe doesnt reflect the wry amusement that many negroes feel when they watch the lastoneinisadirtyword scramble of the white johnnycomelately integrationists novelist james baldwin who is as typical of his generation as the courtly a philip randolph is of his has no qualms about rubbing the noses of the friendliest whites in the dirt of longdenied opportunities not long ago mr baldwin took television viewers with him while he toured san franciscos harlem preening strutting and muttering phrases that blended jeremiah and the new yorker without benefit of monosodium glutamate baldwin bitingly typified the new negro mood when one of the people he questioned gave a disen chanted reply to a blunt query the little novelist would cast down his eyes sagely and mutter the kind of cocktail party apostrophe so often mistaken for the spark of genius mr baldwin did nothing for the negro image neither did the less gifted negroes he interviewed some of the latter like cassius clay espoused the black muslims others told of their encounters with white mens justice and white mens jails several spoke crudely one was obscene and his obscenity brought a shrill giggle from baldwin the churches took their lumps in other candid comments white viewers could help themselves to reactions anger shock fright indignation sadness disgust surely no favorable white reaction was likely negro public relations must have suffered terribly i wondered how many white viewers felt shame shame because white greed and exploitation and intolerance had created among the negroes the same need for demagogues that that other depressed group the old south feels shame for white policies that for generations kept negroes in social and economic bondage that reduced negroes to hatinhand gratitude for white favors that shouldnt have been favors at allbut rights if he had a choice of white reactions this program would arouse mr baldwin and i think most negroes would probably prefer to see shame but chances are he wouldnt much care the american negro has very nearly stopped looking for white approval he is probably more indifferent to such approval than most whites are to the approval of their fellow whites and he is certainly more indifferent to white approval than he is to the approval of his fellow negroes the new solidarity of the negroes is only indirectly the child of ghetto life the latter is a cringing huddling together for selfdefense the new negro solidarity is a proud defiant and for the first time in american negro history a joyful thing the negro long ago put away his banjo and removed the cleats from his dancing shoes in the last decade he has also served notice that the niceties of brotherhood week will have to wait at least until he has the rights that our constitution describes as godgiven for the rest of us the medicine may be increasingly bitter as we wake up to the fact that demands are replacing requests we may not like sitins and boycotts and picketingwe may in fact be right in arguing that these tactics do more harm than good but we have forfeited our right to argue the point by our centurylong foot dragging on negro rights short of widespread bloody violenceand please god therell be none of that we cant even resist much less stop the march and ultimate triumph of the negro rights movement it is truly an idea whose time has come and its much much too late in the day for christmas baskets the steps to freedom a dreadful quiet is beginning to settle over the recently tumultuous civil_rights scene here in america it is an ominous quiet which seems to be issuing from the depths of the broken hearts the frustrated dreams and the dashed hopes of those most affectedthe american negro it is like the calm which precedes the most deadly storm it is as if those long dead have returned momentarily to the play of life to set the stage for some subsequent savage act which will send many new souls to join them in the long cold corridors of the misty unknown it has long been known that it is the nature of man to not only be free but to struggle against all forms of oppression whether it be religious political moral or immoral the negro in america has been morally and politically oppressed for over a century and like the many generations of man before him he has been and is struggling against that oppression and its effects he is for example evolving with certainty in the same direction as did the oppressed people of france during the one hundred years immediately prior to bastille day on july the fact that he is outnumbered by approximately nine to one in population will neither halt nor slow the impetus of his forward thrust for it is as certain as death itself that man must reach out for freedom even in the face of overwhelming odds and inhumane treatment the entire history of mans inhumanity to man reveals that freedom for those oppressed evolves from the public reaction to four basic phases or steps in human behaviour they are in order first cooperation with the oppressor secondthe persuasion of or the reasoning with the oppressor third coercion and threats against the oppressor and fourthviolence bloodshed and death the negro in america today has come to the climax of the third step for nearly two hundred years as slaves and later freed slaves his father and his grandfather cooperated with their oppressors in the vain hope that at some future date their sons and daughters would be able to walk tall in the land as free men and women but this has not come to pass for the sons and the grandsons of the slaves are still not free even though they themselves have been pleading withand attempting to persuadethe sons and grandsons of their oppressors for nearly fifty years many reasons have been advanced as the basis for the continued subjugation of the black man in america some students of human behaviour state that economic competition and drives toward individual security causes the whites to continue to cling to the advantage handed down to them by their slaveholding ancestors others blame family conditioning and tradition that is to say that the son is conditioned within the family to hate what his father hates and to love what his father loves if the father contends that black is a sign of evil then no amount of logic and reason can make the son think otherwise there are other philosophies too numerous to mention here except to state the simple fact that the more accustomed one becomes to oppressing someone else whatever the reason the stronger becomes the feeling of selfexultation and selfworship that grows within him and that the longer these feelings exist the more difficult it becomes to even think of relinquishing them that then has been and still is the conscious or subconscious position of the white man in america today it is the position of the socalled liberal as well as the john bircher and it is the position of the poor white man as well as the rich it was because of these tenacious viewpoints that the disgusted oppressed negro population launched what is popularly known as the negro revolt this writer would prefer to call it the transition to the step before the revolt inspired by the courageous stands taken by a few outspoken negro ministers in the racehating south the dejected negro all over the country took heart and began to look upon themselves with pride the embers of their dying hopes once again began to glow and from that feeble spark a few great writers took their pens and fanned those embers into a blazing flame baldwin lomax and others reached to the heavens with brilliant words and phrases and sounded the clarion call of freedomfreedom uplifted exultant and rededicated negroes of all ages and from all walks of life began to march side by side with whites who felt their urgency and to sing the songs of liberty in the north in the south in the east and in the west they sang they picketed they demonstrated and they marched into the face of vicious dogs and danger into fire hoses and furious oppressors and into the dark jails thus in glory began the third act or more definitively the third step toward freedom this was the coercive phase the large dissenting crowds the loud dissenting voice the pulse of poverty throbbing in anticipation of the better life to be the eager surging forward motion of that part of the nation which had long been held back but now beheld the light of freedom within reach these were the determined two hundred and fifty thousand people who gathered in the nations capital on august and demanded release from bondage this too was the anticlimax the desperate appeal to bring the play to a happy conclusion this was the final bid for the goodwill which never came for those who would oppress still do and those who hate for the sake of hate itself have still not changed their minds indeed they have stood their ground nothing has changed except perhaps that the subtle discrimination which existed before the great march is subtler still and now as the curtain prepares to fall on act threethe flame dies and the stage grows ominously still all that is left of the great anticlimax are the children playing in the ashes of what was once a brightly burning flame in the wings stand the ghosts of john brown of medgar evers of john fitzgerald kennedy and of many morewaiting patiently to set the stage for a long and bloody act four should act four begin there is no doubt that the black man will perish in america for he has neither the means the numbers nor the methods to pursue his goal with arms this fact within itself would not be so terrible men have died before in order that their children might go free if a man is not willing to die for his principles then either his principles are not sound or the man himself is not worthy of holding them the curse of black slavery still lies heavily over the rocks and rills of america it hangs like an ominous cloud over the highest mountain and it creeps like an odorous vine through the bright valleys of wisdom and truth tainting the christian church warping the nations children and twisting the minds of even the most knowledgable men that we must rid ourselves of this pestilence before it destroys us has long been known and were it not for the awesome expectation of the eventual fulfillment of the prophesies it might well be that the blood of the american negro is the only blood that is whole enough to wash the stain away the problem however goes deeper than that and the implications contained within it are heavy enough to shake the very foundations of the earth this then is a prophesynot just a mere conglomeration of words it is a prophesy accompanied by a prayer that the fourth step in the american negroes fight for freedom will never be taken for if this bloody act in the play begins the spark from it will ignite a holocaust that will destroy not only the white man but the population of the entire known world it will be the beginning of a conflict the likes of which has never been witnessed by mankind true there have been wars and rumors of war since the beginning of time several years ago a writer for the new york times noted that in years of recorded history there have been years of war and only years of peace these wars no doubt were fought in many lands for many reasons but never in the history of man has a war been fought merely on the basis of color yet should the american negro be forced to take the next step and take it he will for there is no turning back and thus provoke his end this is the type of war that the world will become engaged in the black brown yellow and the red men three fourths of the worlds population long dissatisfied with the treatment afforded them over the centuries by the white men of the world have for years been banding themselves together on these common grounds and all of the american millions poured out to them under the name of foreign aid has not been enough to halt this trend nor has it been enough to buy their love the rising nations of africa invariably join the causes of asia castro of cuba is spreading his influence over all of latin america including mexico the gateway to the united states france who claims her heritage from egypt and africa is wooing the darkskinned people of asia africa and latin america japan and the far east have joined hands and the fearful dragon of red china is rattling its chains so hard that white russia our former bitter enemyhas fearfully jumped into bed with us and with our allies missiles and nuclear fission are no longer the exclusive possessions of the two great powers and there is enough fire power around in the rest of the world to also blow us off the face of the globe while we are busy blowing someone else up it is of prime importance then that the fourth step in the american negroes fight for freedom be forestalled this is not to say that he should not have his liberty for certainly he must it is merely stated here that the curtain for the third act should not be allowed to fall until the act itself is brought to at least a workable conclusion this can only be accomplished by a miracle of concessions that must be made by both the american negro and the american white man they must first of all together concede that there is a cultural chasm of approximately one hundred years between them and they must combine in their efforts to bridge this gap before it is too late by holding the negro back or standing on his shoulders the white man has amassed most of the wealth in america and all of the power that wealth brings with it by allowing himself to be held back that is to say that by not fighting and dying for his rights in the first placethe american negro has put himself into a cultural position that will make the acceptance of freedom most difficult for him when it finally comes let us therefore not be naive to fully integrate is to eventually assimilate and amalgamate how can two groups of people amalgamate without conflict if their levels of culture and understanding are at opposite poles the problem now before us is how to unbrainwash those who have been thoroughly brainwashed and how to erase the bitterness and disillusionment of one hundred years in a few short months it will not be an easy task but it must be done the cultural gap between the races in america created by the slave trade and its after effects must be quickly closed and forever sealed if we are to survive as a nation difficult though this task may be it can and it must be done the fortunate white man who has profited much from this dilemma created by his ancestors must now spend some of this money to pay for vast social work programs retraining and educational projects aimed at the betterment of not only the unfortunate negro but the unfortunate white as well he must pay this bill because the negro has not been allowed to profit and can not afford to pay the negro meanwhile must take inventory of himself and gird for his new role in society no longer will he be considered as just a boy he will be considered as and he must assume the role of a man willing and able to assume his full share of the responsibilities that accompany the rights that he has fought so long to acquire when this is done the bright glow of liberty will again envelope this land and our children will walk hand and hand together in its glow setting an example for the rest of the world to follow enriched history for the white man he milling process j r destroys the vitamins ii and sucks the minerals out of our tlour for years this resulted in malnutrition in families whose diet centered on bread rickety spavined pimply or otherwise defective bodies were the consequence only when the millers accepted the simple suggestion of some genius that they put back what theyd been taking out was this source of social evil stopped the restored product was called enriched flour honest white scholars have most of them come to agree with what negro scholars have long known for many decades reaching back prior to the turn of the century the school subject that was taught as american history wasnt that at all the vitamins of the contribution of the negro to our nation and its heritage and the minerals of the truth about race relations were carefully removed the effect of the resulting mental malnutrition has been devastating to the negro it was destructive of his sense of personal worth of selfrespect of identityexcept when through family traditions or by benefiting from the single virtue of a segregated college he learned some of the truth to the white it was a calamity it contributed largely to a corruption of the spirit rickety and pimply mental and spiritual attitudes were the effect of the bleached history product through the years an awakening and fighting talented tenth has promoted a subject which for lack of a better name has been called negro history w e b du bois and carter g woodson were the founding fathers of the fight until very recently the work of exploiting their breakthroughs was confined within racial channels it was almost exclusively the negro writer editor reader and student who obtained the benefit the result was separate and not very equal it was not the true american heritage the isolated presentation of the story of the negro in america was as incomplete in its own way as the story of america without the negro short of the day when the integrated story would be told two incomplete tales were better than one the average american public school has continued to teach the standard bleached product devitalized at best in its absence of reference to negro achievement and participation in american life poisoned at worst in its falsehoods and distortions concerning the role of the negro in such epochal periods as the abolitionist and the reconstruction eras this is a problem and an evil that has not been sectional moreover during a period when under the pressure of the negro revolution the moral climate has improved somewhat there has been little mitigation of the faults of the past in professor lawrence d reddick wrote for the journal of negro history a study of southern u s history texts among his findings the place and development of the negro in the national life since the granting of freedom and citizenship are ignored almost completely these authors usually depict the negroes as pawns passive instruments in the hands of others during reconstruction in dr lloyd marcus compiled for the antidefamation league a study of the treatment of minorities in texts the achievements of living negro americans are mentioned in very few books american negroes are portrayed for the most part in the eras of slavery and reconstruction what comes through in most books is a stereotype of a simple childlike superstitious people thus what professor reddick saw in the southern school textbooks of the s was found by the bnai briths researchers to be true on a national scale in lacking in the adl evaluation is one critical fact that the reconstruction sambo stereotype is the product of gross falsehood the cumulative result of a libel on a whole people gross falsehood is a strong phrase not lightly used by one trained as an attorney to be careful in the choice of words but it is not my own it is the phrase of professor arnold rose coauthor with gunnar myrdal of an american dilemma as a sociologist whose principal concern has been with the problem he has studied and evaluated most u s history writings in an effort to get at the roots of bigotry and prejudice in our land he focuses his attention on this issue in his essay in the new book that he edited assuring freedom to the free and how does it happen asks professor rose that most white americans believe this gross falsehood it happens because their teachers teach it in the public schools and the teachers learned it at the teachers colleges and the teachers colleges got it from the professors at the great universities the professors got it not out of scholarly researches but out of the postreconstruction apologies for the south written by negrohaters now a gross falsehood is just another way of saying big lie and those of us who are old enough to remember joseph goebbels know that hitlers masterpropagandist preached and practised the doctrine that a falsehood repeated often enough can enslave the minds of men those whites whose image of the negro is derived solely or primarily from what they have learned in school histories are vexed and perplexed today taught all their lives to believe in the stereotypes that were created to justify separation and inequality they find themselves suddenly preached at and told they have been wrong youve got to be taught to hate and fear ran the song in rodgers and hammersteins interracial hit south pacific youve got to be carefully taught should it surprise us to find that some whites resent moving over and making room foror even extending a friendly hand tothose they were taught to hate when an individual is libeledthe victim of a malicious falsehoodthe law requires retraction or compensation or both what is the remedy for decades of libel against a whole people belatedly educators are coming to see said time magazine commenting on the district of columbias new separate supplemental pamphlet for school history classes the negro in american history that it is high time to desegregate the teaching of u s history not only is it high time it is too little and too late french statesman georges clemenceau is supposed to have said that war is much too important to leave to the generals the need for remedying the misteaching of american history is too vital to leave it to the schools and the teachers the educators have failed us they have bequeathed to us three generations of white americans whose many variants of the question why are they pushing so fast betrays their ignorance of their own heritage as much as it does their utter lack of moral sense there are various schools of psychiatry today differing theories as to how mental illness should be treated most agree that the important objective is to cause the patient to develop insight into his character structure something most effectively accomplished by reexamination of ones early life so that one can get at the root of false beliefs about himself the psychiatrist strives to demonstrate the contradiction between the way a situation actually was and the way the patient thought it was between the way the patient was behaving and the way he thought he was behaving the irrational rejection of human beings because of the shade of skincolorphobiain the united states is the greatest case of mass mental illness in the worlds history it cannot be cured by laws alone nor by simply saying that what was right yesterday is wrong today who is there to do this job that the educators have made necessary this is the hardest part of the fight as the negro revolution moved into its decisive phase loren miller correctly pointed out that freedom nowtoday is a slogan that implies rejection of the dogma that racial reforms must await a change in the hearts and minds of men what the militants have missed however is that those hard hearts must be moved and those warped minds cured there is nothing sensational glamorous or exciting about history the ambitious or publicityhungry leader sees no percentage in it they debate in their press releases about the resistance the white backlash the need for new toolsand give little attention to the importance of the freedom writer to consolidate the grains that the freedom rider has achieved what is needed as a weapon to win the negro revolution is an adult education program of unimaginably vast proportions its content should neither be called negro history nor constitute merely that there is a hidden american heritage to be unearthed that can enrich us all few white americans know the magnificent life story of frederick douglass one can return again and again to his writings and find a lesson for today but the culturally deprived american has not been told of wendell phillips either or been given his magnificent insights into the nature of the relationship between capital and labor one perceptive theologian prof a j heschel has likened the phase of the negro revolution to the crossing of the red sea by the israelites there still remained ahead of them the hardships of the wilderness the israelites murmured against moses in the desert and said what shall we drink for there was no water in the same fashion the negro will justly cry out after a civil_rights bill is passed what shall we eat we want adequate education decent housing proper employment there are lessons as to how these problems can be solved in the enriched history that we must all learn the vitamins and minerals that have been removed include not merely the contribution of the negro to our heritage few know the lives and teachings of such great and nearforgotten americans as theodore parker the brook farmers and the other radical reformers of the abolitionist era or john boyle oreilly john peter altgeld and the populists not all of whom became racists of the later nineteenth century the great lesson to be learned is that a war on poverty cannot be waged from the top the poor and the men and women of conscience of the middle class must unite in political action if the causes of poverty are to be removed understanding the past said arthur schlesinger jr can be the key to the future the past is never dead says one of william faulkners characters it is not even past the present condition of the human race is solely a product of its history if that condition is to be changed for the better it can be effectively done only by beginning with a reexamination of that history we must find out what really happened as the psychiatrist says to cure ourselves from the sickness that comes from what we have been deluded into thinking was our past when dr w e b du bois wrote the declaration of independence of the third american revolution the resolutions of the niagara movement of he said the battle we wage is not for ourselves alone but for all true americans some of the white trash of the north who have been revealed in the last few months will never understand this there is some folks said louis armstrong once that if they dont know you cant tell em but most americans can and will come to learn that the negro revolution is their own cause after they have relearned their history and cast aside the myths and stereotypes they learned in school will they understand they are not merely doing something for the negro when they ally themselves with him the battle for justice to the negro in our history is but a part of the battle for justice to the whole truth in our history when that is gained ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make ye free f for balt i m o r e gaines the announ cer intones its the seventh

threatened st louis cardinal player strike against robinson to a st louis cardinal lineup with bill white curt flood and bob gibson taking the field the interesting thing is this negroes of varying abilitiesstars almoststars journeymen and shortlived flops have come in played and hung up the routine flowthrough is under way celebrating the fact that colored athletes have achieved the inalienable right to be ordinary and even mediocre big leaguers twas not always thus hardly years after robinson quite literally changed the complexion of the game a negro ballplayer had to be decidedly better than good if he couldnt make it big and quick not for him the luxury of a fairtomiddlin batting average and a seat on the bench at big league pay whats more he was expected to comport himself at all times and under all provocations as a colored little lord fauntleroy toward the opposition and his majesty the umpire robinson seven years after retirement from the game a poor second in the national most famous jackie sweepstakes bore much of the initial brunt of baseballs social progress a lonely figure swinging around the allwhite circuit at phiadelphia boston new york chicago pittsburgh cincinnati and st louis he would wryly tell friends coming out to the game youll be able to tell me by my number of course they were also able to tell jackie robinson by his electrifying skills with bat glove and flying feet managing to win rookie of the year honors while in the frightful pressure cooker of pioneering must be one of the sports accomplishments of all time two years later he was voted most valuable a tightlipped performer out of agreed necessity at the start by the time he finished he might also have been voted most voluble the real jackie robinson had stood upoutgoing aggressive proud sometimes irritating but rarely dull now three years older than the uniform number he dramatized jackie is portly and quite gray though unmistakably jackie robinson with quickly intense small features nearfalsetto voice and pigeonlike gait many may have already forgotten the characteristic way he went out in a welter of headlines and conjecture after the season he was traded by brooklyn to the giants about par for the course in the business of baseball never exactly noted for unwavering devotion to its stars black or white once their usefulness wanes babe ruth was sluffed off by the yankees to the boston braves ty cobb was sent from tigers to as tris speaker from indians to senators dizzy dean from cards to cubs and so it goes baseball owners are less sentimental than baseball fans and usually wealthier just as new york fans were becoming intrigued by the thought of grizzled old number facing his old team in a crucial game grizzled old number said the hell with it and became a youthful food chain executive more recently and more quietly finished was larry doby first to make it into the other league though somehow rarely thought of as a symbol six years younger than robinson this brooding outfielders career was cut short by leg muscle in juries which are no respecter of stereotypes about special kinds of muscles beneath black skins there were no big articles about dobys decline and fall nothing summing up the kind of athlete the big leagues second negro had been even at his best there often seemed in the press boxes a feeling of disappointment about larry the tendency was to think of him as one who never fully realized an extravagant potential his temperament it was said hurt him unlike robinson he did not have the ready catharsis of giveandtake articulativeness and sometimes carried his real and fancied grievances into the dugout as a private weight yet a glance back at larry dobys record makes it pertinent to wonder if the mixed judgments were not tinged by the now happily disappearing double standard in which a negro was always expected to be exceptional after all here was a youngster who jumped directly from the haphazard negro leagues to cleveland batted over as a key regular on a championship club in his first full season and made the allstar game five times in when cleveland won a record games doby led the league in home runs and runs batted in hit into only seven double plays and was a superlative defensive center fielder for games black or white introvert or extrovert thats a lot of ballplayer robinson and doby these were the first the special ones starting the long overdue process of taking the quotation marks from around americas national pastime partly because of what they went through with so much fortitude lineups included not only the scintillating likes of willie mays elston howard henry aaron tommy davis maury wills orlando cepeda frank robinson willie mccovey juan pizzaro earl battey vada pinson bill white etc etc but the aforementioned choo choo coleman a yankee substitute named hector lopez and journeyman parttimers such as pumpsie green felix mantilla jake wood bob perry and joe gaines not to knock the latter group like ranking the astronauts its all relative nobody in this highly exacting craft who makes it to the big leagues is an oaf with three thumbs but within the high context of the lands best ballplayers the greens and mantillas are brothers in ordinariness to lesser lights in whiter epidermis perhaps the paradox of progress to mediocrity can best be seen in the growingly varied caliber of those who have joined jackie robinson and larry doby as negroes who once were big leaguers george crowe muscularly owlish parttime first baseman and pinch hitter jim pendleton who never quite cut it after a good start ray noble and charley white a couple of commonplace catchers who moved up but couldnt stay there bob boyd smalling stylish fielder who set no worlds afire at bat bob thurman a not quite benchwarmer in fact you name a particular type of ballplayer and by now theres likely to be a negro big leaguer or former big leaguer to fit the description like the highly touted minor league prospect who is too much and cant miss but does pitcher humberto robinson who came to the eager milwaukee braves in from an astounding season with jacksonville where he led the sally league in victories percentage earned run average shutouts strikeouts and what have you the collegiate bonus beauty who fizzles in the big time earl robinson plucked off the university of california campus with a sizeable check by the dodgers they got their investment back by selling him to baltimore where it was discovered the name robinson does not guarantee stardom the what happened to himt type who seems on the edge of greatness and suddenly poofs out pitcher brooks lawrence the eternal wanderergeorge altman and charley neal about to play for their third team in as many seasons the oneyear wonder flopping as a sophjake wood of detroit the nohit pitcher immediately lapsing back into unevennessearl wilson of bos ton the guy they all gave up on and forgot who returns from minor league exile to all star status leon wagner toast of the poor mans los angeles team the angeles or doesnt one call gene autry a poor man now with the cleveland indians the negro pete reisers real good ones kept from probable hall of fame stature by injuryluke easter and monte irvin theres been the classic version of the rubber armed relief ace used up in one or two fantastic seasons and fading to a premature exit the joe page jim konstanty ted wilks type this was joe black brooklyns rookie of the year in when he came out of the bullpen times more than onethird of the games played won and lost saved more and whipped the yankees as a surprise starter in the world series he was never nearly the same thereafter though before anyone shouts how could he be regard the typedefying case of hoyt wilhelm blacks paleface alter ego of when he relieved for the rival giants no less than times though blacks great record hoyt too backslide after this frenetic rookie year and in fact was written off as finished some years ago by the giants but here he is older than the longgone black hurling effectively in the american league at the age of that too is baseball which like life sometimes defies logical explanation all through at was don newcombe a lumbering giant of a pitcher with tight shoulder muscles who appeared to the opposition as an awesome automaton when he loosened into his midsummer groove don won a staggering games for the dodgers one year and was mr big in several successful flag drives but was pretty much yankee meat come october he was the first negro pitcher to make it big though not the first negro pitcher that was dan bankhead who drew brooklyn paychecks for three seasons finished too is little sandy amoros who could never quite fill the historic left field gap on the great dodger clubs the conditionedreflex response to his name is great catch on berra in the series which fixes sandy immutably in fan chatter as the colored a gionfriddo an early parttime dodger left fielder who similarly robbed di maggio theyve just about all been up there by now including the player whose name gets a blank who from fans who dont forget many try luis marquez a nonhitting outfielder who made it into a few seasons with the browns we even have the colored elder statesmanjim gilliam who came up as an eager second base rookie after jackie robinsons job in and is now the sage wisdomdispensing veteran of veterans on the dodgers championship roster not all negro ballplayers can be successfully fitted into general classifications no white parallel comes to mind for the harsh immobilization of the remarkable roy campanella who moved from ebbets field into a wheelchair youd wear yourself out trying to find more than one pitcher who broke into the middle of a hot pennant race as a yearold rookie and turned the tide with a record of six victories and one defeat there are no neat categories for such as the unlikely satchel paige who probably missed being the greatest big league pitcher of all through his mistake of being born twenty years too soon but certainly the casually wide ranging nature of the roster of colored former and present big leaguers seventeen years after jackie robinson suggests there isnt too much of a negro question left on the playing fields of our national pastime for most of the worlds f g people the union of r south africa is noted for two products both rockhard and apparently durable though one product is synonymous with wealth while the other is the embodiment of evil the products are diamonds and apartheidthe one a brilliant jewel the other an ignominious political plot the diamonds provide the countryand much of the western worldwith riches which in the way of that world justify whatever else is done to make the riches possible and apartheidwhich means simply racial discrimination on a grandiose scaleprovides the white rulers of the country with the endless supply of cheap black labor needed to dig the diamonds from the earth in recent years however parts of europe africa and the united states have been exposed to still another product from south africa a woman with a talent as firm and dazzling as a diamond and invested with all the bittersweet soulfulness bred by the struggle against apartheids dehumanizing forces she is zensi miriam makeba and her brilliance is a match for any diamond since her arrival in the united states in miss makeba has appeared on numerous television shows toured the country in a series of concertswith harry belafonte and aloneand entertained in a range of night clubs from the cozy village vanguard in new york to the plush san souci in las vegas there was nothing quite like her then and there is nothing to equal her now she is absolutely unique as all great performers must be and yet paradoxically there is nothing unusual about her consider she is small of staturepetite reallywith large expressive eyes a crown of short unstraightened hair and a pleasant but unpretty face her voice is soft and low altogether feminine but also otherwise unremarkable one has the impression thatin a crowded roomshe might slip unobtrusively into the background and that the other people in the room might leave her there she seems that shy and retiring and that deserving of respect but once she takes the spotlight she is transformed she seems to literally grow in size the dark eyes flash with fire and the voice flows out all honey and steel and crystal following miss makebas opening at new yorks blue angel a few seasons back time magazines hardbitten critic was disarmed the closecropped woolly head and the sleek white fifth avenue gown come from different worlds but the combination has a charm and a grace of its own he wrote in a ballad she maintains the clean classic phrasing of a church singer she can be roguish in a west indian ditty about a naughty flea and she can make a chilling lament of a warriors retreat song indeed she is a magician with moods within moments she can set her audience laughing leave them awed into silence or bring them close to tears audiences are particularly delighted with her click song a tonguetripping number in which she employs the incredible soundswithinsounds which her people the xhosa pronounced khosa consider routine click song is really qonqgonthwane but it seems few people other than the xhosa can do it justice zensi miriam makeba was born march in prospect township one of the allblack settlements surrounding johannesburg her father was a schoolteacher and her mother worked as housemaid a job young miriam also later took she attended the kilmerton training institute in pretoria for eight years but dropped out and went to work with her mother when tuition could no longer be paid although she had been singing at school church and at weddings funerals and benefits for years it was not until she was that miss makeba was invited to join an established group of singers the black manhattan brothers she was the lone girl with men the group toured the rhodesias and the congo as well as south africa but it was mostly rough going the bus often broke down she recalled and after the first five months i was crying all the time but they kept telling me the show must go on we always managed to get there on time her reputation grew however and she was soon making records and appearing in revues then she was cast as the female lead in the musical king kong based on the life of a local prizefighter and she was on her way the musical did not have easy sledding for it was opposed by racists and banned in some cities still it managed to play in south africa for eight months it was the first time a production written by an african had ever experienced such success and london was interested for months miss makeba had longed to go to london thinking that in england she might earn real money and perhaps achieve the fame routinely denied black entertainers in south africa she had applied for a passport and after nearly two years had received it during the run of king kong american producer lionel rogosin had spotted miss makeba and he offered her a singing role in a movie he was shooting surreptitiously the was movie entered back africa venice come in the film festival and on the strength of her performance in it miss makeba was invited to venice she was permitted to leave south africa meanwhile rogosin screened his film for steve allen who offered to feature show and miss makeba on his nightclub owner max gordon was persuaded to book her except for flights back to england and africa kenya and tanganyika not south africa she has not been home since but south africa remains home her beloved country makeba confesses thatand miss someday there she wants to go home again not now because as she says down if you arent white you may be a star but youre still a nothing and miriam makeba is certainly something a new era in race rej lations ushered in at birmingham by a peo pies revolution demands that a major national effort be made to prepare the negro masses to use the rights being won for them such a program is urgently needed because attainment of civil_rights will not secure equality for negroes a program of preparation must go handinhand with desegregation efforts if the problem of secondclass citizenship is to be solved once and for all a negro alliance for progress could be the answer until recently most southern whites have pretended to believe that negroes were satisfied in their status and the majority of other white americans have been either apathetic or indifferent to the negroes plight recent events and incidents have caught the whites ill preparedwith no plan to direct the coming changes toward equality of status for the most part negroes have been engaged in assaulting the crumbling walls legal and other forms of segregation and discrimination keeping their gaze fixed on the operations or giving moral and financial aid to the cause but organizations devoted to the moral cultural and intellectual standards have been sadly neglected now through direct action negro leaders have succeeded in getting the whites to listen they must seize the opportunity to prove that they are not only striving to change a social order that excludes onetenth of its citizens but to construct a better order which encompasses freedom and justice for all negro community leaders should begin at once to organize socialwelfare programs in every negro community in the nation to help the disadvantaged masses all along the linein every department of public life the problem is of great magnitude but leaders must perceive the need and face up to the task now inasmuch as negroes have been subjected to an inferior status for hundreds of years the federal state and local governments should assist them in bridging the gap into normal american society because of the tremendous breadth and scope of the problem and the need of national direction the federal government should set up a negro alliance for progress it should train people as if to serve in the peace corps the trainees should be prepared to go into the city ghettos and slums of the nations cities to work at the grass roots of the gigantic problem they should help negro leaders perfect community organizations the object of which would be to give the negro masses purpose motivation and incentive to better their lot community chapters of a negro alliance for progress should be widely based to form its official family negro leaders must reach out into the communities for representation from as many institutions and organizations as possible a negro alliance for progress organization must operate in a community center its finances must come mainly from participating organizations and from private donations but the federal government should contribute to the maintenance of the staff especially the experts coordinators to help in the overall operation the work of the organization should be carried on through a number of departments and committees there should be an executive officer in each community organization the alliance would have such departments as education civic affairs family life child care and recreation all workers would give volunteer service its professional help would be drawn from teachers social workers college students and retired people since education is the surest way out of the slums special stress must be put upon this phase of the alliance basic instruction should be given in reading arithmetic and english for those who cannot profit by attending the established adult education schools operated by city school boards training of this kind is urgently needed by unemployed undereducated adults and young people many of whom are school dropouts such training will prepare them to acquire the skills needed to compete in the job market in this connection the alliance can give the individuals counseling and guidance about the type of training they need to secure technological employment and about the places to get such training counselors should also make a determined effort to get dropouts to return to school an alliance could promote trips for youth to cultural centers of interest and familynights at the center workshops and discussion groups on housing employment and education should be sponsored there should be a concerted effort through committee work and clubs to combat a feeling of helplessness futility and resignation that pervades the negro slum and ghetto communities especially in the nations big cities efforts must also be made to build a spirit of pride and high personal standards of honesty integrity and responsibility in view of the fact that voting apathy exists to great extents in negro communities a feature would be to build up in the masses the incentive to vote voterregistration drives would not be the answer the negro masses must be imbued with the knowledge that voting is not only a part of their civic responsibility but it is for their own selfinterest as well the alliance should sponsor a cooperative child care center staffed by volunteers the services of many ablebodied women whose only reason for not working is caring for one or more minor children should be utilized as there are many homes in the negro community where boys in particular who need a father are growing up without one the alliance could sponsor a big brother guidance program in which men of good community standing would take the responsibility of guiding a boy that is offer him an adult male to learn from the negros social problems are mostly lack of adjustment to city lifethe demands of a cold impersonal environment according to the census per cent of the negro population live in cities ninety per cent of the nearly million negroes living outside the south live in cities especially in the big industrial cities of the north and west an important function of the alliance would be to help them alleviate the conditions of a harsh environmentrestore their selfrespect and confidenceby helping families as well as individuals to become oriented and assimilated into the community for example the writer has personal knowledge of a family of eight who moved to a neighboring city from the rural south last year this man and wife whom i shall call james and mary smith not only found some of the problems they had hoped to leave behind but new and more complex ones for three months they were obligated to live with relatives in an already overcrowded tenement apartment at the end of that period james smith who has only a fourth grade education found work as a laborer with a construction company he immediately moved into a fourroom substandard apartment of his own in the same slum area the four school age childrenjames jr sarah frances and annie attended the overcrowded ghetto schools after two months james sr was laid off from work the family is now on welfare aid a community alliance organization could bring this family into its selfhelp program by getting the father to take its basic training it would prepare him for a jobtraining program which would enhance his chances to get skilled or semiskilled employment in the meantime the alliance could also assist him in finding a job which he could perform thereby getting the family off relief it could give the family assistance in getting more adequate housing the wife mary through the homemaking classes of the alliance would be helped to become a better and more economic manager of her household as she has finished elementary school she could give assistance at the childcare center there she would be taught how to handle groups of children and how the program is maintained in this family which serves here as a demonstration of many the local alliance could give yearold james jr the additional counselling which he so badly needs he has been sent home twice from school for misbehavior and is becoming a problem both to his school and family he could through the alliance be found an afterschool job which would assure him that he is a needed and useful person the lack of such assurance is the cause of much of the delinquency among negro youth he could be brought into the recreation program of the alliance through membership in a youth club of his age group and the alliance could provide sponsors to get the three schoolage girls into youth clubs this family has not joined any church an alliance sponsoring them would provide a welcome for them into a church of their choice if the family has no choice the family sponsor could introduce them to representative members of community churches in this manner they could be helped to become a churchgoing family with new ideals and aspirations it could through the family sponsor get the father and mother each to join an alliance committee and to participate in other community activities in this manner all families such as this one in need of assistance would be helped to solve their problems there are to be sure some very successful programs being conducted in a number of cities for underprivileged youth the majority of whom are negroes these programsnew yorks new horizon the phoenix arizona career clubs the banker district in st louis the hunters point training project in san francisco and those in some other citiesaffect only a minute fraction of negroes who are in dire need of special help they do not even touch the lives of hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged and restless negroes trapped in the slums of u s cities automation is upon us negroes who are below average in education and training are going to find it increasingly harder to meet the requirements of tomorrows job market there must be a massive allout effort made to prepare these underprivileged masses to take advantage of present and future opportunities the proposed negro alliance for progress would not be a duplication of government programs designed to assist negroes most negroes must get training of one kind or other before they can take advantage of the manpower training program the alliance could conceivably come under the national service program called for by the president and now before congress in any event besides providing an opportunity for the masses to prepare to enter the mainstream of society the alliances committees could gather valuable data for federal state and local governments the information could then be used to determine what kind of aid should be provided to maintain an effective program while a negro alliance for progress to be persuasive should be in the main selfhelp community programs with federal help and direction there are many ways in which state and local governments can assist they can provide facilities subsidies vocational training and help with juvenile delinquency programs to mention a few to operate the proposed alliance will entail cost but it will be a paying proposition which would more than compensate for expenditures made in reduction of welfare checks unemployment compensation and juvenile delinquency moreover preparing negroes to take their places along beside other americans in the producers and consumers market would expedite a change for the betterall along the linenot only in the cities but in the whole nation in all probability there will be opposition in some quarters to any such program as the alliance calls for it will no doubt be attacked as a proposition to give negroes special treatment if this is the connotation negroes have been getting special secondclass treatment for years to the tune of billions and to the detriment of the nation and all concerned the cost to help the negro bridge the gap between his subculture and the main american culture will be a small fraction of what it is costing to keep him in his secondclass status negro leaders should however ponder the statements made by professor james q wilson of harvard in his book negro politics negroes he says are the object rather than the subject of civic action things are often done for about or to or because of negroes but they are less frequently done by them there is a paucity of leadership among the cultured and materially privileged negroes some even disdain the masses with the apparent attitude of why should i worry i have it made these privileged people should be reminded the more privilege one has the greater his responsibility and the spirit of the time and the revolution is group elevation not individual advancement if the negro would be free he must invest in his own future negro leaders must devote more time and attention in reaching the hearts and minds of the masses and the local communities are the places to begin by addressing themselves to this aspect of the problem leaders will be giving impetus to its resolution the achievement of which history may well record as the greatest social accomplishment in this century although it is the negro leaders imperative duty to take the initiative through community programs to prepare the masses for assimilation into the nations social fabric it is not their duty alone white community leaders must also assume their responsibility and cooperate to resolve the problem for it is not just the attitude in the negro community that must be changed the attitude of the whole community must be changed this is societys problem a united community is the need it is the duty of all white community leaders to work to change the attitude of their own raceconvince them that social political and economic equality are the rights of all americans that the resolution of the problem means complete equality finally the hour has arrived for all americans to make a judgment not only is the negro cause an understandably just one american democracy is on trial before the world and the wave of the future is freedom for our own security and that of the free world the problem of equal status for the negro must be solved we dare not do less portrait of a child first saw letty when irr i observed some classi es for blind children in the public schools as a college assignment letty was a blind negro child of a twin and the twin brother was blind too letty was large for her age and appeared to be a teenager there was no father in the home and the family was on relief letty had just resumed talking after two years of silence by being blind she had been able to start school at years of age but she had stopped talking when she was she continued to attend school during her silent two years following directions and doing the assigned school work but would not answer questions or talk to anyone at home or at school neither the school psychologist nor a private one were ever able to determine why she stopped talking and just as suddenly resumed talking again before letty stopped talking the mother sent her to school neatly dressed but after the speechless period no one in the home evidenced any concern with her appearancethe most rudimental phases of grooming being neglected when she again talked the speech was different too it was so guttural and southern or dialect that it sounded stereotypic during recess some of the sighted children liked to surround letty and get her to talk as they found it game and funny she enjoyed being the center of attention and declaring to her young audience that she wanted to be a preacher she would praise god and quote the scriptures at length if a teacher was near such actions were at once interrupted and the child was encouraged to just walk around the school yard if she didnt want to play the first saturday that i did volunteer work at the recreation center there were handicapped children busily and noisily taking part in a variety of supervised games and activities i was surprised to see letty and her twin brother as they were the only negro children in the group together with other volunteers and a staff person i was assigned to accompany a group of youngsters to the childrens playground in golden gate park we were to be the guests at a picnic lunch there as we were the largest group taking an outside trip this saturday we were able to use the volkswagen bus for transportation in our party were two children confined to their wheel chairs and blind children including letty on arrival at the park we found ourselves the project and guests of a rainbow girls chapter they and two of their mothers were holding tables for us in the picnic grounds near the merrygoround the drab wooden tables had been made festive with colorful paper tablecloths napkins and paper decorated with a circus motif there was even a large sheet cake topped with a candy merrygoround in the center there seemed to be an unlimited supply of sugar cookies all kinds of decorated cup cakes iced soft drinks and a huge container of frosty punch the children had brought lunch bags from home and upon being seated letty hunched over the table and tore open her lunch bag with her face buried in the folds of the bag she wolfed down the meagre unbuttered meat sandwich a wizened green apple and an unwrapped candy bar when she finished before many had barely started she wiped her nose and mouth with her coat sleeve when a napkin was again placed in her hand it was used vigorously as a handkerchief and dropped on the lawn in the small silence that followed a rainbow girl set a plate of cookies in front of her and placed a cup of punch in her hand the cookies being greedily and hastily eaten were replaced with others the staff person having postponed her lunch to help with the needs of the children stood up and announced loudly the rainbow girls are treating us all to rides on the merrygoround i have tickets for everyone lets you and i go first letty nah letty answered ah just want to stay here and have a conversation and eat was implied as she was hungrily and thirstily gulping a bottle of pop the staff person then asked me to take two of the blind boys over to the slides that is their favorite spot and they can almost be on their own there just watch that they wait their turn in line they are so eager they sometimes push ahead of other children and fights start they dont want the other children to know they are blind and resent overt help before she finished talking the two were off tuning and found the slides with no guidance from me when my small charges and i came back from innumerable rides on the merrygoround as well as the slides it was time to clean up and leave letty appeared not to have moved all afternoon and was still wearing her heavy coat she was eating a large slice of the sheet cake the rainbow mothers had already packed up their picnic things and were sitting on either side of letty quietly listening and talking with her and occasionally patting her on the shoulder as if in encouragement of her talking as the rest of the children and volunteers gathered there was a final cup of punch for everyone it took us a halfhour to get startedsome final rides on the merrygoround to use up all the tickets trips to the rest rooms folding and rearranging the wheelchairs so no one was too uncomfortable and then finding an empty lap for a small pair of crutches while one of the volunteers held the child when we reached the center the children tumbled out of the volks wagen and those who could hurried into the building as if following some previously outlined plans as we tied the straps of the wheelchair bound children above the hubbub i heard lettys deep voice demanding where is mah record and mah chair i told ya not to move them as the children wheeled themselves through the doorway i followed the sound of lettys plaintive wrangling voice i found her in a room that i hadnt entered before it was easily the most spacious and lightfilled room in the building and it had been planned to take advantage of the splendid view of the ocean across the highway the ocean waves were frothing against the beach and it seemed odd to see them so near and not hear the surf as there was even salt spray on the huge picture window that extended the length of the room here is your record on the machine and your chair letty a volunteer stated letty drew her chair up as close as she could to the juke box and the room was suddenly filled to the overwhelming with the sound of ray charles singing you dont know me letty started rhythmically rocking back and forth back and forth in perfect time with the music she was completely relaxed and lost in her thoughts and her face was ecstatic after the record had played over and over her twin tried to push another button on the juke machine but letty vigorously pushed him awaynot once ceasing her continuous rocking movements it seemed by unspoken agreement that the machine was lettys province as none of the other children ventured near it had been a chilly and gray day but now the sun was splintering the heavy purple clouds clustered above the ocean and there would be a warm orange sunset on the horizon i heard my name called as the children were being assigned to cars to take them home some of the parents were arriving to pick up their children and others were being driven home by volunteers just now arriving although we only had three youngsters in our car we were the first scheduled to leave as we had the farthest to go above all the commotion at the crowded exit the clank of braces refolding and storing wheel chairs last minute typed directions being distributed and the childrens now tired and querulous voiceslettys blaring record dominated the air as we drove away i wondered who was calling for her but letty will be alright i thought she possesses the true dignity of childhood she is undefeated the negros stake in africa the american society ra of african culture was j i f founded upon the assumption that there exists a core of common experience a skein of common values and a common identification which unite men of culture of african descent there is no implication in this assumption that there do not exist other areas of experience other sets of values and other feelings of identification which bind the feelings of people who are of african descent to those who like them are also americans to those of similar occupations or similar status or to those who share similar taste in music or literature or even a similar interest in africa indeed i doubt that there is a member of this society who is not also a member of one or more organizations composed of people of varied ancestral origin founders and members of amsac are not believers in the mystique of race or blood nor do they believe in ethnic or racial exclusiveness they simply face the fact that a common fate involving certain historic disabilities has generated certain common problems and common responses to those problems all of which have led to a universe of discourse to use a somewhat sociological phrase popular in the s among peoples of african descent so they have joined together to carry on the dialogue among themselves and others talk always leads to action and that is why we are all here tonight of course not all people of african descent care to face these facts or to give a reaction to these tacts those of us who have wanted to face these facts have attempted through this organization to give institutional expression to what we feel are common values common experiences and a common universe of discourse with those who do not care to face these facts and give them institutional expression we have no quarrel but also for our own action we make no apology in a country where polish people make their identification as polishamericans some jews as jewishamericans and some italians as italianamericans there should be neither surprise nor fear at finding those who make an iden tification as lroamericans there is nothing more american than this pluralistic conception of american identity the only time that anyone really feels that hyphenation is a threat to national unity or national welfare is in time of war and i hope we are not going to have a war with the new emerging africa i shall return to this problem of identification again before i conclude my remarks but at this moment i should like to comment briefly upon the origins of this society because this is one phase of the question of whether panafricanism is a myth or a reality amsac came into being because there was a society of african culture that is there is an american society of african culture because there is a society of african culture without the word american in front the society of african culture came into being in france in but its origins are to be found in a remarkable group of french negro intellectuals which came together in paris after the second world war the core was a group of west africans but from the outset the group included haitians malagasies and other individuals of africa south of the sahara one american negro richard wright was a member of this group among its patrons were some of frances most distinguished social scientists and men of letters whenever two or three intellectuals are gathered together they always think of a magazine or journal this group was no exception and presence ajricaine was born in from the outset the pages of this magazine were open to contributions from men of all races some of its best contributions have come from men like jean paul sartre and andre gide and albert camus who are not men of african descent but whose insights were welcome in the journal by men of culture of african descent this being the rather elegant french phrase used for persons of the rather elegant society men of culture of african descent but also from the outset it was concerned with what aime cesaire and leopold senghor had dubbed negritude that perhaps indefinable and intangible something which the folk as well as the intellectuals in africa and negroes in the west indies were thought to have in common and what was this negritude every time i mention the word negritude i begin to hear duke ellingtons in my solitude in my mind and think that somebody should set to music in my negritude but what is this negritude first a passion for similar types of music dance and graphic and plastic art forms which exist in what i call the panafrican aggregate second a soft and resilient rather than a hard and mechanical approach to life third a deep resentment whether expressed or unexpressed over subordination to white people during the four hundred years of slave trade and the subsequent structuring of caste relations here and in africa this was the reaction which sartre in his essay black orpheus calls antiracist racism and to which cesaire once gave a marxist interpretation antiracist racism was not viewed as an evil thing but as a quest for dignity a yearning for respect and an assertion of worth it was viewed dialectically as having been brought into view by its opposite which is aggressive exploitative racism and the whole concept of negritude assumes in its dialectic that antiracist racism is destined to disappear in some higher synthesis the american term integration sometimes implies this remote future in short negritude was thought of by this group as something to be proud of not something to be ashamed of about five years ago a group of americans of african descent were invited to join in the dialogue to come to paris for confrontation to see if they too had negritude there was never any doubt in the minds of the french intellectuals that the americans had it one african poet senghor had written of the softening effect he thought the negroes had had on new york he thought that harlem had put the hard oil on the mechanical life of new york and all of them had caught the tones in american jazz in countee cullen in langston hughes in alain locke and w e b dubois and in the folk and traditional and artistic productions with which they were acquainted by the time the confrontation was over amsac was born it was not a painless birth the recognition of the reality of the existence of negritude among afroamericans as well as francoafricans did not mean that the two groups saw eye to eye on every issue this is one of the major points that i would like to make the feeling of a common identity does not necessarily mean that those involved always get along or always agree on everything i think that within the framework of this international operation this fact has been rather obvious nobody has tried to conceal it if you will look at the introduction to africa seen by american negroes you will see a note there by the french editor who says that there were some members of the presence africaine group who werent quite in favor of dealing so closely with the american negroes not because they didnt feel an identity but because they felt the americans were agents of imperialism this must have been one of the extreme marxist fringes of sac we have no extreme marxist fringes the society of african culture in paris which had such fringes had to make a decision and as a result the fringe group was slapped down this volume came out and there was a strong statement that we do accept the idea that american negroes as well as haitians west indians and others form a part of this group so although there may be disagreement on details and even on issues in this broad fraternity they are not serious they are disagreements within a framework of agreement the continuing association between amsac and sac is itself a testimony to the reality of the ties however much some people may try to talk those ties away or to brainwash them out of the minds of american negroes some of these people well mention later it is interesting to note that the first institutionalization of ties between the scattered bearers of negritude was at the level of an interest in art literature philosophy and other cultural realms it is perhaps significant that this was where the first cementing of ties was madeon the level of high culturenot on the level of politics or on the level of interpersonal relations i think we ought to bear in mind that relations between africans and afroamericans occur on these three levels political cultural and interpersonal these three ought to be kept separate in our discussions they may not be of equai weignt or value at any given moment while the african intellectuals in the french tradition were empnasizing culture other men of african descent were seeking to find unity around a framework of political action we must first examine this group briefly just as we might call the sac and amsac develop ment cultural panafricanism so might we refer to the other phenomenon as political panafricanism these of course are not watertight compartments but they help us to channel the flow of history for our purpose this evening dr w e b dubois is often referred to as the father of panafricanism and in recent years has received honors in africa as such all of us know of his four attempts to convene effective panafrican conferences between the first world war and the depression his work illustrates my meaning when i say that these are not watertight compartments dubois is most often thought of as having given expression to political panafricanism i attended a dinner given for dr dubois at the academy of learning in ghana a few months ago he was honored as the father of panafricanism i was rather surprised that the chief justice of ghana sir arku korsak in introducing dr dubois said that he was not interested in dr dubois political significance my first awakening to the meaning of africa and to our own potential dignity he said came when i was a student at sierra leone and we all read regularly the column as the crow flies which was published in crisis magazine in the s now nobody on this side thought that the future chief justice of ghana in a small cottage in sierra leone was reading dr dubois column but this was the first thing that he said in his intro duction so here was the cultural side of panafricanism at work not wellknown is the fact that the first conference with the name panafrican was really convened in london in by a west indian lawyer named sylvester williams the tradition has now become set so we come to think of the conference set up by dr dubois as the first one new world negroes took the initiative in trying to mobilize negro intellectuals in the fight against two things colonial oppression in africa and discrimination against negroes and other people of color wherever it existed but they had no mass base and the time was not ripe for effective action these were the pioneers american negro intellectuals on the whole have failed to treat seriously the most powerful segment of the panafrican movement prior to world war ii i refer to marcus garveys universal negro improvement association and the african communities leagues i think any objective person looking at the world of negro intellectuals would ask why the biography about garvey wasnt written by a negro black moses was written by a white man i think the flamboyance of marcus garveys insistence on one god one aim one destiny and that you should have a black god and black angels and a black jesus christall of this has been a rather painful episode in american negro history for negro intellectuals who tend to wince a bit at it and believe that garvey was a bit of a buffoon we may be ashamed of garveys black masses walking down the streets of harlem with their plumes but some of the african leaders are not they tend to link the names of garvey and dubois as parts of the same historic stream one of the most vivid memories i bring home from ghana was the convening of the all african peoples conference in december leaders from all over africa were there and at the last session dr nkrumah began his speech by saying we are so glad to see so many of our friends from the new world here with us i think i am quoting him precisely before we were conscious of our own degradation it was they who raised the banner of african liberation in the new world i want to mention especially marcus garvey and dubois this was before the assembled group of agitators who were going out to liberate africa and the statement was made by nkrumah and he named these two people equally significant i suppose is the fact that the first ghana steamship line was called the black star line garveys ships never got across but ghanas ships do manage to get around i am sure that marcus garvey would be turning over in his grave one of his weaknesses was his antisemitism and the first black star line was a joint operation of the zim navi gation company of israel and ghana but we often forget the weaker side of our panafrican symbols in the same way that this happens in other parts of the world i am watching the process by which the emphasis is being put on dr dubois as father of panafricanism with an attempt to say well we dont buy his devotion for the soviet union and eventually that will be forgotten as a part of the tradition assuming that africa does not fall into that orbit in looking back at these two predepression movements garveys and dubois i think we cannot understand the emergence of either of them unless we face the fact that there was a basis among the masses in america the west indies and africa that made both of them possible there would have been no panafrican movement led by dubois there would have been no marcus garvey movement had there been no apperceptive mass which nourished and sustained them there was an identification with africa as a land of ancestral origins which was already there despite all the stereotypes and distortions and all the existing unpleasant realities of contemporary africa and that apperceptive mass is still there i grew up among rather ordinary and common folk who exalted the glories of ethiopia in the past who talked constantly of egypt as being our country which started civilization and who believed that someday princes would come out of ethiopia and it would stretch forth its hands unto god most american negroes probably grew up putting pennies into the church basket which were supposed to go out to some missionary in africa we dont forget that the early denomination included the african methodist episcopal church and similarly named churches this is evidence of a kind of identification one of the early negro organizations were known as the african society i have a theory that the word african began to drop out after the american colonization society was started in the hope of getting negroes forcibly or persuasively back to africa at this point it was probably safer just to drop the word african and use colored if you talk too much about being an african maybe someone will ask you why you dont go back there the point that i have been trying to make is that there was a time when there was an acceptance of the idea of african origins and at the mass level it persisted through the years nobody has ever dealt adequately with the sentiments in africa with regard to the american negro in doing research on panafricanism last summer i found that when the congress of british west africa was started by the famous casley hayford to unite the colonies of british west africa he mentioned in the inaugural speech that on the other side our people have formed an organization called the unia and they have some ships and will probably be coming over here to the gold coast soon we ought to get prepared for them he said he was for strict constitutional action and he said that they may not know how we run things over here and we have got to teach them how to be constitutional here was a serious acceptance of what was supposedly going on on the other side and of the idea that one ought to get ready to welcome garveys ships which never got there the depression years were years when racial solidarity was either subdued or assimilated in the international communist movement all of us remember the concept of the black belt republic and the expression of negro protest in marxist idiom but we must not forget that this was also a period when the comintern made strenuous efforts to mobilize the black masses in africa and also made its worst blunders during the first four years of the thirties perhaps the most energetic person involved in this attempt to get africans into the communist movement was a man from trinidad who had already joined the movement i refer to george padmore who ran the negro worker and was supposed to be lining up africans for the cause of the soviet union some english friends still think that george padmore was a communist influence on dr nkrumah although padmore broke with the communist movement in this break was a very important one because having broken with the communist movement but also having learned a lot while he was in it padmore and a group of west indians began in london to organize the socalled panafrican federation and between and they kept up much agitation around hyde park in london in about nkrumah arrived in london knowing no one and he met george padmore in nkrumah padmore and others convened the fifth panafrican conference they had dr dubois come over as a symbol of panafricanism the movement was for the first time beginning to receive mass support because these were africans mapping out their own destiny this is considered a turning point in the african liberation movement when decisions had been made at the conference the men decided to return home to their native lands with the idea that the first of them to liberate his own country would call the sixth panafrican conference this was taken as a vow between the men as soon as the conference was ended george padmore went to ghana to serve as the adviser on african affairs others of that conference also went back to ghana because they felt that they should all work from that base in december of it was nkrumah who called the sixth panafrican conference under the title of the all african peoples conference dr dubois was unable to attend but his wife was there to read his speech which advised the nations to look to the east and to reject the west little attention was given to this advice however it was agreed that regardless of his political position dubois was still the symbol of panafricanism all of the nine independent states of africa attended that conference and the nature of that conference has great bearing on our central topic panafricanism myth or reality it is a reality in terms of the limited aims which it set for itself the conference first popularized the term african personality differing from negritude african personality was an interesting concept in the first place padmores definition of what is an african becomes anyone is an african regardless of race creed or color if he acts right that is if he believes in one man one vote and in economic political and social equality one of the other slogans at the conference was the sahara no longer divides us it unites us half of the delegates were not black africans they were from libya tunisia morocco and egypt padmores version of the african personality meant that on the political scene we will stick together on all issues involving africa the african nations have set up at the united nations a working arrangement with a rotating chairmanship and regular caucuses until the time of the congo crisis i dont think there was any crucial issue involving africa over which the group split this was the african personality demonstrated through a show of the political presence of africa i consider this a very important turning point because now there develops a new definition of panafricanismwhat i call residential panafricanism not racial panafricanism this begins to pose problems for those who were panafricans what weight shall you give to the uniting of black people in the west indies africa and america as compared with the uniting of all people on the continent of africa panafricanism now has two sides to it one is that all negroes must stick together the other is that all africans must stick together whether they are negroes or not now i dont think the older people have at all rejected the first aspect one of the most moving scenes that i have ever witnessed was the funeral of george padmore when the funeral oration was delivered by dr nkrumah some of the tribalists in the area said that they didnt want a strangers ashes put in sacred land this made dr nkrumah fighting mad and he said in his oration that this man had to me that indescribable relationship which exists only between brothers from this very spot his ancestors may have been carried off across the ocean while their kinsmen stood by weeping we have brought his ashes home and put them to rest where they belong this was the old panafricanism when there was great emotional stress on west indian african and american negro solidarity but i think that the new concept is becoming the dominant one and as it becomes the dominant one we must reconsider what part the old one will have what is the role of the west indian and american negro auxiliaries if one may call them that in the political phase of the african struggle i would say that until the congo crisis the racial concept of panafricanism had reality as you know with the emergence of the new african states africa has become divided into three really big blocks the casablanca five ghana guinea mali egypt and morocco which consider themselves militant neutralist and which supported lumumba a rather conservative group and a group that floats in between we have to realize in structuring our relationships with africa today that all africans no longer think alike once independence comes there will be ideological groupings and that same complication which attends our relationships in the united nations it seems to me that in our country there is a certain fear about the identification of negroes with africans a fear among both negroes and whites yet this is a time for sober analysis now that this whole matterwhether or not racial panafricanism should still be preservedis open to question the whole problem of how to relate ourselves to the new kind of residential panafricanism is here our task has not been made easier by the publication of a couple of articles which i think have tended to confuse not only american negroes but the general public about this particular problem there is fear in america about negroes intense interest in africa and i think these articles have tended to increase the fear and uncertainty in africa what they call the equivalent of this is the propaganda for balkanization or for dividing and conquering to use a cliche from agitators i might state that do not think it was accidental that these articles appeared at the specific time that they did i refer to the article in the new yorker may by harold isaacs and the one in the reporter june by russell b howe the feeling for a need for such articles was in the air in certain circles there was almost a kind of inevitability about the appearance of these articles if the american journalistscholar and the english journalist had not written them i have no doubt at all that someone else would have written them i speak with such assurance on this particular subject because of a personal experience about a week after the eruption of the american negroes in the united nations during stevensons speech i received a long distance phone call from new york it was from an editor of the reporter who asked since i was just back from africa if i would do an article for the magazine he claimed that there is great concern in many quarters over the way in which american negroes are tending to identify with africans and that an article of some sort should show the american negroes once and for all that these africans dont care anything at all about them and that there is really no kind of tie between them i asked him who had told him to come to me and he mentioned a couple of american negro leaders who had said that things are getting out of hand that some american negro ought to write an article o get this thing straightened out and that the american negros identification is with america and not with africa i begged off on the truthful grounds that i was very busy and that an article of this sort required a kind of study that i did not have the time to give to it i cannot say whether messrs isaacs and howe received similar invitations i will admit however that my paranoiac suspicions were aroused when i read these words in the fourth paragraph in isaacs article the outburst of some negroes in the gallery of the united nations security council in new york during the lumumba demonstration in february at least served to make more people aware that american negroes are experiencing their own kind of confusion over the events in emergent africa it is a peculiar and painful confusion cutting to the core of what negroes think about themselves and about their place in american society and in the world everything is changing in their universe those winds blow not only across africa forcing upon them all kinds of new conceptions and selfconceptions and among these are new ideas and emotions about africa itself the hitherto remote and rejected ancestral homeland the gallery demonstrators were merely an extremist handful but at some point these new stirrings touch all kinds of people in every part of the american negro community as i said my paranoiac suspicions were aroused only one of these articles the new yorker piece merits any serious discussion for it was written by a seriousminded exjournalist now attached to an international relations research program at a large and influential academic research institution he is also a man whose devotion to the cause of social justice and civil_rights is beyond dispute i treat his article seriously as to the other gentleman mr howe i only hope that those in positions of power and influence in america will be as skeptical as i am contemptuous about anything that he has to say on this issue the writer in question is a young man who has traveled widely in america and africa he is witty and to some peoples taste charming but quite unable to evaluate facts and weigh them he was declared persona non grata in ghana for repeatedly publishing unverified news as fact at the all african peoples conference in tunis where he represented the sunday times he published an article stating that mboya had said he would never give an invitation to george padmore to come to a conference because he didnt believe in outside negroes interfering in african affairs i interviewed mr mboya the following summer in kenya and he stated that he had never said anything of the sort whether he did or not i dont know but at least this is the kind of mischiefmaking that makes i think howes articles suspect he then went over to the neighboring state of togoland and became a speech writer for mr olympio because he was feeling vindictive about ghana and if anyone wants to check up on what i call very bad reporting read mr howes book black star rising over africa you will find more errors per page than in any other similar book some of the errors fall on the side of what i call claimtheworld american negro history this is simply an unreliable person but one who can do a great deal of harm isaacs for instance stated in his article that he thought the liberians and dr nkrumah didnt want to accept a negro ambassador howe said that nkrumah told him on independence day that he didnt want a negro ambassador then mr howe goes further and says that it will be doing a disservice to the negro to africa and to the united states to send any negroes to africa it would be a disservice to all three he then suggests that we should be guided by the experience of all the missions in africa which never used negro missionaries supposedly because they knew africans didnt respect negroes and therefore could not be converted by negro missionaries now this is the kind of thing we are confronting today i said that i was going to treat mr isaacs article seriously and i will try to do so within a few minutes this article has not only set off widespread discussion among all american negroes who are intelligently concerned with africa but is also being used i am told by those in washington opposed to having negroes in diplomatic posts it is being used to bolster the argument that negroes are a liability in diplomatic circles i read and reread the article weighing the facts cited and opinions expressed trying to catch the nuances and trying to imagine its impact on various groups of people here in america and in africa my own conclusion about the article is that i dont think that it had the intent that howes did but it probably has had the same effect and i am hoping that the author will do a back to africa part ii and make it very clear that he repudiates russell howes position and that he doesnt like the use to which his article is being put what else would i have to say about the isaacs article one is that i feel that so perceptive an observer and so diligent an interviewer as harold isaacs should not have missed the point in so many places and misunderstood the nuances in so many situations it may have come partly just from his not having stayed around long enough for those interviews in africa if anyone interviewed me in ghana at midday he would get quite a different reaction to africa than he would at in the morning because by midday would be hot and tired therefore it seems to me that this matter needs a much more prolonged and deep analysis than was given to it just one other small matter isaacs said that africans scornfully reject the term negro because they think it represents something lowly or unworthy this supposedly leaves the black brother from america confused and resentful this is just not true the term negro is used by the west african pilot all the time the term is used often there so this kind of statement comes from not being fully acquainted with the scene the other main difficulty in the article is that it overgeneralizes what i miss throughout the article is any sensitivity to the complexity of differentiations within africa itself instead there is a tendency to generalize about how africans feel toward american negroes which africans where in what status positions and having what political orientation these are questions you must ask in dealing with the attitudes of africans toward american negroes in ghana today most negroes tend to lean to the noncommunist socialist left they reject negroes propagandizing for capitalism on the other hand other negroes are roaming around and developing intimate and warm relationships the question turns on which negro is being reacted to and who is doing the reacting thats the greatest weakness in this particular article maybe isaacs can afford to ignore the complexity of this problem in a short article for a presumably sophisticated american audience it really isnt fair to them or to the subjects that the author does not explicitly admit he is oversimplifying for our society to ignore these complexities would be fatal for amsac to ignore them would be to jeopardize the success of all our efforts and leave us as confused as some of the people whom isaacs interviewed in the future course of our individual and collective relations with africa we must be crystalclear about the nature of the reality we confront i think that we need to start with the proposition that the question that matters to amsac is not whether some american girls are having a rough political orientation these are the bands or whether some africans dont like the word negro or whether most american negroes suffer from cultural shock after being in africa for a few weeks or even whether a wellknown negro social scientist was invited to the homes of his african colleagues nor should we be particularly concerned about whether anyone in africa appreciates our efforts the question that really matters to amsac is first a power question do the leaders of the newly independent african states those in power at the moment wish to sustain friendly relationships with amsac if they do ultimately the educational forces which flow from these relationships will reeducate a population and reduce some of the attitudes referred to above i think that the answer to this question is that some of these leaders do some of them dont and some dont know anything about amsac but this nevertheless is a crucial question the next crucial question i think is what do we want to do in africa regardless of how visitors get along at the personal level therefore i go back to the three levels there are political problems but political panafricanism is not amsacs problem at the other end i dont think the question of interpersonal relationships is primarily our problem our problem is at the level of cultural relationships this is a matter of relationships between groups and groups and this gives us our broadest approach to africa cultural panafricanism is not a myth it is a reality nobody denies the cultural ties and everyone is interested in implementing exchanges of artists and books etc therefore our problem is relatively easy the problems of individuals who go out to africa are not easy in this respect there is a certain amount of truth in isaacs observations but the point is missed that these personal problems are not the crucial matters in africanamerican relationships i could recount the same kind of problems faced by africans educated in england who went home and had the task of keeping first second and third cousins from moving in on them these are individual problems and each individual is going to have to fight them out himself before us there are some signposts and to my mind they are these first the oldtime sentimental panafricanism is a feeble and slender reed on which to lean all other things being equal color helps but the other factors must be equal i dont think my students in africa could have cared less about my color they were only concerned with the university of londons exam if a white or green person could have helped to get them ready to make an upper first they would have wanted him if a negro couldnt help them to get ready to make an upper first they wouldnt want him but vhere other things are equal on a personal level i think the feeling would be in favor of having a negro around in my case the institution had been there for twelve years they didnt have an african head of department and i was the only colored head of department so i was showing the flag whether anyone liked me or not was irrelevant i was the one splash of color my students might have hated me on a personal level but until they get a good man ready to take that post they would rather see in it a west indian or american negro this may be a part of our fate a part of what we are supposed to do to accept the lack of the warm interpersonal relations and still do the job which africans need done at this particular moment i should like to conclude my remarks by reverting to that illusive and tantalizing subject of our quest for identity in africa today this takes form in the shift from tribal to national solidarity and in the quest for identity as an african we in the united states arent the only people who have a problem of finding an identity and if anyone thinks that panafricanism is a myth look how the votes run on boycotting south africa africans may disagree on everything else but when it gets down to the crucial tests the votes go twentyfive solid so when you ask whether panafricanism is a myth or reality find out in respect to what issues the american negro has a problem of reconciling his citizenship status and cultural heritage with the fact of being a negro this does not merely mean being black because being a negro doesnt have much reference to skin color in the united states the new african definition of panafricanism which includes white africans from tunis is like the virginia definition of a negro anybody with an ascertainable trace of negro blood so you now have white africans in africa and white negroes in the united states again this is not just a matter of color i feel that panafrican identification lends powerful support to successful individual and collective adjustment of american negroes do not consider it escapism to make this identification i say this because i do not share the optimism of those who feel that the trend toward integration will mean the disappearance of negroes as a group in the us or the distintegration of negro institutional life even if this were desirable for all there are going to be black people designated as negroes in the us for a long long time to come along with brown and fair people with enough telltale traits to mark them as being of partial african descent and by law and custom here in america partial means whole marry a person from the white community and as soon as the baby comes along that baby is over in the negro community so for those who intermarry their children are going to be colored children negro afroamerican and not white africans and other negroes who come here from abroad are going to have to share our fate to a great extent they may get special dinners such as the ambassador of sierra leone got the other day but for a long time to come not only are we going to be identified as negroes but africans are going to be sharing a common fate with us while theyre here what we are heading for in america i think is a social structure like hawaiis and not like brazils i am always interested in how we hold up hawaii as a great example of good race relations in hawaii ethnic groups have not disappeared there are many ethnic groups but nobody is ashamed of being in one people are tolerant of each other and if you intermarry you pick which side youre going to be on this is quite different from the brazilian situation where there is some emphasis toward the attainment of one big brazilian race and particularly toward the eradication of all evidences of african culture thats a part of what integration means in brazil eradicate the blacks oy marrying with them get rid of the color then quickly get them educated and get rid of this african survival system i dont regard brazil as any paradise for one who has respect for his africanism now we can either accept such a prospect or we can deplore it try to evade it or if we are light enough try to pass out of it since most negroes arent light enough to do that as are some who prefer to identify with the whole i am for accepting our negritude for trying to inject new meanings into the word negro and for discovering new appreciations for aspects of african culture i am in favor of all of us africans west indians american negroes and our white allies fighting together on all fronts the political front the cultural front and even fighting the battle of the interpersonal relationships this gives us the satisfaction of knowing that we are not fighting alone if we take this position i think we will build strong personalities we shall produce individuals who have the aspirations of the poet claude mckay a west indian who lived and wrote in new york one of his poems that i like very much reflects this attitude of accepting our negritude of becoming a part of the great panafrican fight by anita r cornwell the afternoon was about v r i gone and amanda i stonecutter wondered she could finish iron mg her last bundle before it was time to start supper it was friday and she liked to finish up before suppertime so she would have the week end to do her own chores then a sudden noise from the back porch pulled her head up and she saw her husband rushing through the door waving the evening paper you see here manda them fool kids done gone and got throwed outta school he shouted we told hal not to hang round them troublemaking demonstrators yet there he was leading the pack for a moment she stared at him then slowly cut her iron off and came to gaze at the newspaper spread on the kitchen table i heard the news on the radio she said finally they didnt give names but deep in my heart i guess i knew hal would be in it some where she sighed sitting down her legs suddenly too weary to hold her up he was one of the main ones its right here in the paper jim declared pounding the paper vigorously mr allen showed it t me and he said hal ought not to come back as haycroft aint gonna stand for that mess amandas face turned a dull gray as the blood drained from it they never did like hal them white folks here didnt theyll be laying for him now thats for sure she said in a flat lifeless tone which seemed to deepen the look of sadness in her eyes then anxiety and an overpowering sense of utter helplessness propelled her to her feet hugging her folded arms tight against her narrow palpitating chest she wandered up into the living room and stood at the window halfexpecting to find a mob already gathered in the front yard jim what are we going to do she asked suddenly turning to face her husband who had followed her into the crowded boxlike room hes nearing twenty they wont let him get away with the things he did when he was growing up dont upset yourself manda he began and she knew by the set of his mouth that he had news of some kind that he hadnt told before mr allen lent me money and i telegramed it to hal i told him to go on up to new york to be with his sister helen till this thing blows over youyou think hell do that she asked hopefully jim nodded his small round head bobbing like a top hell listen hes older now manda he knows people here dont want things all stirred up his wishful thinking and the placid look on his childlike face were almost too much for her to endure and the feeble ray of hope struggling in her bosom quietly expired as the scattered veins of fear darting through her body converged into the hard lump which settled in her chest she leaned one bony elbow against the peeling window frame and wondered in silent desperation what would happen to the other children if their eldest son came back and started offending the white people who nowadays seemed more easily provoked than ever finally shaking her head as if to clear away some dense fog she turned from the window to see that jim was already comfortably stretched out on the couch i guess id better go start supper before the children come she said trying without success to suppress another weary sigh out in the kitchen she lifted the halfironed shirt from the board with tired workknotted fingers and for a moment she stared at it with blurred eyes a white shirt a white mans shirt in the eyes of her country she was only a black woman who took in washing she was not supposed to have problems or feelings to care about those problems she was expected to be a workhorse not a mother who loved her children who worried about their wellbeing then relaxing her fingers the shirt dropped into the basket and she took the board down she would have to finish the bundle after supper now and jim could take it by mrs baines on his way to work tomorrow morning then yawning and stretching jim entered the kitchen i reckon id better set this out he said lifting the wicker clothes basket and taking it out to the back porch she watched him moving stiffly like a tired old man and marvelled at the swift cruel passing of time the children had always kept her so busy she had never had time to wonder whether the years were good or bad even when hal was about ten and started his fighting campaign to reform the world her hands were plenty full for the twins mike and ike were only five and annie ruth just a baby then at long last with the help of the good lord and rev mills the kindly old minister who had baptized all the children and mr waterman the principal who had once taught jim hal finished high with honors and a scholarship and she had thought the problem solved for good when he went off to florida to am i but now here he was expelled in his senior year and only god in his heaven knew what was coming next what came next the following day in fact was hal himself just as they were sitting down for the noonday meal he strolled into the kitchen plunking his suitcases down onto the freshly scrubbed floor saddened but not surprised amanda quickly looked at jim who for the moment was ashy white and quite speechless but not the children they whooped for joy and rushed to embrace him their conquering hero home in person you got th wire jim finally asked sure pop i got it hal grinned tossing his cap onto one of the suitcases but i figured what the hell harlem can wait ill liberate mississippi first the children whooped again and amanda felt rather than saw jim sag in his chair then hal came over and bent down to kiss her youre looking great mom he said but his eyes wondered if she understood why he had acted contrary to his fathers command and to her utter despair she knew her own eyes assured him that she did understand but oh how her heart ached for him food was forgotten as the twins told hal about the special assembly yesterday when mr lacker their new principal warned them not to start that sitin bit in haycroft if they wanted to stay at good old booker t high the handsome mobile face quivered with emotion as he began pacing the floor yeah i am very well acquainted with the educated uncle tommies he declared wait go slow it takes time they cry joining hands with their great white brethren to quote from that venerable script someone wrote coming back from lincolns funeral well im here to tell you that crap is from squaresville theyve got to get some new material sure a lot of us got thumped on our behinds and kicked out of school too but we have started something and they aint seen nothing yet just wait till we hit that second thrust theyre going to realize were shooting for the moon not just for the front of the bus jim stared in speechless fascination and the twins whistled and banged the table with fists and silverware annie ruth ran to hal and hugged him again and again while amanda holding her throbbing head tight in her hands frantically prayed dear god please send him north or shut him up before its too late news of hals homecoming spread around town like an epidemic and a few of the more curious souls came to see with their own eyes first on the scene was one of amandas insurance men harry bicker who ordinarily collected on tuesday jim had gone back to work and the rest of them were still in the kitchen listening to hal tell about the sitins in florida when harry bicker came back and right off hal wanted to know what was wrong with the doorbell but amanda hushed him up and took harry bicker up front but hal followed them staring at the white man while he collected his money and marked up the book then after his hasty rather nervous departure hal turned on his mother why dont you pay those vultures by mail every week here they come a pack of whiteshirted hyprocrites it would kill one of them to sit next to you at the drug store counter yet theyre living off us just as sure as buzzards picking a dead mans guts then amanda as impetuous as he in many respects got angry too whyd you come back if you hate it so much here you know what its like why you think you can change em annie ruth followed by the twins came in then and hal flopped down into a chair his mouth clamped shut and amanda tightlipped and boneweary put the insurance book back on top of the mantel and was heading back to the kitchen when the horn started blasting out front she froze and for a moment dead silence prevailed as they stared at one another knowing that none of their colored friends had cars and if they did they wouldnt blow quite like that but annie ruth the youngest and therefore the least frightened jumped up and ran to the window mama its mis baines she said turning to face them you want me to run out and tell her daddy took her clothes this morning ike the taller twin looked at his mother why cant she come in here if she wants to see somebody mike snorted shes scared a little color might rub off on her and shell lose ninetenths of her privileges man shut up amanda snapped but the little tableau was not lost on her she realized the twins were only trying to impress hal but she also knew they were apt to keep trying as long as he remained home somehow she had to get him out of town and suddenly the thought came to her that perhaps god had sent lucy baines to help her standing beside the new blue convertible amanda glanced at mrs baines somewhere between her thin upturned nose and her long ducklike neckline and wondered how it felt to be white and therefore right envy was not in her heart but the rank taste of fear fouled her mouth by now she was most adept at ignoring the fear for it usually erupted when a white face ventured too close vaguely she knew it sprang from a rockbed of hate and she resented the hate even more than she did the fear god didnt put man here to hate she thought despairingly but what were you to do when people pushed you to the ground and kept you there till you were dead and buried then her eyes strayed into the pale blue eyes of lucy baines and she saw fear there too it was only a flash but amanda caught a glimpse of it and she knew she couldnt ask mrs baines to help with hal for if lucy baines was scared then she hated too finally amanda realized mrs baines was saying something about odd jobs for hal to keep him out of further trouble and she nodded her head grinning the foolish grin that was expected of her she promised to talk to hal about the work but he probably would be going away soon helendid mrs baines remember helen who useta help her out after schoolwell helen was looking for hal to come up to new york to visit with her any day now back in the house amanda motioned for hal to follow her out to the kitchen where she told him what mrs baines had said and what she had said to mrs baines but hal would not be compromised mama he began patiently i know they dont like me here because i dont grin like an ape when they come sneaking around well im not an ape and im not going to act like one hal amanda interrupted sharply how can you have so much education and yet be so dumb you cant fight a whole town and neither can you change it by agitation theyll just be waiting for you to start something now why your head so hard boy he backed away from her as though she had struck him throwing his hands toward the ceiling all right so im an agitator so i want to look up at the sun and go where every man but one with a black face can go in his own country is that so wrong look at that barry roth who came here from germany years ago he practically owns the town now a jewhating nazi can have the country but i have to stand up to eat a lousy hamburger at the bus terminal you think thats something to grin about you think i ought to run up to new york and rot in harlem and call myself a man is that what you want amanda clutched at his swinging arms you are wrong to stay here and get yourself killed she cried what good would it do answer me what good would it do hal but he would not answer her perhaps he could not he was flesh of her flesh blood of her blood but not of her generation and through her tears she watched as he finally left the kitchen and retired to his old room upstairs at the back of the house where he stayed for the rest of the day banging away on the portable typewriter helen had given him when he finished high several times she had a notion to go back there to try talking with him again but since she had no real plan formulated yet she decided to wait until she had one at church next morning amanda found it virtually impossible to concentrate on the sermon more than once she caught herself up sharply as rev thornton pounded the lectern bringing enthusiastic amens from the congregation the children sitting in the pew ahead of them were somewhat more fidgety than usual but jim sat quietly beside her moving not an eyelash then her restless eyes fastened on the tall lanky man pacing the pulpit he was young not much older than hal and amanda realized now that she had never really felt comfortable in his presence he reminded her of mr lacker the new principal in manner more than looks the town had certainly changed she thought ruefully the old faces gone replaced by bright eager young men in dark gray suits and buttondown collars they always had the right word at the right time but somehow she felt they were lacking in many of the old virtues rev mills or mr watermaker would have taken hal aside and maybe talked some sense into his head but these new people were different they were probably afraid of a boy who talked too much they seemed more interested in hanging onto a job than going out of their way to risk hanging from a tall strong oak and who was she to condemn them leaving the tiny red brick church smiling and nodding at friends evading their questions concerning hal as best she could amanda walked along beside her silent husband more heavy of heart now than when she left the house but she attributed this more to the restless wanderings of her mind than to any defects of the service then when they reached home and she saw the sheriffs car parked out front she thought already god is punishing me for not listening to his word in church sheriff osborne and his deputy young timmy updyke who had once received two black eyes from hal for calling him a nigger got out of the black mudstained vehicle as they came up amanda looked at jim and saw his face turn whiter than either of the two other men then seeing him scared like that her own fear left her and she reached out to take his trembling hand in hers timmy said nothing in fact he barely looked at them but amanda felt the antipathy in him and the way he fingered his night stick in a sort of unconscious caress while his dull gray eyes stared out into some eternal void chilled her to the bone she knew that if they didnt soon get hal out of haycroft timmy updyke would see that they carried him feet first to the graveyard reluctantly amandas eyes moved on to the sheriff who was now saying what he had come to say in plain good old mississippi english and even before he had finished jim was vigorously nodding his head and promising up and down that hal wasnt thinking o starting no trouble heah in haycroft no sir not hal the sight of jim grinning and bowing tore amandas heart and she could have vept knowing that somewhere in the house hal watched wretched with indignation but god must have heard her plea for he did not come out to intervene they waited until the car disappeared around the corner in a faint cloud of dust then went into the house to find hal sitting in the living room staring at his feet propped up on the piano stool he nodded to them but made no mentioned of the sheriffs visit and somehow his silence was more disturbing to amanda than any of his long speeches had ever been and while she and jim changed their clothes upstairs her searching mind finally landed on the same old question should they all move north the subject was first discussed when helen was bom and they had rejected the idea agreeing that the north was too crowded with people and covered with cement everywhere and no place for children to grow up in as the tall buildings blotted out every last drop of gods good sunshine later however she came to realize that most important of all a child needed a good emotional climate but jim was rooted now and too removed from reality to think clearly about troublesome situations nevertheless she did voice the question once again jim was about ready to go downstairs but he stopped near the door and surprised her by not flying off the handle what would happen to us up there manda he asked his eyes squinting in the little face which had screwed up like that of a worried child then he answered his own question relief probably im near fifty with not much education he came back and sat on the bed his small yet powerful workstained mechanics hands spread upon his thighs i reckon relief aint no worse than this though all these years hearing hal shoot off at the mouth i wouldnt listen cause i knowed he was right i wanted to be a man too when i was his age i didnt like looking at the ground and grinning like a fool every time mr charley walks by they do something to your insides here and when you gets to be as old as me its like walking round dead it was such a rare thing him unburdening himself like that until amanda in the midst of rebraiding her hair hardly knew what to do then she let the long braid fall and moved forward her eyes seeing what they had not noticed in many a long year a man a human being with hopes and fears yet a longing to live in his own way and for the moment hal was forgotten as she reached out her arms to her husband by eleven oclock monday morning amandas first wash hung on the line swinging under the hard october sun which climbed toward high noon and she decided to take a break and look in on hal an idea had popped into her head earlier that morning and the more she thought on it the better it seemed to her they had a cousin in atlanta and if she could persuade hal to go there he might keep out of trouble and also finish his schooling it was risky for they were sittingin there too but anything was better than having him stay in hay croft she dried her hands on her apron as she trotted up the back steps her mind suddenly urging her feet to move faster if hal were around tomorrow when all those insurance men came anything might happen he never had liked them or they him at the foot of the stairs in the living room she rested one hand lightly on the newel post and called up to him uneasy when he did not immediately respond she walked part way up the steps and saw his door standing wide open fear clogged her breath and she dashed up the remaining steps so fast her slippers nearly threw her on the foot of his bed she saw a worn pocketsize new testament and in the center was a stack of neatly typed papers edging over almost furtively she bent down to read the top sheet and now i sit me down a novel by harold lawson stonecutter so thats what hes been typing she thought in some confusion but about what she wondered slowly picking up another page which she started to read this is the day tom thought as he stood at the window idly exam ining the withered branches of the dying peach tree while another part of his mind remembered how it had been back at collegetown you were scared to death sitting there with the snarling mob at your back every hair stood out on your neck and you prayed like crazy asking god to give you courage enough not to swing at one of them then peace came as renewed strength flowed through your trembling body and you knew god was with you in the mirror you saw the contorted faces filled with ignorance and you knew they were the lost souls then you prayed again asking god to show them the way he turned from the window a slight smile on his face as he knelt by his bed then finally he got up got his cap and left the room this was the day suddenly amanda gasped holding her throat as if about to strangle hal she cried softly oh hal how could you blindly she fled from the room down the steps and out into the bright sunlit day yet she knew it was too late even as she prayed with every breath in her body even as she heard the screeching sirens in the distance she knew it but she kept on running and calling his name the role of the negro writer in an era of struggle itre most successful pot lemicist of this it eration is a boysized genbugeyed negro named james baldwin ivory towerist vs activist the role of the negro writer in an era of struggle by hoyt w fuller who despite it all wants desperately to be known as a good novelist in a decade he has produced three novels and while the most v i f elill vvvvavxy james baldwin invests energies in seeking truth in work and life recent one another country was a bestseller none of them has received the sort of critical praise the author would like for his fiction on the other hand mr baldwin has published three collections of essays gained for him the wildest critical acclaim ever accorded a negro writer in this country two of these volumes nobody knows my name and the fire next time also have been bestsellers and the third which in fact was his first published work of nonfiction notes of a native son has been rushed into print again to capitalize on the authors sensational popularity mr baldwin is quite pleased with the reception of his books of course both because it means the reading public is receiving his message and because it means financial independence for him but he will readily admit that his personal ambition remains to be fulfilled he wants to write novels which will draw from nonaxegrinding critics the lavish kudos his nonfiction already has earned following publication of another country in mr baldwin undertook a series of lectures and public appearances which took him to major literary centers across the country his face and his statements became familiar in newspapers magazines and journals then in november the new yorker magazine published a long rambling extraordinarily searching essay by mr baldwin which literallyas well as literarilyshook up the american reading public that essay of course is the meat of the book the fire next time which was rushed into printa few weeks following the appearance of the magazine suddenly organizations and literary and socialconscious groups all over the country were clamoring for the writers attention every newspaper and periodical of any significance whatever published news or reviews about him and his books and time magazine put him on its cover the television networks brought him before their cameras and it became a common sight to see the small intensely alert figure with the great eloquent eyes solemnly setting forth his con cept of the american failure and the american future on the nations tv screens he was interviewed and taped and even recordings of him talking and reading became bestsellers core beckoned and he went launching forth on a physically exhausting national tour to deliver his message in person while bringing in badly needed funds for the vital work core is performing and finally the u s attorney general called and then came calling and in a remarkable session which may have no parallel in history the negro writer who five years earlier was unknown to all but a few discerning readers was telling the man who then sat on the right hand side of the president of the united states that negro americans have reached the end of their endurance and that hereafter they would be in no mood to accept anything short of their full rights as citizens of this country that done the little black writer hied himself off to puerto rico and again took up his typewriter to finish his play blues for mr charlie he was he explained a writer really not a politician and it is a writers duty to write nevertheless in taking valuable time away from his work to become a civil_rights activist mr baldwin demonstrated most dramatically whatfor him at any rateis the black writers role in this era of struggle it is a role which many great writers of the past have played one such was voltaire the th century french dramatist and philosopher whose attacks on religious fanaticism and political injustice twice landed him in the bastille drove him into exile and it has been said helped to bring about the french revolution another was thomas paine the american patriot whose pamphlets fired his countrymen to action in our own revolution this is a role then which involves commitment of the writer to the noblest of human values which demands of the writer as artist that he dedicate his skills to the proposition every man has the right to be free in pursuing such a role the writer serves as disturber of that spurious peace which is arrived at through the degradation of some men he seeks to move the uncommitted to positive action on the side of freedom and he exhorts those who are numbed by oppression or blinded by bigotry to turn their eyes and their energies toward that which is true and just and which is both balm and sustenance for the human spirit it would seem that the black writer himself a member of a group struggling to rise from the morass of degradation and apathy and neardespair would find such a role tailored to his peculiar specifications naturally however there are those who hold different views of the black writers role in thisor anyera of struggle particularly if that struggle is racial in the chorus of general praise which has greeted the articles and declarations by james baldwin for instance there have risen strident and discordant voices lashing out at mr baldwin in what masqueraded as a review of richard wrights posthumous novel lawd today exlife magazine correspondent arthur shay branded the writer an oedipal wreck and cried has nothing changed in the quarter century separating wright and baldwin doesnt the american dream now include some negroes in an attack on the two negro writers which bordered on hysteria the critic expressed dubious sympathy for his black compatriots the american negro has had an extraordinary run of bad luck in his literary spokesmen mr shay wrote supremely ignorant of the fact that he spoke only for white people they go mute with rage expatriating themselves from the theatre of their anguish as richard wright did they retire to some dark olympus of the spirit as james baldwin is doing and issue warnings like mail order seers mr shay conveniently forgot that richard wright was in rather distinguished company in expatriating himself great and sensitive souls have been fleeing the american nightmare for generations and they have included henry james ezra pound t s eliot gertrude stein and ernest hemingway to name a few and even so narrowvisioned an observer as mr shay ought to be able to discern by now that james baldwins warnings may have come just in time to deflect a national cataclysm partly because of them persons in authority from the white house down to community churches have been making an extra effort to put our national house in order mr baldwin never said the fire was inevitable what critics like mr shay really find so hard to bearapart from the indignity of having to listen to negroes making demands rather than pleading for mercyis the refusal of negro writers to accept the crumbs of tokenism for the whole loaf of freedom doesnt the american dream now include some negroes he asks and the inference is of course that negro writers ought to be celebrating the advances that have been made rather than endlessly complaining about remaining injustices there are after all marian anderson and ralph bunche these critics consider writers like james baldwin as dangerous as well they should although they rarely have the candor to state just what the writers are endangering after taking a series of editorial potshots at mr baldwin in his chicago tribune magazine of books column world almanac editor harry hansen admitted his irritation at the negro writer although his reasons for discomfort were singularly unconvincing mr baldwins way of talking is doing the negro writer some harm he put it displaying a sudden and touching concern for the welfare of negro writers it remained for national review editor william buckley the darling of the rightwing to state as only the rapiertongued mr buckley can state what was on all these critics minds baldwin is an eloquent menace mr buckley wrote in his syndicated column going on to equate mr baldwins indictment of white american society with adolf hitlers indictment of the weimar republic and karl marxs indictment of capitalism we need to improve mr buckley conceded speaking for the white race simultaneously we need to reorder more generously our relationship with the negro race and to reject out of hand the preposterous and suicidal counsels of the negroes most inflamed spokesman it may not be too much to assume that mr baldwin had he read mr buckleys assessment of him would have been highly complimented no selfrespecting black man could desire the approval of a man who would express even his guilt in such racially patronizing terms and that ultimately states the problem and defines the protagonists the problem concerns human freedom and dignity and those who believe in it have joined battle with those who do not it may be that some black writers being only human and therefore frail can stand aside and pursue only their muse but in this era of struggle as in all the others which have preceded it such men are not easy to imagine by conrad kent rivers the valley of death is t ll v spread before us but i we swallow our bitter ss sb dosage of lift and move ignorantly toward the hereafter one knows and scarcely knows what to expect one black hereafter is as good as a white one i had to kick their law into their teeth in order to save them each person blighted by darkness broods heavily and carries the business of hate inside like giant cobras carry their venom to alien bodies we are indeed things of dry hours the whole mess of blackness is a spit in the eye of our so called christian society a dryness is upon our house and no black man in america really owns one we have lived the life of impostors and now we must reckon with the broken spirits of our children who through their sectional marches and rides have saved us from everlasting shame in the eyes of free men everywhere save home bom in alabama bred in illinois he was nothing but a plain black boy so we go into drug stores and lunch counters displaying our painted black faces while cockroaches chase the babysitter and we declare our middleclassism wear the mink pay twice for a loose fitting store bought yes sir suit kid the kids negroes whats a negro her body is a honey bowl whose waiting honey is deep and hot what ever happened to those fun loving dancing happy people ones not a man ones not a woman grown gwendolyn brooks is a prophet and a brooder her poetry ranks with the best produced in this wild untamed country one might call her a disciple of truth she speaks of a time and country and people not easily found in the verse and prose of her peers her collected poems intensify all the known and unknown vicissitudes of negro life in america her song is too sad and delicate for the ears of white america but by sheer technique she has managed to capture a few catchers in the rye her song is too pointed and studied to awake the amateur reader among her race the high and mighty read eliot and those facile minded lows read dunbar and the rest she is alone and i fear she knows it beneath the strict didactic tones of her verse there is nothing seeable save a heart full of love and controlled hate and fantastic nostalgia hung up in the mouth of deaths life ill never forget the summer before i was married how needlessly i worried about so many things all the usual difficulties expected of a new marriage were not enough for me i had heaped imaginary problem upon problem until i felt i would be crushed by the load i fancied myselfan inveterate country girlconstrained to city slums for life unclaimed by my family shunned on every side by those around me of course my worries were not completely without cause i grew up in an allwhite environment by the time i was in high school there were a few negro students attending the university in my home town but i knew no more about negro life than the snatches of news and gossip i had overheard from my uninformed and sometimes biased associates as i went through two years of college and began working i made friends from many sections of this country and some from abroad who helped liberalize my cultural outlook even among most of them however i was encouraged to look elsewhereamong my own kind for love and happiness perhaps it was because so few believed that i could make a success of an interracial marriage that spurred me on but i became determined that love was more important than a whole worldful of opinions i began to read every book and article i could find on the subject of negrocaucasian intermarriage integration education culture etc i even found articles by children of these couples which aided me considerably since most people hold the view that these children suffer intolerably naturally i had a firsthand source of information to which i could turn at any time i needed it he never spared the truth in telling me what i might expect from one group or the other i think my greatest lesson came when i was introduced to some of his negro friends for it was here that i discovered that they like he were just ordinary people some became very dear friends while others were as obnoxious to me as some other folks i know during my associations with these people have noticed no difference in subject matter intelligence morals or any other stigma that is thought to be characteristic of the negro i found each person must be judged for himself not as a member of any group though all this may have been known by some for many years it was all new to me the more i learned the more confident i became i reached the conclusion that the only way i would ever know what it was to be the wife of a negro was to become one the day we exchanged wedding vows i was no longer afraid i looked forward to the future with hope courage and pride and i knew then as i do now that i would always have them no matter what trials should come my way looking back on all of this now seems like remembering a dream we have encountered none of the problems i had imagined true we are sometimes stared at and some people go out of their way to be friendly but among the people we know we are just another couple i sometimes wonder what life would be for me if i had let anyone change my mind during those fearful unforeseen years we are so happy now enjoying life together thrilling over the accomplishments of our small son and busy carrying out plans for today and all the tomorrows that we will share my people is the enemy deception is more humiliating than rejection exploitation is more inhuman than exclusion indifference is more emr bittering than open hostility condescension is more provocative than hate the estrangement of the races in the north is more volatile more apt to explode into violence as far as i can discern than is the segregation of the races in the south the alienation of the races in new york city or chicago may turn out to be more calamitous than whatever happens in jackson or birmingham for negroes in the urban north revenge may seem sweeter than equality and violence more decisive than patience and both more honorable than the tolerance of further appeasements and postponements of course i say this out of my own experience in new yorkin harlemand from a good deal of contact with the people of the ghettos of some of the other northern citieschicago boston and detroit especially but i assert it also in the perspective of some exposure to and experience in the south during the years i lived and worked in harlem i had occasion to visit the south a good many times sometimes in mississippi and in louisiana the southern visits involved legal cases but there were also trips to georgia south carolina virginia florida and arkansas to lecture at law schools and colleges and to visit some of the churches of the south there were opportunities to give legal counsel to those involved in the sitins and freedom rides and other demonstrations both in the south and the north indeed i myself was involved in what must have been one of the original sitinsback in when i was in college in maine some of us had observed that negroes were not served at a certain hotel and that discrimination existed and was practiced in some other public accommodations although it must be said that the issue was hardly noticed publicly in maine because there were comparatively few negroes in the state there was however discrimination in some places against french canadians who had migrated to maine a bill was introduced into the legislature that condemned racial or ethnic discrimination and sought to establish a commission against discrimination several of us were working for the bills enactment one day the legislator who had sponsored the measure a man of french extraction came to see us to report that the legislation had almost no chance to pass since there was so little public interest in the issue after long discussion it was decided that three of us would go with a negro to the hotel which barred negroes and ask to be served it was arranged in advance that the legislator would be dining in the same hotel that evening and would have with him a newspaperman the expectation was that we would ask to be served and as had been the custom in the hotel be refused we would protest and the legislator having noticed the incident would intervene in our behalf while the newspaperman took photographs and got a story the publicity of the incident was supposed to enhance the prospects for the passage of the bill at the appointed hour our party arrived at the hotel and went into the dining room the senator and the reporter were halfway through their entrees after we had been sitting at the table for several minutes we noticed that the waiter had gone to speak to the manager we could not hear their conversation but soon the waiter came and asked to take our order we had to order something of course ironically we had already eaten at the college so sure we were that the hotel would not serve us among the four of us we had only about five dollars so the unfortunate senator ended up paying the checkfor our second dinner of the evening that was the result achieved in this pioneer sitin it is against the background not only of harlem but of a bit broader involvement than that that i conclude that the decisive front in the racial crisis in america is the urban north and not the south i have immense admiration for the restraint dignity and resourcefulness of the civil_rights movement in the south but the case remains that the immediate and stated objectives of that movement in the southern jurisdictions are goals that have already been substantially achieved in the northern cities at least so far as court decisions and legislation are concerned and also to a significant degree so far as integration in public transportation hotels restaurants and the like are concerned these things were attained in the north for the most part in the years after the second world war and what is to be seen when one looks now at the northern city is what happens after these legal rights and remedies which the southern demonstrations seek to win have been won the northern city in other words is setting the precedent for what is in store for the southern cities once the legal struggle to vindicate the civil_rights of negroes has been concluded and if in the days that lie immediately ahead the relations between the races are not somehow resolved peacefully then the whole nation is in for an ominous and dreadful holocaust let no man take comfort in the racial troubles of the northern cities least of all any white man from the south any more than any white northerner can appease his conscience or rationalize his indifference by the racial strife in the south no man is made innocent by the mere culpability of another man the lost frontier harlem had considered itself for a long time to be the pioneer negro community not only in the united states but in the world that seems a not unjustified pride after all new york city had been the place where the great succession of peoples of different tongues nations religions and customs had come and found albeit after patience and travail mutual accommodation a general acceptance and a share in the prosperity culture political power and common life of the city new york city represented the hospitality of american democracy to each man and to all men surely the american negro migrating from the south and the west indian negro immigrating to the continent could find here if anywhere welcome opportunity dignity and hope surely the negroes of new york would become and be here the pioneers of their race an example and encouragement and enhancement to all negroes everywhere this pioneer psychology in harlem was fed for years by the accumulation of civil_rights laws and statutory disclaimers of racial discrimination by the ceremonial use of negroes in public affairs by the praise of social equality for negroes heard in the churches downtown by the integration although here it was from the outset the most obvious economic necessityof public transportation and accommodations by the gradual if begrudged inroads of negroes into the lower echelons of public and quasipublic employment by the notoriety that some few negroes achieved in white society particularly in athletics and entertainment harlem was the leader so long as the african nations remained largely colonial harlem was the pioneer so long as the south remained segregated but now under the impact of the events in africathe emergence of the new nations there and the increasingly decisive power of africans in the united nationsand with the disruption and accelerating disintegration of southern segregation harlem frets over its destiny harlem wonders whether it has lost its pioneer initiative and suspects that every achievement of negroes in new york city and every opportunity of negroes in new york city is illusory or fraudulent or guileful no wonder a few years ago legislation was enacted in new york city barring discrimination in private multipledwelling units a law much celebrated by the local politicians as a milestone for negroes and other socalled minority groups in the city yet few negroes look for housing outside of harlem without encountering discrimination in one guise or another and even where the discriminating circumstances are such as to legally justify filing a complaint the procedure for administration of the law is so cumbersome as to be of practical consequence in only a handful of cases the new construction and renovation of housing in new york have been an efficient instrument of segregation the east side of manhattan for instance from yorkville to gramercy park is more effectually segregated today than it was fifteen years ago because the vast reconstruction of that sector of the city has made the rental or purchase of housing beyond the means of most harlem negroes yet at the same time i have been offered an apartment in yorkville for pretty much whatever you want to pay by a landlord who wants to keep the building white and if a negro family wants to move out of harlem and to queens say and purchase a house there they will find that the banks are helping to resist such moves by charging both the seller and the buyer placing fees in order to merely receive a mortgage application insofar as negroes disperse in the city both the negroes and those willing to sell housing to negroes have to pay a penalty for it the effect of factors such as these despite the legislative denunciations of discrimination is to induce the formation of new ghettos for negroes in the places in the bronx or queens or brooklyn or beacon or newburgh to which negroes move from the harlem ghetto as the negro population increases new harlems are spawned which suffer the same isolation from the rest of the city that the old harlem has known for more than a half a century housing is crucial of course because of the vicinity of neighborhood life and the importance of neighborhood institutions in the city if housing is segregated then there will also be and is de facto segregation of schools hospitals political clubs taverns stores and churches even without other considerations that favor segregation in education religion politics and the likewhere slums have been displaced by public housing projects in areas like harlem the people have often been exploited by private businessmen to take advantage of the ignorance of people with regard to their rights one of the common frauds is the furniture dealer who visits a family which has been accepted for public housing to inform them that a prerequisite for moving into their new apartment is that they have new furniture such transactions typically result in the commitment of the family to a heavily mortgaged purchase of furniture of indifferent or inferior quality with such small installment payments that they pay many times over the true value of the goods and are lucky if the furniture lasts as long as the payments of course default in the payments entitles the seller to repossess the property ironically many of these sales based upon misrepresentation are foisted on families who have been admitted to public housing because they are good rent risks that is because they have a stable if low and steady if insufficient income some could in fact qualify for credit in reputable downtown department stores but as in the case of shopping for food are reluctant to leave the neighborhood feeling that their business is unwelcome in the white stores and fearing rejection because they are negroes if they apply for credit negroes have too much and too long been not only the victims of such charlatan businessmen but also have suffered exclusion both from employment in and ownership of business enterprises even within the ghetto this is the situation which gives rise to efforts to boycott liquor stores furniture stores and other businesses in harlem itself and to campaigns to buy black during the demonstrations of the summer of in one section of the city protesting discriminatory hiring practices of a certain restaurant chain in which scores of arrests were made it turned out that the strongest opposition to the demonstrations within the business community of that section was the crime syndicate the businessmen of organized crime were distressed by the demonstrations because they caused a substantial increase in the numbers of policemen assigned to the area and thus made it more dangerous and difficult for drugs to be peddled and for the numbers racket to operate it is also likely that the syndicate fears integration in business because it might eventually require admitting negroes to the rackets as well as to legitimate businesses the sanction invoked by the syndicate to line up the opposition of businessmen and others in the area was to threaten to call in and collect loans made by the syndicate to otherwise legitimate businessmen who might be ready to go along with integration in public accommodations stores and the like or take hospitals not long ago i had a negro client who had taken her child one sunday to a public playground the child who was five years old fell at the playground hitting his head on the concrete surface a few blocks away there is a private hospital related by the way to one of the churches the mother took her child there and after waiting nearly an hour in the socalled emergency reception section was finally interviewed by a doctor who explained that the mother would have to take the child to a public hospital since she could not afford care at this institution and since thats what the public hospitals are for actually of course the private hospital could have been reimbursed by public welfare for any care given to the child although at rates set by the welfare authorities rather than by the hospital administration the nearest public hospital was four miles away so after having been turned away the mother took the child there walking part of the way and going by bus part of the way since she had no money for a taxi after a further wait at the public hospital the child was examined and it was found that he had suffered a serious injury which might permanently disable him the doctors say that if the child had received prompt attention the consequences of the injury would likely have been much less serious the mother in the case worked as a domestic she told her employer about the matter and he in turn reported it to me it seemed likely that the reason the child had not been admitted to the private hospital was either because the family was poor or negro or most likely both the mother however refused to make any formal complaint against the doctor and private hospital because as she explained she had no hope whatever that she could prevail after all why should she a negro expect to be treated fairly or humanely by the law any more than she had been by the private hospital and besides the prosecution of the complaint would not heal her child while the matter was being discussed i called a friend of mine who is a reporter on one of the major new york newspapers one which professes a great concern for human rights told him what had happened and suggested that it might be worthwhile publicizing this incident to call attention to discrimination in the private hospitals of the city but he said that the incident was not newsworthy and that his paper received as many as a dozen reports a day of similar cases its only a story for us he said if the kid dies or if the injury is really grotesque one of the uglier incidents which was thought to be newsworthy happened a few years ago in harlem a babyjust over two years old developed a high fever and his mother a negro took him to a public hospital the interne who examined the child told the mother that it was a minor respiratory intection and prescribed some medicine the mother took the child home administered the medicine but found in the next day or two that the fever did not abate they returned to the hospital this time a different interne was on duty and he sent the mother and baby to the tuberculosis ward saying that he suspected that this was the ailment testing there indicated that it was not and again the mother and baby were discharged after having been given some additional medicine three days later when the babys fever and discomfort persisted the mother for the third time went to the hospital waited her turn and while the child was being examined by the doctor it died an autopsy subsequently established that the child had died not from a respiratory infection not from incipent tuberculosis but from an infection caused by the bite of a rat thats the sort of story that makes the newspapers and that is the sort of incidentalong with the playground casethat causes many negroes to conclude that they can expect little care from hospitals or at least little competent care in short in virtually every sector of the citys lifehousing education and medical care in business politics and employment in the welfare administration and the enforcement of the lawnegroes still suffer discrimination and segregation despite the legislative disclaimers of discrimination and the public promises of the politicians the tragedy and irony of harlem is that while negroes have been lost in fondness for the image of harlem as the pioneer for all negroes harlem has remained the place and symbol of persistent if sometimes subtle discrimination excluded from the housing politics lawful protection commercial enterprise common culture education economic opportunity sanitation and free access characteristic of the rest of the city and taken for granted by the white people downtown the great affront to harlems pioneer destiny is that harlem still exists the passion for revenge this is no report by the way about the extreme racists within the negro community about the black muslims or the black nationalists although both exist and increasingly thrive in harlem and in the other great urban ghettos of the north and they are by no means to be dis counted or underestimated indeed as far as the muslims are concerned they are well financed some say with funds from the arab sourcesand apparently they are congenial with the white racists of the american nazi party at least i myself have seen some proof of their association with the american nazi but these extremiststhe muslimsseem to have made a fatal tactical mistake in their attempts to exploit the unrest and frustration and sentiment for revenge among american negroes especially in the north they have required their adherents not just to hate white men though that is their central doctrine and essential aopeal they also require that their members renounce their relieious inheritancewhich in harlem is either the gospel tradition in protestantism or in the case of west indian immigrants roman catholicismand embrace the indoctrination of a new and strange and unfamiliar religion which incidentally bears little truthful resemblance to historic islam and to further submit to the discipline and rigorous piety of the new faith with respect to practical behavior from day to day the muslims have made hate too complicated and difficult and much too contingent upon a peculiar moralism to become a movement that receives mass support or so it seems to me simply as an observer yet there is no doubt that the central emphasis of the extremistslike the muslimsin the negro communities of the north upon the simple hatred and rejection of white men because they are white men has enormous and increasing appeal among the negroes of the city ghettos the great danger for both negroes and whites is that some leader will emerge who will turn to his people and preach a blunt doctrine of hate and revenge because the ground has been so well prepared by extremists of both races it will be difficult to organize longsuppressed emotion and legitimate grievances into a powerful movement if that comes to pass the peaceful demonstrations in the streets will cease and the revolution will become an insurrection if that does happen if there is a violent and bloody calamity perhaps white men will then recognize that the incumbent leadership of the negro revoltnotably martin_luther_king with his great dignity and discipline and restrainthas been the best friend of white americans both in the north and the south each day of diehard indifference of white people in the north each day of diehard segregation in the south invites disaster by making it more difficult for the negro leadership favoring and practicing nonviolent protest to maintain its leadership the nonviolent demonstrations have after all been going on for about five years on a significant scale and reached a climax in the march on washington in august of if from these demonstrations there is not some tangible result to which the present negro leadershio can point it may be expected with certainty that the patience of negroes will be exhausted and they will turn to other leaders and to other tactics and turn from seeking redress of their grievances to taking revenge for the indignities they have suffered through three hundred years of slavery and segregation no account is given here of the extremists in harlem but the danger is that harlemalong with each of the little harlems of the nation is driven to extremity one sign of how much racism tempts negroes is the degree to which some leaders among them who are not muslims or nationalists feel constrained to imitate and recite racist doctrines some of the statements of congressman adam clayton powell reflect this change in the mood and militancy of harlem i recall for another instance attending a rally in harlem some time ago protesting police brutality one of the speakers was a certain negro minister whom i know well and who has been very moderate it happens that this man is of very fair complexion and could easily pass for a white man when he began his speech he apologized for his light color whereupon he was booed by the crowd he persisted in his apology and said that though he was light he knew the full burden of being a negro in america more booing he changed his tactic and launched into the most provocative and virulent racist speech i think i have ever heard advocating among other things black supremacy and resort to violence to oppose the violence of the police this time the crowd was with him he had sensed the depth of their hostility and had appeased it but there is a sequel to the incident after the rally i went to greenwich village where i had a date to have a drink with a white student who had just returned to the city from a freedom ride in mississippi as we sat in the restaurant who should come in but the minister who had given the racist address at the rally and guess who was with him a white girl the important thing so far as i am concerned is not the duplicity of the ministerthat is a problem he must live with all alonebut rather that he had felt that black supremacy and revenge had become so much the spirit of harlem that he had to identify with it he tried first of all to do that in his pitiful apology for his light skin and when that failed he succeeded in gaining the crowd by outdoing even the professional racists in harlem a particularly ominous sign of the extremisties of negro animosity is the emergence in the open of negro antisemitism it is a complex phenomenon and one which has as far as i can observe been spawned over a very long time part of the picture is a sense of the uniqueness of the negro cause as such and a reluctance among negroes to identify their cause with that of other minorities not only the jews but also for example puerto ricans this sentiment much prevails in spite of the historic interest of the jews in america in the civil_rights of all citizens and in the case of the puerto ricans in spite of their common problems negroes do not want to be lumped together with other minorities but there is evidence of particular resentment at being associated with the jews one reason for this is the direct competition now between negroes and jews in politics in new york in the succession of migrations and immigrations of the different ethnic groups there has been a succession to political power that roughly parallels the order of the immigrations for a while the germans were politically powerful but they were displaced by the irish and the irish in time by the italians as the dominant group but in this succession the jews did not receive their turn they were not welcome in politics although their numbers justified political recognition it is only comparatively recently through the device of a third party with preponderantly jewish leadership and membership and through the socalled reform movement in the democratic party that the jews have received something like the political recognition and patronage status that their numbers and social and economic influence would have brought to other groups long since the problem is that the jews have belatedly emerged in great strength in city politics at just the time when the negro demand for political power and patronage has become insistent consequently the two minorities which have suffered the most harsh discrimination in city politics are now in the position of competing with each other for political power and patronage rather than being united in a common political cause but politics is not the only cause of negro antisemitism there are unfortunate instances in which negroes have endured illtreatment at the hands of individual jews a typical instance is when tenants live in slums where the landlord happens to be jewish i have had two cases where the landlords of abominable slums were rabbiswhich hardly improves the image of the jews in the eyes of negroes the fact is too that some of the furniture dealers who have victimized negroes moving into new housing have been jewish and this further feeds antisemitism even the substantial philanthropy of jews for the civil_rights struggle and their sincere sympathy for the plight of the negroes are greeted with suspicion and resentment who are they to speak for us is a common form which this hostility takes nobody but a negro can know what it means to be a negro is the sentiment which rejects identification on the part of jews with the negro cause yet the overriding reason for negro antisemitism as far as i can discern is that it is some awful emulation of the antisemitism so long prevalent and so unyielding among middle and upperclass white protestants and catholics for generations these citizens who have been ascendant in american society have made antisemitism a mark of social and political status something which while it seldom took the form of open persecution was and still too much remains an accepted attitude and practice insofar as this is the basis of negro antisemitism it places white christians in an excruciating position on one hand they must now stand beside the jews and share with the jews the hostility of negroes toward all white people but at the same time they themselves are authors of one form of that very hostilitythe antisemitism of negroes which imitates the antisemitism of white protestants and catholics such is the economy of judgment in any event now it is at least in the open no longer latent and snide and festering but brought into the open by the boycotts of jewish merchants in harlem the rent strikes against some jewish landlords and the attempts to integrate some unions and industries that have heretofore been predominantly white and jewish now that it is in the open perhaps it can and will be dealt with in a way which both affirms the uniqueness of the negro and the grandeur of the negros struggle and also in some way works a reconciliation among negroes and jews and white christians the spirit of revenge which stalks the streets of harlem and the other urban ghettos is one which increasingly regards any association in public between negro and white as suspect as a guilty association one which calls into question the loyalty and racial pride of the negro one in which the negro is thought to be tempted or intimidated or cajoled or purchased into some compromise of his integrity and identity as a negro an event like the censure of a philip randolph the distinguished leader of the american negro labor council and virtually the patriarch of harlem by the executive council of the aflcio for his exposure of racial discrimination in the unionsthe proof of which has been amply documentedabets the suspicion that when a negro tries to negotiate or collaborate with whiteseven those who protest most that they are liberalshe must either betray himself and his people or suffer humiliation even the word negro is dropping from usage in favor of the term black man in order to express the pride a man who is black should have in being black and the disdain that black men should have toward white men there was a time for example when prostitution in new york involved supplying negro girls to white patrons from downtown and when some brothels in harlem catered largely to white customers those days are gone a negro prostitute does not have white customers any more no matter what the price because to associate with white people is a disloyalty to her race and people and their cause just as much ior a prostitute as for any uncle tom in politics or the churches the intensity of the rejection of association with white people apparent among negroes should be enough to put to rest the red herring in the civil_rights crisis regarding intermarriage the fact is bluntly that most negroes hate white people when there is as there will surely be integration in public life in americahousing and education and politics and jobs and public accommodationsthere will not suddenly be a great increase in marriages between the races at least i have detected no greater interest in the subject among negroes than among whites and why should there be much interest in the subject nobody is interested in marriage in the abstract marriage is a personal issue and decision and it remains that with respect to marriages between the races if marriage in a serious and responsible sense is being contemplated the intermarriage issue is empirically baseless and where advanced as an obstacle to the right of negroes to be received and welcomed as citizens in public life represents a gross irrational and stupid vanity on the part of white people and it is aptly the subject of ridicule i know a seminary professor a native white southerner who is a strong advocate of the negro cause long before the present crisis he was an eloquent and effective witness in the south for civil_rights he has a very attractive daughter eligible for marriage he tells me that he is invariably asked after giving a speech in support of civil_rights what he himself would do if a negro proposed to his daughter his stock answer to this query is to say first of all i would ask him whether he was a protestant a catholic or a jew or to show how ridiculous this intermarriage issue is from another point of view i recollect recently being in the south and meeting an elderly negro gentleman he as it happensand as is the case with many negroes of slave ancestry in this countryhad a white father asked one day by a white southerner about this he replied that he indeed had a white father the conversation was overheard by another negro who after the white southerner had departed approached my friend and said tom dont you ever ever do that again dont you ever admit to a white southerner that your father was a white man you tell em that it was your mother who was white in other words intermarriage when posed as an abstract and impersonal issue is irrelevant to the civil_rights of negro citizens there is no serious evidence of any significant interest abstractly and impersonally in intermarriage among either whites or negroes whereas there is plenty of evidence of the slavery era having fostered many many interracial liaisons and later on evidence of negro prostitution for white customers so let the specter of intermarriage be put to rest the issue it really raises is the sexual ethics of white men outside of marriage both in the days of slavery and in the days of the traveling salesman and let two people fall in love and marry if they are given the gift of love even though they be of different races though they be different in any other way they will have and probably will continue to have for a long time more difficulties than most marriages in this society but the issue then is not so much societys as theirs and if under the burdens which this society adds to any interracial marriage they survive and prosper as man and wife and as a family that only enhances the dignity and maturity of their love it is in anv case no reason to oppose or deny any negro his place and his prerogatives as an american citizen ironically though the passion for revenge is active and i fear increasing within the negro community especially in the urban north that which has subdued and controlled this passion is the same thing which in the end mav be the proximate cause of vengeance and violence what has mainly quieted the advocates of violence and counseled extraordinary restraint in the negro revolution has been the leadership crisis within the negro community itself if any proof were needed which none isof the profound humanity of negroes it is supplied by the infighting and pettiness and personality conflicts the competitiveness an throatcutting within the negro establishment itself they are just like white people scrapping and fighting and destroying each other in all this maneuvering and internal struggle for leadership of the negro revolution the rest of the nation has gained some time to acknowledge and respond to the revolution but now that time is running out and if the negro leadership crisis among core naacp sclc the urban league the student movements the black racists and the remaining uncle toms is not resolved then racial chaos is urely in store for america the masses of negro people have at last been moved they will not wait long for a leader nor dally about who the leader is they will move by themselves if need be without a leader and the revolution will become an insurrection they are tired they are frustrated they are angry they are impatient they are aggressive they are ready for a leader buti thinkthey are also ready to go into the streets without a leader all by themselves as other men have had to do from time to time to defend and vindicate their own humanity the depths of estrangement if one looks today at the cities of the north where the decisive struggle in the negro revolution is taking shape the conclusion is inescapable that the estrangement between the races in the north is virtually complete despite the northern civil_rights legislation despite the commissions on human rights despite the ceremonial presence of negroes in public life despite the liberalism of many white northerns despite good intentions and naive sincerity racism has not been exorcised indeed racism increases it not only becomes more evident and intransigent among white people as negroes press their claims with greater vigor and determination but latent in negroes it begins to emerge and flourish among them the truth is that in the years since the beginning of substantial migration of negroes from the south to the northern cities and of the immigration of negroes from the west indies to the northern cities there has been precious little honest honorable or significant communication between the races the platitudes of tolerance it turns out conceal the practice of discrimination for the american idea of tolerancethough it be less vehement than south africas apartheidis after all a generically similar doctrine of racial coexistence the promises of acceptance freedom and society in the northern city have not been validated in education jobs housing politics or the equal protection of the law everything seemed fine for many years but the condition of that tranquillity was the acquiescence of negro citizens in a secondclass status and a ghetto existence separated from the comforts mobility and opportunities of life in the outer city the platitudes and promises the liberalism and benign intentions of northern white society during the last fifty years in which the negro migration to the cities has taken place mean little when it remains true to this day that eightyfive per cent of all negroes in metropolitan new york for example live in one or another of five neighborhoods which are virtually entirely black and in consequence send their children to black schools worship in black churches dine at black restaurants attend black movies theaters and in all the ordinary facets of community life associate almost entirely with their fellow negroes the main contact with the white people for the multitude of northern negroes has been when some negro has left harlem to go to workas a domestic in an east side penthouse as a sanitation department employee to collect the waste of the rest of the city or to wait on tables in a downtown restaurant which seldom has a negro customer to scrub the floors of empty offices late at night to sell body and dignity to a white businessman for a night or to entertain white people in a club or bar of course in all this time some negroes have made the grade and have achieved a certain acceptance in and access to white society some have made it as has been earlier mentioned by becoming quislings only a few have made it without that humiliation one is dr anna arnold hedgeman despite the eminence she achieved it is constructive to see how she constantly had to resist being used by white society dr hedgeman began her professional career as a school teacher in the dark regions of mississippi but later after some years of community work in the midwest moved to new york where she was an executive with the harlem ywca engaged in a multitude of efforts to raise the educational occupational and cultural level of harlem long before the present sitins and demonstrationsindeed before some of the leaders of the present negro revolution were bornshe and others including a philip randolph were engaged in trying to qualify negroes for jobs in urban society and then in trying to secure jobs for them the reason the major department stores in new york have negro salespeople today is a credit to anna hedgemans pioneering work twenty years ago from her baptism in teaching and community work she went to washington as the executive director of the national council for a permanent fair employment practices commission she led the effort to enact legislation to make the wartime fepc permanent president trumans support of this legislation motivated mrs hedgeman to campaign and to raise funds from negroes across the country for trumans reelection in as a result she was appointed assistant to oscar ewing the head of the federal security agency mrs hedgeman later returned to new york city was an assistant manager in the first campaign of robert wagner for mayor of new york and after his election was invited to join his administration it soon developed that this was an invitation to become an uncle tom it was an invitation to have a negro presence adorn the city administration but not engage in any serious work or exercise any significant influence on the policies of the administration three different jobs were offered to mrs hedgeman one was a post already held by a negro she refused this on the grounds that it represented no gain for her people or recognition for her if she simply replaced another negro in a position that had already been allocated to negroes in accordance with the de facto ethnic quota system which prevails in so much of new york politics then she was asked if she would become a seventh deputy police commissioner again replacing a negro mrs hedgeman had no specific qualifications for such a position and would have been consigned there to a merely ceremonial role she would have no part of that in spite of the salary prestige and publicity to be gained by accepting finally she was tendered an office in the mayors cabinet which she did accept in the mayors cabinet in new york there are several positions of ministers without portfolio often acting as trouble shooters in city affairs reporting and directly responsible to the mayor without going through departmental channels in practice these offices are dispensed in a way that insures the ethnic balance the mayors administra tion needs to attract and hold support from the various ethnic blocs in the citys voting population in appointing mrs hedgeman mayor wagner may have felt especially inspired for here he had a representative of three of the citys neglected minorities mrs hedgeman was not only a negro but a woman and a protestant the day of the inauguration came and with suitable fanfare the cabinet was sworn in it was not long before mrs hedgeman discovered that she was not expected to show up at city hall or to maintain an office there her function was to decorate occasions when it seemed important for the image of the administration to have a negro or a woman or a protestant or some combination thereof on the scene even after being sworn in as assistant to the mayor she was again unsuccessfully offiered the police assignmentan inept attempt to relegate her to a nominal and vassal role there was some consternation at city hall in the davs and weeks that followed because of mrs hedgemans insistence that she wanted to be a functioning working member of the administration not a ceremonial occasional officer it became clear that she was not interested in patronage for herself but in accomplishing something for her people eventually as might have been predicted anna hedgeman resigned from the wagner administration her life of authentic concern shows her to have been a pioneer in the present civil_rights demonstrations which have now forever established that negroes will no longer be appeased by promises platitudes and nominal recognition it was anna hedgeman who years ago had foreseen before almost anyone else either black or white the gravity of the estrangement between negroes and whites in american society especially in the urban north one afternoon she said to me very few negroes and white people are in real communication with each other those of us who can and do speak honestly as you and i do must keep in touch and help others to learn the quality of communication necessary if the races are to be reconciled this will be very hard and will become more difficult as the crisis deepens but that just makes it all the more important that we keep in touch i remember not long ago spending hours on the telephone receiving calls in turn from some of the negro leaders in the civil_rights struggle and then from some of the white church leaders who had somewhat belatedly and somewhat suddenly become committed to direct action in the struggle the calls were distressing because they showed how radical the estrangement of the races is even perchance especially in the churches there were two sorts of calls on the occasion that i recollect one kind came from white ecclesiastical officers who reported that the churches had decided to enter into direct action in support of the civil_rights of negroes but they wanted to know whether this or that negro was the one with whom to discuss the matter the other kind of call came from negroes who having received inquiries from the white ecclesiastics wanted to know if they should bother to meet with them because they were not really sure that those who had called them could be trusted and they wanted to know if i trusted the white people who had been involved in such overtures this is not only proof of how wide the alienation between the races has becomeit is not even widely known who to begin to try to talk withbut it is also evidence of how fragile and inadequate the avenues of tolerance and humanism are for serious and candid communication between the races i remember also this is another type of example being invited more than two years ago to lecture at columbia law school on the racial crisis in the city especially as it pertained to politics i spoke before an audience of bright young white law students they listened to the lecture i thought in a rather sullen way the burden of the lecture is the burden of this chapter of my bookthat one who becomes somehow immersed in some of the visceral and brutal realities of the racial crisis cannot escape a premonition of chaos and imminent disaster what i had to report that night was later to become the substance of an article race religion and revenge published by the christian century in their issue of february pages to gave the speech and said i trust what as nearly as could figure out as a white man was and is the truth about the relations between races in the northern cities when i finished there were a lot of comments from the law students they fell roughly into two categories the first alleged that i had been too harsh and pessimistic about the relations between the races in america and these assertions were documented by the experiences of some of the students themselves such as the fact that several of them had been exposed to negroes in new yorktaxi drivers and waiters and the likeand had been treated by them in these situations with civility and courtesy after further discussion it soon became apparent to the students that the casual contacts they had experienced with taxi drivers elevator operators waiters and so on did not constitute significant nor even honest and honorable communication with negroes in the city so that line of attack on my paper was abandoned the line which took its place was much more revealing they said in effect well the trouble with you stringfellow is that you have lived so long among them that you have begun to think like they do their objection finally as far as i could comprehend it was that i by living and working those years in harlem had somehow ceased to be a white man or at least had lost the capacity and authority to speak as a white manthrough i suppose overexposure to negroes if that be the case let it be all this time i had thought that there is something unique about being a human being something which transcends all of our human differences and diversities whether of race or age or class or profession or sex or wealth or whatever and if it must come to pass in the agonizing tensions and fears which characterize the racial crisis that any white man regards meor any one of a number of other white menas traitors to our race m and heritage then let that be it can only prove how deep and pathetic the estrangement of the races has become in this society so fond of boasting of its democracy and regard for humanity the estrangement is almost complete the proof of that is in the socalled white liberals of the north as much as or perhaps more than in the white segregationists of the south for these white northerners in the professions of liberalism toward the negroes suffer from a mentality which still assumes that white men retain the initiative in the racial crisis and that white men have and should continue to have the prerogative of determining the pace of the negros emancipation and the terms of his reception into full citizenship what do the negroes want they ask not discerning that this very question embodies the essence of white supremacy even though perhaps it be a more subtle and more genteel white supremacy than that characteristic of the irrational and crude segregationists of the deep south that questionwhat do the negroes wantpresupposes that what the negroes want is for the whites to give as if in this society the whites retain some right to dispense to the negroes or to anybody else what is theirs by birthright and citizenship and in truth by their common humanity white men have no authoritylegally or morallyto rule upon any demands of negroes white men have only to acknowledge and honor at last the same civil and human rights for negroes that they treasure for themselves yet the condescension among northern whites is still conspicuous and one might add obnoxious it is in its own fashion much more embittering and provocative much more incitive and diehard than the rabid traditional and sometimes pathological racism of the south it not only assumes that whites hold the initiative in the resolution of the racial crisis which is a fantasy since the initiative has now conclusively passed into the hands of the negroes as the past few years attest but it also still treats participation by white citizens in the civil_rights struggle as a good causeas a cause that ought to be supported by people of principle and conscience just as aid to refugees might also be supported with time and money or just as the work of the united nations might be upheld with words and occasional actions the only thing is that this is no good cause not at least in the sense that refugee assistance or apologetics for the united nations may be the negro revolution is no ordinary charity to which enlightened whites should give their donations and their names the negro revolution is rather an authentic revolution in which the whole prevailing social order of the nation is being overturned in the face of three hundred years of slavery segregation discrimination and de facto racism throughout the country every important institution in the public life of the nation education employment unions churches entertainment housing politics commerce investment welfare transportation public accommodationsis immediately affected by this revolution and this revolution will not spend its course until every such institution surrenders to its objectives the only real question is the means by which the inevitable integration of american public life will take place peaceably or violently realistically or obstinately today or tomorrow this is no good cause in the conventional sense of the term and to treat it as suchas so many northern liberals still dois in itself condescending and stupid how then should white people especially those in the north treat this issue first of all they must surrender their prerogative of decision first of all they must face the fact that the real decisions determining how the racial crisis will be resolved are for the negroes to make first of all they must give up the idea that they have and should continue indefinitely to have the prerogatives of white supremacy first white people must die to that mentality by suffering the hostility and rejection of negroes and by risking their lives and the future of this society in the hands of the negroes that is the preface to reconciliation between black men and white men why i fight for america in the wake of the emmett till slaying in august the question was first asked me by a german taxi driver as we sped along the autobahn in his country during december of that same year a womans refusal to move to the rear of a bus in montgomery alabama made the world sit up and take note it also made me a target for the question as asked by a spaniard in barcelona in when nine childrens efforts to enter school created chaos in a city when pictures ol a negro minister being kicked by segregationists in little rock glared from billboards in paris a frenchman asked me the same question news of the freedom rides did not stop when the busses did the same news traveled on to foreign countries the sitins walkins and standins were launched in the states but like long range missiles their impacts were heard in distant lands when a lone negro braved hostile crowds to register in a southern college federal marshals were not the only ones who watched so did the world now as i stand on this little race is engaged in a constant struggle a great fight to secure first class citizenship but our fight is not a lawless one it is protected nay precipitatedby the laws of our country the constitution the bill of rights and all the rulings that combine to form the just laws of the land the very freedom for which we are fighting springs from those laws and those laws give us the right to fight it is then only fitting and proper that we should serve in the armed forces of our country for there are those of us who must make contributions to the higher cause so that all the other causes will not lose their meanings i am making my contribution i fight to protect those laws during my brief travels i have found that men of all races can live together in peace i recall the times when i have had friends who were like brothers though they were not of my race those friendships cause me to think that brothers are not always of the same blood kith and kin but are sometimes born in the minds of men who live together in strange and foreign lands my prayer is that such births will occur in the minds of my countrymen that we all might reach the scale where the chords of our living will blend into a harmony that sings the greatness of america i fight because i feel that my prayer is not in vain and i stand on this little pacific isle with that feeling growing stronger each time i look westward towards my home by wyatt t walker the basic approach of v the nonviolent revoluj tion will not change it will be marked by increasing frequency and intensity of activity it is already evident that the south will not be the chief focus of activity the entire nation will feel the brunt of nonviolent forces demanding freedom now the south will see most of the activity focused on schools and public accommodations the norths activity will center chiefly on employment and housing in no event will any form of discrimination go unchallenged it has become remarkably clear in the national community that we have a problem a few months ago race relations was only the concern of a small minority and a handful of agitators significantly that which was kindled in birmingham amid fire hoses and police dogs and given a tremendous vote of confidence at the lincoln memorial on august has drawn active support from the great majority that had been at best uncommitted hundreds of thousands have come off the fence the religious forces have become involved as never before birmingham has become a watershed of history in the nonviolent revolution much of our conversation in years to come will be dated with such phrases as before birmingham and since birming i i yet with all of its significance birmingham has not been quite enough to convince the powers that belocally statewide and nationallythat an atmosphere of urgency exists despite the civil_rights package being the most sweeping civil_rights legislation ever proposed the political overtones of the elections seem much too apparent in the face of the seven bombings since the birmingham agreement including that which cost the lives of six and the injury of a score more the department of justice is still using policy as a guide line instead of preventive measures being invoked there is still only the disposition to give ambulance service southern racist political figures must be made to understand that the federal court orders are to be enforced partv affiliation and concerns notwithstanding who might gainsay that if barnett had been jailed during the travesty at the university of mississippi perhaps we would not have had to contend with georee c wallace our kid glove treatment of the real anarchists and subversivesthe barnetts and the wallaceshas cost us a terrible price in human life paradoxically i submit that in the one single instance where the federal government has moved it has been against negroes intimately involved in the desegregation movement how despicable that slater king dr anderson and other leaders of the nonviolent movement in albany georgia were placed under federal indictment for obstructing justice and perjury there is no federal indictment against the sheriff who caned attorney c b kingbut it is under investigation there is no indictment against the peace officer who bludgeoned mrs king into unconsciousness and killed her unborn childbut it is under investigation there is no indictment against countless acts of police brutality and murder that take place all over the southbut it is under investigation so now the department of justice takes to trial the leadership of a local community who have sparked the fight against the illegal system under which they are forced to live the maximum penalty andor years in prison organized labor has failed in at least one respect that can be pointed up by the experience of danville virginia in danville as in other southern cities the legal maneuvering goes on endlessly picketing an established protest device is being harassed with all kinds of restrictions and codes now that negroes have employed it in their fight against segregation the dan river mills with all of its force of organized labor has been absolutely silent when the right to picket was limited by city ordinance to x number of pickets when they wake up twenty years or maybe ten yearsfrom now and automation is full blown they will be crying to high heaven about the unconstitutionality of picketing restrictions that were born solely to keep black people psychologically and economically enslaved where are their voices now the time to speak is now but the beleaguered forces of the negro community have not heard from organized labor in danville other quarters of the national community have been equally unconcerned thus the freedom now forces must devise some way to command the attention of the national community in order that all the emoluments of citizenship are secured once now and forever one of the ways the attention of the nation might be claimed to spur a creative and immediate resolution to the problem could well be the implementation of a national program of economic withdrawal a massive refusal to buy on the part of the negro community and others of good will would throw the business world into shock maybe then and only then will the nations financial leaders exert some initiative in eliminating the evils of segregation and discrimination this is not as farfetched as it may appear the ebb and flow of finance in every community determines to a large degree the character and morality of its politics in countless communities the impact on the flow of dollars by the nonviolent movement has been a strong leverif not the strongest leverto alter the traditional patterns in race relations it has already been strongly inferred that a national conference on selective buying may soon be called the strategic choice of consumer commodities to serve as targets nationally could even get some attention from the moguls of wall street someone has said appropriately money does not talk it screams just consider how swiftly segregated patterns could be altered if in threequarters of the nation the struggle for selfrespect and human dignity has as an ally the forces of the business world though it is a seldommentioned fact business leaders have a responsibility to national morality or again has the moment come in the development of the nonviolent revolution when we will be forced by delays and painfully slow results on some appointed day at some appointed hour to literally immobilize the nation until she acts on our plea for justice and morality is the day faroff when major transportation centers will be strangled by mass acts of civil disobedience airports train stations bus terminals the traffic of large cities interstate commerce will be halted by the bodies of witnesses nonviolently insisting on freedom now i suppose a nationwide work stoppage might attract enough attention to persuade some one to do something to get this monkey of segregation and discrimination off our backs once now and forever will it take one or all of these of course there is always the fast unto death why not are we not daily politically and economically strangled to death by the thousands under the present system finally let me say there is no guarantee that equality of opportunity will come this year or within the next five its possible that it may not come in teneven at the risk of national disaster but even if it is deferred another years the cry will remain freedom now in the midst of daily humiliation where we are still forced to be guided in ordinary pursuits by signs that say white and colored even if it must be said through clenched teeth our cry remains freedom now as we recognize the realities of continuing job discrimination and know full well that we are still the last hired and the first fired even with no prospect of paycheck at the end of the week unfailingly our demand persists freedom now when we return to the negro ghetto at night weary and footsore after a day of fruitless searching for a decent home in a neighborhood where we are able to pay the going price despite the frustration of open and subtle housing discrimination we must insist freedom now there are times when we will tire of endless litigation state by state county by county school board by school board plaintiff by plaintiff in order that the children bom of the loins of our bodies may have the opportunity of a desegregated education our cry remains freedom now there will be moments when we will not be riding the crest of great demonstrations that lead to success our efforts will sputter and utterly fail candidates for jail will be scarce sufficient bond money nonexistent apathy deeply entrenched but our cry must remain freedom now our flesh will tear under the assault of police dogs our bodies will literally break under the forces of billy sticks we will not be able to stand before fire hoses our spirits will be crushed by reprisal and fear but our cry must remain freedom now even as we stand in the rubble of burned and bombed churches or at the bier of a slain medgar evers or hear the anguished cry of little girls dying in sunday school and the prospect of the damning of the unborn our cry must remain freedom now by bill russell bill russell the dark gainly and responsible man who is center and cocaptain of the boston celtics the perennial champions of the national basketball association is without question one of the most remarkable athletes of our time yet he regards his life up to now as a waste i dont consider anything i have done he has said as contributing to society i consider playing professional basketball as marking time the most shallow thing in the world russell is not biting the hand that feeds him and his family he is too canny and practical a man he is not sullying basketball in any meaningful sense either it is rather that he is close to years old and has made certain judgments that seem to him so correct and obvious that he is not afraid to enunciate them basketball or any other sport is at bottom frivolous and the imposition of being a negro at this moment in history is an obligation that cannot be met on the floor of the boston garden where and how he can fulfill it russell does not yet know in six full seasons with the celtics russell has been selected four times by the players in the league as the nbas most valuable player including the last three years in succession on the other two occasions he was runnerup before russell joined the celtics late in hey had led the league in scoring for the five foregoing years but nonetheless each year the celtics had been eliminated in the divisional playoffs in russells tenure boston has won six of seven championships the only year it lost out russell was injured during the final playoff series and did not play in two of the last three games his contributions to his teams welfare are however often unsung not long ago for instance it waswho elserussell who found a teammates contact lens on the court do have to do everything for this club he said with an indulgent smile the foundation of russells brilliant play however is not blocking shots rebounding or his other purely physical skills it is rather his admirable mind and purpose his intelligencehe knows what to do with the balland his pride people dont realize says auerbach that this is a brain out there people think of him as just a big guy with fantastic coordination but he approaches being a genius once the game starts i admire his mind off the court too auerbach adds not entirely facetiously because hes smart enough to understand me to sum it all up says heinsohn hes got a hell of a lot of pride when hes playing his game it makes us almost unbeatable and the secret to the thing is that he gets himself up so often hes so nervous before a game he upchucks he wants to be the best in everything he does says cocaptain frank ramsey he hates to lose as long as the teams winning hes completely happy as long as hes playing real great ball were winning then hes the life of the party you hear that laugh miles around hes only moody with himself although bill russell has much to laugh about and does in his high rackety way there are only two things that could make me quit coaching says auerbach my wife and russells laugh he is at intervals an angry dissatisfied and aloof man of uncommon principle and is no less remarkable as a person than he is as an athlete russells scraggly beard is a telling indication of the man not only is russell nearly feet and blackcircumstances obviously over which he has no controlbut he has deliberately set himself further apart by being one of the few professional athletes to wear a beard ask him why he grew it and he will reply in time if he feels like it ive thought about it and ive thought about it why did i wear the beard why do i its part of this thingive always fought so hard to be different and i am different without even trying and maybe its just my own little revolution it just isnt done in polite circles in a sense but i do think its part of my personality when i first joined the celtics i shaved the beard off i did it on my own it was none of their business and if i had valued their opinion i would have asked them i made a concession to conformity at that time then i grew it back after we won the first championship i let heinsohn shave it off and then i grew it back again it was a very childish thing in the sense of defiance i wear it now to let people know i am an individual i do think for myself and im very opinionated contrary to popular belief im a living thinking breathing human being they say i owe the public this and i owe the public that what i owe the public is the best performance i can give period if someone asks me for an autograph i think its a waste but i sign them occasionally sometimes i just feel like being nice or it gets rid of them i personally dont care what people think of me i dont think i think any different than anyone else but i may act different one thing im not is a liar its not a matter of moralsmore a matter of ego i think too much of myself to misrepresent myself ill do anything i can for anyone as long as it doesnt hurt me but i have sympathy for very few people basketballthats all people want to talk to me about its a waste because they have nothing to say i resent people who talk to you and have nothing to say so i dont say anything hows the weather up there how are things on main street thats where i live what the heck kind of question is that you must be a basketball player because youre so tall just walk up and put it in eh no im not a basketball player i just kept growing what size bed do you sleep in i hate for people to get personal a big bed how much do you eat its ridiculous if you mind your own business life aint bad if you do the best you can thats the best you can do were a bunch of grown men playing a childs game its a childs game weve made into a mans game by complicating it silly isnt it we entertain people for x number of hours during the winter they may talk about it for a few minutes maybe an hour then its forgotten is this a contribution no analyze itits a silly game im also a silly man because i enjoy it i enjoy baseball too perhaps im a little dull it is not easy for a white man to understand or totally accept the vision of a black man skin is the hardest boundary the point is this bill russell or any other black man like him does not want the white mans sympathy or indeed his friendship what he wants is recognition and acceptance of himself as an individual a black individual who can meet the world on equal terms and fare unequally according to his merit a few things have happened russell says ive got three kids now a certain amount of responsibility to them i also have a certain amount of responsibility to a lot of other kids i give most negroes a certain amount of pride heres one of our guys doing all right they say the world cant be all bad that contribution is very shallow of course im practical where else but in basketball could i command this salary it is estimated in excess of man does what he has to but the contribution id like to make as a personto my kids and little black kids all over the worldis to make life better so their ambitions arent stifled when they face the world to give them the opportunity to do what theyre most skilled at i could have a burning ambition to give my kids a million dollars if i gave them that alone id be giving them nothing the most any kid can ask for says russell is to succeed or fail on his merits success and failure are relative everyone doesnt have presidential abilities and everyone cant be an allamerica it doesnt necessarily mean youre a failure my fathers a foundry worker this doesnt necessarily mean hes a failurebecause another persons father is a lawyer society needs both some people are going to be laborers but why say a man has to be a laborer because hes black one right we never had in this countrywe never had the right to be a failure or an individual why if one black man fails should all black men fail thats what the struggle is about whether its through love as with martin_luther_king or through pride as with the naacp or through hate as with malcolm_x and elijah muhammad what does the american negro want the editorials ask i find this very stupid were all products of our society and the acceptable standards are the same we want the same things when they write about birmingham the papers refer to outsiders and racial agitators to the black people of the us there is no such thing as an outsider theres been too much play on words in this country negroes have to earn their rights they say my oldest son buddha william felton russell jr was born on november suppose kids were born around boston that day why does my son have to earn any more than any of those kids i was bom on february why do i have to earn more than anyone else there used to be a lot of emphasis on the first negro to do this the first negro to do that its unimportant whos the first or whos the last the important thing is how many the rest is tokenism when thurgood marshall was made a judge it made me feel real good because he never attempted to disassociate himself like some educated negroes some negroes live in a twilight zone closing themselves off into a small white society the negro world doesnt concern them i feel sorry for themto an extent education is the acquiring of the ability to think for oneself anyone can get through college on memory courses if a negro judge says i dont think of myself as a negro just as a competent judge hes not facing life the way it is in our society its harder to face it the other way but you can sleep at nightevery night although everyone in his family is a life member of the naacp russell has not played a major role in any single negro organization he does not look upon himself as a leader and is uncomfortable in crowds he views the negro movement as being various in means but single in aim and feels that its factionalism is not divisive but a search for the most effective way i would have loved to go to birmingham russell says but im not passive sometimes i think i have tendencies to violence ive been mad enough to fight three times in my life and each time i wanted to kill the man you know the athletes i admire ted williams jackie robinson and sonny liston its easy to be easygoing and friendly to everyone i think a man has to be what he is if he feels good he is good if he doesnt he isnt im an admirer of floyd patterson too these are honest people in the sense of representing themselves some negro athletes dont show me much im disappointed in them they are politicians in the sense of saying the right things all the time if i went down there to birmingham and let someone spit on me and didnt do anything about it it wouldnt be me if you never really express dissatisfaction concretely people tend to ignore it if you believe in something youve got to say it this passive kick if it doesnt work how can they keep preaching it it is predicated on the premise that people are basically moral if they are right this is wonderful if they are wrong the religious phase of the movement will be destroyed if martin_luther_king is wrong he has failed as a leader maybe im becoming a fatalist or whatever you call it morality is a very large word morality and love have a lot in common who can really define it what is moral and what is immoral it is relative ive been reading about the black muslims a lot of things they say express the way i feel perfectly or rather a great deal of the things they say i cannot disagree with can the races get along yes will they get along thats the question the muslims say the white mans a devil i dont agree with that because i dont think there is such a thing as a devil they say the white man is evil i wonder about that in the sense that i wonder whether all men are evil i dislike most white people because they are people as opposed to dislike i like most black people because i am black i consider this a deficiency in myselfmaybe if i looked at it objectively detached myself it would be a deficiency in russell first went to black africa on a tour for the state department the continent had such an impact upon him that he bought part ownership of a rubber farm in liberia and named his baby daughter karen kenyatta after jomo kenyatta the prime ministerdesignate of kenya and onetime mau mau leader whom russell greatly admires russell is thinking quite seriously of settling in liberia i found a place i was welcome because i was black in stead of in spite of being black he says the basic problem in negro america is the destruction of race pride one could say we have been victims of psychological warfare in a sense in that this is a white country and all the emphasis is on being white whiter than white according to the law immigrants from northern european countries are more desirable than any others when a white man says his folks come from ireland he says it with a certain amount of pride he probably can trace his family tree for generations for whatever its worth this is not true of the american negro until the emergence of the independent african countries all we knew about africa was from the tarzan and jungle jim movies how stupid they made the natives one white mantarzanwas the best and smartest at everything even king kong after accepting the sacrifice of blacks for years when he was offered a white girl he didnt kill her he fell in love with her pride in being black was practically destroyed by seeing stupid things like this there was almost a sense of selfdegradation also until very recently the socalled negro elite was fairskinned the problem i see in africa is that it has to build a middle class all your great political and social changes have been brought about by the middle classmerchants artisans technicians africas needs are not necessarily administrators but people who can doplumbers toolanddiemakers draftsmen black africa is stepping from carrying things on the head to carrying them in airplanes theyve skipped the wheelbarrow the horse and buggy and practically railroads they have problems so immense where do you start you educate as many as you can but everyone who gets an education wants to be an administrator people have to realize there are stations in life forms of success everyone wants to have the ultimate success everyone cant have it someone must roll their sleeves up and go to work i find it a very perplexing problem whether i should go to africa or stay here ive thought about it a great deal if my contribution would be more concrete here no doubt i should stay here when i look at the struggle of the american negro i cant help but be very very proud with what weve had to work with weve done a pretty good job of surviving but we still have so far to go it would be a hell of a country its a great country as it is now we have to define great an ambiguous word great industrial empire standard of living i think it would be so much greater if everyone had an equal opportunity in every field there is no way to speculate how much brainpower this country has lost and we dont have to like each other to live together peacefully and equally have you ever read how in the time of drought all the animals use the same water hole the lions stay with the lions the tigers with the tigers the elephants live with elephants but they all use the same water hole of course because of his wealth and position russells experiences do not parallel those of most black men most of the time he lives on a white block in a white town has white babysitters and drives a lincoln continental convertible the fact that owning a big car is considered a negro stereotype does not concern russell ive passed the stage he says where i have to prove anything i happen to like watermelon too there may come a time when i have to ride a bicycle it wont bother me it just wont be as fast or convenient in boston russells celebrity is so great he can no longer enjoy himself at the ballpark or at night clubs he gets too much attention once in a while however the ineradicable fact of being black which he has never forgotten intellectually falls upon him and wounds him like a blow in the summer of russell said the other day i took my two sons to louisiana where i was born and lived for nine yearsto see my grandfather i make a reasonable living im a reasonable intelligent person i bathe regularly so im pretty much a normal human being but from the time i left washington dc we couldnt eat i had only driven the road once before so i was following the map staying on the main road we couldnt stop and eat or sleep i wasnt really hungry i was just trying to get food for my kids i wasnt interested in socializing or rubbing elbows some negro entertainers try to show the whites that they are nice people all of us are nice people but the movement is not a popularity contest i dont care if the waitress likes me when i go into a restaurant all i want is something to eat i drove a pretty nice car had a few hundred bucks on melegal tenderbut i couldnt stop to eat or sleep i bet any russian you name from khrushchev on down would have had a nice trip to louisiana what can you tell a kid and a kid no one can justify this to me customs and traditions and all that junk one of the greatest crimes is apathy im kind of hardheaded youre either against me or for me being neutral you support the status quo you see this going on you say thats sad it really shouldnt be say it to a few people and it makes you feel better this is apathy all i ask is that you practice good citizenship vote and try to accept people for what they are as persons if you do that you give everyone an equal chance if you come to me and say youre not prejudiced youre lying i think all whites feel guilty but im not sure they know what they feel guilty about bill russells life is founded on the facts that he is black was poor and grew taller than most men he was born in monroe la and moved to oakland calif when he was when he was his mother died he was raised by his father when my mother died russell says my father was a young man and he could very easily have shipped me and my brother off with relatives but we stayed together it wasnt all good and it wasnt all bad some of the bad things that happened i have come to understand when youre poor its a different world my brother used to run track did the in thats not badand my father came out one day and raced him with work shoes on my brother says he won and my father says he won and i say it was a dead heat its not important the important thing was that my father got in the race i remember this field in louisiana where the grass grew very tall sometimes wed all play hide and seekthe four of usin that field when it was time to go in my father would pick me up with one arm pick up my brother with the other arm my mother got on his back and he ran us all the way home everybody had a great time although russell is just now entering his prime as a player he often ponders quitting basketball when i think about it he says there are a lot of things to con sider but it never has anything to do with quitting on top first of all im very much afraid of airplanes secondly the game takes a lot out of me i call it a ninehour game two hours getting mentally prepared two hours for the game itself and five hours before i get to sleep sometimes even then i cant get to sleep i feel that if i dont have a good game we will probably lose and it will be my fault during the playoffs its a hour game people say floyd patterson should quit i dont think so because hes not champion hes not a failure i think its false values if a guy feels he has to quit on top there are few enough pleasures in life not to do the thing you want to do one of the saddest things that has happened to me russell said the other day is that in basketball so many good things have happened to me its hard to get a real thrill any more you know what i get excited about nowwhen my kids say funny things or i get two new speakers for my stereo although i had a perfectly good system before that in russells home in reading a boston suburb he has installed a stereo systemhe has lp albums and who knows how many sand some worth of electric trains are in the basement recently his wife rose began displaying some of russells basketball trophies around the house if it was up to me id put them away again russell says as far as im concerned there should be no pictures of the man of the house in his home and no trophies outside achievements dont belong in a family setting but rose has her own ideas too shes the finest person i ever met ive told her many times that if i was married to anyone else i wouldnt be married its difficult to live with a person of my character im moody and demanding in some ways inconsiderate in other ways im a pretty nice guy i think when bill russell permits you to get to know him you discover quickly that he is more than just a pretty nice guy you discover a firstrate and rewarding person and when you are talking to him or listening to him or beating him in gin rummyhes no ace at that gameyou do not think of him as a basketball player or a giant or a negro finally but as someone it is worth your while to be with by charles lbrizzi recently a young negro singer in performing an excerpt from the negro folk opera porgy and bess substituted mommy for mammy in the lyric it was a subtle change perhaps barely discernible to some but make no mistake the singer was exemplifying a deliberate attempt on the part of an organized pressure group to viewpoint regulate any and all references to american negroes which exist in the fields of literature and the performing arts the national association for the advancement of colored people is to be commended for its original program adopted in which states in part to uplift the negro men and women of the country by securing for them the complete enjoyment of their rights as citizens justice in the courts and equal opportunity in every economic social and political endeavor in the united states is the cold calculated and often brutal editing of classical works the way to accomplish such a program in their cries for civil_rights negroes often also cry for an identity or heritage that they have lacked equal rights is true but that they lack a heritage is grossly untrue their heritage in this country began in the th century the very day their ancestors arrived their heritage is evident in the showboats of the mississippi the songs of the south the genius of a booker t washington and the minstrels that spanned a century and the breadth of the nation their heritage is evident in the mark twain works and the unique revival meetings that exist today yet these are the very things that are being attacked as unrealistic undignified distorted or degrading by far these accusations are unfounded in the fields of literature and performing arts who can truly say that twains cherished negro characters in his books of late th century life are unrealistic or that stephen fosters beloved old black joe is undignified where is the distorted view of the character joe in the jerome kernoscar hammerstein ii musical version of edna ferbers showboat or the degrading aspect of a firstrate negro song and dance man still some continue to criticize such things and attempt to have them partially or completely eliminated from the american scene apart from literary injustice to deny these things is to deny the very heritage they strive to locate if all minority groups in the united states attempted to change or eliminate entirely all references to their particular groups in literature or the performing arts on this basis then the world would have to forget forever the major works of harold arlen harry golden john steinbeck william faulkner the famous borscht circuit and all of americas dialecticians how utterly bland would be the american culture then pressure groups should cease this senseless purge and concentrate on the true problems negroes face in the country today by carene jenkins today is the dividend of yesterdays investment todays ambition and the time and energy we are willing to spend to make it pay there is no other time given to do todays job than today the past is a matter of record which me may look back on the future is still ahead of us and may be looked forward to but neither of these lessen todays importance for the past was met with its own circumstances and no future can give us todays opportunity whether or not we use today it will passso gradual we need not stop saying today but let us remember that in this same manner centuries have passed this should help us to realize todays importance the past belonged to those who met its challenge the future belongs to those who prepare to meet its challenge we owe it to the past to improve where it is needed and we owe the future todays worthwhile investment therefore as a summation of our heritage and our great hope our past and future today is ours the other enemycomplacency the freedom rides the fnnt freedom songs the i very a r f freedom and s ght f ltlg awaited dream enroute toward reality this comforts my heart and nourishes my soul but deep in my mind im troubled by the question i ask j so much has been written justifiably so about the inhumanity of white americans toward his black v brother and yet i see another enemy just as ruthless and as omni present as my oppressorthis enemy being that uncourageous contaminating stifling state of complacency characteristic of so many of my black brothers this despite the summer of discontent and the energetic efforts of dedicated leaders and faithful followers i see this state as a dwelling in dishonesty and i could only entitle one to adopt it if i were convinced that he would not associate himself as a part of the victory when it has come to past perhaps this motivates my protest i see the complacent as one yho is not truly unaware certainly vnot unable to grasp the scent of freedom and i believe he will find it humanly impossible to pretend not to share the spirit of overcoming when that day comes shining through the line of defense hed so boldly assert would most probably be what do you mean i dont care no this is not at all what i mean certainly he cares what i know of humanity makes it almost impossible for me to believe that an american negro could truly not care deep down inside he has to care but what makes one man complacent and another not the complacent one simply hasnt the courage to admit his care to express his concern and to face the reality of himself he lacks the strength to recognize and seek release from selfoppression and he must do so before he can contribute to the immobilization of his oppressors the complacent will ask why my pen attacks him instead of attacking my oppressor but does he not realize that he is a tool of the oppressor is he so unaware of the role he is playing as opposed to the role he could play i dont suggest that each of us should or could exert the bravery of martin luther king the dedication of james forman or the militancy of james baldwin but i do submit that these leaders depend on each of us for tfheir inspiration i further submit that our very manhood obligates us to support the cause that means o much to each of our lives since my initial exposure to the realities of our society ive harbored deep convictions about the plight of my people in although at a very tender age i was quite aware of the supreme court decision one might say ive grown along with our protest but with more exposure to this reality i was also forced to see this other enemy complacency i used to wonder when we as a people would act i long to see us unified and to see our leadership truly lead im grateful that much of this is factual today but yet i cant ignore the lingering complacent and ive found him to be shockingly present despite the thunder of an awakened people i returned to these united states during last crucial summer after spending the past year overseas as a member of the armed forces during this time i followed the news reading everything available and upon being discharged i returned to my hometown chicago with a heart rejoicing with the prospects of a unified people ive seen much to be proud of but i couldnt ignore the obvious chicago is probably quite representative of my people for if there exists a melting pot for negroes my hometown most certainly qualifies it didnt take long for me to gather the feeling of the people and though i salute many i have no qualms about my criticism of the others i speak of those who say were making a spectacle of ourselves were not really bad off james baldwin is just mad and statements similar to these i can only think of them as victims but i long to see them reached because such a thinking has for so long victimized my race we owe it to our unborn to be more realistic certainly i alone havent seen and heard these things and surely it disturbs many of us what must james forman feel when he walks the street the taste of a cell fresh in his mouth and comes face to face with complacency what hurt must the struggling although ailing roy wilkins feel when he is confronted with this most difficult of enemies though a negligible enemy perhaps in one man the force of an army when totaled i recall an incident that might have provoked or at least intensified my desire to speak out it occurred on thursday evening august the day after the beautiful march on washington on this evening i attended a core rally with the featured speaker being james baldwin there was a pretty good crowd of devoted negroes and awakened caucasians in attendance but among this crowd with the exception of one clergyman i saw not one person i knew i was bom in chicago my existence has in no way been sheltered i know many people but where were they where was just one of them on this evening just one day after the most touching event of my lifetime i was reassured that my convictions were justified i must have walked away that night compelled to write this article i wish it had not been necessary have i answered the question no this has not been my intention ive only presented it the answer lies in the hearts and souls of my brothers i only know that when i think of the progress made i think also of the progress that could be made it can be made i dont suggest that everyone should picket i dont prescribe the organization one should join and i dont pretend to symbolize the nobility of a negro i only know that there is a spiritual beauty in joining hands and singing we will overcome and i firmly believe we shall we have shared oppression and if we share the responsibilities our goals demand so much sooner will we share the victory there is honor in taking the side of righteousness our cause is right rise above your barricade and you wont regret it a middleclass negro said to me recently ive gotit made i cant believe a man has such a small appetite how dangerous complacency charles sumner yankee president johnson could use charles sumner in the united states senate today he was beaten unconscious to the senate floor by a south carolina congressman in for his fiery opposition to slavery he battled for the admission to the senate of a negro from mississippi in and won by a vote of to he pestered president abraham lincoln into issuing the emancipation proclamation converting the war between the states into a moral crusade to end the indignities heaped upon negroes in america a warweary lincoln once said resignedly sumner you are always six weeks ahead of me he demanded an end to racial segregation in the public schools of the district of columbia as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee in the lincoln administrations he guided through congress a treaty with great britain abolishing the slave trade he achieved the recognition of haiti and liberia as independent nations he secured fair employment for negroes in federal servicefirst as mail carriers for the post office department he fought the th amendment protecting negro suffrage on the grounds that it was unnecessary congress had the power he contended to enact a protective law without a constitutional change anything for human rights is constitutional there can be no state rights against human rights who was charles sumner you hear his name today only in the angry howls of southern segregationists who know an enemy when they hear of one you see his name only on the sumner tunnel under boston harbor but charles sumner was the united states senator from massachusetts from to succeeding daniel webster upon the latters appointment as secretary of state one hundred years ago at the risk of life and limb and his political future he was saying there can be but one liberty and one equality the same in boston and new orleans the same everywhere throughout the country to the negro people even then he was advising fight for full freedom now i trust that no excess of benevolence will make you consent to any postponement of those equal rights which are still refused stand firm the politicians will then know that you are in earnest and will no longer be trifled with victory will follow soon and the good cause be secure forever the civil_rights forces in congress today could use a man like charles sumner old jims yankee son you know dont you that jim crow has a blood relative living in other parts of the country yes this mr james s crow is old jims own son but if you should ever men tion old jim to him he would blush and vehemently deny any kinship whatsoever to the notorious jim crow and all of his friends without exception would warmly support him in his denial they would all forcefully assert that there is absolutely no family relationship between the two but old jim will tell you differently old jim is a southerner and proud of it granting that he was actually born in the north as a few people claim he was no one has ever yet accused him of being a damn yankee unquestionably he was nurtured in dixie where he grew up to become for many decades her undisputed ruler with his bedsheet horsewhip noose and shotgun and he dotingly looks forward to living there forever some observers say however that he is fast growing old and crochety others even state bluntly that he is already senile and that he has just about lived out his historically allotted time his characteristic reply to all such scurrilous and outrageous observations is a raucous roar of defiance and a tantrum of violence he loudly swears that he is still as capable and vigorous as ever yet deep in himself old jim realizes that he is not as popular as he used to be that his power and influence are rapidly declining and that his days are numbered naturally this all hurts himand irritates him his formerly complacent hauteur has now become nervous and defiantand reckless although he has more detractors and critics now than ever before he still has lots of friends and supporters he is very widely known at least by reputation not surprisingly if you understand the popular psychology he has admirers and supporters all over the countrynot just in the south and many who will no longer support him openly will gladly support him clandestinely his most articulate followers especially those in the south agree wholeheartedly with old jim that he is still able to do his work as well as he ever did if only those outside agitators would stay away and quit stirring up trouble everything was lovely they claim until these troublemakers invaded the magnolia groves according to a popular legend mr james s crow early fell out with his father over the question of racial segregation but old jim stoutly avers that he and his son never had any fundamental differences regarding a philosophy of life their differences he maintains always were and still are essentially differences of form rather than of purpose plainly the son thinks his father is unsophisticated and crudea back number and old jim for his part always ends any discussion of his son with the contemptuous snort hypocrite if you ask mr james s crow what his middle initial stands for he will invariably smile furtively and reply that it is only an initial but old jim will tell you bluntly that his sons middle name is segregationist mr james s crow who is not so provincial as his father maintains residence in the east north and west those who claim to know him intimately will tell you unqualifiedly that he even has an abiding ambition to establish a residence in the south some day when old jim becomes too decrepit to wield any significant influence and to take over the management of his fathers business and operate it along the same lines as his own in manners and appearance the crows are quite different brusque in manner old jim has never at least until recently given a tinkers damn about appearances in sharp contrast mr james s crow is iave and deeply concerned about appearancesespecially about apraances thats why so many people think there is definitely o kinshio between the two and mr james s crow is ever ready accentuate these contrasting superficialitiesand to call attention to them so he often excoriates old jim publicly yet observers who have closely followed the careers of both of them say unhesitatingly that mr james s crow is unquestionably a chipalbeit a polished oneoff the old block scratch beneath the surface they advise and you will discover the old jim crow in him instead of using old jims brute force and his unconstitutional state and local laws mr james s crow they claim seeks to substitute psychological conditioning and social manipulation to accomplish essentially the same endsde facto segregation and domination of course old jim invariably retaliates in kind and at length to his sons public abuse of him but in doing so he always unwittingly admits to his own execrable immorality by accusing his son of being equally as bad as he himself isand in many respects even worse old jim prides himself on his frankness says he never puts on airs he says if people dont like him as he is they can get the hell out of there and go back wherever they came fromor somewhere else people who are always carpin about him are just damned agitators and trouble makers anyway recently however many reports have been circulated falsely maliciously and slanderously according to old jim that his friends and supporters have successfully pressured him into sprucing up a bit when he knows that important yankee company is coming to dixie and now some scoffing jokesmith has garnished these reports with the story that old jim once tried using a little shaving lotion and hair oil on the slybut that he completely forgot the deodorant in marked contrast mr james s crow studiously observes the amenities of life and his grooming is impeccable these qualities together with his keen appreciation of the importance of good public relations give him the ability to make friends and influence people so like his aged father he also has numerous friends and supporters in all parts of the country many many more in fact than his father has in truth many of old jims former devotees who found it increasingly embarrassing to openly support him any longer in his mounting vituperation and violence have now turned to mr james s crow who has become the last best hope for the respectable people who seek to keep the substance of segregation but without its opprobrious name for mr james s crow moves always in an aura of accepted respectability he associates only with the best people and he has free access to the highest circles of finance commerce trade industry politics education communication and all other policymaking aspects of social life in this country through generally obliging news media he pays voluble lip service to the familiar and popular slogans of a democratic societyfreedom liberty equality fraternity mr james s crow is of course emphatically opposed to jim crows practices but he is warmly in favor of states rightswhich in practice means the rights of alabama and mississippi for example to disfranchise exploit degrade and terrorize certain citizens in order to maintain an old custom of segregation and domination he claims you cant legislate moralitybut strangely he never advocates repealing all the laws now in effect against such types of immorality as murder arson theft bribery slander prostitution and cruel treatment of children he says you cant change a venerable custom with lawsbut he is perfectly willing for the states to be permitted the right to use the law to bolster the cruel unconstitutional outmoded and crumbling customs of racial discrimination and segregation and he seems to have forgotten that the british successfully used laws to end the very highly valued old melanesian custom of headhunting mr james s crow says that property rights are basic to all other rights doesnt a person without any property still have some human rights by this he means specifically for example that a restaurant owner who had to get a permit before he could even construct a building on his own private land who had to construct the building in compliance with a city governments strict specifications who then had to be licensed by an agency of government to prepare and serve food to the public under certain specified regulations and who has to let a government agency inspect his property at willthis multiregulated property owner must now for the sake of the ultimate freedom and liberty of all of us be left unbridled and even be protected by the government in his inalienable right to freely use this otherwise highly regulated property to refuse service to any of the public that he was licensed to serveif he doesnt happen to like their complexion briefly mr james s crow and his supporters with their own immediate freedoms and liberties and profits and jobs and careers all apparently secure as long as the people are generally contented view this country as the best of all possible countriesand one that would soon be much better if the nigras would only be patient and quit rocking the boat in midstream our nigras you know have made wonderful progress during the last hundred years but would mr james s crow and his supporters be content with the negro peoples social status and their severely restricted civil_rights and liberties with their pay checks and their housing and their health educational and job opportunities oh of course not well it does make a difference doesnt it or does it a great deal it seems depends on whose ox is hobbled whose children are deprived anyhow in a nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal jim crow and mr james s crow are both comically and tragically anachronistic the words the facts and the future few negroes and fewer whites believe that our founding fathers thought of the negro for one minute when they framed our constitution in fact a number of nationality groups and races were not considered the freedomnow movement was not guilty of prejudice against the negro nor any other group and there was no oversight when the good men of the american revolution used the word men they meant men like themselves white anglosaxon protestants of course a few polish french and jews contributed to the revolutionary cause but their insignificant number at that time precluded any serious threat or any necessity of thinking of them as being unlike americans but back to the negro his survival during slavery and up to today depended on his ability to understand what the white man was saying and more importantly what he really meant by his words uncle toms shifty headscratching mumbling ways permitted him to survive without offending slave insurrections contumacious blacks and even docile ones were severely dealt with in order to avoid the appearance of offending the negro had to base his knowinga knowing on which his life depended upon something far more reliable than the word he heard spoken he learned to listen to the voice and how the word was spoken tonal patterns inflections and a host of nonverbal cues such as facial expressions movements of the hands arms legs and even ears in short he became sensitive to the whole man and not merely to the orderly procession of words from his masters mouth the slave also learned to delay response to feign confusion and misunderstanding his headscratching shuffling feet and squinting eyes placed the burden of continuing instruction or explanation upon the master and if the master talked long enough rephrasing restating and broadening the slave knew what he wanted with this knowledge he knew what role to play a safe answer was to tell his master what he already knew or what he wanted to hear the former a primitive nondirective therapeutic technique by fading into his environment as an innocuous at times troublesome but profitable child he survived and the white man was happy with his flattering image of his nigger perhaps never aware of being duped but if the master was aware of his slaves mask he preferred in all probability the ruse to the blackfaced humanity behind the mask the negro felt secure and triumphant his artifice his cunning and yes his intelligence bought another breath another day until today the mask also served the white master it heaped together with all the other convenient reasons was just one more proof of the negros difference inferiority subhumanness the mask also helped to allay the guilt that all good christians reportedly suffer when committing evil the nigger became a thing apart a thing unlike anything else and god willed it too to preserve this moral armor the master would have endured a hundred more masks rather than face the man behind the mask or himself to think this survival technique an unconscious one passed on from mother to child is to oversimplify the problem yet i can only suppose that this technique had its beginning on a nonconscious level i do know that it has worked its way into the conscious and still persists today among certain classes of negroes unfortunately this trait appears to have been learned for it does not seem to be present among the ninetofive ivyleagued negro what a pity it is not an inherited trait then both the black and white bigots could have a field day for the black bigots could claim this trait as a badge of superiority and the white ones as indisputable proof of inferiority but in the slums this awareness this defense is ingrained long before grimm if grimm ever makes it even today among some negroes the phrase read between the lines has great meaning or the injunction to the young when white folks talk you just listen and listen well then you know what to say most of the time you just dont know and i mean you dont know even when you do naturally as some negroes prove themselves by meeting certain middleclass standards such as becoming educated speaking properly presenting the proper emotional expression or lack of one attending the right church and viewing art as something separate and distinct from life they have become more sensitive to the literal meaning of words today the negros social perception is dull or he is ignoring the implicit statements of whites the young middleclass negro is demanding that all words regarding his life liberty and pursuit of happiness be explicitly stated he has renounced the understanding bought by the masterslave conspiracy for today the young negro is not motivated by sheer survival this he takes for granted since todays negro refuses to cooperate and wear the mask the white man is alone with his guilt his conscience and himself and he too often damns the negro all the more for causing him the inconvenience of changing his mind and facing himself this returns us to the constitution with all its promises the bill of rights making the world safe for democracy and on and on the young middleclass negro collegeeducated and all is just as surely shaped in the middleclass mold as though he were white and really believed that he could become president albeit in forty years unfortunately he doesnt believe that he can become president nor that all the slogans and sacred documents include him in their promises not even tomorrow he knows that in the north and south he is excluded in the north he is permitted to read these freedom words but told not now in the south until recently his best bet was to feign illiteracy the southerner knows what many white northerners are beginning to fear that to give an inch is to give all having been afforded a good christian education which teaches that every word has an exact meaning the young enlightened negro pushes for the literal rights which are synonymous with america many may explain this push for constitutional rights and the negros recognition of his dignity as a man by the rise of african nations educational achievement world war ii and other pulsations within the last ten to twenty years all of these conditions no doubt ripened the moment for the freedomnow movement but the negro also believes something else something far more advantageous and equally encouraging no american white would dare exclude him literally from his birthright it is this belief which has fired the rise momentum and contagion of the present drive for equality although ideally a christian country and prizing that image both the white man and negro know that christianity takes a back seat to the customs and meanness of the times but the negro believes that just as with democratic ideals the white man must have his word and his image even though they bear little resemblance to reality americas democratic armor now on display and for sale throughout the world is rarely supported by the lofty idealism usually it is supported out of fearthe fear that no group is safe in america if the literal meaning of the sacred words is changed for in spite of the myth about america being a melting pot america as everyone knows is a molding pot no man is safe who is too different and there are too many different groups who are momentarily resting from attack because now it is the negros hour now i know there are champions of the everythingisallrightwithamerica school im aware of the refrigerators collapsing houses and even aspirin consumption in this country im more aware of and indelibly impressed by what it is to be black in america for most negroes have heard the white mans comments i like negroes but jews i just cant stand them or the poor white trash are the lowest meanest things on the earth you just dont know them they just dont want to be any better ive cringed at the venom hate and utter subhumanness that have been dumped on the poor white trash perhaps whites cant accept the idea that even a white man can be poor and unlike the vaunted mold i dont know strangely ive found myself defending them knowing too well that their love for me is shorter than the hair on the bottom of my feet but it is this hate this need to hate that troubles me and more it sickens me making it impossible for me not to believe that hate and fear are the cement which binds americans too often i have heard whites malign the catholics italians polish and other nonanglosaxon protestants who cant quite disappear into the great molding pot and what is more revolting is to see the downtrodden of europe the starving the oppressed the persecutedbecome the oppressor and the persecutor and far too many of them do one generation from the hells of europe they now in best animalrioting form hurl their outrageous abuse at the negro moving on their street or sending his children to their neighborhood school the maddening yelps in these northern cities are biledup by these lovers of freedom these escapees from tyranny these goodbravehungarian freedomfighters and all the others who can now afford the luxury of tyranny and yet they are partially blameless for to become a good american and become acceptable in the middleclass mold you must hate niggers and these good people would become good americans even if it required duplicating belsen today with full knowledge that the american mood is not quite willing to accede to him his full rights the young american negro is pushing not the conscience but the literal meaning of the word captured in the declaration of independence other sacred documents and promises which symbolize america and propaganda beamed to the enslaved of the world to the crossroads either america admits him as a full citizen on a fulltime basis or else sweeps away the shortlived dream and marches him to the gas chamber if anyone has a right to be bitter and demand all now its the middleclass negro living on the fringe ofor in the suburbs consider his sacrifices he gave up the oldtime religion and jazz unless its progressive and can be intellectualized he has chained his feet and soldered his joints no part of him will ever again sway to the blues or the rhythms of the field hand he has become an observer of art and a patron of the arts watermelon is taboo especially if eaten in public he will forever deny himself greens corn bread chittlins now a delicacy sold in gourmet shops and a host of other downhome pleasures hes going to become a packageeating casseroleslopping tv dinner if it kills him which it wont but the negro isnt unique in his adaptation theres something in america which levels and destroys differences the second generation of the foreignborn quickly became ashamed of their parents accent they wanted to become americans everyone moves toward the great mystical goddess equalitarianism and what is her boon now that the negro has his turn maybe hell find out in the suburban neighborhoods in which the negro has gained a foothold he has moved with astonishing alacrity to become the best middleclass neighbor youve ever seen hes become a slave to lawns barbecue pits houses children and dogs a couple of years ago a white friend of mine had considered moving from his suburban commune while wavering and arguing with himself and everyone else negroes began moving into his suburb he thought a new life was coming to the community the infusion of vitality so he stayed a new life did come just like the whitebut black the negroes outdid the whites their love of lawns house and respectability was aweinspiring whites should welcome them into any community they soon become the standard after making such a sacrifice it is no wonder that the middleclass negro is bitter hes divested himself of everything familiar on the promise of finally making it his peculiar desperation will not permit him to go back to the poisonous past he has no choice but to demand his rights and to demand vehemently and what about the slums this summer i walked the streets of the northern ghetto the moods there are blacker than the faces you pass on the street the middleclass negro leaders especially those of status and years would like to slow down and arbitrate but if they do theyll have no sympathy from the ghetto for no one can count the ghetto among his following here in the beginning was the deed and not the word the instincts and perceptions of uncle tom are too strong white and black faces have used and misused the ghetto given promises and broken promises thought of them first before election and not at all after they know theyre alone the tired people of the ghetto have long since lost faith in the word especially all words which allude to justice here in the black slums police brutality is common and always officially justifiable ghetto eyes see prostitutes plying their trade on the streets and paying off in order to do so they see policy men and pimps making money by the fistful around the clock and coupled with all this they know the subtle prejudice of the north they know the norths solution to the negro problem containment welfare and sociological studies no the negro in the slum doesnt trust his black leadership they talk too much like the white leadership besides theres never been an intense drive to enlist his support he feels that hed be out of place with his black betters and he would the middleclass negro is reaching for the middleclass mold he cant hate all niggers but the least he can do to show good faith is to hate poor niggers the man from harlem or hough knows that all that is black is not good hes not sure that all that is white isnt evil but he has only his personal experiences to draw from so the slum negro listens to the naacp core and all the others but he says to them when do the jobs come what does this mean for me man eatin in a air terminal dont mean no big thing for me i cant even make it walkin so the young emancipated educated negro is confronted with the same problem hes black but it doesnt give him the edge he cant at this time communicate with the ghetto nor command a popular following he can attract only his kind he doesnt understand these blacks hes lost touch the young educated black may have sympathy from the slums he may have support if the end should comethe gas chambers for the negro in the ghetto looks for that day he neither sees nor believes in the conversion of white folks he doesnt hear the word when they promise the great change he doesnt believe that the new negro leaders can do any more to help him than the old ones in fact his plight and he knows it too well is tied up with the entire economic web of the country a negro speaks white folks without jobs you know aint none for me a black nationalist leader not muslim has been confronted with this problem time and time again the sheer logic and blatant reality of the unemployed black and white folks in this country are pushing this leader toward socialism not communism but to the ghetto these are more words and as the black nationalist said man my problem is translation if i come up with an economic setup how do i translate it and before that how do i get them to believe it you know translating an idea into a belief to those who complain that the negro needs to achieve more education and become more like the great mold his very injunction his patronizing advice will come home to shatter his suburban dream for it isand will continue to bethe young educated negro growing to manhood on the juice of hatred not oranges who in his frustration will burn the house that words built for he will meet the standards they arent that high he will meet everyone but the one implicit in all instructions he cant become white he will have listened and obeyed the literal word and with increasing rancor he will demand the reality of the literal promises white americans have no choice they must acknowledge his claim and grant him his literal birthright or if they dare they may destroy the sacred words that give rise to this black hope and by so doing make america safe for no one and each at that time will know his place and his end supposing the middleclass prepared acceptable negro is admitted to the molding club what then the negro in the slum will become as white trash something apart and hateful to all only god will be on his side and god speaks softly and carries a twig let us have a new american theatre from maine to mississippi witchcraft is unanimously condemned sometimes dealt with humorously as in john van drutens play bell book and candle sometimes seriously as in arthur millers the crucible not for several centuries has it been controversial men may smile or shake their heads ruefully in contemplation of mans inhumanity or pity not just the victims for their suffer ing but the persecutors for their stupidity how easy to judge the past how difficult to understand the present every era has its myths the middle ages accepted the myth of witchcraft the modern world has accepted the myth of race men of the sixteenth century did not simply believe in witchcraft they knew it the witches were there to see the nazis did not simply believe in aryan supremacy they knew it the jews were there to see millions of americans consider race not as belief but as fact the negroes are here to see in the wizard of oz the wizard gives green glasses to everyone in emerald city so that they may believe life to be prettier than it is american culture gives to many of us black and white glasses which obscure our vision of our fellow men after these general observations let us consider one result of this cultural mythology the position of negro actors in the american theater now it would seem that aesthetic people tend to be less racially biased than those whose values lie mainly in economics or politics yet such is the strength of culture that without intent or even awareness playwrights producers directors and fellow actors restrict negroes to comparatively few roles this situation prevails in all levels of our theaterprofessional university community and to a lesser extent secondary school a hypothetical example may illustrate the dilemma a high school dramatics coach plans to stage the old mysterythriller the cat and the canary white and negro students read for parts he casts a negro girl as the west indian voodoo woman a negro boy in the minor role of the doctor another negro boy in the bit part of the attendant from the lunatic asylum perhaps too he casts a negro as the lawyer in the first act liberal eh what who could possibly complain but someone does one of the negroes is obviously the most talented student in the cast why wasnt she cast as annabelle the leading role or if a boy in a major role as one of annabelles three cousins the thought never occurred to the director why because whites dont have negro cousins it wouldnt be realistic and after all the stage is supposed to reflect life that is a key phrase a fundamental assumption worthy of examination the theater is supposed to reflect life stunned by the protest the teacher asks the advice of his state department of education the department has a policy school dramatic productions are to ignore race if this means doing goodbye mr chips with a japanese chips and a mexican mrs chips all right professional theatrical practices are not to apply within school the teacher must adjust his casting though professional university and community theaters rely on the reflection of life assumption the practice has limitations it applies to appearance but not to name a theater patron scans his program at ocaseys the shadow of a gunman to find abe cooperstein cast as mr mulligan the landlord and tony romboli as mr maguire soldier of the ira conditioned by custom the patron enjoys their performances without weakening of the illusion that he is watching a play about irishmen i want to suggest that we reexamine our cultural conditioning that we consider color as we do nationality and as members of an audience ignore it the policy established in many schools should extend to all theater this involves not only social and humanitarian objectives but a relationship of greater integrity between audience and actor we would come to accept the negro or oriental in the role of mr mulligan or mr maguire as we now accept the jew or italian a man would be a man and we would look on him as such of course certain plays where the racial myth is a theme should be excepted porgy and bess the blacks a raisin in the sun deal with men as negroes and whites rather than as men some will reject the comparison of nationality and color on the grounds of a visual image the image however is mental not visual stemming from a misconception of acting and the actors purpose this confusion of the actor with the character portrayed has produced the emphasis on broadway as well as in hollywood on type casting a system fatal to the development of an actors capabilities who is the actor finally he is the character portrayed no longer himself we often hear that the actor must enter into the character not so the actor must bring the character into himself the fusion is an act of love and understanding the theater demands illusion it is pretense it is pretending along with art and music drama is one of the means man has devised to experience life the stage is a window into the human mind that of the playwright some now living have been privileged to see paul robeson play othello if othello why not hamlet why not caesar why not christ when we view the film version of julius caesar it is not james mason whom we should see as brutus but brutus as played by lames mason mason must believe he is brutus and we must share his belief william james said that habit explains most of our behavior in shakespeares day people watched men play womens parts there was a visual image as real as color today that would be unacceptable the time is here to discard habits based on outworn attitudes about mankind the integrated society emerging in america will be premised on a view of human nature which transcends the externals that separate us the ancient book maggie knew as did the rats that all the apartments of the condemned building were empty except hers and that of the old man and lady who lived on the second floor under her she had hid mandels gun when she first sensed that her face her body and her child were no longer novel to him and therefore no longer appealing it was as though the rats had waited for mandel to leave a lone woman and a baby in a crib would not frighten them the big woman sat beside the crib holding mandels automatic in one hand the other hand lay upon the heavy covers that covered the sleeping childs dark doubled body mandel would have known what to do she thought and she grew aware that that was why she had flirted with him took him fed and loved him the hollow crash of a door slammed shut by the december night wind multiplied itself as it bounced through the empty rooms and down the unlit hallways immediately afterward the scrape of claws upon the floor in the kitchen joined with the other noises in the a tall somber wabash avenue tenement four kerosene lamps one in each corner of the room set in motion peculiar moving shadows responding to the varying currents of the wind maggie pointed the gun at a shadow that moved quickly in and out of a circle of light across the room from one corner to the corner near her but it was gone before she could be sure of what it was another scrape of claws near the crib and maggie squeezed the babys stomach making him stir and whimper outside the snow had begun to fall and broken white lines sped past the window and lit by the street lamp on the corner below appeared to contain tiny little lights within themselves it was these flakes that reminded her that tomorrow would be december a holiday a gust of wind turned the kerosene light into her face lighting the white shawl around her head though barely lighting the deep brown of her wide flat nose or the fullness of her tightly pressed lips her small eyes slitted and seemed to be the only bright thing about her face as she glanced from one wall to the other hand rigidly about the heavy cold steel moving the with the sweep of her eyes it wouldnt have been so bad her voice comforted her if he hadnt awaited til christmas eve the silence following her voice brought about in a kind of delayed perception a realization that she without knowing it had been listening to the steady scrape of claws upon the floor not just one set but many the noise had stopped at the sound of her voice and it was the resultant silence that made her conscious of the fact that there had been such a sound mandel had shot a rat which had been perched right over the head of the babys bed he had promised to take maggie and fred jr away from merrydale arms right after the first of the year they had gone to bed talking about how things would be different from now on and she had loved him as though she really loved him she had not felt gratitude that night only love but on a christmas evetell somebody he cant take anymore she shoutedor rather the emptiness of the room made it seem as though she had shouted how bout me take it anymore i cant take it anymore then she paused and said very softly but i do perhaps it was the sound of defeat in her voice which gave the starving animals crouched along the edge of the wall the impulse to attack perhaps they had planned the attack to occur at this moment perhaps another hunger pain had hit the boldest of them and his forward charge had set the example for the others but for whatever motive or impulse it was that impelled them the rats ran from the corners and the edge of the wall toward maggie toward the crib the first one maggie saw came from directly in front of her where she had been staring so intently that her vision was no longer able to sort out real from imagined movement but now running in the full glow of the lamp light big black the rat left no doubt as to its existence or its intentions maggie leaped to her feet knocking backwards the chair in which she had been sitting the crash of the chair momentarily stopped the attack maggie fired the gun at the spot where she had last seen the rat naturally it was gone the sound of the shot drifted off into the rooms and soon merged with the sound of an l train that rushed its return load of christmas shoppers to their homes farther south maggie reached for the baby and snatched him covers and all out of the crib just as a rat appeared at the spot where mandel had shot the last one something tugged at the cover that dragged the floor and maggie pulled the hand holding the gun from under the babys warm body and shot in the dark at the dragging end of the sheet she ran to the door kicking her feet as she ran her foot collided with something soft and bulky a squeal and a thud she began hearing what seemed to be hundreds of squeals and squeaks she seemed to see hundreds of scurrying shadows at her feet from the corner of her eye she saw the crib spotted with quick moving fat figures she ran down the hallway feeling her way whenever the lights from the street did not penetrate the darkness now down the stairs past the old man and ladys apartment again she thought she felt something tugging at the covers that dragged along the floor again she shot at the dragging end the baby whined and twisted nearly causing her to drop him another flight of steps seemed to follow every flight she passed and the open apartment doors showed the windows beyond and snow piled upon the floor beneath the windows where the panes had been broken when maggie reached the bottom landing the light through the vestibule illuminated a high drift of snow in the hallway maggie running wildly squeezing the baby hard against her chest holding the gun with its muzzle pointed upwards straining for breath maggie martin fell over the dragging end of the babys covers and started a running fall down the hallway steps through the open hallway door she clutched the baby even tighter she dropped the gun she grabbed for the open door of a mailbox near the hallway door and it came off in her hands her legs seemed to have gone crazy and she had no time for thought or feeling nothing existed except the blur of a distant building a piece of sidewalk and her baby in her arms which was now not even a baby but a part of her self inseparable from the whole of herself she felt her arm wrap around a tree and she felt the bark cold and rough against her face it seemed to be the friendliest touch she had ever known she clung to the tree with one arm she lifted her face upwards into the snow she drew short deep breaths that turned into ice in her throat she looked at her baby and suddenly became afraid for it she snatched the covers away from it leaning heavily against the tree the light from the street lamps showed the brown chubby body distinctly the snow fell upon its face and bare arms and legs the baby squirmed and opened its eyes and closed them again as the snow fell into them then it cried loudly and maggie smiled faintly turning him over at the same time feeling his flesh for a break searching for a rat bite she found none the baby squirmed and shivered and cried out again and maggie seemingly just becoming aware of the snow and the cold looked about her as if to make sure that the snow was really falling she then threw the covers around the baby quickly and tucked them in at the ends and pulled her shawl over her head and started walking south towards thirtyfirst street every building from twentyseventh street where she lived to thirtyfirst street had been torn down now only a catholic school stood undestroyed on wabash another l train sped by and the blue sparks shot upwards from the track and vanished in the shower of thick watery snow it was not until she reached thirtieth and wabash that she realized she wore only a thin sweater and a skirt neither brassiere nor slip nor stockings the baby wriggled a little but she knew that at least it was warm a bus hurried eastward on thirtyfirst street inside the packages lay against the windows beside their owners somehow or other her eye caught a welldressed lady standing up as though preparing to get off at the next stop the lady held a baby in her arms and the baby was wrapped in a hooded comforter with a zipper in the front both the lady and the baby looked to be very warm the wind blew westward from lake michigan and the snow blew with it maggie bent forward pushing her head into the babys covers the sweater seemed like no sweater at all and her legs felt as though they were being sprayed with ice water a chill seeped into her body she trembled she could not stop her teeth from chattering the colder she got the tighter she hugged her child thinking that it too felt the freezing cold as she did but the child had closed its eyes and was breathing evenly as though certain that the jerking ride would soon end and that it had but to wait patiently until it could again lie in its warm bed and sleep undisturbed a blinking neon sign vague in the haze of the snow assured maggie that she had not much further to go she did not consider what was going on in the building beneath the sign she knew only that there was life there and that there were people there who would let her get warm and maybe let her stop until she could figure out what to dowhere to go a man stood in the doorway of the building trying to decide if the party at the tavern a block away was worth walking to in the harddriving wind and the wet snow to get to he decided that it was not and turned to go back into the crowded tavern when he saw a wide jumble of shadow tottering in the grey thickness near thirtyfirst and michigan he stared for a minute he saw no heavy flapping overcoat nor did he see a wind twisted hat or a fur collar what he did see made him squint in the slapping bitter snow to see more and as maggie approached him skirt blown hard against her fat thighs and full stomach sweater white in the white of the snow the man yelled inside the tavern lord in heaven theres a woman out here with no clothes on only one or two people heard his voice over the laughter and loud music but they a man in a fur collared storm coat and his companion a young girl prettily dressed in a leather coat ran to the door they caught sight of maggie just as she stopped at the tavern window and leaned heavily against it rubbing her wet face against the bundle in her arms the man who first saw her ran to her speaking with a drunk mans thick tongue girl what you doin out here in all this cold dont you know you goin to freeze to death the young girl in the leather coat reached for the baby is this a baby here let me take it maggie shook her head and held on to the child she pushed past the people around her into the brightly decorated crowded noisy bar the first man ran in front of her pushing the customers out of the way make room he shouted lets have some room for the lady and her baby this womans froze to death then he turned to maggie and almost touched her cheeks with his lips when he asked aint you baby maggie tried to smile at the man but her teeth would not stop chattering two people near her got up and walked out the bartender was at the other side of the bar pouring drinks for a party of four who had spent for a setup hey jim dandy bellowed the winereddened drunk come up this way jim dandy theres a lady who needs help the bartender looked down the bar and upon seeing maggie frowned and continued to pour the drinks for his party the juke box stopped playing and now no one put any more money in it one or two people walked from their booths in the back to take a look at maggie and the baby a man at the bar watched her through the wreathframed mirror behind the bar one dark brown lady wearing a high peaked black hat with a veil that flattened her nose giggled and turned up a shot glass and blurted black as she is its a wonder the snow fell on her her companion a lightskinned man in a narrowbrim blue hat protested mildly the blacker the berry the sweeter the the mans response became lost in the ensuing buzz the atmosphere changed from that of revelry to contemplativeness the bartender seeing that this woman was affecting the holiday spending by his customers stalked swiftly to the end of the bar where maggie stood wiping her babys face alright alright he shouted authoritatively whats going on here before maggie could answer him the bartender squinting through steamy glasses at mother and child said im sorry lady but no children are allowed in here then as if to make amends he took a bottle from the shelf behind him here ill give you a drink to warm up with the drunk protested what do you mean drink she needs help shes froze the bartender glared at him and then turned to maggie i said im sorry miss now the customers gathered around maggie and the bartender they turned their attention first to one then the other maggie felt as though she were surrounded by the rats again she wanted to run to the street into the snow into the iced nothingness that had lain before her before she saw the taverns neon light but she was too weak and frightened to run anyplace else tonight and she knew that whether the bartender knew it or not she would not leave this place of her own free will she would sit at the bar if she had toor in a booth or even in the ladies rest room but she would not leave she felt therefore that there was no need to say anything by way of explanation and anyway she thought while meeting the bartenders stare with a dull blank expression she could not have explained if she had wanted to she had not yet determined for herself what had happened to her bring me a drink jim dandy wheedled a woman who had gotten up to see maggie and who having seen her had gone back to her seat unmoved and thirsty the drunk grabbed jim dandys arm as the bartender turned to get the womans drink oh no you dont not yet aint you got someplace where she can spend the night aint you gon do something for this po woman and her child the bartender slapped the drunks hand away then he pointed his finger at maggie how come you pick me to mooch on i know you girls beg a quarter here and a quarter there preying on peoples sympathy to get money to buy wine he leaned over the bar and pointed the tip of his finger at maggies flat nose now if you dont git out of here quick im going to call the police on you somebody said that aint right to treat her like that somebody else said something ought to be done maggie looked around she caught sight of a door beside the ladies wash room she walked toward the door people made room for her she squeezed past the table and chairs in the middle of the floor if people were talking before she reached them they stopped when she came near resuming their conversations when she passed she passed an old man at a booth near the ladies toilet his hat was tilted far down across his face and he kept his head bent low she could feel the cold exuding from him as she passed and she thought that perhaps he had sneaked in just as she had and was trying to remain inconspicuous long enough to get warm and to figureperhaps as she had to dowhat to do next no one tried to stop her as she opened the door to the room and found it to be a tiny boiler room with a dim light bulb near the furnace a wooden pop bottle case stood against a wall near the low glowing burner she shut the door behind her and sat on the case and began to unwrap the baby the baby was cold she rubbed its body gently she watched her hand as she rubbed him and she watched his eyes as they stared up into hers his face was solemn and his eyes were bright he seemed neither afraid nor uncomfortable no one came into the boiler room she heard a scraping sound and immediately felt the bundle for the gun she did not remember that she had dropped it she stared at the spot where something big and low moved it was a cat she smiled at it the fire warmed her and the glow through the grating looked pretty upon her babys tiny figure already the baby was asleep she lay her head against fred jr and closed her eyes outside the juke box started up again and the talking grew loud again and soon someone laughed loud and the clinking of bottles increased she did not hear the door open but when she looked up she saw the old man she had passed standing in the doorway miss please dont be scared maggie started to stand the man took his hat off she sat down miss i know you aint gon believe me but i know you maggie pulled her shawl away from her head her short hair pressed flat about the curve of her skull the light from the furnace darkened the shadows of her nostrils and the ridge above her lips the fullness of her face blended with the fullness of her body and a little spot of orange light touched her here and there as in a painting the man stepped toward her maggie did not move he shut the door behind him and looked around as though afraid that someone might see what he drew from his heavy rag of a coat this book is from before the bible the man smelled of burnt wood as though he had spent the evening before an open fire i am the direct kin of an african chief the old mans face was white with whiskers about the chin and eyes his flesh was dull and wrinkled and it did not shine when the firelight touched it his voice was rough even though he whispered and it seemed deeper than any voice maggie had ever heard he stopped beside maggie you not from this townare you maggie softly no the old man laid his hat on the floor you dont know where you fromdo you maggie looked away from the man at her baby you aint got no husbandis you well i did kind of no the man stood the book at his hands hung at his side girl you a princess your kin was the most high ruler of the original ghana your great great great great grandfather was the living god to his people and all who saw him praised his name in this book the old man looked around him again then turned to maggie is the history of your people girl know who you are read this book it will make you free it will change your life girl maggie stared at the man she stared at the book it was bound in plain brown paper the surface of the book looked as though it had been put together with flour paste it was wrinkled and smudgy the man turned the inside of the book to maggie she saw pictures of dark people standing tall and straight some held spears in their hands the man turned the page of the book and there was a fullsized picture of a man sitting upon a stool holding a scepter above several kneeling dark people maggie reached for the book the man drew it away ill give it to you for two dollars maggie said i got a dollar to my name the man looked around again and whispered give me the dollar you wont regret it your life will change i know what im talking about maggie looked at the baby he was asleep she wondered where she would go tomorrow one thing was certain she would not go back to merrydale arms she wondered what she would eat what the baby would eat she reached underneath her sweater and unpinned the dollar that lay against her breast she handed the dollar to the old man well there aint much i can do with a dollar anyway you wont regret it miss you wont regret it he handed her the book and turned quickly and rushed out of the room maggie opened the book there were kings in it there were warriors there were great structures she recognized as the pyramids of egypt in small letters at the bottom of the flyleaf of the book was printed in small letters copyright published by the south state book store south state street chicago illinois maggie smiled she hoped the old man would buy a meal with her dollar at first she read silently moving her lips as she did she hardly noticed when she began reading aloud although she glanced often at fred jr as she read from a land far away three travels came seeking the ashanti child who would rule great africa as his father did desire for many days and nights they did travel and it was over an humble place that they saw a bright star shining and they came to that place there they found the black prince maggie read the words until she could no longer keep her eyes open then she fell asleep she did not see the door open again as she slept leaning against the wall near the furnace she could not feel the hand of the young girl who slipped the hatcollected cluster of bills down her bosom neither did she see the drunk stare at her with the oddest kind of resolution upon his face somewhere outside the boiler room a clock struck twelve and the customers stoodtheir backs to the barstaring through the open door at the fat dark woman and her child touched lightly by the orange glow from the fire were adam and eve black were adam and eve black they must have been according to the laws of heredity held today gregor mendel an augustinian monk discovered the mendelian laws of heredity by crossbreeding colored and white flowers he discovered that red flowers might produce white or red flowers red and white flowers would produce red and white flowers but white flowers could only produce white flowers the absence of a quality he called a recessive characteristic the presence of a quality he called the dominant characteristic thus whiteness would be the recessive characteristic since it could not produce that which it did not have viz color so blueeyed parents may only have blueeyed children for blue eyes is a recessive characteristic it only shows that there is less black pigment on a white background and black whiskers on a white background give an impression of blueness since parents lacking pigment cannot have children with more pigment it appears that our first parents were black by arthur m brandel no matter how easy n v or difficult it may be to find a job the real problems for the per son holding only a high school diploma begin when he starts working he must appreciate what his prospects are not immediately but in the next decade and how he can make them come out best for himself is it so hard to think of the next ten years you will be in your late twenties you will probably have voted in a presidential election you may have done a tour of duty in the armed forces there is a good possibility you will have married and have started a family ten years are really not so many are you ready the high school diploma that enabled you to get the job is a license a license to acquire knowledge the future belongs to those who know their work well and can learn with changing times and needs within the next six or seven years the labor market will require more than two and a half million more skilled workers than were required two or three years ago in addition replacements will need to be found for another million persons who will transfer to other occupations retire or die the national economy will therefore be looking for million able young people to apply their intelligence and skills to produce machines build homes and highways and keep america moving the opportunities are as boundless and far reaching as the solar system rapidly growing new technologies will create opportunities unknown today like group photographs statistics can be awfully boring unless you are in them certain occupations within the skilled worker group have grown faster in recent years than have others and will continue to grow faster there are career guides pinpointing these check your schools guidance counselor for information he may have as a general thing however you should know that the job outlook for skilled workers is currently bright growth in the number of skilled workers in the to year bracket has been declining lately this means that increasing numbers of skilled workers must be furnished by younger age groups and opportunities for the high school graduate under are exceedingly good provided that he plans well and gets himself good training in his skill the importance of the skilled worker has been overlooked to some extent in recent years because of the attention focused on professionals such as engineers and scientists but a basic fact of life in the workaday world is more true today than ever before the work of engineers scientists executives and many other professionals would be barren without skilled workers to give their ideas and plans form and substance these are among the more important reasons why this is the era of the specialist and organization man a skilled worker technician or artisan prepares for the future at trade schools in special technical courses or in an apprenticeship building a sound foundation for his career in these ways may take some time really getting established in a skill may take longer yet and as in all kinds of work there are sometimes tough choices to make for example the matter of a union may be crucial to your choice of a skill some unions encourage the development of young workers others do not but while it may be harder to get into x union than into y union x union may have been able to keep wages higher in its industry than y union has done in its field this and other factors are things that the young skilled worker has to take into account it would be wise for him to do a good bit of checking into the job career and advancement opportunities in the several fields that may interest him before committing himself too firmly to a specific skill field one of the best skillslearning places going today is the armed forces so specialized are the skills required in the modem military force that the soldier sailor or airman is often more technician than warrior in the armed forces you can learn how to handle everything from a bulldozer to a battlewagon you still have to go through basic training but once thats past you have a chance at a great variety of technical training schools skills learned in the armed forces often pay handsomely when youre back in civilian clothes radar specialists mechanics electronics experts construction men computer programmers and operators often join firms that have government contracts many opportunities exist also in the civilian side of government pay is generally good theres job security and government work is nowadays so vast and varied that opportunity for advancement is almost invariably available in determining a career examine the future of law enforcement men and women fingerprint and ballistics experts are crucial members of todays mechanized and specialized army of law enforcers so too is the modern policeman the modern fireman any office manager in the united states can tell girls fervently of the need for competent trained knowledgeable secretaries and other office assistants special plea here please get on speaking terms with the english language if secretarial work is what you want high school graduates are in particular demand by utilities and communications companies new systems being installed have increased the employment needs of telephone companies new billing methods and accounting procedures have put a premium on competent young help in virtually every publicserving corporation moreover these companies are among the leading offerers of onthejob training the field of merchandising remains in many ways the most promising of all the field is more demanding now in skills training and knowledge of the public than it once was but the high school graduate who is smart aggressive and imaginative can cover a lot of ground and rise very high although the beginning in this highly competitive field may sometimes look not very promising the population of the united states is increasing by million persons a year new supermarkets and suburban branches of department stores will continue to be built and theyll all need good managers good sales and service representatives good display technicians good buyers around the supermarkets and store branches will be more houses to build sell and service and more people whose living and recreational needs will require competent service representatives a final note on a skill field increasingly overlooked these days farming as everyone knows there are fewer farmers every year as the american migration to the city continues but americans have to eat and farmers raise much of what comes to their tables the modern farmer runs a highly technical operation in which a lot of money is tied up he has to be a skilled manager mechanic gardener animal husbandman all in one he can be very successful and as one of the few really independent artisans left he can know satisfactions oftentimes denied to his coginthewheel fellow artisans of city and suburb where can you find specific information about opportunities and openings in skills fields one excellent resource is your local office of the united states employment service industry personnel offices can help you community county and state offices often have employment counseling and service aids private service organizations such as ymca can often help and so can unions state universities and colleges and church groups dont be shy about checking out possible information sources you are going to be someone of firstclass importance to the future of the united statesa builder mover and maintainer you owe it to yourself and the thousands you will serve to be in work you like and to be good at that work have you ever attended the dedication of a bridge the launching of a ship the opening of a new building on such occasions the designers engineers and architects publicly thank the skilled workers without whose knowledge training and ability nothing more than drawing board designs could have been achieved you are setting sights on the day when you too will be so honored the american racial puzzle can be solved it has occurred to me only recently that perhaps the most striking development in the south is not that the process of desegregation is under way but that the mystique with which americans have always surrounded the south is beginning to vanish driving into atlanta in a heavy rain one hot august night six and a half years ago my wife and two small children waking up to watch the shimmering wet lights on ponce de leon avenue i was as immersed in this mystique as anyone else for the last full day of driving the talk and the look of people were different the trees and fields seemed different the air itself smelled different this was the mysterious and terrible south the deep south soaked in blood and history of which faulkner wrote and margaret mitchell and wilbur j cash white atlanta had been ravaged and still knew it negroes had been slaves and still remembered it northerners were strangers no matter how long they stayed and would never forget it there was something about atlanta about georgia the carolinas that marked them off as with a giant cleaver from the rest of the nation the sun was hotter the soil was redder the people blacker and whiter the air sweeter heavier but beyond the physical beyond the strange look and smell of this country was something more that went back to cotton and slavery stretching into history as far as anyone could rememberan invisible mist over the entire deep south distorting justice blurring perspective and most of all indissoluble by reason it is six and a half years later i have lived these years inside what is often thought to be the womb of the souths mystery the negro community of the deep south my time has been spent mostly with the warm and lovely girls in my classes at spelman but also with the earnest young men across the street at morehouse with the strangely mixed faculties of the negro colleges the white and the dark the silent and the angry the conservative and the radical with the black bourgeoisie of college presidents and business executives with the poor negro families in frame houses across the street and their children playing with ours on the campus grass from this i have been able to wander out into the glare of the white south or cross into those tiny circles of shadow out of sight where people of several colors meet and touch as human beings inside the tranquil eye of the hurricane the southern mystique hovered nearby even on yellow spring afternoons when we talked quietly to one another in the classroom at times it grew suddenly dense fierce asphyxiating my students and i were ordered out of the gallery of the georgia general assembly the speaker of the house shouting hoarsely at us one nightmarish winter evening i was arrested and put behind bars hundreds of us marched one day toward the state capitol where helmeted soldiers with rifles and gas masks waited a dozen of us sat in at a department store cafeteria silent as the manager dimmed the lights closed the counter and ordered chairs piled on top of tables all around i drove four hours south to the black belt country of albany georgia to call through a barbed wire fence surrounding the county jail to a student of mine who was invisible beyond a wire mesh window it was in albany also that i sat in the office of the sheriff of dougherty county who a month before had given a bloody beating with a cane to a young negro lawyer and nowhere was the mystique so real so enveloping as on a dirt road in the dusk deep in the cotton and peanut land of lee county georgia where justice and reason had never been and where the night before bullets had ripped into a farmhouse belonging to negro farmer james mays and exploded around the heads of sleeping children and yet i can say now after living intensely in the deep south in exactly those six years when the south itself has lived most intensely that the mystique is dissolving for me and for others the south is still the most terrible place in america because it is it is filled with heroes the south is monstrous and marvelous at the same time every cliche ever uttered about the south every stereotype attached to its people white and negro is true a thousand other characteristics complex and subtle are also true the south has not lost its fascination but it is no longer mysterious and i want to explain this by talking about those two groups who have been at the center of this mystery the whites and the negroes of the deep south although the darkness of the negro physically suggests mystery it is the white southerner oddly enough who has been presented as the great national enigma this despite the whiteness of his skin against which flaws and blemishes show up more easily a whiteness unsullied by that admixture of slavic and latin blood found in the north and kept homogeneous by the simple expedient of tossing over the wall in the night all offspring from blackwhite sexual encounter the mystery of the white southerner comes from a trait that he is presumed to possess in quantity and quality sharply distinct from everyone else and deepinthebone compared to the obvious difference of the negro that trait is race prejudice other white people it is acknowledged are colorbiased there is considered to be however something special about the quality of the white southerners prejudice the yankee is rather businesslike in his matteroffact exclusion of the negro from certain spheres of ordinary living the british imperialist was haughty and sure of himself but the violence the passion the murderous quality of the white southerners feeling against the negro has become a canon of american thought deep in our consciousness and our literature and of european literature see sartres la putain respectueuse and what is more significant while the outward signs of this prejudice are clear enough at its core at the why of this crazy feeling is a mystery when reporter john bartlow martin wrote right after the supreme court decision the deep south says nevercentral to the books thesis was the implication of some ineradicable mystical hatred so deep and so invisible in the white southerner that no blasts of social change could touch it when i had lived a year or so in the deep south talking to and living next door to the same white people described by the author of that book i began to suspect he was wrong six years later i knew he was prejudice discrimination race hatred are real problems to the point of viciousness even murder but their mystery for those who will look hard is gone i will not tangle with cause because once you acknowledge cause as the core of a problem you have built something into it that not only baffles people but worse immobilizes them causation is not merely complexit may be impossible of solution as some of the new philosophers say one of those metaphysical conundrums created by our own disposition to set verbal obstacles between ourselves and reality why not ignore cause as a general philosophical problem and concentrate on result the point is devilishly irreverently simple if you can get a desired result the mystery is gone stop fumbling with the cause of prejudice except for those aspects on which we can operate a physicist may still not know what really is behind the transformation of matter into energy but if he has figured out how to release this energy his achievement is stupendous atlanta is in the deep south atlanta has as many crackpots kkk sympathizers country woolhats white supremacists barbershop lynchers vicious policemen as any southern city if the deep south said never atlanta too said never in it was tightly segregated by the buses had desegregated so had the public libraries the rails and bus terminals a number of theaters and restaurants downtown the department store cafeterias the opera the municipal auditorium the legitimate theater the public schools the colleges public and private several hotels the plainclothes squad of the police department the fire department the baseball team the tennis courts the parks the golf courses the chamber of commerce several professional organizations the county committee of the democratic party and even the senate of the georgia general assembly now that it is all done there are obvious reasons which can be advanced with great casualness a flexible city administration a layer of negro intellectuals a determined student movement a band of white liberals giving cosmopolitan salting to the countrystyle talmadge ham but none of this takes account of the fact that all the above forces are a minority of the population that most of atlantas population the overwhelming majority of its white people still consider negroes inferior and prefer a segregated society and that these people were numerous enough to have prevented most of the changeby riot by election by boycottif they cared enough they stood by passively and accepted with the puniest of resistance a series of fundamental changes in the sociolegal structure of the city there is then a key to the traditionally mysterious vault of prejudice locked inside the mind of the white southerner he cares but not enough or to put it another way while he cares about segrega tion there are things he cares about more the white southerner has a hierarchy of desires in which many other things are rated higher than segregation monetary profit political power staying out of jail the approval of ones immediate peers conforming to the dominant decision of the community desegregation has come in varying degrees to atlanta and a hundred other places in the deep south in the face of persistent antinegro feelings in the community simply because one or another of these desires which stand higher in the southerners valuescheme was threatened if he did not surrender except as an academic exercise there is no need then to probe the fog that inescapably shrouds the philosophical question of causation in race prejudice what needs to be done is to decide for each group of whites in the community which value is more important and to plan a web of multiple tacticsnegotiation boycott lawsuit voting demonstrationthat will effectively appeal to these priorities in a rough semiconscious way the actions of the federal courts and of negro leaders in the south have aimed at this a more deliberate use of the hierarchyofvalue concept would bring even more dramatic results the white man in the south is subject to the same simplicities and the same complexities that surround the human species of any color any place he has certain biological needs which he will try to satisfy whichever way he can on top of this he has other wants which he has learned from his cultureand because these often conflict with one another he has an unconscious set of priorities that enables him to make choices he is subject to economic pressure and ambition also if jungian theory is correct and the notions of modern role psychology valid and i believe they are he needs approval from certain people around him and seeks to play out the role society has cast him in beyond all this as beyond all the frontiers of human knowledge there is mystery in the behaviour of the human animal but its time to clear from our minds that artificial and special mystique so firmly attached to the southern white that has too long served as a rationale for pessimism and inaction but what of the black manor woman there is a strange and damnable unanimity of segregationists white liberals and negroes on one fervent beliefthe mystery of negritudethe irreducible kernel after all sociological peelings of race difference the segregationist white citizen or black muslim shouts this in all directions the white liberal is subtle sophisticated and ingenious in the various ways he can express thishe sweetens it with sympathy or admiration or affectionhe delights in the sheer thrill of a mystery he cherishes it as a secret shared with his fellow liberals yes yeswe can never know what it is to be a negro no nothey will never trust a white man and we cant blame them the negro robbed of other protection clings to it plays with it turns it to his advantage when he can even the most perceptive of his literary leaders baldwin ellison use it in cunning or in pride and all of them white liberal and negro intellectual fondle it nurture it as men having subdued a forest fire might play with the last flames too fascinated even in the midst of peril to put them out for good physical difference is so gross a stimulus to human beings cursed as they are by the gift of vision that once it is latched onto as explanation for difference in personality intelligence demeanor it is terribly difficult to put aside it becomes an easy substitute for the immensely difficult job of explaining personal and social behavior conservatives use it openly liberals secretly even unknowingly it seems to be the hardest thing in the world to convince ourselves that once weve noted skin color facial features and hair texture we have exhausted the subject of racethat everything beyond that is in our heads put there by others and kept there by ourselves and all the brutal material consequences of centuries from lynching to patronizing friendship were spun from an original thread of falsehood the most vicious thing about segregationmore deadly than its immediate denial of certain goods and servicesis its perpetuation of the mystery of racial difference because there is a magical and omnipotent dispeller of the mystery it is contact contactbut it must be massive unlike those integrated situations in the north and it must be equal thus excluding maidlady relationships of the southdestroys the manmade link between physical differences and behavior explanation race consciousness is hollow its formidablelooking exterior is membranethin and is worn away by simple acts of touch the touching of human beings in contact that is massive equal and prolonged the brightness of the physical difference is relative it stands out in that darkness created by segregated living and is quickly lost in the galaxy of sense impressions that come from being with a person dayin dayout in our country the kind of contact that rubs away race consciousness is possible only in rare places and intermittently but it exists in scattered underground pockets of resistance to the norm one of them is the negro college where white people can become so immersed in a negro environment that they are oblivious at least temporarily of race the fact that they live on an island against which waves of prejudice roll from time to time means that they slide back and forth from overconsciousness on some days to a blissful racial amnesia on others a white student after several months of living eating studying playing in a totally negro college environment visited a nearby white college and returned saying how pallid they all seemedall those white faces and sharp noses this is a startling example of race consciousness in reverse but it is encouraging to see how quickly one can change the temper of racial awareness by an inundation of sense experiences once the superficiality of the physical is penetrated and seen for what it is the puzzle of race loses itself in whatever puzzle there is to human behavior in general once you begin to look in human clash for explanations other than race they suddenly become visible and even where they remain out of sight it is comforting to know that these nonracial explanations exist as disease began to lose its eeriness with the discovery of bacteria although the specific problem of identifying each bacterial group remained so long as evil existsand it exists in poisonous heaps south and norththe raw material for mystery is here we can make the most if we want toof white mobs in oxford mass negro indignation in albany blazing churches in birmingham gunfire on rural porches and the sheer wonder of blackness and whiteness but the specialness of the southern mystique vanishes when one sees that whites and negroes behave only like human beings that the south is but a distorted mirror image of the north and that we are powerful enough today and free enoughto retain only as much of the past we want we are all magicians we created the mystery of the south and we can dissolve it howard u conference last november cv it v many of the nations leading advocates of civil_rights and racial equality gathered at howard university for a twoday conference on youth nonviolence and social change the parley was called by the gandhi memorial lecture committee at howard headed by professor flemmie p kittrell and represented an expansion of the annual lecture series which commemorates the late indian leader the program was financed in part by grants from the gandhi society for human rights and the taraknath das foundation both of new york city the purpose of the conference was to inquire into the impact of the nonviolent movement to date upon the individual and the community with special reference to youth participating in the discussions were youth who are involved in nonviolent direct action civil_rights movements psychiatrists lawyers social scientists and the leaders of ational organizations whose primary purpose is the attainment of equal opportunities author james baldwin also was a participant from the welcoming remarks by president nabrit on the morning of november to the gandhi memorial lecture by the rev dr martin_luther_king which closed the conference on the evening of the following day the several oncampus sites used for the talks were filled to capacity the results of the parley were pretty much as expected there was unanimous agreement that the civil_rights movement should continue there were varying opinions on the techniques to be employed however excerpts from the remarks of the several speakers appear on the pages which follow space limitations have necessitated the use of only brief abstractions it seems that this is both the time and the place for a conference on youth nonviolence and social change this is the centennial of the emancipation proclamation which assures us of physical freedom but the vestiges of the slave system have remained to plague us from the days of slavery down to this day and we are not yet free revolutionary changes are taking place all over the world and america has not escaped this common lot a great many of us are not able to live up to the requirements of this movement which call not only for courage but also for an inner discipline and selfcontrol in the face of great provocation therefore it seems wise to me that we should take this time to look at the anatomy and the impact of one of the great forces in our time the nonviolent movement it also seems that this is a proper time in which to examine the impact of nonviolence because of the increasing intensity of the struggle which the negro is making to achieve firstclass status in our country for many years we have witnessed this struggle in the schools in the courts in our institutions and lately we have seen it transplanted into the streets in the highways and into our business and commercial establishments it is also occurring in our unions and our organizations and as the intensity of the struggle increases opposition mounts so that when we look at the nonviolent movement which is one of the powerful forces in this struggle we do indeed serve our time we welcome you to howard university an institution that has attempted during these many years to aid in theory and in fact in the struggle for freedom we hope your stay at howard will be comfortable and pleasant but above all we hope that from this conference shall come a renewed determination to continue to struggle on every front until we have achieved freedom to those who would divide us because all of us do not think in the same way and to those who would discourage us because all of us do not align ourselves behind any one social force i could remind them of the words of the poet who said if a man does not keep pace with his companion perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer let him step to the music he hears may we do that and may your conference be a success how much provocation can a nonviolent fighter take before he breaks out into violence or if he can hold himself in check during the campaign is he more prone to become violent afterwards nonviolent fighters characteristically master their angry feelings through adhering to a religious philosophy that preaches the ultimate supremacy of love and the redemptive power of suffering does this limit the successful use of nonviolent methods to those who hold this philosophy the hardest questions arise from the fact that to date nonviolent campaigns have all been waged in a context of violence the threat of violence has always lurked in the wings although the primary aim in human combat is to change the opponents mind to make him submit to your will one cannot deny that threatening him with bodily harm is a very effective way of doing this and if you kill him you no longer have to worry about what he thinks so far only groups that believe that they cannot hope to win by violence have adhered to nonviolent tactics however these nonviolent movements could potentially mobilize superior violence on their side the leaders of nonviolent movements constantly remind their opponents that if their demands are not met they may not be able to keep their followers in check is the threat of violence an integral part of the success of nonviolence can nonviolent campaigns succeed in the complete absence of this threat if not are they truly nonviolent dr nelson among the qualities inherent in genuine nonviolent protest is a belief in the persuasive even compelling power of selfsuffering this may be a high price for the end that is sought but what choice remains when persuasion the courts the ballot have failed resort to this kind of soul force has two justifications one is a belief that as the means so must the end be means and ends must be seen as convertible on the belief that to take care of the means is to guarantee the ultimate achievement of the end there is of course the alternative of violence which also is not without its price violence eschewed there remains the pitting of ones spirit against the hardness of the offender of ones whole soul against anothers will we who want genuine enduring freedom why must we look for it to spring from the seed of violence rather than from the seed of kindness a good rule for the participants in any movement of nonviolent resistance is to bear in mind that they are not saints fighting devils they are the aggrieved struggling against the authors of their grievances i would suggest then in relation to nonviolence as a technique that the nonviolent act of a man which outruns in goodness his convictions is still better than a violent act i suggest that the continued doing of good which exceeds ones moral convictions can lead to the making of a better man we must still concede that this as a mere technique is an uncertain foundation upon which to build a good and happy society mr baldwin one could hope in this country for a level of cognizance able to envision a world in which quarrels can be settled in some way other than they have been settled in the past i think the situation of the negro proves the obsolescence of the notion of violence however i cannot help but wonder how long we can endure what is happening to us and not fight back particularly in situations where it is a matter of selfdefense i have found a great number of young people who would think nothing of picking up arms tomorrow on the other hand i see in this danger this terrible confrontation an opportunity for good an opportunity not only to liberate this country but perhaps an opportunity to change the world it is very clear to me in any case that if we were not involved in the cold war or the nuclear race we could liberate a vast amount of our money and energy and begin to change our cities our negroes in them and the white people too it is a question of misplaced energy mr coffin nonviolence as we have seen it in america does not so much change the segregationist as it does the enemy the enemy is no longer the negro the enemy is now violence it is at this point that the moderates come out of the woodwork and begin to moderate they moderate not on the grounds of integration not on any moral ground but on the very pragmatic grounds of law and order the avoidance of violence our societys first concern is not to establish justice is not to grant freedom to individual members but simply to offset chaos by establishing order it is one thing to say that justice rolls on like mighty waters but it is another thing to work out an irrigation system fear is more influential than moral persuasion fear of irresponsible negroes is having a greater effect on the white segregationist community than conversion by people like mr farmer mr farmer one of the problems that we will have to work with is how to control and discipline a mass movement to maintain nonviolence how to do it especially when it is a movement based upon a tactic upon a method upon a technique rather than upon a philosophy or a way of life we concentrate now on setting up institutes workshops and sessions to train masses of people we must train monitors who will be skilled to spot trouble isolate it move the demonstrators on before violence has had an opportunity to wreck the demonstration this must be done quickly otherwise it will deteriorate into a violent revolution there is a peculiar situation here in america demonstrators in the south can affect the conscience of the north but demonstrators in the north have difficulty affecting the consciences of northerners i find that the movement has been more successful where it has been able to affect the consciences of persons i am firmly convinced that the nonviolent movement must be a combination of an appeal to the conscience and the old trade union tactic of hurting the pocketbook we must do this in a more professional manner than we have done in the past dr fishman nonviolent demonstrations have had an interesting paradoxical effect on the one hand the white liberal is enthused and entranced at the image of the morally dedicated brave young negroes risking their lives on behalf of a moral principle the white liberal perhaps has become too much involved in the issue of nonviolence and too little involved in the issue of rights nonviolence in this sense has perhaps had a similar effect on our government if in the long run our government continues to be ruled by political power and concerned with what is politically pragmatic and politically possible then nonviolence may represent an easy out for the politician it represents for him a way of ducking the whole issue so long as he can keep the negro placated with promises extenuations talk about political pragmatism talk about what is politcally possible and hope that the reverend king and the other negro leaders may be able to keep the negro community in check and keep them nonviolent the political leader has a perfect out he can spend his time maintaining his own power and not giving in to the basic issues of freedom and rights sociological and psychological aspects dr edwards nonviolence in its pristine form is more than resistance in nonviolent terms as conceptualised by gandhi it converts the adversary through demonstrations of suffering and selfabnegation which expose and bring to consciousness the oppressors guilt and the faulty position he holds if one elects to follow such a course in accordance with the dictates of his conscience and in full knowledge that the adversary will administer punishment one must be prepared to accept such punishment without retaliation in violent terms desoite the presence in this country of scores of admirers of gandhi who preach his philosophy and have advocated nonviolence and despite the supporters of the peace movement the crystallization of the ideology of nonviolence which guides the present movement is owing to the reverend martin l king prominent attention is given to the reverend king because he has been the most articulate spokesman and has provided the most crystallized ideological expression of the nonviolent movement nonviolence must always be viewed as a phase of a larger social movement it is conceivable and predictable that as the movement changes nonviolence as a technique will disappear though one would not be so bold as to predict when it is already apparent that the successes of the present movement have brought into view a clearer need for different emphases but whatever its future the historian is likely to relate that in the midth century the nonviolent movement focused the attention of america on one of its most significant problems drs solomon and fishman it would appear that the nonviolent student civil_rights movements is neither an unusual accident of history a carefully invented pragmatic ideology of a few leaders nor a movement sprung into being through the appearance of one charismatic leader its content the reactions it provokes and its successes appear to be an understandable intersection between a number of psychological and political forces in the south and the evolution of a new social character in negro youth the movement provides a release of pentup resentment and anger in a politically and socially advantageous and morally superior manner touching both the conscience and political nerves of the community data drawn from the negro students suggest that for many the ideals of nonviolence are secondary to the social and personal considerations of achieving civil_rights to these students nonviolent techniques seem like good strategy and their reason for not striking back when being physically abused is that it would hurt the movement that is not to say they do not believe in the worth of the technique but rather that these students feel that the current political framework and role of public opinion in the country today is such that those who become violent are bound to lose in the long run when a group or individual struggles against opposition much stronger than himself and which is capable of inflicting disastrous retaliation upon him nonviolent defiance seems to provide a way of resolving the dilemma mr kahn there are certain prerequisites for nonviolence a certain degree of organization in society reduces the necessity for violence violence in a large measure is a reflection of social disintegration fundamentally the problem always has been how to remove the instituional causes of violence frictional institutions which cause violence the measure of nonviolence in my view is not how deep down it goes into the individual but how far out it goes from the individual and the group to change the conditions that cause nonviolence the closer the nonviolent directaction movement comes to making progress the more it is going to have to begin to make broad political judgments on the nature of the political system under which we operate it is surprising to me for example that the various civil_rights organizations have yet to mount all together in consort with other progressive forces in society an allout political campaign which has as its single slogan break the political power of the dixiecrats i think this is the main obstacle to which the movement is going to have to address itself mr mitchell i believe the nonviolent movement has been to a great extent identified and described by those who want to make the negro a docile and subservient fellow who is willing to turn the other cheek who is willing to let his women be kicked around who is willing to let his children go to jail this is a great mistake because it is not characteristic of most humans whether they be negroes or not to react that way i think time is running out on america in this resoect i think that those intellectual and dedicated people who have carried the ball of nonviolence who have been willing to be slapped and kicked around have brought about a wonderful chapter in our countrys history but the plain fact is that there are many other people who are not willing to be slapped around there are plenty of other people who will defend their homes if they are bombed the only way to meet this challenge it seems to me is for the u s government to get busy and pass effective legislation which will make it possible to protect people who are interested in safeguarding their lives their property their honor and the future of their children dr waskow i think it is important to examine the question whether there is a field of behavior that is neither violent nor nonviolent but nonlethal this should be done if for no other reason than to make it clear that one need not lapse directly from gandhianism to violence there are techniques for carrying on political conflict that are not violent but do not depend on the direct confrontation of bodies and souls secondly i think we need a new look at the role of the police both the southern establishment and most of the integration movement tend to assume that the role of the police is to defend one or another established order segregation or integration it is possible to imagine a role for the police in which they do neither but aim at only one thingthe prevention and if necessary punishment of outright violence but do not prevent either nonviolent or nonlethal forms of conflict i am not posing this as the solution but i think that the possiblity of this role for the police is one which has not been looked at so far mr meredith first i would like to comment on mr mitchells remarks and say that i am in complete agreement with him no matter how hard i try i cannot fully adopt the principle of nonviolence in addition i do not believe that in the final analysis this principle can solve our problems when i was a student at the university of mississippi and when some other student cursed me and i smiled people would think that i was a shining example of the nonviolent method believe me this was not the case because of the situation at ole miss i had no choice but to act nonviolently i am sure that violence is not the answer to the negros fight for freedom i am not so sure however that our people are as nonviolent as they have been pictured particularly in the white press i believe that if negroes continue to be nonviolent even when circumstances naturally would make them become violent it will be harmful to our position in the long run legal and constitutional aspects mr nabrit the demonstrationsparticularly the sitinshave required lawyers to reexamine some ideas about constitutional law that had become settled and fixed the issue is whether under our system of laws negroes can be kept out of public accommodations because of their race and arrested and jailed for insisting upon service in such facilities the southern states argue that when a storekeeper discriminates against a negro the constitution is not violated because the state is not involved we of the naacp have argued to the contrary saying that the states are deeply involved in these cases i suggest to you that the failure to assure that negroes are treated equally in the public life of the community offends the fourteenth amendment i believe that the framers of the amendment intended that it would cover the failures of states to protect as well as their affirmative misdeeds i think that it is instructive to recall that american states and many english commonwealth and european countries including france italy and the netherlands would protect the right of a negro to be served in a place of public accommodations a principle characteristic of racial segregation is that whatever other impact it may have it is invariably an insult mr trebach one of the great practical effects that direct nonviolent protest has is that it conveys on a personal basis the idea that negroes do regard racial discrimination as an insult the enforcement of segregation is a violation of the equal protection clause it is also true that any action by an official of justice that in any way treats a person differentially because of his race is a violation of the equal protection clause this is a pretty pervasive concept for example there is a case that came out of birmingham where the police went into a railroad station and asked negroes if they had interstate tickets they did not ask whites this action by the police had set the basis for an eventual favorable decision toward these civil_rights protesters bail is a particular problem in baton rouge bail was set at for protesters on a breach of the peace offense normally the bail for this offense is there is also the possibility of relief in the injunctive provisions of the civil statutes the big thing about an injunction in this area is that the general position taken by the federal court is this if a suit commences in the state court the federal court will not issue an injunction unless you can show that great irreparable and immediate harm will occur finally on the possibility of removal of a case from a state to a federal court under present law this is not a very effective remedy i dont know of a successful case in the history of this removal statute i find a terrible prospect for the future but i hope that southern officials will come to their senses stop these practices and conform to the constitution unless they produce a great social upheaval mr bernhard the concept of the original civil_rights statutes passed in the s and s has been totally forgotten this concept was that not only were substantive civil_rights statutes needed but procedures and techniques were needed to enforce them our present provision of the federal law is ineffective in order to get somebody prosecuted successfully today it must be shown that the policeman grabbed a negro hit him over the head jailed him and kicked him after he was in jail but that is not enough you have to establish that while the policeman was doing this to the negro he had a fixed intent to deprive him of a constitutional right i think we need to go back into our history to find out what has happened to the original civil_rights statutes those enacted during reconstruction this is one area that has not been adequately researched to date dean ferguson the method of mass arrests which has been used as a technique against the demonstrators raises some very severe problems about our process of justice administration itself the system is based supposedly on individualization of each particular case what has quite obviously happened is that the mass arrests were not individualized the arrests are what some scholars might call group theory that is if we find a group which can be identified in a particular way then we move against the group i would suggest that there is a fairly substantial constitutional problem here the republican form of government clause may very well be involved when we begin to get mass arrests and mass use of the administration of justice machinery for the purpose of imposing punishment on persons by using such procedural machinery as bail holding for a certain number of hours without consultation and the like dean pye it is easy enough to say that any time we are engaged in nonviolent action where our motives are praiseworthy it is permissible this idea to me raises very serious difficulties i do not have the answer but i suggest that in a pluralistic society such as we live in the dangers to the legal order may be such that we are going to have to place a brake on some of our nonviolent activities we want to be careful in the attempt to justify nonviolent activity which is lawful in the cause of civil_rights that we do not provide the intellectual justification for southern school boards not to desegregate until somebody sues them we want to be careful that we do not give justification to roman catholics who decide not to vote for school bond issues for public schools in negro neighborhoods because they think that constitutionally they have a right to share in those tax revenues for parochial schools miss thornton i am concerned with the amount of time which lapses between the beginning of a right and the winning of a right in the courts i am concerned with the ineffectiveness of the remedies we wait three or four by martin_luther_king jr there can be no gainj ll saying of the fact that ii we face a crisis in race d relations in our nation this crisis has been precipitated by the collusion between the forces of liberation and the forces of domination the old idea of racial segregation of paternalistic relationships has exhausted itself and american society is seeking to reorientate itself along the idea of desegregation of integration the idea of persontoperson relations this is the crisis of our age i am still convinced in spite of the tragedies we have faced in our birminghams and other communities that nonviolence is the most potent weapon available to the negro in his struggle for freedom and justice i believe that nonviolence is the method that can achieve the ideals goals and principles of this new age the philosophy of nonviolence contends that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek means and ends must cohere ones aim must never be to inflict injury upon the opponent this stands at the center of the nonviolent discipline and philosophy one must rise to the heights of being able to accept blows without retaliating nonviolence means that you refuse to engage in external physical violence and it also means that you are constantly moving to the point where you refuse to engage in internal violence of spirit not only will you come to the point that you are able not to shoot the opponent not to hit the opponent not to throw a rock at the opponent but you come to the point that you are able not to hate the opponent some people misunderstood love at this point for they think when you say love you mean a sentimental affectionate emotion and i would be the first to say that it is absurd and nonsense to ask oppressed people to love their oppressors in an affectionate sense the love i speak of is more than an ecstatic or romantic love it is more than friendship it is a love of understanding creative redemptive goodwill for all men it is an overflowing love which seeks nothing in return theologians would say it is the love of god operating in the human heart when an individual rises to love on this level he loves every man not because he likes him not because his ways appeal to himbut he loves every man because god loves him and he rises to the point of loving the person who does the evil deed while hating the deed that the person does i think this is what jesus meant when he said love your enemies and im happy that he didnt say like your enemies its pretty difficult to like some people its pretty difficult to like somebody bombing your home and killing your children its pretty difficult to like some of the senators and congressmen who spend all of their time voting against civil_rights but jesus said love them and love is greater than like it is a recognition that prejudice is a learned process that those who are prejudiced are taught that way hate is dangerous it is as injurious to the hater as it is to the hated the nonviolent discipline says you move toward that point at which you are able to love the opponent and hate segregation and there is something about this that frustrates the opponent it exposes his moral defenses it weakens his morale and at the same time it works on his conscience and he just doesnt know how to handle it even if the opponent tries to kill you you develop an inner conviction that there are some things so precious some things so dear some things so eternally true that theyre worth dying for and if a man has not discovered something that he will die for he isnt fit to live if an individual at yearsold hears some great truth some great principle some great ideal standing at the doorsteps of his life and he refuses to take a stand because hes afraid that his hand will be burned afraid that he will lose a job or afraid that he will be killed and he wants to live longer he may live until hes but hes just as dead at as he is at one must never allow himself to reach the point where he is willing to cooperate with evil this is what civil disobedience means in the final analysis noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good there are those who argue that you cant legislate morality that negroes must wait for freedom until the heart changes but the people who say this fail to see something it may be true that morality cant be legislated but behavior can be regulated it may be true that the law cant change the heart but it can reform the habits it may be true that the law cant make a man love me but it can keep him from lynching me there is need for strong civil_rights legislation and if this legislation is not passed in this session of congress the debilitating sorrow and sore on the body politic will suddenly become malignant and we will be in for a terrible night in our nation it may be a night of violence and terror the whirlwind of hope can be restored in the negro community by the passage of this bill by gordon b hancock booker t wash hd ington was the first f and only american s who made the long t journey from slave cabin to the hall of fame the nearest approach to this marvelous achievement was made by abraham lincoln who rose from railsplitter to the presidency of the united states but the comparison fades before the fact that lincoln was white and booker t washington was a negro with its disadvantages that are beyond human computation whereas lincoln had all the advantages that go with being white in a white mans civilization where a mere white skin is the password to the best that the nation can offer washington had to make his fight up from slavery with his hands tied behind him it is no wonder then that the rise of booker t washington to fame has become one of the social wonders of the modern world and that the world proclaims his greatness and renown redounds to the credit of mankind and is one of historys grandest adornments the coming of booker t washington booker t washington therefore becomes not only one of the greatest negroes but one of the most remarkable men of history that he found his way from that slave cabin to the hall of fame occasions no surprise to students of history for such universal recognition followed as naturally and logically as the night follows day booker t washington stands out in fullest stature when silhouetted against the times when he arrived on the scenethe closing decades of the nineteenth century those dark and turbulent days of reconstruction had not completely passed and slaverys hangover was rife in the land the south was still huffed over losing its war of rebellion and negroes were feeling in full force the wrath of the souths disappointment and grievance over its loss the south mounted what may be definitely called a fivepoint attack in a cold war on the negro freedmen the first assault was on the negros humanity whether or not the negro is human was once a burning question which this writer remembers quite vividly as a lad i remember reading a book by one writer named carroll who wrote a book entitled the negro a beast or the image of god but the negros general advancement and social behaviour soon relegated the specious argument about the negros humanity which was conceded even by the most venomous enemies of the negros advance the next assault was on the negros industry it was argued that the negro could never survive in competition with the white man and that he would soon fade before the withering pressure of a life in competition with the industrious and resourceful white man but the negros general economic advancement shown by his accumulation of property and his fine beginnings in almost every field of human endeavor soon ended the specious argument about the possibility of negro extermination through his lack of industry the negro was not only surviving but grandly next came the assault on the races vitality it was argued that whereas the negro physically survived under slavery because the white man forced upon him habits of survival under freedom he would finally perish for lack of health discipline in those days white life insurance companies refused negroes as unprofitable insurance risks this gave the negro insurance companies just the opening they needed one white actuary named dublin widely publicized the idea of the negro as a too risky insurance risk the north carolina mutual life insurance company and the atlanta life insurance company and others by their phenomenal growth proved the untruth of the allegation against the negros vitality the campaigns that the white companies are putting on for negro risks today are added proof that the poor vitality argument against the negro has lost its force then came the assault on the negros morality this was an argument to the effect that negroes could not control themselves sexually and were rapists by nature and hence a grave danger to the white mans society this argument has long since been dissipated by such findings as reuter in his american race problem and by the history of sex crimes in the nation the final assault was made on the negros mentality and the mental tests incident to world war i gave just the excuse prejudiced whites craved to prove that the negro lacked mental equality with the whites and was thereby disqualified for full citizenship in this country but when the mental tests showed that northern negroes showed to better advantage than southern whites all the wind was taken out of the sails of the fivefold attack on the negro in a cold war that is still going on booker t washington came on the scene to face this social psychology of the white south then there arose such towering negrophobes as ben tillman of south carolina who was the first to throw the negro question full force into politics he so played upon race prejudice that he an almost unlettered white man became governor of south carolina and went on to the senate of the united states with no political platform other than keep the negro down it was so easy that georgia soon had its hoke smith and tom watson mississippi soon had its vardaman and bilbo alabama had its heflin and soon every southern state had a vestpocket edition of ben tillman tillmanism still flourishes in the south in this situation the negro found himself impoverished untrained and inadequately led except by its ministry that was unequal to the tremendous task that lay ahead booker t washington in this trying and critical hour not only arrived on the scene but he arrived a man with a plan he reasoned that having done the souths hard labor for hundreds of years the negros foot was in the door and all he had to do was to keep pushing he argued that the negros labor was his only commodity and if this could be sold to advantage the negro could gradually rise by his own efforts he came preaching a gospel of industrial education and the dignity of labor it was true that dr w e b du bois and john mitchell and monroe trotter and frederick douglass were urging negroes to contend for their rights but the sign of the times pointed to the conclusion that ere the white man conceded the negros claims for full citizenship there would be a long lapse of years there would be a long and arduous struggle subsequent events have proved the correctness of washingtons conclusion after a hundred years we are still a long way from the promised land negroes in general were quick to grasp washingtons idea but under the aegis of the arguments of douglass and dubois they were soon confused and with the apparent lack of coordination of leadership it was easier to sell negroes on positions than to sell them on the matter of jobs the negroes who fought washington based their fight on the exposition speech he made in atlanta when he said in things economic the races in the south could be as one as the fist but in things social they could be as separate as the fingers this statement by a man beset by a prejudiced south led by at times vicious white leaderpoliticians turned the wolves loose on washington yet when we review his atlanta speech in retrospect what else could he have said at the time for him to have taken the position that martin_luther_king jr is taking now and saying what negroes on every corner are saying would have meant annihilation for the negro race moreover since washington uttered the atlanta speech negroes living in the white mans south have done just what he said could be done in things economic negroes and whites of the south have lived side by side and in things social they have been as separate as the fingers the truth of washingtons statement has been lived before the eyes of the world moreover there are indications that in spite of minor gains here and there and in spite of some momentous court decisions there is little or no evidence that negroes and whites of the south will not still continue to live as one as the fist in things economic and as separate as fingers on the hand in things social of course the negro race would have it different most of us are nowists but are dealing with principalities and powers that have sworn unto death that neverism is the word if there is any leader who can hasten matters his work is cut out for him but conconcluded washingtonand wisely the negro cannot do without eating and wearing until this whole matter is settled eating is a nowist matter and what faced the negro in washingtons day faces the negro in our great today the negro must fight but he must have something to eat in the meantime and so when washington arrived he was a man with a plan what was his planto take the foothold negroes had in the economic life of the nation through his primacy in the manual arts and exploit it to the utmost to sell the use of proficient hands until we qualify ourselves to sell the product of our brains to make the very most of opportunities in the manual arts until we gather strength and prepare ourselves for positions of our liking there is nothing disgraceful about using jobs as stepping stones to positions economic security and assurance must precede full citizenship in this country and not follow this is one of those stern facts of economic life booker t washingtons doctrine rejected according to the teachings and doctrine of booker t washingtonjust suppose he could have sold his idea to the negro race through its leaders the negro cooks would be the owners of our great eating places and establishments our bricklayers and carpenters would be our great contractors now our launderers would have charge of the great laundry industry instead of quarreling and fighting for the jobs that are becoming fewer and fewer by reason of competition and automation we would now be commanding those jobs but washingtons doctrine and his plan were utterly rejected hampton and tuskegee could not supply the great need for training such as they offered but what is even more tragictheir graduates did not spread the doctrines and popularize it at first little tuskegees and little hamptons sprung up all over the south but those who taught industrial education did not themselves believe in it and so could not enthuse their students about its possibilities even our great schools at tuskegee and hampton are today for all practical purposes schools of liberal arts those who rejected and spurned washingtons doctrine of industrial education were under moral compulsion to bring an alternate program just as washington had a plan for his day we need for our present day a man with a plan we have before us a gigantic task to win first class citizenship but in spite of our cry now there are multiplying evidences that we are nin for a long struggle and we must eat in the meantime dr du bois and monroe trotter and john mitchell all gainsaid and disparaged washington they had fine arguments but no alternate plan negro leadership has utterly rejected washingtons plan of using the manual arts and occupations as means of gaining positions but nobody seems to be coming up with a plan to feed the negro while he fights the fight the negro is now putting up deserves a leadership with a plan we cannot reach our goal merely by producing a race of fighters though fighters we must have but we also need a plan to feed these fighters even fighters must be fed one of the glories of washington is that he not only had a plan but it was a positive plan and a practical plan a plan in a time of great crisis and great need today the employment situation is becoming so serious that the government is becoming concerned and is about to pour millions of dollars into training and retraining for the jobs that are and will be available it is seriously to be wondered whether our educators and other leaders who have completely rejected the washington plan will sell the negro race the opportunity inherent in the current efforts to train and retrain for jobs that will be scarcer as competition and automation press like a vise upon the working population today we are fighting against segregation although most of our economic success is of the segregated varietyour professionals our insurance companies our publications our undertakers and barbers and beauty culturists all live by segregation our thousands and thousands of teachers today are faring finely salarywise in our segregated schools desegregation without integration will not relieve the necessity of our leaning hard upon the fruits of segregation in spite of segregation the negro has advanced but we need a plan we have rejected washingtons negro educators what is your economic plan for the masses although the negro race through its leaders and especially its educators has utterly rejected washingtons plan to date has offered no alternate plan to succour the race in its economic life washington made the great mistake too often made by the prophets preaching to the people a gospel of what they need instead of what they want and so booker t washington was stoned even as the prophets of old were stoned but when we consider what booker washington had to show for his teachings and doctrinesa tuskeegeeand what his critics have to show washington thus stands out in bold relief like the towering alps snowcapped and majestic booker t knew in his early times that in the last analysis who has the dollar is a far more powerful question than who is going to marry whose daughter and so he had a plan by which negroes could command the dollar it still is true that he who would get the dollar must put his heart into his work as well as his hands it is still true that beginning at the bottom is the surest way to reach the top washington was our great leader in the darker days of segregation martin_luther_king jr is proving himself a great leader in these anxious days of desegregation of sorts who will bring forward a leadership for the days of integration that lie far into the uncertain future many a great football game has been lost by a fumble negro leadership fearfully fumbled the opportunity that washingtons philosophy and doctrine pointed out to a struggling race we are wondering seriously whether our fumble can be recovered and the day saved by a reformed leadership that will not reject the man and the plan that led somewhere the problems that confront us in these troubled times together with our lack of a constructive plan of solution are a vindication of the life and teachings of booker t washington who looked over the shoulders of three generations by ssgt gerald westbrook the dictionary gives various definitions for this particular essence history identifies those w ho possessed it the bible reveals from whence it came the song that begins lift every voice and sing portrays it violent death often takes he who displays itmedgar evers he conveyed it many more died but the essence lives on and on the freedom march in washington expressed it in a feeling rather than a sight or a sound i have a dream said reverend king and tears sprang to many eyes for he spoke from his heart and his speech had the essence and when i read his speech i felt this essence i think most american negroes who read or heard it did for this essence is at the very core of our existence it binds all our lives together and in it we are one the chains of slavery could not squeeze it from us the noose could not bring it to an end the countless whips may have drawn blood from the flesh but they could not draw the essence from within thus it was passed down to us through the centuries not from hand to hand but rather from heart to heart it is within us among us and around us it is part of our heritage we call it soul to us soul is a part of many things have you heard of soul food or soul music in a recent interview as reported by an international magazine mary lou williams the pianist said this i am praying through my fingers when i play i get that good soul sound and i try to touch peoples spirits she did not elaborate but her statement raises a questionwhat is this soul that she captures in her music it is the same essence that medgar evers conveyed moreover a recent issue of jet magazine reported that solomon burke the singer had been dubbed the king of rock n soul an interpretation of that title is beyond the scope of this article however why is the term rock n soul used in place of the more familiar rock n roll to what does this soul refer it refers to the same essence that was expressed by the freedom march in addition the society editor of jet informed us that the dinner served at a special event consisted entirely of soul food the specific menu for the dinner need not particularly concern us what we are concerned with is this question what was the soul that pervaded the food it was the same essence that per vaded reverend kings speech what is it that has spanned the centuries that can bridge the gap between such different styles of music as those of mary lou williams and solomon burke what is it that was shared by thousands during a mass marchthat reached out and touched them when they heard a speechthat is used to describe such opposites as food and music what is the essence that we call soul it is not the moral or religious soul of any single man not the lone one possessed by you or me it is part of yet apart from the individual soul it is a togetherness a oneness a sum even more than a feeling soul is an affinity rather than a word a look mostly a spiritual sharing in the blending of all that was that is and is to come soul is that which tells the story of many lives in a single prayer one that began perhaps in the slavehold of a ship a prayer that implores the light of freedom to shine to pierce the darkness in mens minds so that well all be free to us this prayer gave a sense of humility and from that humility came soul a james meredith who faces hostile crowds a freedom rider who emerges from a burning bus a pregnant woman who spends days in a dark dank cellthese people transcend fear or bravery they have soulthe essence that embraces happiness and exalts sadness that tempers bravery and lessens fear it justifies dying relieves living and lends significance to life and death in his book black like me john h griffin tells of the time he went to an unidentified smalltown bus station in the south i bought a ticket to montgomery and went to sit outside on the curb where other negro passengers gathered many negroes walked through the streets their glances were kind and communicative as though all of us shared a common secret the impression that he received was correct their glances were kind and communicative because the common secret that they shared was soul for soul is living in sympathy with one another having an empathy for each other and sharing in all the things that we have felt and that we feel soul encompasses facing forward with high hopes and looking backward at the sorrows joys trials toil and tears it involves looking back across the bodies of our dead ancestors back across their shallow nameless graves to the nights when they sat and sang in the face of terror to the nights they hung bloody heads and prayed those songs and those prayers are still among us though they may be different in melody and word so if a strange song or prayer brings sudden tears to our eyes we are not surprised we know that this is soul and if we could hear the ancient voices speaking from the nameless graves they would tell us of the thousands who died from lack of bread they would tell us of the foodless days and cold hungry nights they would tell us that they sat and cried as they watched their children starve and die then they would tell us of the times when there were only certain foods to eat greens from the fields the belly of a sow the bread made from cornmeal or flour they would tell us that those foods once helped them cheat the hands of death that they nourished those who began the struggle that we have vowed to carry on so it is not strange that certain foods touch on memories of those who lived before for we are reminded of all the foods that they had and didnt have this too is soul soul is the common denominator the great identifier the path of synonymity from the crib to the grave from the gutter to the throne rising above love neutralizing hate moving outside of riches or poverty it forges a link between the princes and paupers the bourgeoisie and bums soul combines strength and a feeling of helplessness faith and a feeling of hopelessness an awareness of living and suffering a love for loving an urge for laughing and the need to cry soul is to each of us what it is unto itselfa reflection of lifes miseries and a mirror for its joys we have caught that reflection we have looked into that mirror such is soul the essence we feel by calvin jarrett the mississippi senator v rjp f who succeeded jefferson davis in the united states senate was opposed to lynching his name was hiram rhoades revels he was a negro president of the confederacy tj when hiram revels took his seat in the senate he was fulfilling prophecy senator simon cameron told senator jefferson davis in when he left the senate i believe in the justice of god that a negro some day will come and occupy your seat the senator was the first negro to serve in the united states senate hiram rhoades revels was born september at fayetteville north carolina he was born of free parents so he never knew the condition of servitude he left north carolina when a young man revels moved to indiana while quite young and attended the quaker seminary in union county a while later he moved to darke county ohio and attended the seminary there when he had completed this period of education he went to baltimore maryland he was ordained in the african methodist episcopal ministry in his education was incomplete he went to illinois and graduated from knox college at bloomington after completing his education the young negro taught and lectured to his people in indiana illinois missouri kansas kentucky and tennessee at last he settled in st louis missouri where he taught for a short while the energetic young minister returned to preaching in cincinnati st louis pittsburgh and baltimore preacher revels was in baltimore when the civil war began he assisted in organizing the first two negro regiments raised in maryland in revels moved to st louis and founded a large school for freedmen he helped to recruit a negro regiment in st louis in he went to mississippi and joined the federal army as chaplain of a negro regiment at the same time he helped the freedmens bureau to extend protection to negro troops chaplain revels crossed over from vicksburg to jackson to establish schools and churches bushwhackers almost captured him but he was warned by friends and managed to escape in he left the army and went to louisville and then to leavenworth kansas to preach in he settled at natchez mississippi where he combined preaching with participation in politics the first republican convention ever held in mississippi met at jackson september about a third of its members were exslaves revels had been elected as alderman of natchez in he was elected to the state senate in at this time revels had received no particular attention from the reconstruction republicans but when the state legislature of mississippi convened in january preacher revels was called on to open the session with a prayer his prayer was impressive and did much to lead to his election as united states senator the minister had entered politics reluctantly because he feared his participation would cause racial friction he was careful to never prostitute the pulpit to partisan purposes as some were accused of doing mississippi had no representative in the united states senate after jefferson davis resigned at the beginning of the civil war when mississippi reentered the union in revels was elected as a compromise candidate the memphis daily avalanche of january had this to say about the first negro to serve in the united states senate seven cities contended for the honor of homers birth how many will struggle for revels is yet a question a week ago people had never heard his name or if heard it was only to be forgotten now it will be the subject of leaders and when revels reaches washington the reporters of all the great journals will interview him happy revels he is of popular manners and speaks with great ease fluency and generally in good taste in his intercourse with all classes he conducts himself with decorousness that has won him the regard of all his neighbors at home and of the members of the mississippi senate of which he is now a member revels did not go to washington to serve a full fouryear term it was an unexpired term to last from february to march when senator revels arrived in washington some members of the mississippi delegation held a party president u s grant and his cabinet members were present grant received revels with much kindness and told him he hoped he would be admitted to the senate without difficulty it was reported that even the radicals of the republican party didnt want a negro in congress when revels credentials were presented to the senate on february one senator james nye rejoiced in a speech that a negro was replacing jefferson davis this set off a debate that lasted all day and revels was not confirmed on that day the debate resumed on february and lasted all day without a decision senator simon cameron made a speech in which he reminded the senate of what he had said in when jefferson davis left washington the radicals wanted to seat revels in davis old seat for the spectacular effect it would create senator ross of kansas occupied jeff davis old seat no he would not give it up and revels was forced to take no on the opposite side of the row a vote of to was cast in his favor on february and revels became the first negro to be seated in the u s senate the newspapers and the negro ministers in washington announced that senator revels would give his first speech in the senate on march the gallery of the senate was packed a writer for the philadelphia press said never since the birth of the republic has such an audience been assembled under one single roof it embraced the greatest and the least american citizens the occasion of revels speech was the readmission of georgia into the union in referring to his race he managed to get in a word for civil liberties they appeal to you and to me to see that they receive that protection which alone will enable them to pursue their daily avocations and enjoy the liberties of citizenship on the same footing with their white neighbors and friends sir i repeat the fact that the colored race saved the noble women of new england and the middle states many men of whom they lean today for security and safety many of my race representatives of these men on the battlefield sleep in countless graves of the south if those quiet resting places of our honored dead could speak today what a mighty voice like to the rushing of a mighty wind would come up from those sepulchral homes could we resist the eloquent pleadings of their appeal ah sir i think that this question of immediate and ample protection for the loyal people of georgia would lose its technicalities and we would cease to hesitate in our provisions for their instant relief senator revels didnt receive any more attention until the summer of at this time he appointed a negro to west point the negro cadet failed to pass and was soon dropped the nation pronounced it a very foolish and cruel thing as far as the boy and his family were concerned and a very injudicious thing as far as the colored race is concerned the first negro senator introduced two or three minor bills which failed to pass on february he gave his last speech in the senate it concerned the mixed schools in the district of columbia he favored the proposal of mixed schools at the conclusion of his speech he said the white race has no better friend than i i am true to my own race but at the same time i would not have anything done which would harm the white race revels term came to a close on march he did not run for reelection alcorn college for negroes was established in mississippi and revels became its first president he was appointed by governor alcorn who had replaced him in the u s senate in june revels went to new orleans to edit the southwestern advocate an organ of the general conference of his church revels then served a second term as president of alcorn college after this he returned to religious work and made his home at holly springs mississippi he became district superintendent of his church and died while attending a church conference at aberdeen mississippi the date was january thus ended the career of the first negro to serve in the united states senate our children must not be castoffs my job is that of a teacher i am proud of it devoted to it and fully aware of my responsibilities that is why i am here tonight i apologize for the screen which shields me from your view however without its protection i might lose my job yet the screen does allow my words to reach your ears for this i am grateful to begin with like you i am a product of the society that stands on trial here tonight when i was just a toddler unaware of real human conflicts my mother often said these words to meover and over in a determined voice when you are old enough to go to school we are going to leave this place well go where you can get a good education we lived in the heart of the rural south then where educational facilities for negroes were lacking she kept her promise and we leftheading northward to the land of opportunity we know that teachers should be constantly at war against one common enemyignorance but what do we teach the truth part of it or only the truth as we see it in any discussion of the socalled negro problem the truth is often grossly mistreated usually ignorance is the rootor very close to the rootof this problem as a result the mere mention of the word negro sends minds of all colors scurrying for protective cover nobody wants to discuss it especially squeamish are the whites who created it they have preconceived ideas these ideas were passed down from generation to generation because of this fact they accept without questioning all the ideas that are inherited thus a monster image of the negro has been skillfully built in the minds of white america likewise uncle tom negroes eager to assimilate into the white mans culture adopt readily his values as to beauty standards and cultural patterns lost is the sophisticated negros identity with anything negroid or dark in hue very briefly let me review some very disturbing byproducts of deftly applied ignorance any member of the white race is basically superior to any member of the darker races regardless of age or natural ability the negro in general is not to be regarded as a human beinghe is thought of only as chattel and is to be exploited whenever possible under pressure a few doles can be handed out to pacify him for the moment the negro is only one step removed from the lower animals for this reason he has extra long or large body parts the negro has a peculiar offensive odor his intelligence level is and is destined to be lower than that of other racial or ethnic groupsparticularly the white group the negro has no culture he is really uncivilized and can never be fused into a civilized urbane white society the negro is basically lazy slovenly and happy go lucky he is satisfied with his lot in life he does not want any socalled freedom he is a poor workerin job situationsand is utterly undependable if his job becomes easier as to physical demands it is then declared to be a white job he is fired the negro can succeed only in matters requiring physical or entertainment ability this fact accounts for the monopoly of the sports and amusement fields if a negro is interested in integration he is interested primarily because he desires intermarriage personal wishes of equal job opportunities housing and education are not understood by white americans havent we all heard these statements the fact that these beliefs contribute to the neverending circle of frustration despair and general confusion felt by the average negro is not even considered by the whites tensionreleasing activities such as rock and roll music or other diversions are frowned upon by whites as being symbolic of the animal nature of the negro thus the white man can justify smugly that he has the right to relegate the negro to his place for everyones good such then is the social climate as we switch to a negro school in a negro neighborhood fortyeight negro youngsters push and shove each other into line as they hear the clanging of the shift bell if this class is in a changing neighborhood they are often exposed to perplexed hostile white teachers who neither understand their problems and resultant actions nor attempt to the students are yelled at compared to stupid animals and generally impressed with the fact that they are two to three years below grade levela fact that they are already aware of they are scolded and told to act like civilized people they are told that they cannot write neither can they read the strange symbols in the book if they are lucky they can look at the pictures of the little white blondehaired children playing with their pets in the backyard of course the house is white surrounded by the lilywhite picket fence a first grade teacher in a southside chicago school reading dick and jane with the class asked who lives in the white house on the hill one little boy finally stood up scratched his head and said the white people do this is the white world and it is strangefar removed from his dark world his color is his curse he sees this fact very clearly as his father returns home at night to tell of his failures in trying to get a job that day that is if his father has not already become discouraged and left the home he all too often feels that adc aid to dependent children is the answer that will provide food and shoes for his needy family thus he disappears so that his family will be provided for and he can laugh or drink his troubles awaywith less overpowering responsibility and more opportunity for success is it any wonder that the student leaves school one way or the other as soon as possible truancy dropouts and general delinquency reign supreme in these hotbeds well then how can a teacher teach this class of negro children often rebellious to any form of authority she begins with the pledge to the flaglistening to the chant one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all fervently she labors to develop the concept that equal and adequate services of the public schools are available to all the children of all the people yet she knows that lettie the fifteen year old girl in the sixth seat in the first row has no idea of what shes saying her iq according to test scores is but she is sitting in a regular classroom with other seventh graders the division that could best meet her needs is overcrowded at her school the fact that she has a violent temper and fighting tendencies simply prompts school officials to graduate her from grammar school as quickly as possible where is lettie now what is she doing there are hundreds of letties in regular classrooms throughout the negro sections of the city some have iqs in the s but they still are lost in the rushed crowded schedule of the overcrowded shift situations the iqs of these children are taken as irrevocable fact when educators pounce upon their scores yet studies have proven that they are more often than not completely unreliable consider the example of a negro child attempting to take an iq test she is asked to put a mark on a pail however she marks everything but a pail because she sees only a bucket a pair of scissors and a ball the word pail is not in the childs experiential vocabulary therefore she will not mark the pail and her test results will be correspondingly lowered it has been proven also that the person administering the test plays a vital role in the test results if negro children are being tested by a white tester iq results are considerably lower than those in a control group of children tested by a negro tester libraries are full of data supporting all statements made here tonight but ignorance again wins out when american citizens are either unaware of these facts or are too biased in their thinking to investigate the question arises are all negro children underprivileged and housed in crowded cramped conditions no they are not yet as recently as four months ago statistics were obtained stating that of the children on double shift sessions in chicago classrooms some of those children were negro youngsters the coincidence is too striking what do you think well over a thousand children have passed through my classroom door and each one had some unique problem generally in the crowded situation i had neither the time nor energy to devote to really helping those children solve the problems that were blocking their learning opportunities as a result some children that i formerly taught are today parents of illegitimate children seriously mentally disturbed dope addicts prostitutes and at least one that i can recall is dead because of his unfavorable environment when i have children in a class there just isnt time to listen all i have time for is maintaining order some of the evils of overcrowded school conditions in negro neighborhoods are so remote and removed from the average white persons thinking that he cannot begin to understand the problem little or no school supplies are available for overcrowded classrooms extra fancy supplies such as yarn string scotch tape scissors for every child crayolas or other basic necessities are simply a joke when they are requested one set of books per subject is assigned to each desk despite the fact that two children must share them on a doubleshift basis more not fewer books are needed by these handicapped children they are not available what happened may i ask to the negro parents tax dollar why doesnt his child have books school supplies the extras that make learning fun not drudgery in most double shift schools there is not enough time even for a regular recess gym periods are cut in halfmost normal schools have two gym periods a week but most double shift classes have only one the children are cramped and confined without regular exercise and you know what this does to learning often schools that are on shift have had the library converted to a regular classroom yet these are the students who need libraries most who can answer these questions we have the most talented educator in the country at our disposal so we have been so forcibly told does he choose to give our negro parents any answers does he know does he care he certainly has had opportunity enough for on numerous occasionstoo numerous to list tonightsupt benjamin c willis has been asked to give chicago taxpayers a true picture of the school situation has he shown the courtesy to do so no why should we negro and white alike be burdened more with increased taxes when more than enough empty classrooms already exist in this city to take our children off double shift we do not need new schools we need to fill the ones that we already have attention white america we are not interested in marrying your daughters all we want are equal opportunities at job training and other benefits we want adequate housing for our familieshousing that we can afford then we will not have to double up in order to pay your rents we can pay reasonable rents save our money and buy homes for our familiesas you have been able to do dr willis it is your responsibility as our superintendent to see that all children are given equal opportunity for learning despite race creed or national origin it has been said dr willis that you harbor the same idea that some of your white brothers sharethat those children meaning ours should be treated as castoffs in a society that demands only the best those children dr willis are children and grandchildren of negroes whose talents have been grossly neglected and wasted have you wondered why there are so many dropouts among negro youths have you wondered why that teenage gang made its threat because of the school situation have you ever wondered why the negro youth thrive on rock and roll music and dances have you ever visited any taverns and seen negro fathers in despair over the jobs that they almost gotbut couldnt because they were born with dark skins you are a great educator dr benjamin c willis havent you ever thought about these wasted livesor did you solve your problem by drawing another boundary line with your very wise pencil we are paying you a handsome salary to do a job dr willis when are you planning to start to work we have a right to know by ruth burke so youve decided to o take the happy gamr ble you and the neygu p gro man or woman whom you love feel that in spite of the probable rough going ahead life would be much harder to bear if you didnt marry now that youve made the big decision you want to know what to plan for and what to expect the first item on your program will be to check and see whether or not your state allows interracial marriage nineteen states prohibit it they are alabama arkansas florida georgia louisiana mississippi north carolina south carolina tennessee texas virginia delaware indiana kentucky maryland missouri wyoming oklahoma and west virginia if you live in a state which has a law forbidding your marriage you have two courses of action open to you either move to a state where there is no such law or make an attempt to marry then if stopped take the case to the courts of your state in an attempt to have the law changed these laws are archaic since so many states have dropped their antimiscegenation laws recently perhaps your state is just waiting for a case such as yours to test their law then they could dispense with it on legal precedent of course if you live in the deep south they may be reluctant to do so just yet one important thing to remember is not to settle for a commonlaw alliance for then your marriage will have an inferior status and your children might not be your lawful heirs after you have decided the state in which you will be married and the one in which you will live note if you leave your home state briefly to be married elsewhere and return after the ceremony the state could prosecute you for trying to evade its law your next concern will be the choice of a dwelling will you rent for awhile or can you afford the down payment on a house the houses which carry the lowest down payment are tract houses and if you like them you can quickly have one to call your own more and more tract houses are opening to people of all ethnic groups and government financed houses cannot legally practice discrimination if you dont like tracts perhaps you would like to live in an apartment until you have children good apartments in the right price range are sometimes hard to find when you need one one way is to advertise in the paper most read by the economic or intellectual group in which you belong state all the nice things about yourself and say that you will give a breakage deposit if required another way is to place a card on the advertising boards of your local markets say plainly that you are a mixed couple and then the right people can call you those who live in certain areas of the country where there are laws against discrimination in housing have an advantage but it is up to them to take a firm stand and not back down new york city has such a law and so does california with its unruh ate and the much publicized rumford act however in many areas of the country people are forming committees to peacefully gain open occupancy this is true in riverside california then too in chicago the old town gardens and marina city are examples of places open to all who can qualify with the rise of labor unions employers have been less able to fire their workers for personal reasons if you or the person you are to marry feel that your job has been taken from you because of your association together see your union representative or go to one of your local civil_rights protective groups if you are working on a job handling government contracts this is illegal in any case do your work well so your employer will not want to find an excuse to dismiss you you may have heard that mixed couples lose all of their friends when they marry this isnt true for you wont lose any real friends you may even gain more than you had before as interested people will seek your company unless you live in an area where bigotry is so strong that people are too frightened to be friendly if your family treats you in a mean way or disowns you treat them kindly and with understanding time will mellow them especially when they see your children they will be likely to reown you they will be somewhat ashamed of their hasty judgment and will use many different ways in trying to make it up to you be prepared for questions of all kinds some of them quite personal people are curious and if they can overcome their shyness enough to speak up they will try to find out just how a mixed marriage works try not to be offended but give them an honest answer you dont know but what they are contemplating doing the same thing when people stare at you on the street it is not necessarily out of hostility remember that a good number of people have been taught that mixed marriage cant exist in the united states so it is something of a jolt for them to see a mixed couple negroes stare as much as whites so just assume that people want to look at you if one or both of you still attends high school wait until you graduate to marry this is hard to do sometimes as emotions are hard to control particularly the strong emotions that mixed couples feel for each other your parents may not allow you to date openly but dont sneak out to see each other as difficult as it may be try to finish school so that you will be able to get good jobs after that if your parents still forbid your courtship tell them that you dont intend to defy them but that you honestly feel that you are doing the right thing your new inlaws and other negro relatives by marriage might not care for you very much at first but they are likely to be much more friendly to you than your caucasians relatives will be to your mate just give them time to know you remembering that they are often bitter about the treatment which they have received in the past from whites love and understanding will be your main weapons if you keep your personal life above reproach they will be quick to see that there is no angle to your marriage but love for the one whom you marry dont worry about whether or not to have children have all you can afford they will be interesting and probably beautiful enough to win first prize in the local baby contest if they know that their parents love each other and love them they cannot help but be well adjusted and happy they will be able to make friendsand enemieson their own too as other negro children such children of mixed couples as roy campanella philippa schuyler and andre watts have made a high mark in the united states this is the most important thing to remember dont leave god out of your lives attend church every week and kneel and pray together every day thank god for each other and always be grateful to him for keeping prejudice from preventing your marriage do things together after all you have defied longstanding customs to be together take part in all the activities that you have time for plan trips to the zoo and the beach go to concerts and to museums enjoy each others company if you are a white woman learn how to press hair you may have a daughter who needs it you will find that negro women are often sensitive to having members of the other race around while they are doing their hair once they dont mind you know youve been accepted as one of the gang try to keep your home as much of a refuge from the outside world as possible your mate will be contending with the frustrations which will continue to beset negroes until we help our country to free itself of prejudice use a thousand ways to show you care by the fact of your marriage you will have helped atone for the terrible way in which the whites have treated negroes over the years you will be showing that if the united states is actually the melting pot of the world then every ethnic group has the right to melt soon youll feel like and be an honorary negro knowing how to read expresisons and sensing where discrimination is practiced finally when the ubiquitous bigot asks the classic question about whether or not you would want your daughter to marry one you can reply friend my daughter is a negro so if you are certain that you have made the right choice get married the rest of your life will show you how right you were a matter of fellowship during a softball game a lessthantenyearold boy called to me from the sidelines hey mister you look like johnny jones are you his father no im not i am warren marr and im from new york how do you do mr marr i am carl smith and im from rocky mount are you enjoying your visit here yes yes i am i almost stuttered into additional conversation for i was not prepared for this kind of assurance and maturity from a negro boy in bricks n c i would not have been prepared for this kind of exchange from any boy of or younger carl was one of youngsters all under the age of who were sharing the experience of a twoweek summer camp at franklinton center located in the miniature town of bricks in the rural tobacco country of northern north carolina he was one of a group who were having their play period and who had divided into two softball teams for a lively game without immediate adult supervision carls turn at bat came v excuse me mr marr he said returning to the game and driving a twobagger down center field when the inning broke the boys agreed to pose for a picture quickly they arranged themselves in rows and assumed postures associated in their minds with professional ballplayers the effect was good and i told them that they handled themselves better than many adults under similar circumstances thats a polaroid isnt it mister someone asked yes how do youknow do you have one no but ive seen them on ed sullivans show can we see the picture come out another asked sure i said as i squeezed the shutter release come on i began to count aloud one two a chorus picked up the count and carried it on the basis of the rhythm i had initiated to ten then quiet heads moved in close to watch the back of the camera being opened for the extraction of the finished snapshot hey thats good can you make pictures for us i wont have enough film for the work i have to do if i make a picture for each of you i must get photographs of the buildings and the work in the community to take back to my office ill take one photo which i will give the group of you if that will help how will all of you share one picture thats easy a boy said well take it to miss martin and she can put it on the bulletin board who will take it to her let joe be in charge hes the oldest later in the day in the auditorium of fellowship hall the pure vigorous voices of boys blended in fourpart harmony rehearsals were under way for a closing program and again i was impressed with the decorum of the boys and their respect for discipline there was no fidgeting and no whispered conversations only wholehearted participation the song ended and a tall brown face rose from the group to announce the next feature eight boys walked alertly to the front to sing as an octet then came a demonstration of the virginia reel performed with near perfection a display of acrobatics revealed surprising agility and muscular control twelve boys participated in a military marching drill more songs what you have achieved with these children is completely unbelievable i said to marjorie martin you must have worked with them endlessly im only here for a short period during the summer the redhaired freckled instructor said i am a schoolteacher and can be here only on my vacation time william judson king president of franklinton center interrupted this is the second and younger group of children who have been here this summer there were girls from to in the first group of this annual pta camp they come from all parts of north carolina the way young people respond to miss martin defies description we wish we could afford to have her as a permanent member of our staff the reference to limited funds almost went unnoticed with his positive outlook mr king was only stating a condition he has to work with he was not bemoaning an obvious and im sure heartbreaking limitation this impression occurred again when on a tour of the establishment he said here is the dining hall it seats since we can sleep people comfortably it becomes a trick of mathematics to feed that many everything about mr king is positiveeasy unassuming unpretentious but positive as he moves at a seemingly relaxed pace about his wellkept campus he observes everything and acts immediately that man cutting the lawn is at a point where he should switch to the bigger power mower she wont start the man says president judson king squats behind the machine and makes some adjustments with a screwdriver the machine starts in hospitality hall the dormitory the venetian blinds are closed so the rays of the sun are deflected downward the sun will fade our furniture he says as he reverses the slant of the blinds this is the same man whose foresight has helped the farmers of his own and adjacent counties to have their first contact with the industrial world a corporation was formed with stock offered to the negro farmers at two dollars a share some of the farmers wives made weekly trips to kings strictly utilitarian office to pay for a share of stock at the rate of cents a visit mind you i cant issue you a stock certificate which costs cents to produce until you have purchased ten shares he would say the women didnt mind they and their husbands in a relatively short time accumulated then they looked for a small industrial plant to buy they found one in a neighboring town and their joint investment is now paying per cent we wont identify the business its management is still white the machine operators are negro as far as we were able to learn the town in which the business is located is unaware that it is now negroowned president king finds great satisfaction in the knowledge that some of his people have diversified their financial interests in addition negroes handling the machinery are gaining a technical knowledge and experience they would not have been able to acquire otherwise they can use this new knowledge to particular advantage if they should move into the industrial cities as many do nearly every highschool graduate leaves the area within a year of his commencement exercises it is a good beginning it is impossible to assess the influence judson king exerts in north carolina as head of franklinton center and neighboring tillery he perpetuates and extends the tradition of the organization which founded both these centers that tradition was at its best when the american missionary association went into the south on the heels of the union armies setting up schools for negro freedmen and any whites who would attend more than schools had their beginnings this way franklinton center as it exists today is the result of the merger of two separate institutionsbricks school and franklinton center in franklinton at the end of the th century bricks worked with negro share croppers teaching them to read and write and to improve their agricultural methods later it became a junior college when the school was discontinued the future was uncertain then came the merger efforts to make the new franklinton a conference center were tenuous meanwhile the buildings had fallen into disrepair when one building burned and several others were razed their gaping foundations became dumping groundsunsightly health hazards the vast grounds became overgrown with brush judson king has nearly rebuilt franklinton since he cameand not without excitement as he began to eliminate an old foundation a dragline brought up snakes poisonous moccasins as franklinton has regained its stature its acres have diminished former tenant farmers of the area who once studied at bricks have been sold parcels of land adequate for economically sound farming with the continued cooperation of the center the new landowning families have become successful farmers meanwhile various groups and organizations are using the center for their conferences in addition to the camp mentioned before there have been joint churchmens meetings ministers institutes laymens fellowship meetings the american friends meetings international study caravans conferences on better life for farm families and numerous other conventions less than a score of miles northwest of franklinton is the sprawling community of tillery named for its former white owner when the federal government was selling off the rehabilitation project to negro tenants several local landlords wanted the crossroads site of a community center for business purposes the ama purchased it to preserve it for the use of the tillery community today the tillery community center is operated under the auspices of franklinton center and serves as headquarters for the tillery improvement association which stresses farm home and community improvement one day last august nearly peoplenegro farmers and their familiescrowded into the little auditorium for their fifth annual picnic meeting with the theme farming in the space age they planned for the year ahead and for the years after that during the formal part of the meeting several white farmequipment representatives sat in the audience they had accepted the invitation of tillery to display their equipment on ground space rented at the ridiculously low figure of these men have learned that the tillery farmers will buy equipment only from firms that participate in this annual picnic it is estimated that the gross value of equipment purchased from the exhibitors has reached the sum of that amount of money becomes staggering with the realization that years ago most of the farmers were cultivating small plots with muledrawn plows perhaps the most successful farmer under the tillery influence is a man who has acres of rented land in tobacco com soy beans and cotton his crops are typical of the area so is his forward outlook there is a great amount of cooperation among these farmers as they enjoyed their annual outing the only sour notes were their expressions of disgust about the impenetrable minds and dragging feet of a few of their neighborsneighbors whose refusal to accept change delays the progress of all among these tillery farmers president king shared openshirted comfort conversations between him and the farmers were handled in an offhand manner that bespoke camaraderie king is the director of the tillery center and the local representative of the american missionary association but aside from the prestige of this post he was present at the outing as the most respected person of the community his affability influence and apparently endless knowledge have helped these farmers grow the president of franklinton and tillery is continuously thinking in terms of progress for the negroes in his area he is dedicated to a more effective franklinton both of these concerns have been helped because king has had the courage among other things to hold interracial meetings on his groundsmeetings in which effective communication between negro and white has been initiated franklinton center is dedicated to the service of more than churches of the united church fellowship in north carolina and virginia and to the service of the church universal its work with farmers of the area makes it a practical laboratory with tangible results for the involvement of churches in problems of town and country adjustment it is a living demonstration of the effective application of religion and of religious institutions to the problems of everyday living the influence of franklinton is extensive from time to time farm experts from other areas come in to observe visiting when i was there was dr shaker hammad of the agricultural faculty of the university of alexandria egypt despite its present influence it is apparent that financial limitations inhibit the program how can the center implement its desire to take voter education into the various communities how can young people do research when there is an inadequate library and no set of encyclopedias how can the very poor of the area be helped with clothing problems when few gifts of usable clothing are shipped to the center how can there even be the certainty that franklinton will aave water when the deepwell pump is years old and wheeling about feet deep the well has never run dry and there have been many times when neighboring farmers have had to come to franklinton for water when their wells ran dry the original rosenwald schoolhouse needs repair and hospitality hall could use a new roof an adequate dining room will cost yet as i drove past the college of another denomination a short distance from franklinton i knew wry humor franklintons need for a dining hall is urgent but at the neighboring school bricklayers were erecting a decorative serpentine fencestrictly a luxury itemfor which a benefactor had donated franklinton offers every possible opportunity for meaningful fellowship president king says in this growth toward white and negro fellowship in christ the breaking of legal restraints the removing of personal and social impediments and all the other activities which breach the walls of partition are but necessary preliminary steps and as noble as all these things are the church cannot afford to be satisfied with them nothing less than full fellowship in the body of christ can be our goal what s an american my name is blanchette french you r would assume an unusual t start article perhaps lets continue the fun my mothers name was maloney oh you now thinkfrench and irish too well so what allow me to quote a few lines from louis e lomaxs tomorrows leaders that appeared in the emancipation proclamation centennial edition of ebony magazine in september negroes are terribly confused these days are we africans negroes americans if so which and what do we seek what do we really mean by integration if such a question confuses you does it not follow that i should also be confused am i frenchirish or american i have never delved too deeply into the background of my ancestors but it is possible there is a bit of indian in me toomy gosh what do we have here french irish indian and yet american my confusion you would think must be enormousit isntbecause i know that despite all this ancestral mumbojumbo i am an american we all of us who are americans french irish russian german greek negro hungarian japanesehad our origins founded for us on what are now foreign soils you the negro have as much connection with africa as i with france or ireland the words negro or caucasian do not have too much meaning except where they are useful to certain branches of science interested in the study of man and ancient historyto determine which of our many nationalities lived in a specific place at a specific time and to learn what it is possible to learn of their culture actually you should be proud to be known as an american negro at least you know where you stand we caucasians are in an awful messwith the blood of every nation in the world flowing through our veinswe cant afford to think we simply know we are americans thats all just as you too are americans and there is nothing we can do or should want to do about that i do not particularly care to be called a caucasian not that it is really importantit is just that i am made to feel as a museum piece under the probing eye of a visiting anthropologist for modern use among average men the words negro and caucasian are merely helpful at timesto know if you refer to a man with a light or dark skin we are a common people living together in a common land with educational opportunities steadily improving for negro youth and chances of employment increasing for the adult it will not be long before we are truly united in work and societygeared to the task of making the united states a better place to live for us all the sooner our dispute is wholly solved the sooner we will be able to help settle the more intrinsic problems of unemployment medical aid to the needyand those problems of international proportions there is no such thing as separate but equal we need youyour brains courage determination strength and wisdom there is no real difference between usdont allow the diehard segregationists to fool you the one superficial difference coloronly causes me to envy you you look healthier than i as if youd been out absorbing more fresh air and sunshine actually your war is already won a few more battles perhaps occupational troops for a time and then complete integration and unification in conclusion i provide a quotation so well known it is unnecessary to identify united we standdivided we fall breakers ahead as the wheel turns life becomes progressively more complex and meaningful survival national and personal seems more and more like one long gantlet betweet scylla and charybdis at least this is true for many people tension and anxiety are so much a part of our daily lives that we accept them as normal conditions of existence yet their toll in the disintegration of personality and related problems must be very high indeed recently i heard a woman express her gratification at being able to get through it was an awful year she said so many problems so many tragedies was indeed a fateful year for americans and for most of the people of the world for us it was a year burdened with the kind of events which illustrate the corporate personality of a whole people divulge their national character and reveal their strengths and weaknesses there is no need to catalogue the burden of events with which the year just past was invested for they were of a sort that involved almost every american personally or at least vicariously take the mine disaster in pennsylvania for examplea tragedy which reminded us so poignantly that a mans life is not his alope it belongs at least in part to his family and his friends and even to the larger society even among the most lowly and the most deprived life is a value with which men are loathe to part no matter how poor they are no matter what they do for a living no matter how utterly wretched their existence men want to live for themselves and for those they love and cherish men want to live because tomorrow the reversal may come tomorrow the weight of the centuries may be lifted from their shoulders and some new atlas may be chosen by the fates to bear the burdens of the world for a time and society of course has a stake in the preservation of individual lives although we sometimes behave as if the contrary were true there was the tragedy of unemployment in harlem and west virginia the viet nam incident in far off indochina the murder of the innocents in birmingham all america watched the pageant of the great march of protest on the capital city of the united states there was the dallas incidenta brutal tale in which a man marked for greatness and an uncontested place in history was shot down like a common thief in the most fantastic tragicomedy of modern times while a brave heroic woman showed the world that the dignity of courage need not be subsumed by grief looking back januslike we must concede that was a year of hatred and violence of murder and fear and invective but interstitially it was also a year of heroism and courage and hope few were sorry to see the old year close all of us are apprehensive about the portents of one aspect of the heritage of the american people has been an individualism which has produced on the one hand a rugged independence and a hallowed determination to avoid interference with whatever is not of primary personal concern to the individual because we have until fairly recent times enjoyed a certain isolation from the rest of the world that has functioned to insulate us from most of the worlds problems the occasion for personal involvement in the personal struggles of people elsewhere in the world has not been forcefully presented because america is itself a giant country with plenty of space and elbow room for all we have not been required to take notice of our neighbors this same philosophy of laissez faire has operated at home to produce for most of us an obliviousness of the problems and accomplishments of any outside the primary groups to which we belong as a consequence we have maintained our own privacy and permitted a like privacy to others at the expense of an appalling ignorance of the very factors which threaten the values we cherish so much while the most influential americans have commuted to the suburbs with averted eyes poverty and disease hatred and hostility have filled the vacuums they never permitted themselves to see furthermore because we have so frequently abdicated responsibility to irresponsible people we have as frequently reaped a harvest of incredibly bad government the primary intent of which is to maintain the status quo ie the ignorance and impotence of the responsible in order that the selfaggrandizement of the irresponsible may proceed unhampered the irony of it all is that the most inept rulers always rule in the name of the people while the people themselves are modestly silent and far above it all it is time for the responsible men of this country to take an intelligent appraisal of what is happening in america for if we do not it is inevitable that our most important values will be lost by default ours is a society experiencing the most rapid rate of change in its fundamental values of any society anywhere at any time in history some of this change is good some of it needs to be evaluated some of it is disfunctional to our national purpose and to our survival as a free and independent society our principal danger lies in the fact that in the turbulence of the social flux some changes are imperceptible and go undetected until they are accomplished facts another danger is that in learning to live with modern technology we have become so acclimated to change as to accept it at face value in most areas of our lives we have accepted the dictum that you cant turn back the clock as if all change were progress and as if we have nothing to say about what changes we shall have and what changes we shall avoid we behave as if the world were a huge mechanism already wound and rolling when we got on and we are powerless to deflect it from its course of aimlessness and guide it in the direction of more creative realities it is probably true that none of us can stop the world and get off but each of us can play a decisive part in determining where it is going is going to be a crucial year in the fate of the world and the people of the united states if we are to be participants in the drama of our lives rather than mere objects to be manipulated and shoved here and there by the patterns of events then we must concern ourselves seriously about some of the issues which are before us as individuals citizens and sustainers of the national purpose which embodies the american self image i do not intend to attempt an exhaustive analysis of what is wrong with america nor is such a critique indicated but perhaps it may still be profitable to talk about some of the problems with which we are certain to be confronted they are not problems which we can solve as individuals but in thinking about them and talking about them we help to create a climate more nearly conducive to a realistic expression of the will of the people the category of possibilities is broad but i have selected four areas which i believe will illustrate the gravity of conditions now playing an important part in the shaping of our lives and the circumstances under which we live technology philosophers have argued that the only persistent thing in life the only thing that does not change is change itself the world is forever in the process of change people change institutions change patterns of behavior change so there is nothing very new in the idea of change or the experience of it what is new to contemporary americans and to most of the rest of the world is the rate of changethe speed with which familiar institutions accepted ideas and hardened patterns of behavior are passing out of existence to be replaced by new and unfamiliar entities history becomes increasingly irrelevant as a guide for solving the problems we must face today and tomorrow for example what can we learn from napoleon or clausewitz or pershing or even eisenhower and macarthur about the war we seem to feel we have to fight tomorrow or the day after history used to teach that war was a political instrument that wars could be fought and won peace restored and existing international arrangements altered to the profit and glory of the victor how archaic is this lesson in what can we learn from the political presuppositions of the th century or even of the thirties and forties of the present century we can learn something to be sure from the fundamentals but the specifics of twenty years ago have receded into the realm of the irrelevant today the destiny of america is irrevocably linked to the destiny of every nation in the world because the people of india and a thousand other unnamed communities of asia and africa and south america are dying of hunger we are uneasy with our swollen granaries and rotting potatoes because the people in the congo or in viet nam or in the negev desert or on the island of cypress want to fight each other our farflung armies and probing naval units are restless colonialism and racial oppression in south africa and angola makes us anxious and concerned we are not an island unto ourselves for better or for worse for as long as we can tell and as far as we can see into the future we are indissolubly linked to the mainland of human historyto all nations all races all religions their accomplishments are our own their problems of survival are our problems of survivalclearly even now and even more decisively in the future this is the era of the machine this is the era in which we find ourselves confronted with two infinitiesthe infinity of space and the infinity of nuclear war the chief instrument by which we propose to probe both of these infinities is the machine hence technology has come to bear upon our lives in so many ways and with such force as to give it preeminence among the problems with which responsible americans will have to deal in and the succeeding years if any of all of the scientists who ever lived are living today and they are creating for us a world which threatens to exceed our present political moral and economic capacities i do not believe with the determinists that technology is a force with a life of its own directing the destinies of its creators men do not have to go where technology directs them they do not have to do whatever technology suggests that it is possible to do the imperatives of technology can be resisted but are they it is common knowledge that technology has long since taken over the arms race we build bigger and better bombs for no other reason than that it is technologically possible to do so for years we have had a decisive overkill capacity today we have times the nuclear might needed to annihilate completely any potential aggressor in any quarter of the world it is not for political advantage or national security that we continue to install bigger and more fearsome weapon systems it is because an escalating technology tells us it is possible to do but technology says nothing about the moral implications of our weapon systems or what we plan to do with them we are in danger of becoming prisoners of the very machines we have created to insure our freedom and survivalor at least to be certain that no one else is free or survives in fail safe that disturbing novel dealing with our automated defense system and the possibility of accidental war the authors describe our helplessness to prevent an unprovoked nuclear attack against a potential enemy once a signal has been fed into the machinery by the most unlikely accidentor by technological miscalculation in his book kill and overkill ralph lapp tells about a recent accident in which an american bomber dropped a thermonuclear device on north carolina the device had six foolproof safety locks on it to prevent accidental detonation according to the strategic air command none of these six safety locks could possibly be triggered by accident when the device was examined after being hurled to the earth five of the foolproof safety switches had been triggered but the problem of thermonuclear technology does not confine itself to accidental war it is a problem that searches out our fundamental values technology is a tool an instrument under proper control and direction its function is to serve man not to dominate him it is a means the search for the one best way in the pursuit of efficiency we are in danger of making technology an end in itselfthe prime value of american life along with the blessings of increased efficiency technology has also given us scandalous surpluses of foods mountainous scrapheaps of obsolete machinery and an everincreasing population of unemployed and unemployable men and women we shall have to concern ourselves with the problems of technology and quickly while there is yet time we need human engineering to cope with the increasing problems created by our technologists at a time when we are in need of all the brains we can get we may yet find it expedient to welcome back the socalled eggheads we have so perfunctorily dismissed from time to time economics a second problem is that of our economic order it is in part related to the problem of technology as i have indicated we now have the capacity to produce all of the goods and services needed by americans but not all americans have what they need of what we can produce one fifth of all americans live at or below the level of poverty there are areas in this country which are quite as undeveloped as any in asia or africa the need and the poverty the abject misery saddling the slums of affluent america tell a familiar tale of the inequities of the distribution of wealth in this democratic society fifty million americans do not have enough to eat they are in addition undereducated underemployed and confined to the ghetto if we do not move to rectify these conditions we must inevitably reap the consequences in crime and delinquency the lowering of health standards wasted manpower hostility and social revolution einstein previewed our economic predicament shortly before his death when he declared that the individual has become more conscious than ever of his dependence on society but he views this dependence not as a positive asset nor as a protective force but rather as a threat to his natural rights and to his economic existence we shall have to come to terms with the probability that millions of todays unemployed will never again enjoy sustained employment it is not a question of whether or not they want to work these are human rejects the victims of the technological revolution now in progress we are more fortunate than some countries w h ferry writing in a recent issue of cross currents says that in india for example as many as million indians are unemployed if mr nehrus third five year plan succeeds ferry writes it will produce another million jobs but an additional million people will by then be waiting for them the problem of an escalating technology is not so acute in america yet but we will have a population of million six years from now and the percentage of the permanently unemployed will go up rather than down many americans can be retrained to take their places in the new automated society but many are too old and many do not have the basic education prerequisite to retraining for gainful employment in the space age but these americans have a right to continue to live and with dignity we have a corresponding duty to share with them the benefits of the wondrous technology which has wrested from them the emancipating dignity of work they are the victims of the historical flux if this most advanced of all societies has kept them uneducated unskilled and unemployable for whatever reason or if it has not in times past provided realistic incentives for their development and improvement then ultimately this society must share with them the profits accruing to the birthright of full citizenship they have had no chance to enjoy in a world where people are starving for food no less than for the simple recognition of their humanity and in a society where the imbalance of wealth between those who have and those who suffer from not having is extreme the rationale for such a system becomes less discernible and traditional attitudes about the sacredness and the inviolability of the capitalistic enterprise suffer the gravest erosion the welfare state is not a reasonable alternative for the welfare state destroys the soul while trying to salvage what is left of the body yet a sharply increased sense of responsibilitysocial responsibility which looking beyond the profit motive can see the people brought to distress through instrumentalities they neither recognize nor understand is imperative we may no longer shut out the uncomfortable realities of hunger and crime and destitution by the simple device of averting the eyes or closing the mind for they obtrude into consciousness with a persistence that accepts no further delay international peace the experts list at least five kinds of accidents which could plunge the united states into nuclear war any hour of any day first a miscalculations or misinterpretation of an act by either the united states or russia both the russians and we have tripwire forces set to unlease retaliatory missiles before an attack is experienced if it appears that the other side has mounted an attack secondly the accidental detonation of a nuclear device such as almost happened in north carolina is automatically detected by monitoring devices on both sides but there is no way to tell whether the device was set off accidentally if we think it was not an accident we may attack if the russians think we think it was not an accident they may attack in order to get in the first strike if we think the russians think that we think it was not an accident we may attack so as to strike first and so it goes thirdly we could go to war unintentionally over a military incident that got out of hand such as the holdup of one of our convoys on the autobahn into west germany or the escalation of a local situation like viet nam or cuba or even panama fourth the madman theory of accidental war is viable while the key personnel controlling our weapons systems are carefully screened even the most stable men have been known to break under the tensions associated with such dreadful responsibilities suppose lee harvey oswald had been flying one of the nucleararmed patrol bombers we keep constantly in the sky near the borders of russia or skipper of one of the many polarisbearing submarines we have probing the oceans of the world a fifth type of accidental war may result from technological causes the failure of a machine to correctly assess a given situation and make the right response these are ways in which war may come by accident they do not take into consideration the constant presence of political frictions which could produce war by design all things considered we walk constantly on the edge of the abyss there is no moment of our lives in which we have a reasonable assurance that it will be succeeded by another the anxieties concomitant to such a state of continuing tension and uncertainty is robbing our lives of depth and meaning as we come to accept the inevitability of destruction we generate a value system consistent with this fact of existence while we wish to live in peace psychologically we are perpetually involved in war and we tend to live and express our lives as if life itself were vanity a monstrous joke perpetrated upon a people doomed to die we need a respite from the tension and anxieties of war our psychological orientation needs to be for peace fortunately the era of the big two standing eyeball to eyeball with pushbuttons in hand seems to be declining general u thant secretary of the united nations believes that there are certain unmistakable trends toward new alignments in the world setup there have been fluctuations and vicissitudes in the fortunes of the big powers he says my feeling is that in the seventies if there are seventies the world will witness four big powers the united states of america europe russia and china such a happenstance will signal the decline of russia and the united states to a position among equalsa rebalancing of power which if it does not make peace altogether impossible will at least obviate the standoff between the russians and ourselves our respective peoples the russians and americans deserve a respite from the neurosisproducing anxieties that have so long characterized our relationship as the military sponsors of east versus west our president has made it clear to the soviets that we have no wish to bury anybody and that we ourselves do not intend to be buried perhaps now in we can get on with the matter of disengagement internal peace the most crucial and sensitive problem confronting us today is internal peace the internal peace of this country is predicated upon our ability to reasonably control the violent rightwing extremism which is mushrooming in many of our towns and cities and to equitably resolve the racial issue which threatens to become universal throughout the fifty states at points these two social diseases come together in one foul malignancy but for the most part they represent separate infections which we shall have to fight and fight hard the rightwing extremists like the ku klux klan the white citizens councils the john birch society the socalled christian crusades and others of their ilk are all of a piece led by a handful of sinister expreachers sick retired generals befuddled candymakers and discredited politicians and followed for the most part by weakminded men frustrated housewives and little old ladies in tennis shoes their techniques are slanderous and undemocratic their stockintrade is hatred and suspicion the ends they pursue are diabolical and their danger to america is incalculable they are the kind of people who did the screaming and clawing and cursing at little rock and new orleans who were serpentine enough to dare to spit on a man like adlai stevenson in dallas and who created the climate of hatred and lawlessness that made the assassination of our president a routine expectation the racial situation in this country is not encouraging while some breakthroughs are registered here and there the fundamental patterns of this racist society have changed but little during there were protest demonstrations in the south alone demonstrators were arrested there were thirtyfive bombings and ten people died under circumstances relating to racial protest the savagery we saw in birmingham was a distressing illustration of the bestial hatred characterizing the opposition to social change change is inevitable hatred or no hatred blood or no blood nowhere in the world are intelligent men and women willing any longer to accept subjection to anybody on the flimsy and irrational premise that skin color makes some people better than others the very idea is preposterous and the people who believe it are either ignorant sick or both it is past time for an enlightened america to discard these antiquatedegotistical undemocratic patterns of thinking and get on with the business of making the full range of the common values of citizenship available to all our people in the minds of twenty million determined negro americans discrimination is dead they have sought in every peaceful and reasonable way to communicate this idea to the bigots who keep the country in turmoil by setting themselves up as the racial arbiters of the public conscience but only concerned americans can make america truly democratic and only responsible americans can bring justice and order to this unjust and disordered society let america make haste it is considerably later than we think it has been said that the condition of the american negro is todays bitterest joke about freedom and justice well negroes stopped laughing a long time ago or hasnt anybody noticed monday will be better miss banks was a faj twit miliar sight five morn y ings a week to those living in the older section of town reflecting grand old houses with magnificent lawns sitting snobbishly back from the streets parents could set their clocks and hurry slowmoving children by the time they saw the little gray haired woman walking briskly to the lakewood high school three blocks away during the early spring and fall miss banks always wore a white sweater thrown over her shoulders no matter how warm the weather while carrying a bulging briefcase like a symbol guardedly by her side when the weather became cold and undeterminable miss banks would get out the old black ford of questionable age and drive slowly and too carefully down the streets hunched stiffly over the wheel in her somber black coat and shapeless hat this september morning if there had been those hurrying children or attuning their morning chores to miss banks passing they would have noticed she was ten minutes late and that her usual friendly face was set in a thoughtful mold looking neither right nor left to greet and return a warm smile for the first time in twenty years on the first day of school miss banks had a headache for one long week the ache had persisted in a dull monotonous form causing her to go mechanically through the normal routines of domesticity but on several occasions she had forgotten to feed the cat now as she moved along the streets the tense nervous feeling that had distressed her increased as she neared the school and saw them small groups of people milling around the sidewalk curiously watching the front entrance to the school the women some with metal curlers still entwined in their hair stood with small sleepyeyed children hanging to their cotton housedresses the men were separated into mengroups arms folded khaki baseball caps pulled low over stony leather faces a photographer was busy taking pictures stopping long enough to interrogate the figures standing like a small weaponless army the town police car was parked conspicuously along the street and to miss banks the one sign of normalcy was the orange school bus gliding to a stop when she appeared many turned recognized her as one who had taught them and now their children but they did not speak parts of their mutterings broke against her like muted clipped thunder the niggers come yet its a shame they got schools of their own why want to go to ours why indeed miss banks thought as she purposefully quickened her steps trying to avoid the multitude of gazes she knew or felt were following her no questions please she had no answersonly to her this was the most frightening and confusing time in her life never had she believed something like this would happen to affect her the town and the occupation which she had enjoyed all these years the morningclear and bright loomed large and ominous before her a witchs jeweled stone in her path at this moment she wished she was descending instead of climbing the steps to the sprawling brick schoolthe pride of the town when she entered the familiar odors of chalk sawdust cooking foods and pungent scents that were there last year and would be there years after she had gone assailed her she hurried down the hall to her room miss vladosk of courre was a tall blonde nicelooking girl who taught civics and algebra and had just been there one year goodmorning miss banks paused to smile at the young woman ohyoure late miss vladosk said looking curiously at miss banks to see whether some strange malady had caused this unusual occurrence theyre already in she went on in a whisper gesturing a little excitedly behind her dr robinson thought because of the crowd they should come in the side door now miss banks saw the colored girl sitting alone at the desk this meant the boy assigned her homeroom class was waiting toothere in her room ive been talking to her she heard miss vladosk go on her fathers a minister she seems to be a bright girla little shybut thats understandable yesof course miss banks felt a foreign dampness mist her forehead she extracted a kleenex from her purse dabbing lightly at the moistness its so warm for september the first day of school and i guess im not ready to be back in harness perhaps its time for an old tired woman like me to retire she smiled a tiny smile i think ill get a glass of water would you watch my room until i get back the teachers lounge was thankfully empty and quickly she poured a glass of water from the refrigerator this she halfdrank ending by dumping the contents down the sink a bell sounded pealing shrilly in the room the first bell she had to get back she couldnt delay any longer he was seated directly in front of her desk he was large for his age and the ninth grade seat looked built for a lilliputian he was quite dark and his features swollen stiff black hair closely molded his head like a cap he wore a yellow sport shirt carefully creased brown slacks and polished shoes that looked new the hands gripping the notebook were large and strong looking the lined veins showing a tautness against the skin he reminded her of a painting she had seen of an african prince hanging in the museum she went back to her desk closed her purse in the drawer and did not look at him but at the memo from the principals office about books and supplies then she took out the paper to read the list of names belonging to her homeroom class given at fridays preschool teachers meeting you are james p johnson jr she asked still not looking at him yes maam his voice too was strong and thankfully before anymore could be or had to be said the second bell sounded like a cloudburst familiar students surged in a noisy stream through the halls and into the classroom ohhh look what we got smoky the bear chocolate drop miss banks heard them the muffled whispers which were not muffled at all experience told her she should say something pleasetone your voices down they came in filling up all the seats behind james p johnson until the last ones had to slump noisily in front behind and lastly beside him the third bell sounded school had taken in somehow she managed to get through the morning but each time she looked up there he was a big black splotch marring her view to her it was a little indecent this fly surrounded by milk she tried looking over him to the side of him but neither worked he was still there and then it occurred to her that she could do what she had always done with the masses of them by looking directly at him she found this worked best for then she did not see him at all at lunchtime she went to the cafeteria the colored were already there noticeably seated at a table by themselves four boys and three girls neatly dressed faces shining eating quietly carefully as if they had been cautioned to eat like that james p johnson joined them and now there were eight a representative group arent they miss vladosk sid sliding the tray beside miss banks i hear they were carefully screened by that negro organization miss banks tasted the soup which to her had the same flavor all these years mondayssoup meat loaf peas and milk but she had tea she brought her own bags and they had the hot water ready for her when she passed through the negro organization think im going to enjoy this new experience miss vladosk said smiling i can learn from them and they from meperhaps learn from them what was there to learn from them miss banks thought wasnt that why they were here to learn from us suddenly there was a loud crash a tray had been dropped one of the colored girls bolted upright dress soaked with the hot soup there was a split deathly silence then riotous confusion peppered with the clanging noises of silverware and laughter splayed with boisterous catcalls miss vladosk was there before anyone it was the girl in her room the ministers daughter quickly she handed the girl napkins talking quietly to her as she did while she scanned without seeming to each face closest by miss banks watched her lead the girl out of the room the others at the one distinctive table continued to eat faces expressionless vaguely trying to disconnect the moment she wondered if they liked what they were eating later miss vladosk came to her door and the two of them stood outside talking in low tones we managed to get most of the soup off her dress miss vladosk said shaking her head enough for her to stay the remainder of the day dr robinson was adamant about that an accident miss banks murmured someones careless loud giggles from her room caused miss banks to stop and turn her students looked serene busily writing their assignment all but james p johnson who was looking slowly about him carefully searching each bent face his mouth was bruised in a straight line and his huge body showed signs of harsh rapid breathing an ugly blue stain trickled down and splotched the middle of his broad back inking the yellow shirt in an ugly zigzagging blotch bob miss vladosk whispered i saw that bob waller bob waller popular captain of the football team and son of layton waller president of the board miss banks squeezed her hands together nervously why after all these years did she have to be thrown into something like this the whole idea was ridiculous to begin with you cant make people like what they dont want to like ive got to get back miss vladosk said miss banks sighed with unrestrained relief with miss vladosk gone she did not have to wring and twist with questions and possible threats she could simply ignore it as something she had not seen but she could not ignore james p johnsons face a mixture of bewilderment pain and anger if he were white he would have turned red with fury only he wasnt white he was black how can you tell if a black boy is angry when he cant turn red tuesday and the classes were the same little mounting incidents a sprawled leg a name dropped pushing deliberate avoidance the days following were alike until a month was over october came and the headache still persisted she found herself sleeping less at night forgetting to put the cat out moving around her house like a somnambulist the family doctor had given her some pills to quiet her nerves but even these she forgot to take finally with resigned defeat she decided to ask dr robinson to transfer her to another school the next semester it would hurt to leave lakewood where she knew everyone felt a part even of the pale green walls in her room leaving the students whom she followed with a maternal interest through life but why dr robinson asked seated behind the large desk in his office he was a thin slight man with penetrating blue eyes behind rimless glasses i need a change she said sitting tensely in the straight back chair pushing the mountainous papers and books aside he leaned intently towards her a changea change he murmured questioningly you know this is unusual miss banks you have been with us for years he paused keen eyes focusing steadily on her then softly is it because of the colored student she felt a flushness stealing over and warming her face in this period of transition were all experiencing the pains of adjustment but things never stay as they are and it is up to us educatorsmore than anybody to see that the change is steered carefully through intelligent guidance you arent the only one having difficulties the other teachers are going through what you are miss banks but they are accepting it as a challengenot as something to fear or run away from hewellhe rather frightens me she said looking away frightens youhow i dont know i cant explain her small white hands flailed the air like fluttering wings hes got two eyes two arms and two legs like everybody else hasnt he the wings fell and folded in her lap distilled lightly together she saw where the day was crisscrossed by the venetian blinds and thought barred like his mind he didnt understand he wasnt born and raised in this town like she had been her parents and parents before had helped to shape and build and make real the things the young ones and newcomers were now enjoyingthe library museum community house he didnt know or sense about the town and the people and the way it had always been tell me miss banks do you know anything about negroes what an odd question of course she knew about negroes who doesnt they lived in this town didnt they they lived across the tracks and she saw them downtown on the streets and working in the stores cleaning the floors and washing windows you must remember miss banks i was born only fifteen miles away from this town my town is similar to this town he said gently but nothing growing stays the same no nothing stays the same except the blacknessa gauntlet the albatross around the white mans neck as her father used to say i want you to please reconsider your request think through your problem many of the difficulties you and the other teachers are encountering can be smoothed out with patience and understanding he stood up smiling down at her please dont hesitate to come in to talk anytime after school like youth deputized miss banks thought wryly miss vladosk stopped by her room how are you making out the older woman looked up from the pile of papers she was preparing to take home all right well miss vladosk began briskly after that soup business i gave all my civics classes a damned goodif i say so myselflecture on citizenship then to top that i assigned them a research paper to write on the subject an excellent idea why hadnt she thought of that tomorrow in her american history classes she would skip to the chapter on the united states a melting pot of nations it would be a start but by the next morning she decided they should finish the unit on the rise of political parties instead that afternoon as she listened to the students in her english section recite she thought i must call on him sometime hes been here two months and i havent called on him for a single recitation the time abruptly presented itself when unexpectedly his hand raised to finish the first verse from thoreaus poem love no other hand indicated the answer was known and because of that there was nothing else for her to do but say james p johnson she was astonished by how easily the name came out the class was unusually quiet a movement unheard a breath unknown in anticipation of a wrong answer amazement or surprise that he could even speak she did not know he stood up tall and stalwart as a black warrior slowly he began to recite in a rich sonorous tone let such pure hate still underprop our love that we may be each others conscience and have our sympathy from thence she was not surprised that he was correct his papers were neat and accurate handed in on time more so than the others who had hundreds of social excuses when he finished she said quietly thank you looking down as she did she knew his gaze had not left her face always the eyes were like hot black beacon lights since the bizarre ink incident they seemed to haunt her deliberately focusing never wavering never shifting once when she felt them an uncontrollable urge to look up assailed her and when she did she glimpsed the hurt and confusion shining out novemberthe erratic football month to miss banksthe time when the school was in a fever to win the most important game of the season the homecoming game held on thanksgiving day the boys would practice all hours homeroom periods study periods after school and between classes she added quippishly if they could soldiers training for the great battle but this she was now resigned amending it by concluding extracurricular activities are too a part the month of november did bring cheer to miss banks this was the time when the class collected cans of food to make up holiday baskets for the needy and sick each class donated a basket to a family on a list which only the teacher knew the list was comprised mostly of colored and miss vladosk called it a time when guilty whites assuaged their consciences she scanned the sheet given her by the principal ordinarily she would simply check the next name on the list and send it on but when her eyes ran hurriedly down the page she recognized it immediately james p johnson sr pine street no house number simply pine street she knew the address from her registration book fantastic almost ordained this would be where the basket went a silent gift from the class for the first time in a long while she bebegan to feel enthusiastic about something she would see that the basket would be a very nice one onean ample one fit for a negro family unexpectedly she felt the urge to smile at james p johnson but when she looked up he wasnt there then she remembered friday afternoon he practiced for something or other the last hour of school ohyes football he too was engrossed in the battle of brawn she wished him here to see her smile lightened by her plans the burden did not seem so heavy now miss banks the class had been dismissed for the day james p johnson stood over her desk a black mass looking intently down at her my report card yesyes she said impatiently having just given them out i got two cs in both my classes under youamerican history and english so carefully she closed her books and neatly stacked papers in her briefcase what about it ive been making as and bs on my papers the other courses i got all as and bs your grades kept me off the honor roll anger flushed through her how dare him him she fumbled with the zipper to her bag keeping her eyes down james the word was so quiet and controlled that at first she wondered if she had spoken it at all you have been doing nicely however classroom recitation counts and when she did look up he was gone there was nothing where he had been and all she could think was he moves very quickly very silently for one so large as the days moved one into another miss banks found herself be comine more excited about the basket the collecting of cans almost became an obsession with her each day she reminded the class and like a miser she watched with a deadly concern the daily accumulation each student who brought in a donation received a free ticket to the schools friday movie by thursday when she gave the list a final check there were only two names left not contributing james p johnson and bob waller that bob so forgetful he could afford to bring in a hundred cans that afternoon just as school was dismissed bob waller came to her desk the room was noisy with students wrapped like happy eskimos bounding for the cold blustering day miss banks i almost forgot he said plunking two large cans on her desk these are james and mine a tiny chattering group leaving the room turned for a quick moment as one looking at them james yes mam you know how he leaves before anybody else he left it in his desk guess he forgot to give it to you she stared at the cans both peaches expensive brands and alike i see thank you bob slowly she scratched out their names bob waller and james p johnson as the days wore on there was a difference in the room she could sense itthere was a difference they went through their routines recited handed in assignments conducted homeroom activities but there was something present not there before in their stiff overpoliteness attentiveness and not meeting of eyes and there was a difference with james p johnson more of the boys were talking to him now eating lunch with him being goodnaturedly friendly absently she turned away from the class and gazed out the window the day was bright and sunny but the air was cold and peculiarly she felt a little let down the annual thanksgiving day football game set the tones for the holiday season there was an ebullient expectancy in the air filling it with gaiety she told miss vladosk she would try to attend the game but to her of the most importance was getting the basket to the johnsons this one she intended to deliver herself instead of asking one of the men teachers early that morning she halfdragged and halfcarried the heavy basket to her car propping it in the trunk she drove slowly through town and across the tracks to where the colored lived only when she reached there she found herself getting lost in the tangled maze of dusty roads before she finally discovered pine street which looked exactly like dunbar avenue and jackie robinson boulevard sighing in desperation she pulled the car over to the curb and stopped a woman in a shabby black coat shuffled down the street slightly lopsided from the filled brown greasy bag she carried miss banks leaned cautiously over to the passengers side and called where do the johnsons live frowning the woman eased the bag to the pavement as if relieved that this one instant would excusably give her a rest johnsons which johnsons theres william johnsons a little ways down the street and the thomas johnsons over the james p johnsons ohthem johnsons bout a block down little white house direcly on the corner thank you the house wasnt too different from the others except the shutters had been painted recently and a sears stormdoor added she parked the car and got out to open the trunk grunting with effort she lifted the basket with both hands careful not to brush it against her tweed coat and started up the walk setting the burden down she rang the doorbell after an interminable time and no answer she knocked loudly thinking the bell was out of order the door finally opened and a woman asked yes quickly miss banks dragged the groceries past the woman into the house there she breathed looking up now to smile the woman was tall and dark and towered over her like a sharp angular peak there was no doubt this was james mother the same thick features only the lines were stronger and the dark eyes watching her were like depthless pools im miss banks james teach er the womans eyes did not waver nor did she seem to breathe she was like an impassive statue compressed in brown mud when she did not speak miss banks continued hurriedly breaking the pronounced silence are you his mother yes well miss banks suddenly felt out of breath either from carrying the basket or the moment her gaze quickly scanned the room giving her time to free herself from the unbearable tension the living room served too as a dining room with an old horsehair sofa covered with a clean bedspread to preserve or hide it two overstuffed chairs and a round table ladened with james p johnsons school books she remembered the basket rushingly she explained but the more she talked a heavy curtain veiled the womans eyes like a babbling brook suddenly run dry miss banks stopped realizing she had said all she could until there was no more the room was soundlessthe basket strong between them the woman did not look at the basket only her then she spoke quietly hurriedly in a husky slurred tone my sons tolt me bout you miss banks oh and we dont need no basket not need the basket why how ridiculous the houseeven though it was neat and clean spoke of need but your name was on the list the woman drew herself up in a proud thoughtful line fo months my husbands been out of work they put us on welfare hes a good workera meckanic fo fifteen years he worked at browns garage not missin a day goin at seven and gettin off all hours maybe six eight nine but he liked his job it was a good job then my son signed to go to the white school and my husband was laid off the next day mr brown got hisself a white boy miss banks wanted to say im sorry but she couldnt a constriction tightened her throat so she could not say even that my husband finally got another jobin milltownten miles way he works in a factry leaves early comes home late ands tired i takes in washin and ironin and im tired but our son wanted to go to that school he wants to be a kemist there aint no kemistry taught in our school when night comes and we tired we look at our son at that there table with his books and we aint tired no mo miss banks looked at the faded blue wall paper the books piled neatly on the table and back at the woman when she spoke her voice did not sound like hers at all wherewhere is james dont you know slowly she shook her head no she started to say should i no you wouldnt he tolt me how you look at him as if hes dirt how you said nothin when the ink was spilt on his shirt that it took me twodayswash to buy please her eyes searched the womans face pleading you must understand its hard for us toome how you think its been fo us miss banks the power of the woman overcame her she felt helplessweak unable to form the words which needed forming and there was still the question of the basket then suddenly the door swung open accompanied by bellowing whoops bob waller and three other boys she recognized came in carrying james p johnson like a king high on their shoulders he had to bend his head to keep from touching the door sill mrs johnsonwe won bob called triumphantly it was tied and james broke the tie by scoring a touchdown altogether now fellows another yelled hiphiphooray james was eased to the floor like a giant piece of precious china miss banks was surprised to see how white and even his teeth were in the brown smiling face ohmiss banks his face changed to surprise when he saw her then to a blank mask she spoke to him and the others who smiled and kept talking animatedly about the game their whiteness contrasting vividly against the backdrop of james p johnson im mighty proud of my son miss banks when his daddie gets home hell be proud too now james you help miss banks carry that there basket to her car miss banks saw him look down at the basket seeing it for the first time recognizing knowing he looked at his mother and the moment was long and deep and silent you can take it now james his mother said moving her eyes over and above them he lifted the basket avoiding the faces of the boys circling him walking stiffly to the door outside miss banks locked the trunk and turned on him im glad we won james you must be a very good player i didnt do it all miss banks were a team she wanted to say more but there was nothing more to say she reached out and touched his hand it was warm and brown and firm ill see you monday yes mam hey james a boy called impatiently from the house com she drove off watching him in the mirror still standing there in the fast deepening twilight a motionless scarred figure and she knew monday would be better by j noel heermance in richard wright y just back from a fling with communism cio turned his attention once more t o the american scene and produced his powerful novel of social protest native son polished and poignant native son immediately became an archetype of literate negro expression in this country and the social protest novel seemed forever wedded to the expression of negro experience risking oversimplification at this point i think it fair to say that the part which the negro subsequently played in two international wars his tremendous migration into the more politically and economically sensitive cities and the succeeding supreme court decisions all tended to emancipate him from the burden of proving his legal and emotional rights to exist as an american in this country the protest genre still continued of course but now a greater scope came into the novel the novelist now began to examine himself as a man and an american as well as a negro and relatedly he began to examine america itself from a more assured and detached pointed of view and not from the emotional position of achingly desiring membership in it and finally he began to feel so much a part of itand so free to critically examine itthat he began to make major suggestions as to how to change the american society as a wholeand for its own betterment overlooking such negro novelists as frank yerby and john henry clarkemen who have either sought to renounce their negro identity by escaping into the purgatory of writing popular pseudohistorical romances or who have sought to transfer their search for identity to the foreign shores of th or th century africawe will concern ourselves here with the two major figures of contemporary negro fiction in america ralph ellison and james baldwin ralph ellison born in oklahoma city in has written only one novel yet invisible man published in and winner of the national book award for fiction of that year remains so exceptional a novel in its own rightand so monumental a breakthrough in subject matter and expression for the negro novelthat it alone has assured mr ellisons inclusion in the chronology of negro prose fiction invisible man then is a bildungsroman the search for both personal identity and social place by a young unnamed narrator at the same time because it is written by this narrator from a later perspective the novel features both removed exposition and involved narrative developing from this complex structure then we find a negro novel that achieves a new and exciting stature yet in order to see what is so new here perhaps we ought first look at what approaches the old traditionally the negro protest novel concerned itself with defending the negro from the stereotypes held by the white man and then with attacking the white man for this and any other sins or hypocri sies the writer could lay his hands on understandably enough invisible man does not wholly neglect this motif thus there is early in the novel one scene quite reminiscent of this naturalistic protest in it we learn of one jim trueblood a negro dirt farmer who has been guilty of incest with his eldest daughter the sin itself is treated environmentally the nights were cold husband wife and daughter all had to sleep together for warmth trueblood found himself in the midst of a racial dream in which a white man of the town symbolically says they just nigguhs leave em do it and the sin is committed why the daughter slept between husband and wife is never explained nor is it even examined and this i think is significant for it shows that this kind of environmental naturalism is not of great interest to ellison guilt and fault are not at issue here what concerns him more is how the fact of sin affects husband and wife family and negro community family and white community almost immediately we learn the results trueblood has been slugged in the head by an axe the angry extension of his wifes angry arm he understands and accepts this because it is the result of a personal involvement in the fact by his wife at the same time he does not understand the other two reactions principally because they do not represent any recognition of him as a distinct person thus on the one hand the negroes of the town reject him completely and offer to pay his way out of the area for good to them he is merely a disgusting embodiment of the immoral and stereotyped past whose stigma they labor day by day to wash off on the other hand it is the white community which comes to truebloods aid and though their actions are more humanitarian their motives are certainly baser for whites have a morbid curiosity about sex mr ellison seems to imply and it is to hear trueblood describe his sin in all its concreteness that the townspeople offer him jobs and the white state university sends recording interviewers in this world then only the axe at the end of his wifes arm is understandable to the common negro however what is of importance in invisible man is not only how irony rather than pathos plays through this naturalistic scene nor even how that irony is aimed at black and white alike but rather it is important to note the scarcity of such whiteoppressor negrovictim scenes for what is more fundamentally new in invisible man is a certain ironic detachment from the whole naturalistic question altogether and the substitution instead of a concern with white american society on its own terms and in a speaking voice favored by its own white critics such a newly ironic and detached position allows ellison to talk lightlyif pointedlyabout a grotesque widemouthed nigger piggybank with an enormous grin and large black outstretched hand as a piece of early americana just as it allows him to go a little deeper with this tone and quote an insane middle class negro who when laughed at by his fellow inmates for trying to change blood into money retorts i did too i discovered it and john d rockefeller stole the formula from me further ellisons removed position of criticism permits him to dispose of wit altogether and with poignant sympathy quote an old foreman in a modern paint factory as he attempts to cling to an individual pride in the face of automation by asserting that we are the machines inside the machine but perhaps the best example of this new negro interest in american societyand this new position for discussing itis the southern small town night club scene of chapter one where the narrator is a boy of perhaps holden caulfields age led into the main ballroom he suddenly finds himself in the presence of a tall blond white woman dancing naked before the lustfully transfixed townfathers what the young narrator sees then is almost exactly what his salinger counterpart would have seen he notes a certain merchant who followed her hungrily his lips loose and drooling and each time the blonde swayed her undulating hips he ran his hand through the thin hair of his head and with his arms upheld like an intoxicated panda wound his belly in a slow and obscene grind this fascination is rampant among the local businessmen and the scene closes with a wild chase of the woman which ends with her being tossed around as college boys at a hazing it was mad the narrator tells us yet beyond this above the womans red fixedsmiling lips the narrator can see the terror and disgust in her eyes almost like my own terror and that which i saw in some of the other boys it is then a scene of general degradation handled in the mixed tones of disgust wit and compassion and this tone with its application to what becomes essentially a nonracial scene is reason enough for proclaiming invisible man a new novel at the same time it is equally true that ellisons most damaging examination of contemporary commercial america is not made in the vacuum setting of a private allwhite nightclub at all but is instead made in the morning sunlight of the market placeespecially the negro marketplace thus he notes in his wanderings how a whole truckload of defective paint is shipped to a government project with the full approval of the dispatching foreman and more poignantly he describes in antic detail the insane negro inmates of the golden day tavern noting that many of the men had been doctors lawyers teachers civil service workers who were supposed to be members of the professions toward which at variious times i vaguely aspired myself and he notes too the terribly mechanical way that a white philanthropist talks about helping the young narrator enter the american business world you are my fate young man your school that has been my lifes work not my banking or my researches but my firsthand organizing or human life you are important because if you fail i have failed by one individual one defective cog the white world then is essentially a mechanical cage which tries to fit the negro to its commercial ends should he seek to rise above his coglike stature here his world becomes the personal and social chaos of the golden day and its inmates however there are roles for the negro to play within the cage roles of adventure insight and subtlety that are open to him if he will only accept the fact of the cage and work within its confinements and it is the harsh and frank description of these roles which forms another first for invisible man there are in fact five roles open to the negro who recognizes and accepts the cage around him to begin with there is the passive dedicated hating as put forth by the narrators dying grandfather overcome em with yesses undermine em with grins agree em to death and destruction in short let em swaller you till they vomit or bust wide open equally violentthough much more boldly sois the life of the criminal which brings a certain power to a negros sense of identity thus looking at the office wall at his first job interview the narrator notes that the wall was hung with three portraits of dignified old gentlemen in winged collars who looked down from their frames with an assurance and arrogance that i had never seen in any except white men and a few bad razorscarred negroes a third role available to the enterprising and realistic negro is more expansive and spirited in its conception for it is not confined by a passive burning intensity nor is it recklessly defiant in its criminality it is simply amoral thus the ubiquitous rinehart in harlem isall at the same time and with no sense of conflictrine the calculating numbers runner rine the reckless gambler rine the briber rine the romantic lover of dozens and finally rine the reverend pastor of a holy way station which features a neon sign for its narthex and electric guitar for its choir for rinehart the world abounds with possibilities and he is equal to every one of them but perhaps the most devastating revelation of roles is the one portrayed by dr bledsoe the president of a small negro college calling the narrator into his office after the narrator has driven a white trustee to the trueblood shack dr bledsoe angrily asks for an explanation the narrator replies innocently enough that the trustee had ordered him to go ordered you he ordered you dammit white folks are always giving orders its a habit with them why didnt you make an excuse my god boy youre black and living in the southdid you forget how to lie lie sir lie to him lie to a trustee sir me he shook his head with a kind of anguish and me thinking id picked a boy with brain didnt you but i was only trying to please him please him and here you are a junior in college why the dumbest black bastard in the cotton patch knows that the only way to please a white man is to tell him a lie what kind of education are you getting around here who really told you to take him out there he did sir dont lie to me i swear sir no one told me nigger this isnt the time to lie im no white man tell me the truth these then are the four basic possibilities within the cage at the same time though the narrator and mr ellisonhave found a fifth that of descriptive novelist with a certain pride in his inherited past i am not ashamed of my grandparents for having been slaves he tells us i am only ashamed of myself for having at one time been ashamed a proud enjoyment of describing and utilizing the past then marks the texture and meaning of invisible man for ellison himself his own negro identity is as much the expression of the novel as it is the subject of it thus the rhythm and shout of the holy roller revival the rhetoric of the political demagogue the ca dence of the hucksters pitch these are the sounds which form the vital background and meaning of the novel and the negros fifth role the enjoyment of negro rhythm and the fun of its sound the honest identity to be found in folk tale and slang as when the narrator summarizes the meaning of his negro high school education by envisioning himself receiving a diploma that reads simply to whom it may concern keep this niggerboy running these are the fruits of ellisons acceptance of his past and the tools with which he can fashion a role in society to transcend and utilize the cage which otherwise binds him he is still an invisible man to be sure but he is now able like louis armstrong to make poetry out of being invisible in this marked a great new height for negro american fiction when we come to james baldwin now we come to a novelist who is an essayist also and this presents a problem for while this paper l primarily interested in discussion of the negro novel to overlook completely mr baldwins essays articles and interviews is to overlook the fact of his didactic and explanatory novelistic style for like the great majority of negro writers he is an author writing very much out of his experience with a mind intent on a message thus his essays and articles can be very pertinent comments on his novels let us briefly take his three novels in chronological order now to see just what experiences baldwin generally draws upon and what sort of message he elicits from them the difference between invisible man and baldwins first novel go tell it on the mountain is that the invisible man as narrator is constantly wandering among social and political forces in the negros life while johns search in go tell it is one within the personal family the biblical set thine house in order is both haunting echo and essential theme here for go tell it is the semiautobiographical story of a young boy growing up as a negro in harlem under a father who is bitter against the world for its tyrannies yet equally tyrannical within his own household in his struggle with the night and pain and suffering then john chooses personal religious answers rather than social or political ones he becomes converted to jesus not to ellisons brotherhood or the naacp the answer is religious because the problem is seen in such personal terms yet actually the basic problem is the social one of a negro in a white world as well as the personal one of father and son and the point is that baldwin is asking his negro characters to set their house in order before they go out to eradicate the larger social evils of the world it is further interesting to note here i think that baldwin levels the same personal charge at the white liberal in america when he notes in a may mademoisselle interview that they the liberals make no connection between what they do in nightclubs and what they say in print no connection between the ruin of their children and their public pronouncements clearly then this is a fundamental message for mr baldwin as both novelist and essayist just as the personal realm is the fundamental setting for his later two novels as well thus this same personal motif underlines and confines the movement and interests of his second novel giovannis room a story concerned with a uniqueto say the leastromantic triangle involving the choice between hetero and homo sexual love by an american expatriate in paris the point here is to notice just how personal and isolated this little drama is made by the novelist giovanni one side of the triangle is ostensibly a waiter yet we see him in the cafe only twice and neither time does his work impinge on his or ourconsciousness david is the american living on money from home and is so free of responsibilities and outside interests that when he finally decides to love giovanni he is able to sit in giovannis room all day and play housewife and finally hella the second side of the triangle is a traveling womanoff to spain on unknown funds like a hemingway heroine in order to decide if she loves david thus this is a very romantic left bank vacuum in which these characters cogitate and love in another country baldwins last novel to date we are similarly immersed in a small groupthis time of new yorkers and their search for love both hetero and homo in the free setting of greenwich village and we find ourselves once more dealing with an economical dramatic structure confined to three pairs of lovers it is like a large family really especially since the characters are all so much alike and spend so little time outside the loving home of the novels message thus we find again that the central characters in the novel are as noticeably unemployed and uninterested in the world around them as was the case in giovannis room we see the musician rufus far more in bed and at parties than we do on the bandstand likewise vivaldo is a writer whom we never see write and never even overhear think about writing he does have a typewriter we learn but that seems to be only a prop for him to sit behind and muse on intimate problems this same vacuum effect is equally true of all the other characters as well just as the fact that they all tend to think alike further serves to isolate the group as a whole a somewhat closer look at another country now is in order i think since it is a novel as strictly about love within a family as the first two novels but is one which also emphasizes an interracial element thus the critical dramatic question in the novel is seen in vivaldos question to eric hows one to get through it all how can you live if you cant love and how can you live if you do and the general answer comes when eric decides that he wished he could rescue her and make her life less hard but it was only love which could accomplish the miracle of making a life bearableonly love but more important than the general question and general answer here is that the specific answer to this question is ida a vivacious harlem girl whose final marriageofsorts to vivaldo provides the novel with its only happy union and saves vivaldo from the chaos as eric sees it of those lovers who are not needed by the ones whom they need yet salvation from personal chaos is not all that ida brings for she is also a social symbol as well as a personal character thus despite his general personal motif in the novel baldwin does give us an overall social message his thesis then briefly stated runs something like this american today is essentially a dying corrupted society hence the question for the negro is do i really want to be integrated into a burning house or as baldwin more pointedly puts it in his essay down at the cross i am far from convinced that being released from the african witch doctor was worth while if i am now expected to become dependent on the american psychiatrist thus the negroin the figure of idais now intellectually free of the dominance of the white american mind and its values the only thing white people have that black people need or should want baldwin says in the same essay is powerand no one holds power forever at the same time the negro is still an american physically by accident of history and emotionally as well he feels himself very much an american now because the laws of the land and the temper of the people are making him so hence baldwins tone in i accuse my country and my countrymen and also because he has within his past and present the warmth and stamina to supply the redeeming virtue for this american society personal christian love on the one hand this is a love which produces truth and which thereby takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within and on the other hand it is the compassion in the negro to wait while the white world is adjusting to this truth thus baldwin writes to his nephew in my dungeon shook please try to remember that what they believe as well as what they do and cause you to endure does not testify to your inferiority but to their inhumanity and fear there is no reason for you to try to become like white people and there is no basis whatever for their impertinent assumption that they must accept you the really terrible thing old buddy is that you must accept them and i mean that very seriously you must accept them and accept with love for these innocent people have no other hope they are in effect still trapped in a history which they do not understand and until they understand it they cannot be released from it this understanding of love then and the position from which it is offered to american society mark baldwins basic contributions to americanand negro american literature for if ellison emancipated the protesting negro novel by his honest expression of the possibilities within the cage and attempted as well to transcend the cage altogether by his tone of wit and compassionate scorn baldwin has completely turned the cage around and has pictured the white world as trapped within its past history and its present preconceptions thus the cage is on the other foot as it were and the negro is now on the outside looking in only he is looking in with a greater compassion and sensitivity that the white man ever looked in with thus not only is the negro emancipated from his cage but he has attained the even greater staturemoral and religiousof being the free man concerned about the horrible lostness of the prisoner at his most noble then the negro is americas compassionate saviour bringing love to a cold dying society and at his worst he is a caustic critic sarcastically visiting the sick and shut in this is a reversal indeedand marks the highest stage of freedom and assurance the modern negro novel has yet attained in volume of index to court cases of cal laway county on page for the october term is plaintiff the state of defendant celia a slave file no and in the closely written pages of file no there lies a story of violence passion and tragedy it is a story of aged lust of youthful ravishment of blighted birth of jealous betrayal of frenzied destruction of retribution delayed but when it came conclusive and of death on the gallows for a nineteen year old girl whose execution was postponed until after she gave birth to the child of the man whom she had slain and whose body she had caused to be consumed by fire the background of this tragic action was human slavery which had endured in this country for nearly two hundred and fifty years but which was in nearing its legal although not actual close as an institution it had long been under attack because of it unbearable tensions had developed and the nation would soon be cleft in twain in callaway county there were approximately negro slaves and free negroes as compared to a white population of some the fear of a negro insurrection while probably groundless was then a haunting everpresent fear and led to acts of cruelty and oppression which were unnatural and perverted this story properly begins with celia a negro slave girl who in was about fourteen years of age and who was living presumably with her slave parents in audrain county missouri at that time she was purchased by robert n a callaway county farmer who was then some seventy years of age and a grandfather he was a large landowner appears to have been welloff financially was of good standing in his community and was an active churchman with him lived his married daughter virginia w her husband and their two children and an unmarried daughter mary his wife had been deceased since july his two married sons lived in the neighborhood almost immediately after purchasing celia robert n apparently began to have carnal relations with her on this point colonel jefferson f jones testified at her trial in cant say positively whether celia said that deceased had forced her on the way home from audrain county have heard that he did but do not know with certainty whether she told me so regarding the relationship between master and slave in the years following the return to callaway county colonel jones continued she said the old man had sexual intercourse with her her second child was his celia lived with her children in a cabin about sixty steps from the home of her master some four hundred yards farther on was the family burying ground where negroes and whites were interred near together as was the general custom with celia from time to time and surreptitiously there also lived the young negro man george for whom celia evidently had a strong affection george bitterly resented the periodic intrusions of the white master on this point colonel jones testified she said that george had told her that he would have nothing more to do with her if she did not quit the old man this she evidently greatly wanted to do and finally didat the price of her life we come now to the day and to the night of june celia for some months had been pregnant and perhaps as a result of her pregnancy ill according to virginia w celia had been sick took sick in february had been sick ever since had been unable to work since february william powells testimony threw additional light on the relationship of celia and her master she said she threatened that she would hurt him if he did not quit forcing her while she was sick i do not know what her condition was as to health had heard she was sick do not know that she was pregnant judge from her appearance that she was she said she did not intend to kill him virginia w further testified i saw my father in the evening june about twilight reading at a window we all went to bed leaving him in the room he slept in the room he was reading in on the following morning robert n was missing from his home the search instituted by his family was joined by neighbors concerning it virginia w stated record pagewilliam powell further deposed after looking about him i asked his negro boy where he thought he was he stated that he did not believe it was worthwhile to hunt for him anywhere except close around the house for he had reasons to believe he was not far off from the statements of george i believed he had been destroyed in the negro cabin with this information by george the final destruction of celia was assured powell who appears to have been a vigorous crude callous sharpminded individual further testified a passionate plea for civil_rights it is true that prejudice exists in the minds and hearts of men it canej not be eradicated by aw but j firmy be y lieve a sense of fairness and good will also exists in the minds and hearts of men side by side with the prejudice a sense of fairness and good will which shows itself so often in acts of charity and kindness towards others this noble characteristic wants to come out it wants to and often does win out against the prejudice law expressing as it does the moral conscience of the community can help it come out in every person so in the end the prejudice will be dissolved this bill has deep moral implications for the individual and his society for this reason we have seen in recent months an unparalleled show of support for the bill by the religious leadership of america when religious leaders call on us to urge passage of this bill they are not mixing religion and politics this is not a political issue it is a moral issue to be resolved through political means religious leaders can preach they can advise they can lead movements of social action but there comes a point when persuasion must be backed up by law to be effective in the field of civil_rights that point has been reached mr president others have discussed the specific provisions of this bill with more skill than i possess the constitutionality of the bill has been affirmed by the most eminent lawyers in the land but there are some points in each of the major sections i would like to stress the purpose of title i the voting section is to accomplish the aims of the voting rights sections of the civil_rights bills of and had congress known then the weaknesses in those sections i believe these provisions would have been added at that time we learn by experience the civil_rights division of the department of justice under the outstanding leadership of burke marshall has labored for three years to do the job assigned it by the prior legislation its small squadron of attorneys have worked long and hard but every possible legal barrier has been thrown in its path to win after protracted litigation the right to vote in an election held a year ago is no victory the right to vote in federal elections must be enforceable at the time of the election to have any meaning the barriers to the right to vote were taken down in my state over years ago the difference between our social and economic groups have been settled peacefully at the ballot box the way they should be in a democracy it is argued that title vii can only make jobs for negroes by taking them away from whites the same accusation was thrown at the irish in massachusetts in the s the argument is groundless in america because it assumes a stagnant economy we have always had a dynamic jobcreating economy the new income spent by new job holders has created more demand and more jobs in a great upward movement of growth and prosperity mr president this is not a force bill there are no fines or criminal penalties on the contrary the bill abounds with reasonableness with conciliation with voluntary procedures with a moderate approach towards its goals the public accommodations section covers only those types of establishments where discrimination works the severest hardship even these types are exempt if they are small enough so that their integration would disturb the owner in his private life the voting section covers only federal elections it uses the procedures of the courts it creates not special privileges but only tries to prevent irreparable injury the education section creates no new rights the department of justice would be able to sue only to enforce what the constitution already requires the federal program section is equally moderate funds could only be denied to programs where discrimination is practiced other funds could not be affected the procedures under this section must conform to the standard of due process of notice and hearing of the administrative procedures act and the employment section is equally mild companies would have adequate time to comply with its requirements the fair employment commission has no sanctions of its own but must look to the courts for enforcement of its orders in short the bill emphasizes not new rights but remedies of existing rights not coercion but voluntary compliance not the heavy hand of the federal government but the evenhanded justice of the courts of law with provisions as mild as these it can truly be said that even in passing this bill we are still relying primarily on the decency and the tolerance and the conscience of the american people to secure these rights for negro citizens in conclusion mr president there are some personal reasons why i am so interested in passage of this bill as a young man i want to see an america where everyone can make his contribution where a man will be measured not by the color of his skin but by the content of his character as one who has a special concern with the emerging nations of africa and latin america i have seen what discrimination at home does to us in those countries i want to see america respected there and finally i remember the words of president johnson last november th no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor president kennedys memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil_rights bill for which he fought so long my brother was the first president of the united states to state publicly that segregation was morally wrong his heart and his soul are in this bill if his life and death had a meaning it was that we should not hate but love one another we should use our powers not to create conditions of oppression that lead to violence but conditions of freedom that lead to peace it is in that spirit that i hope the senate will pass this bill in the face of war and death there is a war going on now in the united states anyone who does not understand how this could be possible is more naive fortunately or unfortunately than one would think this century would permit recently in that war four negro children were blown to bits while they were learning to pray the leader of the jackson mississippi naacp himself a reluctant convert to the doctrines of nonviolence was assassinated in front of his home police dogs fire hoses blackjacks have been used on negroes to try to reinforce a simple and brutal social repression and all these terroristic tactics are used finally toward the same end to make young bucks and tottering school marms confess to the same lie the racks and maidens of the inquisition demandedthat there is something other than reality while a negro is under a hose or thrown against a building by some brute he is supporting that lie as well as the lie of his own inferiority the inferiority of the suppliant the readiness of the weak to repeat themselves to be no more than weak or no smarter than their torturers yet in spite of this and in the face of such brutality certain elements in america ask the negro to be nonviolent but who are these elements and what are they really asking on all levels the white man insists that there is no negro in america like the one that claims now to be here or at least there has been a constant and unfailing effort on the part of almost every white man in america and the colonial west to have his own qualified version of a black man exist and not just any black man who might like to appear under his own volition to the southern white and many northerners the sitins are liars the pickets and boycotters all are fiendish liars there is no such negro who would want anything but what weve always given them the white southerner says the negro who wants the foot off his neck must be inspired by communists it is a simple lie to say otherwise they say we know what negroes are what they want governor wallace on television admonishes his black housekeeper warmly yall take care of everything heah the old woman smiles and goes off to take care of his baby that is the negro that really exists for him no other the smiling convicts raking up leaves in his yard he waves as he crosses to his car more real negroes he is on his way to the university to make the fake negroes disappear the liberal white man insists also that there is no such thing as a negro except the thing he has invented they are simply underprivileged the havenots the emerging they are the same as we given an education a livelihood etc and this is the rhetoric but where did all these underprivileged people these havenots come from what for instance are all these black people doing in this country in the first place it is questions like these that the rhetoric is supposed to erase from the liberal white mans mind the fact that the negro was brought here as an african slave and labored some two hundred years in slavery is by now supposedly forgotten during slavery a liberal or a moderate was a man who didnt want the slaves beaten but he was not asking that they be freed certainly the negro middle class has forgotten or at least it is their job to pretend they have forgotten and for this reason even the low moan of blues from some unamerican tenement is almost as much of a social affront as a sign on a water fountain this is the missionaries legacy the last pure remnant of the slave mentality cultural shame what the liberal white man does is to open a door into the glittering mainstream of white american life as a possibility for the middle class black man all the negro need do is renounce his history as pure social error and strive with the rest of the strivers so that he too can help in erecting a monolithic syndrome of predictable social values based on the economic power and hegemony of the american western white man in order for the negro to achieve what i will call an equality of means that is at birth to be able to benefit by everything of value in the society of course the society would have to change almost completely what the liberal white man wants is to change the negro so he can be included in the existing system richard nixon is an example of what the liberal wants the negro to become a drab lower middle class buffoon who has no more political power or cultural significance than his social interment and petty ambition allows very few american white men want the system itself changed and that change complete or to occur with the rudeness of sudden reality abracadabra a family of twelve negroes is living in the next lot what shall we do the cry goes up from the kindest hearts it is the same kind of spurious and pragmatic realism that motivates most american reformers eg most of the socioeconomic policies of roosevelts new deal were not meant to change the society but to strengthen it as it existed roosevelt in this sense gave a flexibility to the american ruling class that it could not have survived without it is like a man who when fire breaks out in his apartment immediately builds a stove around it so far the most serious battles in the war i spoke of are being waged between two classes of white men although the negro middle class is the semiconscious pawn in these struggles the rest of the black population are pawns by default the battles have been waged are being waged now and for the last three hundred years between white men who think the negro is good for one thing and those who think he is good for another this same fight went on during the early days of slavery ie between those of a missionary mentality those who would give the slave christianity thereby excusing the instance of slavery as a moral crusade with concomittant economic advantages and those who felt that as animals the black men had no need for god since as animals they had no souls the fight continues today with the same emphasis except in earlier times the liberal forces the god carriers had only the house slave or occasional freedman to show off as end products of a benevolent christian ethic but now the kennedys and the rockefellers have a full fledged black bourgeoisie to gesture towards as an indication of what the social utopia of the west should look like so the war goes on from battle to battle but with essentially the same things at stake and for the same reasons the forces of naked repression on the one hand have always been out in the open what they want have wanted is common knowledge to negroes once negroes have gotten old enough to know that the world as they will come to know it is basically unfriendly if you are black each class has its own method of making that world unfriendly which makes the quarrel but nothing is really changed complete socioeconomic subjugation is the goal of both white forces what the liberal sees evil about this program is the way it is being carried out liberals want to be leaders moral guides rather than rulers the black middle class and its spiritual forbears the freedmen and house slaves have always fought to maintain some hegemony and privilege and as a privileged class within the american system as definited by the liberalmissionary class of american white man and because of this they have always had to be pawns and tokens in the white class war that constantly goes on trying to decide what to do with negroes the naacp sclc core and any other groups who advocate moral persuasion as their weapon of change reform have been members of the negro middle class or at least bound by that class social sentiments these organizations and others like them are controlled by the negro middle class and largely sponsored by white liberal monies all these people treat history as if it were autonomous and had nothing to do with the people or ideas old slavery for instance and its legacy contemporary social and economic slavery are looked at possibly as hideous accidents for which no one should be blamed the liberal mind is such that it is already trying to persuade us that no one was to blame for hitler or for that matter for joe mccarthy the times are to blame but the fact is that negroes in america are still either field slaves or house slaves the mode of oppression depending on the accident of social breeding one group having easy chairs in its cells the puppet uses to which the historic liberalmissionary syndrome have put the black middle class have grown more bizarre through the years simply because of the increasing dead weight of the black poor which this artificial middle class is supposed to exorcise but this weight if anything has gotten heavier and is felt by all the elements of this society the welfare state was the reformers answer it was and is like a rotten blimp attached to the sleek new airliner thirtyfive dollars a month and carfare to the welfare office is available to each poor negro who rides in this quasilighterthanair ship called ghetto each scream of agony that comes from the airship causes the black middle class who ride in a special airtight compartment of the airliner to ask for more zweibacks in their gleaming bowls so that now there must be a negro assistant press secretary a proposed negro chief of urban affairs a negro for housing etc all of which creates a tiny transistor like industry for the placing of negro tokens booker washington prepared the way for such utilization of negroes martin_luther_king as a recurrent social factor is the same man both men are simply public servants washington solidified the separate but equal lie when that lie was of value to the majority of intelligent white men kings lie is that there is a moral requirement to be met before entrance into the secular kingdom of plenty this is the reason washington said negroes had to labor in the wings in the first place to get ready for this entrance rev king who is formed very clearly and expertly from the same missionary fabric comes bearing the same message of goodwill that once this moral requirement is met by all negroes ie the poor and brutalized will immediately rise once they understand this then they might pass easily and joyously into that burning building which he insists on calling heaven even though gasoline is being spread on the blaze on all sides by every suffering man in the world the reward for piety and high moral concern then is to be a membership in gomorrah in this sense kings main function as was washingtons is as an agent of the middle class power structure black and white he has functioned in montgomery albany birmingham etc as has the negro middle class in general as a buffer a cajoler against action not sanctioned by white intelligence however innocently these functions might collect as moral imperatives in his own mind let it be our blood he has said repeatedly to negroes and his sincerity on this point is not to be questioned he is screaming out to the blimp with the loud speaker of recent agonies he is a much publicized leader of the oppressed but how many of the oppressed are convinced for every token offered in the general interest of keeping goodwill between the black middle class and the liberalmissionary power structure the gap between this invented bourgeoisie and the majority of black men in this country is widened the tokens are more and more bizarre have more and more supposed power and influence but at each instance the poor black man gets even statistically poorer and less accessible to utopian propaganda but the public servant function of the black middle class especially as indicated by the performance of its chiefs like king roy wilkins whitney young etc is one of communication and control that is they present the demands of the black middle class to the white ruling class and in exchange as payment for the meeting of some of these demands usually such social treachery as token integration which involves the creation of a lucrative civil_rights industry they relay that ruling class wishes to the great mass of negroes while making sure that none of this mass becomes autonomous enough to make demands of their own the various vigilante middle class groups like the first student sitins the more militant chapters of core and sncc began autonomously enough but very soon they came into the fold of the mainstream moral suasion groups of which king is the titular if not actual head the reduction of the student nonviolent coordinating committee to mere membership on the rolls of this main black middle class reform element was signified quite blatantly by the censorship of its chairmans john lewis speech at the march on washington ceremonies the montgomery bus boycotts and later disorders as well as the birmingham nearviolence before and after the bombings were all quickly mounted by king and brought to sanctimonious halts hours after the birmigham bombings king was already there moving through crowds of negroes bringing them the word before that when the negroes were marching in that same city king and the other leaders swore that the white men were willing to bargain if only the moral commitment could be made by black men absence of violence was the commitment these leaders asked have always asked and again it was given by lower middle class negroes and those strivers who had to be on the scene and if word got back to the leaders that the silent weight the poor blacks were uneasy at being left to rot in the same ghettos without the slightest hope or chance of their misery being eased except by making that symbolic leap into bourgeois commitment which is the local utopia and dwelt by such uneasiness upon the impossibility of such advice then king would walk among them praying seeking to involve the most oppressed people in this country in an ethic that only has value for the middle class power structure and even in those uses remains artificial except as it maintains local and national social evils with an admirable stability when this uneasiness would manifest itself as actuality or actual possibility then these bearers of the missionary legacy would quickly seek to turn whatever energy that existed into confusion and always shame let it be our blood king says to the poor making an evangelistic identification he trusts even backward white people will understand as leadership and when that cry of passive resistance is translated into common social activity it means very simply do as you have been doing and some white miracle will prove your suffering was accidental and finally worthwhile violence or nonviolence as actualities have never really been real categories rather their use is symbolic in discussing possible goals of any negro progress in this country and the white west negroes except for isolate ie limitedly organized and uncon nected incidents have never been anything else but nonviolent there have been race riots when the liberalizing elements of the white power structure have been briefly stalemated and the brainwashed lower and lowermiddle class whites have clashed with those economically similar groups of negroes in purely idealistic terms the real tragedy is that these two groups could not find goals that were mutually attainable in some kind of egalitarian revolution that would simply overthrow their mutual oppressors and resurrect a system that would be workable for men who could utilize all their energies within it such a revolution was possible at the end of the civil war marx did not study the racial situation in america closely enough nor its macrocosm which has been world wide since the white man realized as e franklin frazier says in his book race and culture contacts in the modern world the extension of control over the colored peoples of the world but the suspicions bred out of race ties and in some cases inculcated in lower class whites by upper class whites purely for their own economic advantage eg at the end of the civil war are much stronger than any purely political method of organization but for the most part there has been no violence from the black man american indians tried violently to defend their lands from white expansionism but the material superiority of western culture and the peculiar aggressiveness of humanist industrialism was of course much too powerful it is a humanist industrialism that has always longed for the twentieth century ie when man really was the measure and literally had his fate clutched quite tightly in his spastic hands a century where the only gods are immediately useful and grow angry only as their worshippers do the moral priggishness of the western white man which grows to insane proportion in america is displayed religiously in every part of the world he has exploited the ritual murders in the name of reason and progress go on every hour in every part of the globe how many nonwhite peoples have been killed in asia in africa in latin america just since in the name of some almost mystical need for a consistently accommodating order the free world is merely that part of the world in which the white man is free to do as he wants with the rest of the people there and he has ruled this way since the elizabethans when the white man says violence he means first of all violence to his system the possibility of outright war to change the political and economic categories of rule but this has to do with thought primarily rather than the actual utilization of arms by negroes to attain some arbitrary political and economic goals the middle class negros first word on the subject of violence as it is sheepishly and unintentionally given reference as a possibility in the real world is that we couldnt win anyway but the real idea expressed here is that the bourgeois black man does not believe he could benefit by a total withdrawal from white society which could be manifest by simple political rebellion and in this sense any attempt at such rebellion represents violence in the same sense the political overtones of the muslim movement represent this kind of violence against the liberal middle class missionary power structure ie as withdrawal and actual political rebellion this is why the intelligent white man and the middle class negro are so frightened of this group because certainly the only real terror in elijah muhammads program is the fact that even though it utilizes a fancied ethnic hegemony as its catalyst its goals and its version of us social history are quite practical as even a thinker like thomas jefferson has attested the slave when freed is to be removed beyond the reach of mixture but a political rebellion within the existing social structure is impossible any energy seen to exist within the superstructure of american society is almost immediately harnessed within acceptable motifs and shaped for use by the mainstream whether the results of this process are called swing music or core the intent is the same white music there is no way the black man can be heard or seen clearly in the existing system muslims would be rounded up and dropped in the grand canyon before any kind of territorial gift would be made absolutely no violence ie real social or political rebellion will be tolerated by the static center and for this reason this center assumes a flexibility which allows it to sweep from right to left without actually moving at all it merely gets stronger and essentially more intransigent we will risk our cities to defend berlin is one answer since negroes have hardly ever tried to mount any organized physical violence and any political violence to the system is by the nature of the black mans oppression almost impossible even though there are attempts from time to time eg the new all black freedom now party which by the very exclusivity of its form proposes a very practical dissent hence violence to the existing party system one might wonder just why it is so necessary for white liberals and the negro middle class to exhort negroes constantly to follow a path that willingly or not they have always followed it would seem if one examines the history of black men in the west and especially in the united states that they have most often been objects of violence rather than its perpetrators it would seem too that if there were any need to caution some group against violence and influence them toward a path of righteous passivity and moral indignation it would be the white man at this point who needed such persuasion as exiled exnaacp leader robert williams has said how much money has been expended to convert the racist brutes of the social jungle of the south to the ism of nonviolence and love how many nonviolent workshops are being conducted in ku klux klan dominated communities and racist strongholds of hate and violence against afroamericans nonviolence as a theory of social and political demeanor concerning american negroes means simply a continuation of the status quo as this theory is applied to define specific terms of personal conduct negroes are supposed to utilize it assumes again the nature of that mysterious moral commitment negro leaders say the black man must make to participate as a privileged class among the oppressed nonviolence on this personal moral level is the most sinister application of the western method of confusing and subjugating people by convincing these people that they the white west know what is best for them since the negro exists at a particular place in american society which has been constantly redefined by the warring elements in white society nonviolence and passive resistance are only the echoes of a contemporary redefinition of the negros place as seen by the most powerful of those elements ie the industrialliberal nee missionary element which since the civil war has held the upper hand in the overall power structure of the society but even couched in purely secular terms the emphasis on passive resistance and moral suasion is an undiluted leftover from the missionary era and its intentions are exactly the same only god has been replaced as he has all over the west with respectability and airconditioning the negro must have both before he is ready for equality is the way another answer goes to enter into the mainstream of american society the negro must lose all identity as a negro as a carrier of possible dissent he must even assume a common cultural liability and when the time comes for this white society to die he will be asked to die with it and for the same reasons that it will die but there is no indication that the poor have any such communal suicide in mind not that they have any theories or bodies of social reasoning to the contrary it is merely that in most parts of america the social system still hews to the intransigence of its beginnings and no real advance into that mainstream is really being offered the white liberals plan is still too academic to really work but then what will happen what will negroes do are there any alternatives all black political thrusts that is any that could issue from the actual needs of the masses of negroes are blocked either by the sham leadership of the middle class negro whose whole tradition is based on abandoning his poorer brothers or by the intransigence of those whites who are behind the times as any liberal spokesman will tell them an america made up strictly of such backward types of white men would survive only a few more years before internal disorder andor external pressures resulted in out and out racial wars asia africa latin america and black america vs the white west but the feigned flexibility of the center permits a toughness for the american way that will take some pushing to topple completely nonviolence is such a feigned flexibility it allows some gesture of social and political protest but offers no real alter native to the existing order but again what is the black mans alternative very simply either he must find some way to do political and social violence to the existing system even though he is hampered at every step by the black middle class and the white power structure or an actual physical violence will result when those four children were killed in the birmingham bombing the us steel plant in that city should have been shut down by negroes black workers should have walked out of every job they hold in the city a general strike should have been called an attempt should have been made to shut down completely the citys industrial resources that city should have died should have been killed by negroes at this writing the bombers have still not been found and attempts have been made toward finding an equitable position for negroes in that city if thats what was supposed to have happened all of this happened two or three weeks after the great march on washington and nothing else could have shown the moral sham involved in that lugubrious display as horribly as that bombing martin_luther_king arrived in birmingham hours after the bombing to quiet the crowds and give a quiet light of hope to the middle class but no real hope or stance is offered by black leaders in the face of such treachery what has been offered is talks in poolrooms with the th st toughs about the dignity of man to men whose dignity consists in their constant resistance to the yoke of cultural compromise white men call their place one young slick haired cat chalking his cue and looking straight into the television camera after that same bombing said theres a whole lotta people aint gonna stand for much more a this meaning i am not the presidents assistant press secretary nor the first negro to appear in a chemical com bank television commercial but nobodys gonna run over me because of it the point is i think that the poor black realizes at least instinctively that no matter what deal goes down ie no matter which side wins out the crackers or the government no help at all is being offered to him the desegregation of schools has been largely a lie the increase of employment among chronically unemployed negroes has also not happened the battle of housing is to see whether a negro who is able to buy a house can live in it there is no doubt that soon he might be able to but that means little to most negroes at this moment even the administrations long touted civil_rights bill is being systematically compromised by its supposed sponsors not that it was very strong to begin with a television commentator says it is a reasonable bill wish to god this man were black so he could get a good idea just how reasonable the bill is such a bill at its strongest is only a token and has no practical application at allin the united nations a few days ago only the united states great britain france and the white free world abstained from voting on a resolution to make illegal any organization that promotes race prejudice in latin america governments change hands monthly and no matter how repressive illegal and nonrepresentative a government might be as long as they play ball with the united states and are anticommunist we say nothing it is only in cuba that something is going on of which we disapprove but why in south vietnam and south korea the united states has supported the most brutal governments in the world part of the sugar quota is transferred to south africa we sign a new contract with franco and this is the society rev king wants to get the poor negro ready to enter better hell itself but partnership in gomorrah is the best thing offered by the white man to the negro in america today this is in essence what the promoters of nonviolence represent to the negro masses the march on washington for instance began as an idea of protest against the system but was quickly turned into a nightclub act and a moral victory for the middle classes with marines and plainclothesmen on the scene just to make sure the audience liked the show they were going to put on nonviolence then is not a protest at all in the context it has been promoted into in america it has to do with india too just as rev king thinks it does just what did nonviolence accomplish there the germans were our enemies and they are better off today than the great majority of indians plague and hunger still ravage india and for all the lies and rhetoric that issue from the west about that countrys independence and the political individuality of mr nehru india for all practical purposes is still a crown colony it is still very much exploited by great britain and the rest of the western world not only does nonviolence usually mean no action at all but it is not nor is it likely to be useful moral concept in the impossible social environment of america especially not in the american south one cannot draw analogies between american liberal proposals for negro nonviolence and the recent algerian quietism under the terror of the oas simply because the algerians were waiting for the french to clear out it was a simple case of resisting a greater malice knowing that the french troops would return if too many colons were killed in retribution for the many algerians who were killed during that period it was a qualified military tactical device which kept the french from marching back at the flank but the negros goal has never except in the late stages of slavery been as clearly delineated as was the algerians in that situation nonviolence in the american context means at its most honest evocation a proposed immersion into the mainstream of a bankrupt american culture and thats all and as i have said even that proposition is finally a fake no such immersion is even possible it is much too late a closer analogy is the fate of the european jews and more specifically the fate of german jews at the hands of adolf hitler the german jews at the time of hitlers rise to power were the most assimilated jews in europe they believed and with a great deal of emotional investment that they were germans the middle class german jew like the middle class american negro had actually moved in many instances into the mainstream of the german society and wanted to believe as that mainstream did even when the antijewish climate began to thicken and take on the heaviness of permanence many middle class jews believed that it was only the poor jews who would suffer in such a climate like these unfortunate jews the middle class negro has no real program of rebellion against the status quo in america quite frankly because he believes he is pretty well off the blatant cultural assassination the social and economic exploitation of most ne groes in this society does not really impress him the middle class negros goal like that of the rest of the american middle class is to be ignorant comfortably what other goals can the negro realize in america the out of date white man who is perhaps in one manner of speaking more honest is offering the negro nothing at all except what has always been offered the black man in white society he is saying that if the negro wants anything further than what the white man has always given him he is going to have to take it and this kind of white man will take steps immediately to see that such taking remainsas it has always remained in the context of an orderly american societyunheard of the liberal white man does not even offer the possibility of such taking his only goal for the negro is that the negro remain nonviolent in exchange for this nonviolence this liberal power structure will send an army into mississippi to see that its symbols are accepted by white and black alike but in essence this is all that this power structure offers and what it hopes negroes will continue to accept it offers negroes nothing further in their or in its lifetime nonviolence then is not being offered as a means to an end but as the end in itself the negros real problem remains to find some actual goal to work toward a complete equality of means is impossible in the present state of american society and even if it were possible the society is horrible enough without negroes swelling its ranks the only genuine way for the negro to achieve a personal automony it seems to me this equality of means would be as a truly active moralizing force within or against american society as it now stands in this sense i advocate a violence a literal destruction of the american sociopolitical stance not only as it directly concerns american negroes but in terms of its strangle hold on most of the modern world the negro must take an extreme stance he must attack the white mans system using his own chains to help beat that system into submission and actual change the black man is the only revolutionary force in american society today if only by default the supposed christian ideal of nonviolence is aimed at quieting even this most natural of insurrectionary elements as as actual moral category all rational men are essentially nonviolent except in defense of their lives to ask that the black man not even defend himself as robert williams tried to defend himself and the rest of the black community of monroe north carolina a few years ago before he was framed on a bogus kidnapping charge by local whites with the aid of the federal government is to ask that the black man stay quiet in his chains while the most liberal elements in this country saw away at those chains with makebelieve saws the negro again in this instance is asked to be what the white man makes of him not only does the white man oppress the negro but he even tells him how to react under this oppression but surely the most patiently christian man must realize that selfdefense in any situation is honest and natural it is also obligatory otherwise there is no use in asking for any right since the asker will probably not be around to benefit by its granting but if the most violent political and social protests are muffled and the exile of robert williams seems to me an example of such muffling the attempted jailing of newsman william worthy for trying to find out about china and cuba another and the moral bankruptcy of the black middle class continues to be used by the white ruling class as its cynical symbol of negro progress then it seems to me that quite soon an actual physical violence will break out for every lie that the liberal power structure tells itself the black bourgeoisie and the rest of the world about the majority of negroes in this country alienates that majority even more critically by not allowing a real grassroots protest issuing from the core of the oppressed black masses the american white man is forcing another kind of protest to take shape one that will shake this whole society at its foundations and succeed in changing it even if only into something worse soon for every sham gesture like the march on washington or the still impending deal king and the other black leaders made with white birmingham there might be twice that many acts of unorganized responsive violence how much longer does anyone in this country black or white think that the th st toughs ie the oppressed black man who has made no deals with the white power structure nor received any favors is going to run from policemen and dogs or stand by and watch while unknown assailants blow up their pitiful homes is it possible that the american white man knows so little about negroes from whatever level he does his observing that he thinks these negroes believe or have ever believed in the justice and morality of the white man left to their own devices the masses of negroes will finally strike back perhaps even kill in a vertiginous gesture of fear and despair their anger will not even matter since it has been a hopelessly familiar element in their emotional lives nonviolence can be your goal if you are already sitting in a comfortable house being brought the news of your oppression over television it can be the normal conduct of rational men if they can believe in the literalness and effectiveness of what they are trying to accomplish by such conduct but walk on any night from one end of th st to the other and count the hundreds of policemen then figure out the climate of rational conduct that is being cultivated by such an environment a legitimate negro protest movement unstalemated by the sham of tokenism and bourgeois intention might succeed in remaking this society and establishing an honest connection between it and the rest of the nonwhite world but most of the leaders of what passes as such protest the middle class negroes and white liberals who have access to courtrooms and picket lines have already sold their souls finally it would seem that for the mass of negroes such leadership as they need will come from within their own ranks bolstered by those young negroes from the middle class who themselves recognize the hopelessness of their social connections but this leadership is most likely to take solid form only in the most repressive and irrational of circumstances the most horrible vision i have is that the white man growing in terror of those suddenly ubiquitous acts of unorganized violence to which the most oppressed black men might resort will grow even more repressive and even the veneer of the liberal establishment will then be stripped away in much the same way that such veneer has been worn away in international affairs or in dealing with the possibility of actual domestic political dissent mail is being opened phones are being tapped the penalty for traveling to cuba is five years in prison and five thousand dollars fine they say where will such insanity lead and in such instances these unconnected acts of responsive violence would increase and perhaps even gradually find their connection the result of such chaos is anybodys guess guerrilla warfare concentration camps one of our congressmen has said recently that our only real ally in africa is south africa and the only foolproof way to completely stop negro protest especially as it grows more agitated by the lies and malice of most of america and agitated into actual bloodletting would be to follow the south african example or hitlers i hope this is a nightmare fantasy but there are very few white men in this country who are doing anything to prevent it the present emphasis on nonviolence rather than honest attempts at socioeconomic reconstruction will only speed the coming of such horror sokagakkai target american negroes from distant japan y p comes an ancient re ligion to win the spiritual support and allegiance of all americans but now with a special emphasis upon changing the religious orientation of the american negro this is the sokagakkai the twelve million member lay organization of nichiren shoshu buddhism the unique practices of nichiren shoshu buddhism are seven centuries old but its postworld war ii lay action organization seeks to make nichiren shoshu buddhism the religion of all humanity although dismissed at first as just another harmlessly bizarre oriental cult the sokagakkai has during recent months been the special target of the japanese and american press for its membership in japan alone numbers some twelve million while powerfully active beachheads have been established abroad outside japan centers have been established in southeast asia in korea taiwan thailand hong kong macao and in vietnam sokagakkai groups are active in the philippines and in australia the movement is firmly established in hawaii okinawa and the united states the sokagakkai is making rapid inroads into portuguesespeaking brazil sokagakkai headquarters have been established in paris france for the promulgation of nichiren shoshu buddhism throughout europe translation of sokagakkai literature into the major european languages has already begun earlier of course sokagakkai literature had been translated and published in the english language explanations of nichiren shoshu doctrines and practice are available now to everyone although but relatively recently established in the united states the sokagakkai has spread its tightly knit organization across the face of america but top leaders in tokyo have felt that an even greater participation of all elements in american life in the sokagakkai is badly needed knowing no color bars the sokagakkai now actively seeks the participation of the american negro in a crusade to change the religious character of the united states and of the world what exactly is this nichiren shoshu buddhism which the sokagakkai is so actively spreading this is a system of esoteric buddhist teachings promulgated by a japanese priest nichiren daishonin who felt that both japan and the buddhism of his day were corrupt and in need of drastic reformation nichiren shoshu buddhism teaches a system of atuning oneself to the basic power and fabric of the cosmos the threefold beginning is the twicedaily practice of the gonkyo ritual veneration of the gohonzon and the chanting of the mystic phrase nammyohorengekyo the gohonzon is a scroll enshrined by every sokagakkai member as a follower of nichiren shoshu buddhism the sokagakkai does not disparage formal and systematic study of its higher teachings but it feels that the gate to true enlightenment and understanding is first through practice contacts are told that the ultimate test of nichiren shoshu buddhism is a pragmatic one try it and see for yourself there is no teaching of a strictly personal god nor does salvation come from anywhere but ones own personal effort however there is a great sea of power within the cosmos which the individual using the techniques of nichiren shoshu can tap for his own betterment what does the sokagakkai seek for the individual personal happiness beginning here and now the sokagakkai teaches that strictly pieinthesky religion is based upon falsehood most of the evils of the world come sokagakkai leaders proclaim from religious faith which is divorced from reality the sokagakkai has been strongly criticized in japan and in the united states for its public and frequent declarations that nichiren shoshu buddhism occupies a position of unique religious truth yet this position of unique religious truth is not merely claimed by nichiren shoshu buddhism alone but by every other vital religion which has shown and is showing dynamic growth the sokagakkai has actually been accused of being militaristic hardly anything could be more untrue or more unfair first and foremost the sokagakkai refused to support many policies of the military clique which embarked japan upon world war ii sokagakkai leaders felt that these policies of the military government were morally and ethically wrong in july the sokagakkai was officially suppressed its top leaders were imprisoned on november tsunesaburo makiguchi one of the cofounders of the sokagakkai died of malnutrition in solitary confinement he died as martyr for his faith his humanitarian principles and for world peace immediately after the end of world war ii almost as american troops were landing as occupation forces the sokagakkai was reestablished to promulgate nichiren shoshu buddhism throughout japan southeast asia and the whole world where does the sokagakkai in the united states stand on negro civil_rights from the time of nichiren daishonin himself nichiren shoshu buddhism has held that human dignity cannot and must not be denied that which makes a man less than a full man goes sokagakkai teaching is evil and evil must be fought between the four seas and under heaven all men are brothers declare the ancient writings of the orient and the sokagakkai cannot see where this is any less true today than when it was written four thousand years ago the sokagakkai in the united states has its national headquarters in los angeles the international headquarters of the sokagakkai in tokyo publishes an englishlanguage weekly newspaper the seikyo news which is available from the los angeles headquarters at a subscription of cents per month the sokagakkai has been accused of being political but this is not true the former political section of the sokagakkai has been made an independent organization never at any time has the sokagakkai concerned itself with the political affairs of other nations nor does it intend to the sokagakkai is not antichristian but it places strong emphasis upon the nonchristian character of nichiren shoshu buddhism it feels that christianity belongs to the past for although being supposedly a religion of peace oceans of blood have been shed in its name too many consider that christianity hopelessly compromised itself by condoning slavery and the negro slave trade during the th century also the sokagakkai feels that such philosophies as marxism are fundamentally false for they are based upon a purely materialistic view of life man is neither a machine nor merely an accidental grouping of matter the sokagakkai rejects both materialism as represented by such philosophies as marxism and false supernaturalism and superstition it seeks the establishment of a third civilization upon the eternal foundation of nichiren shoshu buddhism this third civilization uniting all peoples and fusing the orient and the occident shall be altogether different from anything known in the past youngest federal judge there are those in philadelphia who say theres no telling where a leon higginbotham jr will wind up some see it as quite possible that he might be the first negro to wear the robes of a justice of the supreme court others merely observe that leon will be whatever he sets his mind to being time alone will tell of course but time is what the towering six feet five inches richvoiced jurist has in abundancetime and the ability to use it well at thirtysix higginbotham is united states district judge for the eastern district of pennsylvania the youngest man to sit on that bench in thirty years for more than a year before president kennedy nominated him last fall to the ayear post higginbotham was the first negro member of the federal trade commissionthe first negro ever to serve on any federal regulatory body and the youngest commissioner in history last year the us junior chamber of commerce named him one of the ten outstanding young men in america the same year he won the arthur s flemming award as one of the outstanding young men in the us government his professional and civic virtues have been recognized with enough plaques certificates and framed letters to fill a small hall of fame he hasnt had time to unwrap a few of them and they await unveiling on a shelf in the anteroom to his chambers at the us courthouse his childhood was far removed from the rarefied judicial world he was born in trenton only son of a factory worker who has spent fortythree years on the production line at a refrigerator company and is still there because he likes it higginbothams mother now retired was a domestic he went to public schools in trenton and got fairly high marks at trenton high he played tenor sax and clarinet in the school jazz orchestra summers he worked as a hotel bus boy factory laborer and shoe store porter in his spare time higginbotham frequented the ymca in trenton the ymca director was hilmer l jensen one of the most inspiring men i have ever known judge higginbotham recalled when i talked with him in his office recently this was a segregated y our best piece of equipment was a rickety ping pong tablebut mr jensen would talk to us of our future and our hopes and expose us to higher visions he made us feel somebody in the world cared about us higginbotham pushed on through high school went to purdue university to study electrical engineering while he was a freshman there he took the turn that led him eventually to the bench it began with a door slammed in his face as a member of the varsity debating team higginbotham had gone to evanston ill to take part in a debate with northwestern university when our team checked in the night before at a hotel in evanston the room clerk looked at me fidgeted slightly and murmured sorry we dont accept negroes here young higginbotham spent the night at a ymca but he didnt sleep much by morning he had made up his mind i decided i would become a lawyer i felt i would make a greater impact against such inequalities as a lawyer than as an engineer he transferred soon to antioch college seeking a liberal arts course tailored to his new goal his first day there was more eventful than he realized at the timehe met a sociology coed who ultimately became mrs higginbotham higginbotham started doing something about the fight for racial justice at antioch he headed the students chapter of the naacp later was a research associate for the american council on race relations in chicago working under robert c weaver who is now federal housing administrator in washington after antioch higginbotham entered yale law school before he graduated in he had won more honors in oral advocacy than any student in the schools history he came to philadelphia in got a job as a law clerk with judges curtis bok gerald a flood and louis levinthal mayor richardson dilworth appointed him an assistant district attorney and late that year higginbotham joined the law firm of norris green and harris my clients ran the gamut from murderers to the national baptist convention and the ame church he recalls his star as a leader in philadelphia civic and human relations work rose rapidly governor david l lawrence named him to the pennsylvania human relations commission in he was elected president of the philadel phia branch of the naacp over the protest of a faction led by cecil moore present head of the group who claimed members hadnt been given enough notice of the voting as president of the nations largest urban naacp chapter higginbotham proved a moderate who preferred the law courts to the streets as a battleground for equality says a minister who worked with him leon was never a rabblerouser he appeals to reason he prefers the force of logic and morality to demonstrations to this higginbotham agrees only in part it is every americans right to demonstratebut demonstrations must be lawful they shouldnt be held just to raise he hesitated havoc and he added demonstrations cannot be an end in themselves he took part in peaceful picketing of fiveandtencent stores in because these chains were discriminating against negroes in the south after the supreme court decision of outlawing school segregation higginbotham filed the first school case in pennsylvania using the supreme courts doctrine we filed suit against the lower gwynedd township school board for operating an allnegro school penllyn schoolin montgomery county we received an adverse decision by montgomery county court but the school board integrated the school system before we even filed an appeal he filed the segregation case against the philadelphia school system which is still pending while the school board has filed its own desegregation plan i asked him what he thought was the biggest single factor in the civil_rights battle there is no single solution to unequal rights except the granting of equal rights to all citizens he said progress is being made in this directioni think the negros cause has made greater advances since the kennedy era than in the hundred years before we are now in a process that is irreversible as i see it there is the need for a twopronged attack we must eliminate all of the barriers of actual discrimination that is essential but it is equally essential to stress to young people the change in environment that will permit firstclass opportunities that were not available to them a few years or even a few weeks before he pounded the arm of his chair for emphasis i wish i could make every young boy and girl see that they should prepare themselves on the assumption that the doors that are still closed to them will be open tomorrow but theyll be open only to those who are prepared if sidney poitier had assumed sixteen years ago that there would be no opportunity for him he would not have won the academy award that negro astronaut capt edward dwight jr would not have been appointed if he had dropped out of school years ago the point to me is that despite all deprivations we must stress preparation and i think the motivation should begin not in high school but in kindergarten that goes for white children too although the negro has an extra weight around his neck i mentioned the current chasm between the moderates and what are commonly referred to as the extremists among negro leaders i dont like the word extremist the judge said to many far too manythe fact that the negro dares to stand up and demand his constitutional rights is extremist in itself i agree there is a split between advocates of violence and nonviolence but i firmly believe that those leaders who urge nonviolent conduct will have substantial support of the negro masses he paused thoughtfully the major factor is whether the power structure will respond to their legitimate demands if employers refuse to promote qualified negroes if owners of public accommodations deny them serviceeach such instance causes a diminution of the nonviolent appeal by responsible leaders an implied lack of effectiveness in getting the problem solved so far he said at least ninety five per cent of negroes are behind such leaders as the rev martin_luther_king jr and naacp president roy wilkins most men regardless of their economic level recognize that they stand to gain most by a nonviolent kind of protest and by a respect for the rule of constitutional law he declared i wondered why communism has failed to lure more negroes the negro is realistic enough to know that he can eliminate his deprivation without substituting another form of tyranny despite various levels of education the negro has a high degree of political sophistication he wants racial equalityplus all the other components of democracy why settle for half a loaf i remarked that it was perhaps impossible for a white man to imagine himself in the negros shoes no one he said who hasnt himself experienced discrimination can appreciate it fully some time ago i took a camping trip with my wife and our two children we went to seattle wash and came back via the southern route we had to eat in the car because we wouldnt be served in eating places along the way i suppose some white persons would look upon this more philosophically today judge higginbotham frankly recognizes that his federal judgeship has curbed his role in the civil_rights battle in a narrow sense he cant engage in political and lobbying activities i am supposed to represent all the people he said but i have not retreated from my convictions one step i said that whites often accuse negroes of being prejudiced against them i consider all prejudice and discrimination wrong he said i think antiwhite hatred is as undemocratic as being antinegro but as a realistic matter the twenty million negroes have basically been the victims of one hundred seventy million white americans and some negro porter may be as prejudiced as a white bank president but the consequences are quite different the white bank president can make it a lot harder for the prejudiced negro than the prejudiced negro can make it for the bank president in court these days judge higginbotham maintains a rugged schedule he breezes into his office at am studies briefs confers with lawyers thumbs lawbooks after lunch at a nearby cafeteria he presides over court until sometimes stays in the office until pm takes work home he often greets his secretary mrs essie brock with a cheery hows your adrenalin supply today says mrs brock ive never seen him tired or droopy hes just on the go go go all the time once in desperation i said oh judge why dont you fire me he just laughed and said that would be the easy way outnothing doing the higginbotham family lives in a fiftyyearold house in germantown with six bedrooms three bathrooms and two powder rooms the judge likes to repair the plumbing paint the walls build furniture he likes to cook too and the results one admiring guest told me are out of this world judge higginbotham also tinkers with his trailer like to swim at a pool in yeadon and is a feared tennis player he keeps his towering frame in trim with vigorous basketball romps in his byfoot backyard with son stephen twelve and daughter karen nine i love space he says musing fondly on a trailer vacation trip the family took to nova scotia a couple of years ago marvelous the outdoorsthats real living but he added with a smile he enjoys his days in court too by joseph kennelley are not many nr y negroes in advertis jt k ing why this huge profession employs people in the united states and spends over billion a year growing larger every year it covers such fascinating fields as copywriting art personnel administration buying research marketing and merchandising in such varied businesses as direct mail television retailing mailorder radio public relations publicity outdoor advertising industrial advertising and publishing yet there are very few negroes working in advertising prejudices i personally have found very few signs of prejudices in advertising as a matter of fact ive seen many negroes considered for important advertising positions in the past few years yet turned down by prospective employers i was one of those prospective employers ive frequently talked to other advertising people particularly in the southern california area who have been forced to reject applications by negro job seekers we agreed generally on one point we turned down applicants for the simple reason that we were unable to accept a person totally unacquainted with some phase of advertising frankly though there was another reasona very important one let me cite two examples first my own about six months ago we decided to hire an assistant advertising manager to help us write and design direct mail brochures sales letters and catalogs as one of the largest mail order firms in america we turn out dozens of these advertising pieces every year my firm has not been averse to employing negroes right now of our employees per cent are negroes another per cent have been hired from the mexicanamerican community in los angeles one day the president of our firm suggested that i consider negro applicants in our search for an assistant advertising manager this applicant would if hired fill an important job full of exciting work and offering many opportunities ive been in the advertising profession years and as advertising manager of my firm i could have offered this man helpful guidance i might have steered him into a career that would have brought him high pay prestige and security but unfortunately i didnt have time to break in or trainfromthestart a young man simply because he possessed a burning desire to get into advertising having the desire was not enough i was on the lookout for an applicant who preferably had earned a degree in english or journalism actually though he need not have possessed a degree at all if he could have met one important requirement i contacted three employment agencies in los angeles and hollywood i phoned the los angeles office of the urban league which operates a placement bureau i ran a classified ad in the huge los angeles times there was a grand total of five negro applicants for the job the urban league sent over two young men one of the employment agencies known in advertising circles for its fair employment policy sent two aspirants my ad pulled one negro applicant to white applicants im sorry to say that not one of the negro applicantsalthough i found them all eager and intelligent could offer enough writing background either practical or collegeacquired to make me feel that i should hire him in the case of one applicant i blamed college training rather than the applicant for his inability to land the job this young man was years old showed a friendly personality had certain aptitudes but his writing samplesthose hed written in collegewere very bad so bad indeed that his spelling and punctuation needed about per cent improvement how he passed his college exams in journalism ill never know i really didnt blame himi just regretted that here likely was potential talent gone to waste i advised him to go back to night school and brush upno start overon his grammar and punctuation another case was similar a friend of mine whos been in the advertising agency business for over years recently interviewed two negro men he had an opening in his organization for a young man who could show some writing ability another job opening was that of a fashion artist along with several caucasian applicants he interviewed these two young menboth eager to get into advertising but neither of them had prepared himself properly when one of them was asked if he had read any books on advertisingbooks which he could have picked up at his local libraryhe replied why no how could reading a couple of books on advertising help me get a job in advertising i thought you were looking for somebody with writing experience very well but had this young hopeful written anythingperhaps a newspaper story or a short story or a poem or anythingsince graduating from college no had he enrolled in any writing classes in one of the adult education programs at his local school no had he studied some magazine and newspaper ads cutting out layouts and whole ads studying and analyzing the wordage he especially liked and which appealed to his tastes how were his writing samples the very few he could show to my friend were they good or mediocre today a man must sell himself to get a good job and by selling himself i dont mean displaying a golden gift of gab a smart applicant must display a real interest and be able to back up his reasons for wanting an advertising job by preparing himself for it this sells him having the ability to write well of course isnt the only channel by which you can enter advertising although it is one of the easiest many high salaried persons in advertising got there through art some got jobs through selling or retailing there are even some who entered advertising through the entertainment field others acquired advertising jobs through general office jobs such as finance personnel statistics etc but most of todays highest paid advertising executives reached the top of their ladder by starting from copywriting either by the printed word or by television or radio commercials yes some young fellow right now is earning a week turning out those singing commercials if youre interested in getting into this business do something about it why not enroll in a writing course write a short story or article or even devise a few singing commercials of your own but write one young lady i know used to copy ads in newspapers and magazines she would rearrange the sentences to suit herself sometimes arriving at a brand new idea in the copy before long she was creating her own new fresh ads it was invaluable training when you go on an interview have something tangible to show the person interviewing you let him see that youre not only interested in breaking into advertising but that youve also done something about it heres a field that the negro has hardly dented opportunities are plentiful pay is good the people in advertising are intelligent and friendly and theyll help you over the humps one warning though if you want to be able to take your place in advertising you must learn to write good english know the fundamentals of spelling grammar and punctuation you must learn how to express yourself by the written wordin fresh interesting sentences if you can meet these basic requirements youre going to find it much easier to break into this exciting rewarding profession the patient he was a short bantam cock of a man with deepset dark ey es and black hair and he seemed vaguely familiarlike someone i had seen once standing in a schoolhouse doorway somewhere i waved him to the couch and he stretched out on it with a nervous quickness i notice that you didnt give the receptionist your name when you made the appointment i started in my easiest couchside manner just mr x thats part of it thats part of the whole thing he snapped back spastically i dont remember my name i dont know who i am at all and thats your problem then i said presumptuously no no no he said quickly i told you that was just part of it the other is worse much worse all right shoot i said i realize thats pretty jazzy phraseology for a psychoanalyst but we headshrinkers have to live a little too my patient raised up on the couch and glanced nervously about him you sure there arent any of them here he asked nervously any of who here i inquired glancing around over my shoulders too you know any of them here he said confidentially theyre everywhere these days you know in the pentagon and the white house and the un and all the restrooms i still didnt know who he was talking about but i figured it stood to reason that if they were in the pentagon and the white house and the un sooner or later they would have to use the restrooms well i dont think there are any of them here i said because theres nobody in this room but you and i good good he said im glad to see you havent let them infiltrate your office i decided to use what is known technically in my profession as the imonyourside approach i certainly havent i said firmly you know thats my problem he said lying back down and seemingly starting to loosen up im beginning to think that im one of them too suppose you start at the beginning suggested in what i considered to be a very sound professional tone well you see ive been making all these speeches lately he said in wisconsin and indiana and maryland and all over and i was careful not to say anything against them not directly i just talked about how our individual liberties were being taken away from us by the federal government and that the issue was really one of states rights and that i had never in my life said anything personal against any of them i see i said with a few somber nods actually i had no idea what he was trying to tell me but if you ask a patient what the hell he is talking about somehow it kind of shatters the doctorpatient relationship he went on but even though i didnt say anything about them i began to notice them everywhere i went they were on street corners and riding the buses and driving the taxis and taking my luggage up to my hotel rooms and when i would ring for room service one of them would show up i would go to a movie and there one of them would be sitting right behind me and i was walking down a street one afternoon humming a song and before long i noticed one of them walking along beside me humming the same tune hmmm i said then it started he declared i mean it really started i would be talking to a large audience and at first i noticed a few of them out there then as time went on some nights it looked like the audience was all them and instead of cheering me they would be laughing at me and they would all follow me back to my hotel chanting and singing all happylike and poking me in the ribs and tapping me on the shoulder and inviting me to sing with them my my i said it was like they were slowly enveloping me swallowing me up then it began to happen what what i asked sitting on the edge of my chair slowly i began to get sensitive about my tan he said im from the south you know and the sun gets pretty bright down there well anyway pretty soon it seemed like my tan was getting darker and darker even though i started staying out of the sunlight as much as possible and once i scared the daylights out of myself when i woke up in the middle of the night and looked in the mirror and couldnt see anything but my eyes and my teeth i nearly had a coronary before i realized i had forgotten to turn on the lights goodness gracious i said doctor he went on solemnly ive begun to think im colored ahem i see i replied clearing my throat and this disturbs you you damn right it disturbs me he shot back bolting upright on the couch wouldnt it disturb you if you woke up all of a sudden and found out you were colored well i dont know i said look at it this way scientifically theres no difference in the races theres really only a visionary difference and perhaps a state of mind so what does it really matter if what does it matter he shouted man dont you realize whats happening to me i get on a bus and i go take a seat in the back i take off my hat whenever i speak to white ladies i never get in front of a white person in a line im worried about my kids having to go to a segregated school and getting a secondclass education doctor ive got a problem i sat quietly for a moment looking at him as he tried to regain his composure finally i said yes i guess you do have a problem but we cant solve it overnight this is going to take a little time can you come back same hour same day next week i couldnt possibly make it next week he said oh i said inquisitively next week i have to go to st augustine fla to sit in a

this world a negro novelist remembered sometimes gre are either not nized or are forgo by the commun where they spent t early life but not always garet mcmahan wrote a sunday feature on november for the fayetteville n c observer in which she said the first negro author in the united states to win lavish praise from literary critics was born of fayetteville parents and spent his boyhood and early manhood in fayetteville and north carolina he was one of the first north carolinians of either race to make a national name for himself in the field of letters the negro literary pioneer she was referring to was charles waddell chesnutt the subject of this article the negro woman chloe sampson and her daughter ann maria were leaving fayetteville the year was and they were fearful and full of insecurity they were free colored people but laws had been passed which took away their suffrage the nat turner insurrection had taken place and the southern whites were jittery concerning negroes the free negroes no longer enjoyed any more civil_rights than the slaves ann maria was a young woman with a brilliant mind she had a desire to be a teacher and had in fact been secretly teaching slave children to read and write she did this at great personal risk because in the decade before the civil war the teaching of slaves was forbidden ann maria could no longer tolerate her condition in the south she prevailed on her mother chloe to go north in they joined a little band of free colored people who were preparing to go north by wagon train they headed for cleveland ohio to join a colony of negroes who had gone there earlier in the group of pilgrims who were headed for cleveland was a young negro man named andrew jackson chesnutt he joined the wagon train but his destination was indiana where he hoped to live with his uncle a respected and wellknown citizen andrew jackson chesnutts father was a substantial farmer and drayman of fayetteville north carolina the elder chesnutt was a member of the cross creek school board he was one of five negroes who purchased jointly a lot where was later built the howard schooleventually to become the negro state normal school and later still to become fayetteville state teachers college ann maria sampson and andrew jackson chesnutt fell in love as the wagon train slowly prodded towards cleveland it was heartbreaking for both young people when andrew departed the wagon train and continued alone towards indiana chloe sampson purchased a little house on hudson street in cleveland andrews uncle was helping his bright young nephew get an education in indiana but andrew couldnt keep his mind on his studies for thoughts of ann maria that kept intervening one day in june andrew left indiana headed for cleveland on july ann maria sampson and andrew jackson chesnutt went down to the probate court and obtained a marriage license the following day they were married charles waddell chesnutt who was the first of thirteen children was bom in cleveland ohio on june the civil war started when charles was three years old andrew chesnutt joined the union army and served as a teamster at the wars end andrew found himself near fayetteville he went over to fayetteville to visit his father who had become old and feeble he found his father in such poor physical condition that he couldnt bear to leave him and return to cleveland andrew sent for ann maria and the children ann maria was reluctant to return to her place of birth because she enjoyed the freedom she had known in cleveland but being a dutiful wife she packed up and joined andrew in fayetteville andrews father set him up in business on gillespie street in fayetteville it proved to be a thriving grocery store young charles was enrolled in the howard school named for union general o o howard who did so much for negro education such as establishing howard university charles was a bright boy from the very start and earned a remarkable scholastic record george haigh was a leading citizen of fayetteville who ran a good bookstore he saw that charles had much intellectual ability and was enchanted by books haigh gave the boy the freedom of his store and encouraged him to read dr edward lilly a member of the fayetteville school board had the finest library in town he also recognized charles ability and gave the boy permission to make complete use of his library charles tried to aid his fathers store business by peddling needles pins thread buttons et cetra one of his students later said he would sit down and display his wares and while the customer made his selection chesnutt would become completely absorbed in any book within reach charles chesnutt was a precocious youth and he sold his first story a serial to a weekly newspaper when he was only fourteen years old even at this age he yearned to be a creative writer he wanted to express his feelings and thoughts in words that would be read by others chesnutts formal education did not extend beyond howard school which had the high school grades and some studies of the higher branches of learning but he had great intellectual curiosity and he was a voracious reader he devoured books by the bushel and acquired an excellent liberal education robert harris was charles teacher and principal at howard school harris was a spiritual man and charles greatly admired him harris had much influence on his young pupil robert harris brother cicero harris was the principal of a negro school in charlotte at age sixteen charles chesnutt was sent to charlotte to be an assistant to cicero harris young charles spent three years with cicero harris in charlotte sharing a room sharing teaching duties and eating their meals together charles was much taken with cicero harris as he had been with robert harris cicero had a great christian influence on his young colleague chesnutt spent the other two years between and teaching in other north carolina schools near fayetteville one of these years was spent teaching in a school ten miles from spartanburg south carolina during that summer he wrote in his journal i am in the woods again ten miles from spartanburg i came up here yesterday july afternoon i am in a large old frame house my room is upstairs it is spacious and tolerably pleasant the people are very anxious to please i begin to feel a little charlottesick and to wish i could see j if she were here i should be contented i wish i could write to her without her mothers reading the letters i would write nothing improper of course but i would pour out my heart i love the girl and i hope she loves me and will continue to do so here is a lock of her hair i kiss the lock of hair and press it to my bosom would it were she i wish i were about twentyfive years old and had about a thousand dollars or so and she were a few years older id marry her if shed have me and i think she would the lonesome young man had fallen in love with a young girl in charlotte charles wrote in his journal on march judge tourgee has sold the fools errand i understand for i suppose he had already received a large royalty on the sale of the first editions the work has gained an astonishing degree of popularity and is to be translated into the french now judge tourgees book is about the souththe manners customs modes of thoughts etc judge tourgee is a northern man who has lived in the south since the war until recently there is something romantic to the northern mind about the southern negro and there is a romantic side to the history of this people and if judge tourgee with his necessarily limited intercourse with colored people and his limited stay in the south can write such interesting descriptions why could not a colored man who has lived among people all his life why could not such a man if he possessed the same ability write a good book about the south as judge tourgee has written but the man is yet to make his appearance and if i cant be the man i shall be the first to rejoice at his debut and give god speed to his work on may charles wrote further on the subject in his journal i think i must write a book i am almost afraid to undertake a book so early and with so little experience in composition but it has been my cherished dream and i feel an influence that i cannot resist calling me to the task but young chesnutts book writing was to wait awhile in the fall of robert harris died the local board of managers of the state normal school at fayetteville insisted that chesnutt go to raleigh the state capital and apply for the position of principal of the school in november at age chesnutt started as principal of the normal school teacher training his salary was per month while serving as principal charles bought himself an organ and taught himself to play it he served as organist in the old historic evans metropolitan methodist church he also served as choir master and superintendent of the sunday school on june chesnutt had married susan perry the daughter of a welltodo and highly respected negro edwin perry proprietor of the barber shop in the fayetteville hotel on sunday mornings a familiar sight in fayetteville was chesnutt on his way to church with one of his babes in arms while serving as principal in fayetteville chesnutt met a white professor of german extraction chesnutt wanted to continue his learning on june he wrote in his journal professor neufeld has consented to give me instruction in french and german three lessons a weektuesdays and thursdays from to and saturdays in the morning i am happy to have this golden opportunity i pay mr neufeld per month and i should willingly pay if necessary he wrote further in his journal i do think that i shall ever forget my latin the labor i spend in trying to understand it thoroughly and the patience which i am compelled to exercise in clearing up the doubtful or difficult points furnish it seems to me as severe a course of mental discipline as a college course would afford i have now spent four months in the study of greek and according to my plans for the session i must now stop and devote my time to phonography and composition in preparation for a different work from the one i am now engaged in a little while later chesnutt began the study of stenography because he wanted to go north and earn his living other than by teaching he thought this would also prepare him for any field of knowledge he declared i hope to write words a minute in two months time by may the young principal had attained his goal and could write words per minute he decided to take his family and start a new life in new york city the school board in fayetteville reluctantly accepted his resignation he had won the respect and esteem of the townspeople of fayetteville members of the school board wrote him glowing recommendations the fayetteville observer of june wrote a flattering editorial on the departing principal immediately upon arriving in new york chesnutt found employment as a reporter for dow jones on wall street chesnutt didnt especially enjoy this type work he stayed with it five years and then he returned to his place of birth cleveland he studied law in the office of judge samuel e williamson later general counsel for the new york central railroad and was admitted to the ohio bar about this time chesnutt began to write in a desultory fashion for various magazines and newspaper syndicates his first published story as an adult was uncle peters house it was based on scenes across the cape fear river where his father had owned property his stories were shortly to appear in puck tidbits two tales the independent the overland monthly century magazine and the atlantic monthly the atlantic monthly in published a negro author for the first time when they published chesnutts the goopered grapevine this was part of a series of seven folk stories later collected in chesnutts first book the conjure woman published in by houghton mifflin and company the year was a boom year for chesnutts writings he wrote the wife of his youth and other stories of the colorline and also an excellent biography of frederick douglass the negro leader the douglass biography was a part of the beacon biographies series on eminent americans the wife of his youth part of a group of short stories is a tale of a very fair colored man who just before the civil war by the aid of his negro wife makes his way from slavery to freedom to a northern city groveland cleveland he makes a success in business and becomes socially prominent and is on the verge of marrying a young white widow when the wife of his youth appears on the scene chesnutts first novel the house behind the cedars is commonly given first rank among his novels in this story the heroine rena walden is sought in love by three men george tryon a white man whose love fails when put to the test jeff wain a coarse and brutal mulatto and frank fowler a devoted young negro who sacrifices all for the love of rena in before he left north carolina chesnutt went to raleigh to report a speech by frederick douglass for the raleigh signal at this time he made this interesting resolve the object of my writings would be not so much the elevation of the colored people as the elevation of the whitesfor i consider the unjust spirit of caste which is so insidious as to pervade a whole nation and so powerful as to subject a whole race and all connected with it to scorn and social ostracismi consider this a barrier to the moral progress of the american people and i would be the one first to head a determined organized crusade against it the stories in the conjure woman are related by a wily exslave uncle julius to a white couple unlike uncle remus of joel chandler harris fame chesnutt has his uncle julius showing the tragedy of slavery his sly wit and a keen awareness of his own interests chesnutt had grave doubts on the question of dialects he wrote one of his publishers the fact is of course that there is no such thing as a negro dialect that what we call by that name is the attempt to express with such a degree of phonetic correctness as to suggest the sound english pronounced as an ignorant old southern negro would be supposed to speak it and at the same time to preserve a sufficient approximation to the correct spelling to make it easy reading i do not imagine i have got my dialect even now any more uniform than other writers of the same sort of matter the marrow oj tradition has been called by some an american classic it was written shortly after the spanishamerican war had ended and is the first negro novel to deal with the negro question in the specific setting of imperialism chesnutt made this observation on liberty at the time he wrote the book the nation was rushing forward with giant strides toward colossal wealth and worlddomination before the exigencies of which mere abstract ethical theories must not be permitted to stand the same argument that justified the conquest of an inferior nation could not be denied to those who sought the suppression of an inferior race one reviewer noted mr chesnutt has made a most powerful argument in favor of social recognition but it seems a waste of time and energy in the present state of american civilization chesnutt was disheartened by the small sales record of the marrow of tradition he wrote his publishers im beginning to suspect that the public as a rule does not care for books in which the principal characters are colored people or written with a striking sympathy with that race as contrasted with the white race his next novel the colonels dream which exposed peonage and the convict lease system did not have large sales either it was a hard blow charles w chestnutt was only when the colonels dream was published but he wrote no more novels after that on june chesnutt was awarded the spingarn medal for his pioneer work as a literary artist depicting the life and struggles of americans of negro descent and for his distinguished career as a publicspirited citizen harles waddell chesnutt came to the end of his frutiful life on november at cleveland ohio his body lay in his library surrounded by his beloved books people who represented every walk of life in america every creed and color attended the simple episcopal service margaret mcmahan the writer says charles waddell chesnutt has stood the test of time he remains one of the nations great writers and north carolinas most outstanding negro authora literary great a word artist by norma fay hamilton i waiting

and wife formal the first negro president of the united states not ten minutes but nearly twenty minutes had passed and still the direct communications line from the alte mainzer palace in frankfurt am main to the cabinet room of the white house in washington d c had not been repaired only general pitt fortney who had asked edna to order the coffee had not had the time to finish more than half of his cup impatient with the delay irritated by the unexplained inefficiency he had been up and down at the handset telephone and away from it and back to it belaboring the signal corps for not yet making the presidents private line operative minutes ago he had bellowed into the telephone at some pentagon underling dammit colonel if you arent fixing to get those wires up im going to get sac to fly me over in a b and do the job myself now get cracking they were no longer gathered around the cabinet table general fortney like a caged and offended beast was pacing near the telephone jed stover stood beside the bookcase beneath the mantel with its model ships examining the titles of the various volumes near him propped on the arm of a chair senator dilman was lighting the stub of his cigar and again reading a sheet of paper he held in his hand before the open door to ednas office senator selander and representative wickland were engaged in a conversation secretary of state eaton his back to the others his hands clasped behind him stood at the french doors contemplating the rose garden in the dull august morning governor talley was making an inquiry of leach the stenotypist thus it was that edna foster found them as she returned to the cabinet room from her office where she had met with tim flannery the press secretary to inform him that the conference call while still interrupted would soon be resumed passing selander and wickland she heard a snatch of their conversation senator selander was saying dont you worry your head none about old hoyt watson hes the most reliable member of the senate southerner or not hes still internationalminded hell go with t c its that damn troublemaker in your house im worried about cant you control zeke miller and that lousy newspaper chain of his he hasnt let up a day on aup representative wickland was at once defensive leave him to me i can handle him he likes t c hes received plenty of patronage from t c i tell him the president wants aup why zeke miller wont obstruct him senator selander appeared unconvinced for someone who likes t c hes sure raising hell with t cs cabinet did you see what he let reb blaser publish in the citizenamerican about eaton dirty politics i tell you edna foster who had hung back to hear the last saw that both majority leaders were turning to inspect eaton embarrassed at eavesdropping she hurried to her purse lying on the table opening it to find a cigarette she cast a surreptitious glance at eaton still at the french doors still contemplating the rose garden she wondered if he was thinking about reb blasers column in the washington citizenamerican leaving dinner last night george had bought the newspaper peering briefly at the baseball scores and reb blasers story as they walked toward her apartment george had showed her the column it had been devoted to the low moral tone of the department of state and then boldly revealed information from an inside informant that the secretary of state and his attractive socialite wife kay varney eaton were on the verge of a divorce the gossip column had pointed out that of the days past kay varney eaton and her husband had been together in the capital city only sixtyeight days in fact reb blaser had pointed out she was now in miami being seen in nightclubs with cartnell the renowned decorator while herequally renowned husband rattled around alone in their elegant georgetown mansion we can only hope reb blaser had concluded that our secretary of state will be more successful in maintaining peace with the soviet union than with his wife of twoandtwenty years edna remembered that she had considered blasers column disgraceful and she had blamed his publisher congressman zeke miller for allowing even encouraging such attacks she had been surprised to find george defending both blaser and miller he had he had said only admiration for their news sense and for their honesty edna had quickly forgiven george understanding that as a member of the white house press corps he would naturally defend and admire his own now edna realized that arthur eaton had come away from the window and caught her staring at him flushing she turned away only to observe senator dilman going out the corridor door probably to the washroom she decided to talk to jed stover at the bookshelves starting toward the under secretary of african affairs she became aware of a folded paper lying on the green carpet behind stover quickly she went to it picked it up and opened it in order to find out to whom it belonged the embossed letterhead she saw bore the name trafford university in the left corner was the smaller lettering office of the chancellordr chauncey l mckaye it was addressed to dear senator dilman not meaning to go further but unable to escape the typed words in the single paragraph that followed edna realized that the head of the university at the suggestion of the dean of men was writing the senator about his son julian dilman a sophomore whose grades had seriously fallen off and who would have to be placed on probation if this continued she noticed words like inattentive and disrespectful and the phrase more interested in outside activities of late than in his schooling she folded the letter embarrassed to have seen its private contents but for the first time she thought of dilman as a human being of those in the room she knew senator dilman the least this was because since t c had been president dilman had been less frequently in the white house than the others only in the few days between the vicepresidents death and the presidents departure for frankfurt had dilman appeared several times with the majority leader but now this letter in ednas hand it gave him a son a son who was a problem and it made him a father not just another senator but a human being noticing that dilman had reappeared and was making his way toward selander and wickland edna hurried to intercept him senator i found this on the floor she said apparently you dropped it im sorry i had to open it senator dilman accepted the letter with the slightest smile its quite all right thank you edna turned in time to see wayne talley approaching eaton arthur its past two in the afternoon in frankfurt t cs probably gone back into the conference think theres any point in waiting around like this eaton shrugged he addressed not only talley but everyone i think we have no choice but to wait the president just may feel this is important enough to delay the conference he may want to speak to us further as if the deferment in resuming communications were a personal affront general fortney charged at the regular telephone once more for the hundredth time it seemed he was calling the signal corps about to continue to her chair and shorthand pad edna slowed down listening hard she thought that she had heard her own telephone ring in her office she was listening trying to make it out above fortneys voice when she heard representative wickland the person nearest to her open door call to her miss foster your phoneshe darted past the congressman into her office slipped between the electric typewriter stand and the table holding the television set and caught up the receiver in midring hello she answered the presidents office for a suspended moment she heard nothing more than the wavy swooshing sound that indicates a longdistance call then a voice came on a strange voice from far away and it said is this the white house who is this this is the presidents personal secretary miss foster may i ask who is calling oh miss fostermiss foster and suddenly edna felt goose pimples on her arms and a chill across her back for the disembodied voice was quavering and frantic miss fosterthis is zwinnambassador zwinn in frankfurtmiss foster the voice seemed to be choked and then it shouted out theres been a terrible emergency get me someonetalleyget me talley with emergency with terrible emergency edna found herself shivering and the receiver in her right hand shaking one secondone second please she blinked at the open door to the cabinet room and screamed out governor talley governor come here something terrible has happened talley burst through the door on the run puzzled curious searching her face she merely wagged her head wordlessly and shoved the receiver into his hands as he took up the telephone she backed away from the desk and could see the room rapidly filling with the others all looking from her to talley wonderingly who talley was saying into the receiver zwinn oh ambassador i didnt know his speech halted as abruptly as if his throat had been cut he listened and listened and as he did so his lips began to move but dumbness remained and his face turned grayer and grayer until it was finally ghostwhite at last he spoke are you sure are you positive the president and then listening lifting his head from the mouthpiece to stare at eaton and the others yes ambassador he was saying again yes i understandi cant believe ityes yes i do believe you ill tell them well get right back to you talley lowered the receiver onto the cradle and stood rooted to the spot a portrait of stunned disbelief eaton came slowly toward him what the devil is wrong wayne what has happened talley tried to speak tried to form the words mouthing them then stuttering them out the prespresidentthe president is dead what eaton grabbed talleys shoulder roughly shaking him what in the hell are you saying who was that what did he say arthur that was ambassador zwinn part of that building in frankfurt collapsedthat goddam ancient palacethe top caved in on two rooms and one was t cs studywhere he was talking to usthats what happened thats what cut off the call broke down everythingfell on him all of themkilled the presidents dead arthur dead eaton was ashen but controlled are you sure is it certain dead whimpered talley killed instantly blocks slabs of granite fell down on him crushed him they have the body two secret service agents in the room too dead all dead oh godgod what a terrible terrible thing that moment the corridor was flung open and tim flannery burst in crying out have you heard associated press just got the bulletin from frankfurt the president he halted eyes going from one dazed face to the other and then he knew that they had heard eatons face was hidden in his palms and then suddenly he looked up the president dead he said that means the speaker of the housewayne what about the speaker earl macpherson was in there what about him talley did not seem to comprehend eaton spoke louder dammit man is macpherson alive or dead alive muttered talley hei dont knowi think hes in pretty good shapenothing criticaltheyve got him over at the hospital theyre working on him this is the worst tragedy in our history the worst whats going to happen to all of us eaton closed his eyes us he repeated the roof just fell in on us too and when he opened his eyes edna foster could tell for the first time that they were wet it was hard to tell because she was weeping and she did not know if she would ever stop night had come to washington a city like the nation dumbed down in grief and mourning night had come to the late presidents oval office where those who had worked with him and for him who had known him and loved him who had depended upon him and needed him now filled the sofas and armchairs forlorn and disconsolate stood in corners heavyhearted and helpless waiting for they knew not what edna foster eyes swollen lips still quivering came into the office with the latest special editions of the evening newspapers and wobbled through the cheerless room passing out copies all who had been in the cabinet room ten hours before were present here but now there were also many others edna recognized attorney general clay kemmler secretary of the treasury vernon moody cia director montgomery scott senator hoyt watson admiral alfred rivard and at least a halfdozen more of equal standing it seemed that every nook and cranny in the oval room was filled except one and that one the vacant place tonight was the late presidents highbacked black leather armchair behind the buchanan desk having finished passing out the newspapers edna found that she was left with one copy the group beside the french doors that led to the rose garden the group consisting of senator selander representative wickland general fortney and secretary of state eaton were reading the front page of the newspaper that senator selander held out for them or rather edna became aware all were reading the front page except eaton whose attention was disengaged whose attention was turned inward there was much more to the news story and many more similar stories on the front page but edna foster had no desire to read further casting the newspaper aside she realized that wayne talley and tim flannery were whispering in the doorway to her office now talley was returning heading for arthur eaton stand by edna he said then reaching eaton he said they have an open line to frankfurt no word on macpherson yet hes been almost three hours in surgery tim spoke to ambassador zwinn briefly the first phase of the operation was successful but theres still a way to go but everyone is feeling better they expect to swear macpherson in the minute he comes out of the anesthetic i think tim and i better draft a press release there are more than a thousand accredited correspondents out there baying for news go ahead said eaton disinterestedly talley hesitated i know howhow you still feel arthur i know how close t c was to you i cant get used to it myself im numb who would have ever dreamt that such a thing go draft that release said eaton curtly then he added let me know the second you receive any flash on mac okay edna saw talley signal her edna he said tim and i need you i know its tough but we have to dictate something about macpherson succeeding t c as president dumbly edna foster nodded her assent hating this moment of surrender of bitter truth when her employer would be supplanted by another she followed the presidential aide into her small office shut the door behind her and observed that tim flannery had already drawn up two folding chairs since he and talley were sitting she went around the desk to take her accustomed place in the walnut swivel chair she located her shorthand pad and several sharp pencils flannery waved toward the pencils dont take anything yet edna wayne and i want to talk this out first flannery had already handed the aide a sheaf of papers which talley was studying intently everything here talley inquired still reading everything said flannery the boys on the judiciary committee pitched in and also the justices gave us material and for the background we had the legislative reference service at the library of congress busy youll find the presidential succession acts of and in full with pertinent sections marked out then theres a lot of legal and background data all severely condensed isnt it amazing how you go along and never think of anything like this said talley youd think id know most of this but i dont i know eight presidents died in office before t c but i never knew this that eight vicepresidents died in office also nine vicepresidents counting poor porter ten days ago talley looked up blankly christ i forgot all about him today seems to have blotted everything else out half listening edna doodled on her pad then as talley read on she began to print the names of the nine presidents including t c who had died in office she printed william harrison zachary taylor abraham lincoln james garfield warren harding franklin d roosevelt john f kennedy and then t c she counted eight who was the ninth then she remembered and printed the name of william mckinley between garfield and harding next she tried to think of the vicepresidents who had died in office she could think of only elbridge gerry henry wilson garret hobart and porter and not another finally she gave up there was no use thinking about it she felt ill she heard talleys strained voice i somehow believed that almost every president who didnt finish his term was assassinated but it says here that not more than four were shot down lincoln garfield mckinley and kennedy said flannery fingers pressing his forehead harrison and harding died in part of pneumonia taylors death was caused by cholera morbus fdr suffered a cerebral hemorrhage like porter incredible but poor t c was the only one ever to be snuffed out by an accident he shrugged i suppose it had to happen to someone sometime then he added wretchedly only why did it have to be t c edna had been watching tim flannery as he spoke and there was a sweetness about him behind his whole facade of forced factuality that she liked very much he was a tall irishman with unruly rust hair and a small reddish mustache and a wide ingenuous florid face now puffy and blotched by sorrow he looked as tweedy as his suits with their leather elbow patches and he had been a midwest newspaperman who had written several highly respected history books on the side it said much for him that most of the cynical white house press corps and her own george among them liked tim flannery chrisamighty but im sure not in the mood for this governor talley was saying his one crossed eye contemplated the ceiling and then reluctantly came down to the papers in his hands well guess somebodys got to do it might as well get it over with let me see tim says here that speaker earl macpherson will fill one year and five months of t cs unexpired term is that correct give or take a few days yes said flannery almost inaudibly he seemed to make an effort to pull himself together all the past vicepresidents who succeeded presidents had over three years of unexpired terms to fill except filmore who served two years and eight months of taylors term and coolidge who picked up one year and seven months of hardings unexpired term and lyndon johnson who served one year and three months of kennedys unexpired term macpherson will have a long enough way to go in thein the presidency yes he will said talley with gravity he touched the sheaf of papers in his hand you say here this is the first time in our history we have ever lost both men elected to serve us for four years never happened before said tim flannery but as clinton rossiter wrote in the american presidency this is no guarantee for the future how right he was flannery pointed to the sheaf of papers did you notice that other quotation from rossiter which one flannery had bent forward and pointed to a paragraph on the top page right there he read it aloud if we are only poorly prepared for a double vacancy we are not prepared at all for a multiple vacancy and it is this kind of vacancy so i am told by colleagues who deal in the laws of probability that we are most likely to be faced with during the next hundred years and beyond tally frowned im not interested in that im interested in the facts tim nothing else were faced with a double vacancy not a multiple one lets check the presidential succession act of just get it straight before we dictate the release to edna he had begun turning the pages and at last he found it here it is okay clear and simple if the presidency and vicepresidency are vacant the speaker of the house of representatives shall upon his resignation as speaker and as representative in congress act as president his gaze moved down the page yes clear enoughpresident vicepresident speaker of the house and after that the order of succession is president pro tempore of the senate secretary of state secretary of the treasury secretary of defense attorney general and so forth through the cabinet he raised his head any speaker even come half this close to the presidency before not while speaker no said tim flannery one former speaker polk was later elected president but none ever okay theres always got to be a first time said talley he handed the papers back to the press secretary so its the speaker of the house grumpy old earl macpherson himselfwhod have believed it possible okay thats the law and no matter how we feel we might as well start dictating some kind of press announcement flannery snapped his fingers i forgot to get a capsule of macphersons background some of that should be in too definitely said talley flannery twisted in his chair toward edna can you be a good girl and fetch representative harvey wickland in here he can give us what we need for now on macpherson edna came out of her swivel chair hastened to the door leading to the presidents oval office opened it and then halted surprised everyone in the crowded room was on his feet all converging upon arthur eaton who stood in the center of the room in the middle of the eagle of the united states design woven into the thick green presidential rug edna turned to flannery and talley somethings happening she exclaimed everyones gathering around secretary eaton immediately talley and flannery jumped to their feet pushing past her into the room toward eaton reluctantly edna followed them toward the center of the oval office eaton his voice dry and low was speaking aloud i have just been called outside to take a telephone call from frankfurt i have terrible news to report to all of you terrible news and it grieves me speaker of the house earl macpherson died in surgery on the table under the knife ten minutes ago this has been confirmed now the speaker is also dead a great gasp swelled through the room and off somewhere there was someone hysterically sobbing and after that there was a sickening silence edna heard tim flannery beside her whisper almost to himself multiple vacancy the first to be heard speaking aloud was governor wayne talley i dont believe it the second to be heard aloud was arthur eaton it is true then it was that general pitt fortney called out who in the hell is t cs successor arthur eaton held up his head according to the presidential succession act of the next in line is the presidents pro tempore of the united states senate for strange and suspenseful seconds the secretary of states pronouncement hung in the air and those who heard it were immobilized allowing it to sink into their minds as the curved walls with their niches and shelves of dead mementos seemed to close in on them the president pro tempore of the senate the attorney general intoned as someone might intone amen and then at once all at once collectively each in the room seemed to realize who this was who their next president of the united states was and all at once all of them collectively turned their gaze upon the one man who stood somewhat apart from them near the buchanan desk everyone it seemed was staring at senator douglass dilman and for edna it was frightening to see that in each persons eyes without exception there was registered a look of horror within thirty minutes the group grown larger from the arrival of other members of the government had assembled in the cabinet room they stood now in the semicircle with an opening in the center for two still photographers and two television cameramen representing the press pool clustered around the sevenfoot dark mahogany table once while waiting eaton had asked douglass dilman if he had any close relatives or friends in the city whom he might wish to have witness the ceremony he had replied in an undertone no sir no one once minutes ago eaton had beckoned to edna and tim flannery and demanded a bible there was much scurrying about but no copy of the bible was to be found until edna remembered the one in the lower drawer of her desk she had gone to get it and found the cheap battered bible a gideon bible she had borrowed from a hotel room in memphis once on a trip with t c and had forgotten to return and which she now retained for reference purposes guiltily she had brought in the gideon bible and given it to eaton she found herself still standing beside eaton who leaned against the highbacked leather chair bearing the tiny brass nameplate secretary of state she heard eaton inquire of senator dilman do you wish this open on any particular passage she heard dilman reply psalms slowly eaton leafed through the book and then he said is this it except the lord build the house they labour in vain that build it except the lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain he glanced inquiringly at dilman and dilman swallowed his adams apple bobbing and said yes sir that is it it was during this moment that noah f johnstone chief justice of the supreme court came through the corridor door and across the room gravely nodding at the familiar faces turned toward him even without his robes edna thought even in his bow tie and dark suit the chief justice appeared impressive he was a giant of a man with a slight stoop and an uneven gait his sunken face wrinkled and wise betrayed no emotion he came around the cabinet table into the glare of klieg lights nodding to talley and then to dilman and eaton and he took his position behind t cs old chair are we ready he inquired of no one in particular and then he accepted the open gideon bible from eaton squinted down at it and said to dilman take the holy book in your left hand and raise your right hand i will recite the oath of office as it is written in article ii section of the constitution of the united states when i have finished please repeat the oath he proffered the bible to dilman who took it and held it with difficulty in his left hand and raised his trembling right hand chief justice johnstone lifted his own right hand and measuring each word he rendered the oath of office when he was done he waited after a painful interlude douglass dilmans thick lips moved and the words that he repeated came out low and slurred i douglass dilman do solemnly swear that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states he halted and looked around the room bewildered as if seeking a friend in a company of strangers the harsh kliegs blended with the light of the overhead neon grill made the witnesses to the historic tableau seem ghostly he had lowered his right hand and suddenly chief justice johnstone reached out and grasped dilmans right hand in his own and shook it mr president the chief justice was saying we deeply mourn the passing of our beloved past president but the continuity of our government the welfare of our country must stand above any one individual in these perilous times our hearts go out to you for your double burden and may the lord in heaven bless you and watch over you as the new chief executive of this nationandas the first negro to become president of the united states it was the muffled sound of argument that awakened him there was a thin line of ache behind his forehead as he listened sorting and separating the muffled sound into two sounds the first shrill and feminine cross and indignant the second low and male calm and placating his head was deep in the fat pillow so deep that when he turned he could not see the time the pillow had been handmade by aldora almost doublesized and stuffed with gray goose down and presented to him on their first anniversary so long ago when their marriage still had hope the cross fire of altercation beyond his bedroom wall increasingly abrasive continued louder he lifted himself ever so slightly on his forearm and was able to make out the time on the electric clock humming upon the end table beside the bed it was eight fiftytwo and although the room was darkened by the drawn shades he knew that it was morning he realized that he had meant to be awakened earlier had meant to set the alarm but had forgotten to do so before falling asleep the shutoff lever on his telephone had banished all calls and in his utter exhaustion he had slumbered on and on it was shameful he thought behind the headache and as always to do anything shameful alarmed him other men could afford mistakes small and large but he could afford none not the smallest one several times during his residence in washington he had awakened with the remnant of the same dream that he had been treading water in an enormous aquarium and that all its sides were painted with blue eyes staring at him the shimmering fragment of dream had always left him uneasy but now the private hook of humor that he possessed but had not dared to reveal to anyone but wanda and his closest friends extricated him from the fish bowl and he was free to admit to himself that he had performed his first act as the president of the united states he had overslept suddenly the enormity of what had happened last night and of what he was oppressed him with its unreality and automatically forced him to retreat into the cup of the down pillow he had he remembered been told by someone last night that after formally resigning from the senate he had become the president of the united states at ten thirtyseven in the evening he had not been returned to his brownstone row house until after one oclock in the morning it was almost impossible to recollect what had taken place in the time between he had signed something yes his first official signing he had affixed his name to the proclamation that poor speaker macpherson was sup posed to have signed the same statement that had been hastily prepared for the speaker and was to have been flown to frankfurt this proclamation was the official announcement of t cs funeral and the period of national mourning he had listened to secretary of state arthur eaton and governor wayne talley expound on the critical roemer conference and he had not absorbed a word of it he had sat with them smoking cigars until his eyes smarted and his throat felt blistered and he had sat with the sympathetic press secretary yes tim flannery the redhead preparing the carefully worded release to all the news media then others had swum about them senators and representatives whom he had known during work hours for years and t cs cabinet members whom he had hardly known at all and they had spoken of approaches and strategies and public relations and the party and he had been grateful that they had addressed eaton and talley and flannery and not himself he had been almost physically ill from the tension of the events of that day and evening and after midnight there had been a stirring and rising and he had been released guided to a cadillac limousine outside the south portico he remembered protesting against the two secret service agents who had entered the limousine with him and protesting with embarrassment against both the motorcycle escort of police which had preceded him and the second car of agents which had followed him to his home he recalled the scene outside his home and how he had begged hugo gaynor the chief of secret service who had followed him into his living room to go home and how gaynor had been adamant about staying and he remembered how he had surrendered from exhaustion desiring only to escape to his bedroom and sleep alone away from the blue eyes around the glass aquarium the sound of the argument beyond his bedroom wall was persisting it had probably been going on steadily in the seconds of his introspection and now at last he was able to place himself accurately in the time of day and the routine of his former life and he knew what was going on in his living room it was crystal and a secret service agent who were locked in debate crystal had come to him through an employment agency during his fourth term in the house of representatives and because he had been alone and was still alone she had grown fiercely maternal in her devotion to his comfort five days a week she appeared at eightthirty to prepare his breakfast make his bed clean his flat market for him she worked until twelvethirty then disappeared to tend to her own home which included her sisters family and then returned at threethirty remaining to cook and serve his dinner often not leaving until eight oclock in the evening she was a poor cook a burner of toast and a slipshod housekeeper a sweeper under the rug but she was prompt loyal busy and relatively unobtrusive that is until recently when she had taken to carrying on always quoting her brotherinlaw a gas station attendant about the tumerite group who were out to ruin the one chance that the colored folk would ever have for economic improvement through that rehabilitation subsidy act for negroes that was being talked about at once the reason for the altercation in the living room was clear to him crystal had arrived as usual and found the secret service waiting which was unusual the irresistible force had collided with the immovable object douglass dilman threw aside his electric blanket and swung out of bed he stood up straightening his blue pajamas stuck his feet into the misshapen slippers picked his polkadot cotton robe off the chair and pulled it on he walked to the bureau mirror and looked at himself his black kinky hair as always after sleep was shoved high into a peak at the back of his head he took the widetoothed comb and ran it through his full hair smoothing down the peak he poked at the inner corners of his bloodshot eyes to wipe and clear them he studied his broad indelicate countenance he was darkwell black but not coalblackand his features were negroid his forehead was high his nose full and wide his lips heavy and protruding at fiftytwo years of age he was overweight not yet fat but stocky and thick tim flannery he remembered had asked for the statistics last night and he had said that he was five feet ten inches cheating a halfinch for more stature and pounds his appearance a bigcity ward heeler had once told him worked for him his lack of height his tackiness the antithesis of the fearsome young negro buck combined with mild refined caucasian speech and mannerisms made him more acceptable to the white labor voters his unmistakable negro features made him authentic and agreeable to the black menial voters oftentimes in the past he had wished that he could be all one or the other like the members of his family pitiful dead aldora had been light tan often mistaken for a spaniard and he was sure this had contributed to what had happened wretched julian his son was as dark as himself black really but possessed of features less coarse than his own pathetic mindy his daughter was or had been when he had last set eyes on her six years ago white and beautiful white and lovely which had pleased her mother had worried him had made julian resentful and had made mindy herself haughty and impossible he thought that he heard crystals sharp voice through the wall wake him up she was demanding he knotted the belt of his robe crossed to the door went through the narrow hallway and turned left into the living room the sight that met him was not unexpected beneath the arch that led from the entry hall into the living room stood the shiny bulging crystal shapeless in her tent of brown coat still holding the morning newspapers in one hand and the inevitable huge straw basket for leftovers for her sisters hound in her right hand blocking her way stood lanky elderly hugo gaynor chief of the secret service the wellproportioned excalifornia athlete whom dilman recognized as lou agajanian chief of the white house detail of the secret service it was crystal who saw dilman first she waved her fat hand and shrieked senator they wont let me ini gotta get up breakfast gaynor spun around and agajanian did the same and both were instantly respectful and apologetic mr president gaynor said we have no idea who this lady is we cant let people without credentials in here simply because they say they work for you can you imagine what dilman nodded shes quite safe mr gaynor crystal has been my housekeeper for years i should have advised you last night hello mr agajanian i think weve met once or twice good morning crystal its all right now you can come in obediently the agents parted backed off and the magic of it made crystals eyes bulge her unsubtle black face was almost comically transformed from indignation to triumph to pleasure to awe she waddled toward dilman halted eyes widening ii almost forgot to say senatorpresidentmr presidentbut i want to be the first to congratulate you and also for my sister and brotherinlaw and the kids thank you crystal thank you she began to go sideways still awed and then she stopped we stayed up late and it was all over the television everyone was sorry about the others but were happy that if it had to be then mercy were sureenough happy it is you ii almost didnt come here this morning i was sort of sure youd be in the white house with a special fancy staff and not needing me any more dilman smiled i wont be in the white house for a while and you can be sure crystal ill want you then as much as i want you now she seemed overwhelmed with relief thank you senamrmr president suddenly her round face broke into a toothy smile enamel and gold and she said ill have to take lessons how to talk to you whatll it be this special morning anything special the same as always crystal give me fifteen minutes or so ive got to shower and dress she was off to the dining room and kitchen straw basket swinging and dilman smiled at the two secret service executives shes here every day he said and weekends her niece comes in gaynor said well have to trouble you for a full list of your employees and friends youll have it today mr president there are a number of calls that have come in anything important i dont believe anything urgent the secretary of state wants to speak to you when youre up oh yes one personal callwell he phoned two or three times from new yorka young man claims to be your son julian thats right mr president gave the name julian dilman said hed call back again at half past nine all right better give me time to get myself cleaned up and into some clothes he started to go then said over his shoulder you can ask crystal to make something for you you must be starved thank you mr president the two secret service officers said in duet the tone of their voices hung inside douglass dilmans ears as he walked back to the bedroom he was attuned to every nuance of every utterance that came from his white colleagues the changeable inflection of speech was their civilized weapon of subtle mockery and superiority without insult even when you were a congressman this was their best weapon when they found that your skin was black and thin you could not prove disrespect but you could know its vibrations he remembered one committee hearing when general pitt fortney had appeared as a witness before him and the others he had posed a question and fortneys reply in print on the record had been beyond reproach in writing it was a general replying sensibly to a senator across the committee tables verbalized it had been a west point white general speaking downward to a semiliterate jigaboo perhaps he had been oversensitive that time and on several other recent occasions for years he had tried to curb his excessive sensitivity as other men tried to reduce their weight it took diligent unremitting work it could be done but then every once in a while you put on sudden sensitivity as you put on extra weight and suffered for the added burden throwing aside his robe entering the bathroom he decided that the two secret service heads gaynor and agajanian had been courteous in their behavior and now it seemed reasonable that they should have been to their dedicated eyes a mr president was a mr president whether he was grover cleveland or woodrow wilson or dwight d eisenhower or t c or douglass dilman all that mattered to them their jobs their future their pride was that they keep the pounds of flesh entrusted to them whatever its pigmentation alive he unbuttoned his pajama top stripped it off and removed the pajama trousers opening the shower door he adjusted the knobs inside then started the spray of water finding soap and cloth he wondered how many other white men would be as courteous as his bodyguards the personalities whose speeches he had heard whose bright remarks he had heard whose prejudices he had known crossed his mind the southern congressmen the northern committeemen the western rightists the eastern ivy league snobs a son of ham he thought in the white house in the oval office of the west wing in the highest seat extant in this red white and blue not black republic despite the old prediction of robert kennedy as attorney general that there could be a negro in the presidency in thirty or forty years there had been no one of equal stature then or now no matter how wise or liberal who believed that it could happen then or in this century yet it had happened by accident stepping into the shower cell he knew that he had been insulated since last night from what was happening out there in the capital city in the cities of the fifty states how stunned the american people must be this hour to learn they would have to look up to an outsider a member of the tenpercent black minority of their white country it was not the first spray of die shower that chilled him but the first realization of what had happened and how wildly it would be resented he remembered the short poem how odd of god to choose the jews he paraphrased it how odd of god to choose me to choose one who had already gone high enough too high for comfort and had wanted nothing higher for himself one who wished only to be limited to his legislative height where reticence and diffidence would still keep him an unresented exhibit that was a sop to the liberal conscience of the north then the chief justices wrenching words of last night came back to him may the lord in heaven bless you and watch over you as the first negro president of the united states his limbs felt weak so weak and his heart thudded inside its chest cavity there were a million white men who were right for the job there were a thousand black men who would have bravely and defiantly welcomed the godsent opportunity and called it godsent yet something something had gone wrong up there the lord had poked his heavenly finger at the wrong name and now it was too late he wanted to rebuke the maker for his blunder and then strangelyout of respect to the memory of his mother and father and aunts in the midwest earth out of fear of the hellfire that had been sounded in that old michigan church in the room behind the brokendown social club when he was in knee pants he was humble before that god and the son of god and his bitterness and fear really it was deepdown cringing fear turned to shame this was no place for kneeling but when there was the time and the place he would beg forgiveness and beg for help yet jesus jesus why did it have to be himself douglass dilman who was not white and who was afraid of being black and who was without armor or grace then as the showers liquid needles warmer now hit his soapy chest and the foam ran down his stomach and thighs and as he absently rubbed himself with the soapy cloth and allowed the stream of water to dissolve the soap he thought that his position despite his secret inadequacy was not entirely bad his mind went backward to last night or the early hours of the morning when the white house limousine had taken him home what had happened then was in retrospect heartening when he had become a member of the house of representatives he had leased the upstairs frot apartment of a red brick twostory apartment building between georgia avenue and sixteenth street the three rooms and kitchenette modest and clean had been sufficient to serve his widower existence the location had been comfortably in the midst of a onetime white neighborhood now occupied by upperclass negroes but the apartment had become too small for him senator espinosa who had become senile and disabled had resigned twothirds of the way through his term the governor of dilmans state to strengthen his position with his vast negro voting populationwhich had trebled with the influx of colored families from the southand with the liberal union leaders had appointed dilman to espinosas vacant office for the two years remaining dilman as senator had found himself briefly a nineday celebrity having left washington dc to campaign in a preponderantly negro district for his fourth house term he had returned to washington as a senatorial appointee one of the few negroes to achieve so high a seat in government he had been the subject of a lead article in such magazines as life look time and newsweek and he had made the covers of ebony and sepia he had vaguely felt a freak and been discomfited but encouraged by the party bosses he had cooperated with one and all it had been during this transitional period when he had been the object of so much attention when his mail had swelled when he had received callers mostly political mostly pressure that he had decided that his rented apartment could no longer serve him he had found that the parlor and kitchenette were too cramped and there was need of a study and library at home he had begun to search for a larger apartment but the rents demanded had appalled him gradually he had decided that it might be wisest to buy a house washington was after all his adopted city and would likely remain his home for years to come while he was a senator from his state by appointment and only for a short period and while he had no idea if he would be a senator again he was confident that he could regain his old house seat and even if that were not possible he could go into private law practice in the capital city where with a population per cent negro a highly reputed negro attorney would have enough client to keep him occupied and secure guided by real estate brokers he had visited three brownstones in his neighborhood and in each instance had felt that the house was overpriced and too expensive for his meager savings the fourth brownstone had come to his attention by chance seated one morning behind his desk in the old senate office building he had learned that the reverend paul spinger was in his reception room eager to see him a visit paid by spinger was not in itself unusual spinger as director of the largest negro organization in america the crispus society had often come to dilman to discuss civil_rights legislation that morning as far as dilman could recall there had been no immediate business to discuss he had invited reverend spinger in and the elderly but energetic clergymanlobbyist had said that the word was around that dilman wanted to buy a house if true he happened to know of a house not yet on the market whose owner j had to sell in a hurry and which might be bought at a reasonable price j in view of its value as an investment it was a tenroom twostory brownstone off sixteenth street on van buren northwest and it was a bargain at it was spinger had said a solid aged abode that one day could stand remodeling but was comfortable enough and well located on the fringe of the wealthier negro section near walter reed general hospital spinger knew about the house in advance he had said because he and his wife rose and a boarder had rented the upstairs for several years the landlord had lived downstairs half jokingly spinger hoped that senator dilman would consider it if someone else bought the house they might need all ten rooms and evict the spingers the senator spinger had reasoned was a widower with his son in boarding school and would have no need for more than the downstairs rooms i senator dilman had gone with the clergyman to visit the brownstone i and he had been enchanted by the quiet residential street with its maple trees the small green front lawn the walk up to the entry hall the generous comfortable rooms and nineteenthcentury fixtures immediately he had bargained for it and closed the deal that had been five years ago more than five years ago and not one day had dilman regretted the financial encumbrance for to this brownstone off sixteenth street dilman owed not only his first real pleasure in having a place where he belonged but also his enduring relationship with wanda gibson and because of last night he owed to this house his first feeling of acceptance as the new and accidental chief executive of the united states last night he thought and then his memory held on last night the feeling of acceptance had come at some time after one oclock in the morning as his chauffeured limousine turned into van buren street dilman sandwiched between the secret service agents had become aware of a phenomenon this was a welloff negro neighborhood but a hardworking one and its inhabitants went to sleep early the thoroughfare was always blanketed in darkness well before midnight but last night after midnight the street was lighted with illumination from every house and alive as a mardi gras and then as they had neared his brownstone dilman realized that van buren street was thickly lined on both sides with people neighbors and others of the capital city who had come to be the first to set eyes upon americas new president when the limousine had drawn up before his front lawn and he had emerged the size of the crowd in attendance had overwhelmed him almost one thousand persons he had guessed the faces many recognizable had been mostly black but there were whites here and there although dilman had been unable to discern if they were reporters secret service agents or simply curiosity seekers of the kind who rushed to accidents as he had walked between the agents to his front door the applause had begun then swelled and there had been cheers dilman had paused deeply moved and had exhaustedly waved and waved and then gone inside his house he had fallen asleep so quickly he now supposed because after the first fear and trepidation the paralysis induced by change and sudden elevation he had been warmed by friendship and approval but now the harsher light of morning was upon him the soothing blackness was gone the uncertain whiteness waited he shut off the shower emerged dripping onto the bath mat quickly dried himself then went into the bedroom to dress this was a momentous day and perhaps he would be expected to attire himself specially for it he considered his dressiest sunday black suit then decided that it would be awkward in the morning he settled for the charcoal one he had purchased readymade at garfinkels for his first appearance as temporary presiding officer of the senate during the vicepresidents last trip abroad six months before his death as he dressed himself his mind compulsively revived one more event of last night one that had taken place a few minutes before he retired sitting on his bed last night wondering if the secret service men in the living room could hear his voice he had dialed the spingers upstairs the phone had hardly begun to ring when it was answered the voice he had recognized as belonging to rose spinger hello rose i hope i didnt wake you this is doug her response had been pitched high with excitement oh doug we hopedheavens i mustnt be calling you doug any more or even senator or landlord he had smiled to himself tiredly please rose no formality nothing has changed between us i thank you doug oh my heavens to think of it did you see us outside in front in that mob waving to you im not sure i saw wanda for a second of course you would have were all so thrilled were sorry for that accident in europe but since it was gods will were happy you will be there to guide us we need you doug we all need you and the reverend says this is the hand of providence oh heavens hes telling me to be quiet and let you speak to wanda all right except i want to say for the reverend and myself from our hearts that we wish you strength and courage thank you rose i need that the reverend went to knock on wandas door shes still up shell pick up her phone in a second ill wait thanks rose in the seconds that he waited his brain had become alive and projected the early pictures of wanda gibson when he had bought this brownstone five years ago and while it was still in escrow he had been invited to dinner by the spingers to celebrate his acquisition he had met the spingers before many times but always about the hill or at crispus society affairs or at parties given by african embassies near sheridans circle this was the first time that he had accepted an invitation to their home twice as a representative he had been asked to their dinners and twice he had declined with fabricated excuses as a member of the house he had not wanted to be in the position of having to answer to white colleagues who might charge that as a negro he was being used by the head of the most important negro organization his timidity had been ridiculous he had known especially since other negro congressmen and white liberals had attended those dinners in a natural way and had enjoyed rose spingers cooking thereafter he had told himself that if he was ever invited again he would accept the familiar timidity had assailed him but one more time just before signing the escrow papers on the brownstone house he had wondered what those on the hill would think once it got out about a senator owning a house in which he permitted the leader of americas largest minority pressure group to live nobody apparently had cared perhaps oilman thought wryly because nobody apparently cared what he did at any time in the senate until his surprising selection in party caucus to serve as president pro tempore of the body when vicepresident porter was out of town or ill few had seemed aware of his existence he was one of a hundred names on the roll call rarely absent but almost always silent and withdrawn he made no speeches gave no interviews introduced no bills and he went along with the party and t c and everyone even though after filling espinosas unfinished term as senator he had been endorsed by the party to run on his own with strong negro and labor support against a weak opponent destroyed by a graft expose four days before the voting and he had been reelected to the senate on his own he had felt an interloper he had accepted the spingers third invitation to dinner not as a senator but as their landlord and he had gone unafraid knowing at last that no one not even such southern redneck mouthpieces as representative zeke miller or senator bruce hankins cared or gave a damn there had been six of them at that intimate dinner at the spingers five years ago the host and hostess a colored engineer and his colored teacher wife himself as the personage and guest of honor and wanda gibson it had been his initial meeting with wanda gibson and for the first time in the many years since aldoras death he had realized that affection and desire within him had not atrophied but had only been sublimated even then five years ago wanda had not been a girl but a mature womana lady he had always thought of her as being a ladyof thirtyone when he had been fortyseven she was a graduate of the university of west virginia with economics as her major and she had worked for her favorite professor in morgantown and charleston and followed the professor known for his liberal books to washington d c when he accepted a government advisory job in the latter part of the lyndon johnson administration when t c had become president and wandas professor had gone back to his university she had stayed on in washington for the last two years she had held a wellpaying position as executive secretary to the director of vaduz exporters in nearby bethesda maryland from the first dilman had known that wanda was a remarkable find her intelligence and wit her good nature and humor her wellbred manner had made it seem incredible that she had not ever been married as he came to know her better dilman had come to understand her avoid ance of marriage her parents who had lived in west virginia where her father had been a shortorder cook dishwasher janitor in an allnight diner servicing coal miners had sacrificed much of their comfort and the futures of her younger brother and sister to educate and launch her when first one parent and then the other had been hospitalized and afterward confined to costly sanitarium care wanda had accepted full responsibility to support and look after them not only as daughter but as debtor she had a burden and she could not discard it in favor of marriage for which she was so perfectly suited but two years ago her father had died and less than a year ago her mother and at last wanda had been free to live her own life as her own person she had expected him to propose marriage last spring dilman knew and he had not and it had created for the first time an undercurrent of unhappiness between them she had known that he wanted her for his wife he had known that he needed her the proposal was up to him and yet while he could profess affection and love articulate his need for her he could not bring her from upstairs to his downstairs flat as wife he had thought about it a thousand times since spring and had known that the failure was entirely his own marriage was an affirmative act and he had been shackled by countless negative fears he had tried time and time again to narrow in on specific fears small ones avoiding the major one until at last he could see what was left and what in himself taunted him with contempt wanda gibson was a mulatto that was the center of it as a mulatto she was more white in appearance than black in most communities she could have passed for white her hair while brunette and curling was soft and long her eyes were light brown her nose delicate and upturned and her lips and mouth small her figure was trim well hipped but otherwise slender she considered herself a colored woman and she lived as a colored woman but for douglass dilman how she regarded herself and how she approached her life were not assurances enough the nagging cowardice within him that avoided marriage to the one good companion of his life was his fear of how she would look beside him and how this would affect his political career with wanda as his mate he would appear blacker with himself as her mate she would appear whiter whatever the facts and truth it would give the impression of an interracial marriage it might not cause talk in washington and in his home state but on the other hand it might it was an unnecessary risk it would rock the boat in times like this or at least it might dilmans solution had been to avoid the issue the weekly platonic meetings had continued the senator and his ladylike lady friend in the spinger living room in the loges of loews capitol theater and ever so occasionally in the golden ox or the lincoln inn recently dilman had become aware each rendezvous had been less comfortable less warm and communicative it was as if they were both present each desiring the company of the other but now that she was free of parental commitment and he was temporary presiding chairman of the senate there had fallen a thick steel grill between them you could see you could hear you could not touch you were two not one and might never be one and wanda gibson for all her evenness of temperament and understanding had begun to resent this failure in douglass dilman since his invisible antenna of sensitivity had picked up and recorded her disappointment in him dilman had recently taken to reviewing and brooding over this relationship and his own life some weeks ago he had almost arrived at the decision to propose marriage and to the devil with the consequences if any after all he had asked himself in a practical way how could he any longer be hurt but then he had been sidetracked by his activity and sham importance in serving the senate in the vicepresidents place and now overnight cruel destiny had touched him he had become the president of the united states the personal choice ahead was clearcut should he be james buchanan or grover cleveland buchanan had been the only unmarried president to serve his country cleveland had been the only chief executive to be married in the white house when the choice was weighed thus the scales tipped toward buchanan a showy wedding like clevelands in the blue room before the world and the press a marriage to a mulatto a mulatto who might almost be mistaken for white would merely serve to incense the enemies of his race his uncertain position and precarious image before a broken and divided country would be worsened this had been his rationale last night as he waited the telephone receiver in his hand to hear wandas voice his private decision he had known was neither courageous nor honest it was merely expedient and political it solved nothing but simply traded off a personal problem to avoid a more fearsome one gazing down at the receiver in his left hand he had wondered why under the circumstances he was trying to speak to her at all at least at this time he had no idea what he could say to her yet somehow as president of the united states for more than three hours he had to speak to someone before sleeping and then waking to the terrible fact and the only one who might care about him reassure him was wanda as he waited for wanda his mind drifted to mindy his attitude toward the two of them was one and the same he avoided taking a wife he needed for the same reason that he did not seek out a daughter he loved he was black and still afraid hello doug she was calling down to him through a wire from upstairs and yet she had never been farther away wanda i wanted toto say good night before going to sleep doug its overwhelming the whole thing what does one say do i congratulate you that sounds wrong you commiserate with me and with the whole country no dontdont talk like that its not true that accident in frankfurt was horrible but it happened doug those things happen remember how we once talked about what we were doing the moment that we learned fdr had died and how we felt even as youngsters we felt the world had come to an end that we were dying too that there was no hope yet nothing happened to us life went on maybe differently than it might have had he lived but not that differently well doug t c was a good man im sure and popular but he was no fdr and neither was macpherson i know youll do as well as or better than either no one is born to be the only one to be president thousands of men could be president just as well as the one who fought to get the office if it had to be someone else i think it could have been no one better than you wanda dontyou know me too well for thatyou know my weaknesses everyone has weaknesses doug be sensible stand off and look around lincoln had weaknesses and t c had too many to count and probably dozens we couldnt see to count of course you have weaknesses but youre strong enough to handle the job dont discount your strengths i cant forget what you refuse to remember with the kind of background you had all that poverty how did you get through university and law school how did you get elected to the house of representatives four times and then get into the senate and even become its presiding officer it took something doug it took very much i know you maybe as well as anyone knows you maybe better and i am positive the whole countryonce they get over the shock of theof t cs deaththeyll see you for what you are and theyll be proud of you wanda wandayoure doing your best i knowi

the country maybe butwill they think so i dont know i dont know what theyll think and neither do you i only know what i think if you go at this as youve gone at everything before with determination honesty learning what you have to learn acting as you believe best it will be all right im sure it will work itself out youyou sound less certain now wanda do i i didnt mean to i guess im just concerned about you what do you mean tell me exactly what you mean i meanplease dont take it wrong dougwe know each other too well for thatbuti mean it would be bad hurtful if you started off went

anything i mean in your personal life youre right wanda its late dear youd better get some sleep iill be here you call me when you can anytime ill be here ill call you tomorrow anytime now sleep dearest and know we are all with you good night doug good night wanda good night after hanging up he had tried to analyze their talk she had offered him encouragement and her language had been warm and yet toward the end especially he had sensed her remoteness still he had thought as he reached to turn off the bed lamp and then pushed his fatigued body beneath the blanket she was for him and with him no matter how disappointed she might be in him and that was comforting that was something and then he had felt drowsiness and then he had slept today our nation faces a crisis in finding job opportunities for negroes from the long view of our past this is indeed a historical irony negroes were brought to this country albeit unwillingly because of the excellent job opportunities as slaves in the tobacco fields of virginia on the rice and cotton plantations of the carolinas it has been claimed by some historians that the main theme of southern history was the creation of a social system designed to keep negroes in these jobs slavery terror racism segregation and discrimination were elements of such a system from the countryside to the city twentieth century wartime manpower shortages in the two world wars and the korean war created a demand for negroes elsewhere in american life than in southern fields in response to this demand negroes moved out of the southern countryside in on the eve of world war i only per cent lived in the north and west by per cent lived in the cities of the north and west in three quarters of the negroes in the united states lived in rural areas by threequarters were urban dwellers during this brief year span the intermittent intervals in which negroes were sought for urban industrial jobs were countered by new developments in agriculture the original job opportunities for which negroes were brought to the united states began to disappear due to mechanization of farming in the south tractors chemicals and mechanical cotton pickers replaced men hoes and mules in georgia for instance the use of tractors increased five and one half times in the single decade between and from the beginning of world war ii through the end of the korean war the negro worker underwent a period of extreme economic and geographic dislocation under a push pull sort of pressure the push was the substitution of mechanical power for human labor in southern agriculture the pull was the demand for unskilled labor in urban centers since the push has been accelerated but the pull has diminished in there were negro owned farms in the south by this num ber had decreased by over to in the next five years another negro owned farms disappeared in other words the rate of displacement of negroes from agriculture increased meanwhile the demand for unskilled labor elsewhere in the economy diminished with the step up in automation negro workers bore the brunt of the hardship unemployment of negro workers rose from per cent in to in an increase of over two and one half times this growing non farm unemployment gave rise to a new phenomenon we discovered negro men either born in the city or longtime dwellers therein with a history of good industrial employment who were now welfare recipients these men had been displaced by automation or plant move outs northern racism in the form of segregation and discrimination coupled with too little and too poor an education has frozen these men out of a secure position in the work force we have created and continue to hold trapped a new urban peasantry whites with social conscience have tried to bury the problem of urban negroes by saying that it was a question of newcomers to the city as though negroes were sort of black irishmen this is not the case northern social and economic practices perpetuate the second class status of negroes be they fresh from the mississippi delta or third generation city dwellers northern cities invented de facto segregation in which negroes regardless of education and social status are held within a residential ghetto and sent to segregated neighborhood schools with the breakdown of legal segregation in the south the south has adopted this northern invention the northern cities have created a second class status which has resulted in what i call cultural castration of the lower class negro male in chicago one out of every six able bodied negro males is completely without work and a second one out of the same six receives an income so low that it keeps him and his family below the poverty level we have created vast high rise compounds of public housing in the heart of the ghetto in which we cluster together poverty familial and social disorganization these conditions cause slum shock an illness which our society could eradicate if we use the same vigor that we used in eradicating polio our schools also are failing the negro child this year in chicago the number of high school graduates will be slightly over a third of the number of negroes who reach the age of an alarming number of those who do graduate will not be able to read at the high school freshman level so that even they lack the skills necessary to make the grade in an automated society lest you still think that the ra cial differences are only a problem of rural background of the negro poor let me remind you that in the city of chicago the white high school drop out earns almost more than the negro college graduate new job opportunities given these conditions i join commissioner of education francis keppel in saying thank god for the civil_rights movement south and north the impact of the civil_rights movement is opening up new positions for negroes some with firms which have never hired negroes before and some in skilled occupations and managerial posts from which negroes were excluded this movement has gained the attention of many employers who never before had given the condition and the status of the negro a second thought the civil_rights movement is also important because it has given the little black man new dignity the direct action arm of the revolution has provided an opportunity for the little guy to speak for himself to tell of his anguish his desperation his desolation to force those in the seats of power to act let me give you an idea of some of the openings that we at the urban league see in the chicago labor market prior to the summer of well trained skilled young negroes with few exceptions were confined to employment by government agencies or business institutions within the ghetto today we find chicago loop businesses affirmatively seeking negro professional clerical and technical help the most dramatic breakthrough in which we participated was the agreement last summer of five major loop banks with the chicago urban league to develop an extensive program of recruiting negro employees prior to the announcement of our program there were only a handful of negro workers in the city s banks today either directly through their personnel offices or on referral from the urban league negroes are entering the banks staffs at all levels at one of the largest banks there is a first a negro management trainee all of chicago s major banks are looking for them we also note that insurance companies are hiring negroes as whitecollar personnel and we have begun the long awaited breakthrough in the advertising business in short we are dealing with thousands of employers who are new to the hiring of negro workers and the same is going on all over the north like anyone else with scientific and engineering training negroes with advanced degrees are in great demand the possession of scare skills tends to make a negro very attractive he performs the technical job while he helps satisfy the government contract compliance officer there are further breakthroughs into once restricted areas in one automotive plant we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of negro foremen in other plants some under employed well educated negroes have moved into supervisory positions some firms that had no negro employees even in production or maintenance are now hiring in order to comply with the state fair employment practices law and the president s order on equal employment in the food industry which is sensitive to consumer pressure negroes are being brought into the management training programs of the chain stores although they are still being slotted into stores in negro neighborhoods the large manufacturing firms which supply this industry have followed suit by hiring negroes as wholesale salesmen to the food retailers in the area of government employment we have seen in the last few years a great increase in the number of negro teachers in federal employment while negroes are still disproportionately located at the lower levels of civil service during the last two years there has been nearly a doubling in the number of negroes above grade in general we have noted that almost every major firm in chicago is asking for some talented and skilled negroes the young welltrained negro now has a chance to get into the mainstream of american economic life this situation has put a great strain on my employment and guidance staff tney are under pressure to provide the instant negro the employer names the job specification for which he wants a negro and we are supposed to produce one to fill the spot with the same magic as producing a genii out of a bottle the new opportunities and the american economy these new job opportunities for negroes have not been opened long enough to make any over all change in the economic structure of the negro community nor any basic changes in the labor force of major employers lacking such evidence of basic change we constantly have a gnawing question do these new opportunities represent the opening of the doors of equal opportunity to all or do they just represent token concessions to the great pressure of the civil_rights movement i suspect that it is some of both it is the job of the legal defense and educational fund it is the job of the urban league and of the entire civil_rights movement to guarantee that the doors really do swing wide open and stay open we have had a succession of systems of race relations in our nation first slavery then rural peonage followed by urban segregation and discrimination we have to ask ourselves what is the next stage will we develop a system of tokenism in which a symbolically small number of well educated middle class negroes have access to the total society while the mass of negroes are excluded i fear that tokenism as a system may become a distinct danger even if employers who are opening up these new opportunities are serious and are not going to close the door after they have their token negroes equal opportunity for employment has severe limitations when a nation does not have enough employment to go around it also has severe limits for the individual when he has not had an equal opportunity to become prepared for the job in a certain sense the racial revolution comes at a most convenient time we are undergoing one of the longest economic booms in recent history we are approaching three and one half years of continuous prosperity it is obvious that an employer has to be hiring to hire fairly still the employment effects of the current boom are minimized by the rapid introduction of automation and other technological advances our current national rate of unemployment is still five and one half per cent of the labor force there is a danger that unemployment will increase for the displacement of labor by machines will continue while the labor force grows at an accelerated rate as the post war baby boom hits the labormarket a business recession would further complicate the picture and diminish the number of jobs so far the improvement of negroes employment position has been largely dependent upon full employment for all war time labor scarcity did more to improve the employment position and skills of negroes than any other single social movement any failure in the general economic health of the nation and a lack of expansion of employment would tend to freeze the negroes new opportunities for employment into tokenism or worse racism has become frozen into the fabric of american society in the cities these practices have created an urban peasantry which every year is becoming further removed from the constantly rising level of skills demanded by employers today in chicago the major employers such as the steel mills are requiring a high school diploma for employment as a laborer yet this year in chicago only one out of every three negroes who reach the age of will possess this qualification where do the twothirds without a diploma go to work if they can t work in the mills they are headed for a career of marginal jobs unemployment and welfare they and their families are locked in a pattern of poverty ghettoes segregated and inferior schooling and of course with such conditions unstable family life unless our nation can break this pattern by a massive attack on second class and segregated conditions especially in education the new job opportunities will be meaningless to these people and their children depending upon the general level of employment one third to one half of the urban negroes under current conditions are in a position to take advantage of new employment opportunities this means also that under current conditions one half to two thirds are walled off from a secure position in the labor market the giant step ahead the american community cannot allow tokenism to become institutionalized as we have the systems of race relations which preceded it we are now in the midst of and must continue an all out onslaught against the status quo which denies equal opportunity we are on a road without turning we must shun the blandishments of the gradualist who insists that things are getting better his optimism reminds me of the man who met an acquaintance on the street and in a friendly manner inquired how s your wife the friend retorted compared to what we must all understand that we are striving for equal opportunity and we must be clear ourselves in that equal opportunity means equal opportunity not just a condition better than formerly existed as far as jobs are concerned it means equal education and training equal access to the job equal working conditions and equal chance for advancement all the way to chairman of the board while we must realistically recognize that the achievement of this objective is not the work of a day we still want it and should have had it yesterday the point which i am struggling ponderously to make is that those of us who are in the vanguard of the battle for equality must never allow our eye to be taken off the goal of total equality even though some things are getting better for some black people let me be clear this is not intended to be a blanket indictment of all employers it is a blanket indictment of that portion of the american system which has fostered and condoned crippling discrimination and then in defense pointed the finger of blame at the cripple it created there have been for a long time industrial leaders in the areas of our concern in chicago e.g inland steel international harvester spiegels western electric illinois bell are among those with a very long history of employment of negroes more recently others have joined our leading banking institutions such as first national continental illinois and harris trust are offering a real shot in the arm to help our community toward fair employment by both precept and more importantly by example but we have had too few employers on the right track and we have involved none to the extent which we should but even in the face of these breakthroughs if we are to save the urban poor and their children from an entire lifetime of joblessness and hopelessness of costly dependency and delinquency we must establish a massive crashcrisis program of the magnitude of the marshall plan and the lavishness of the manhattan project we must increase our determination to eliminate segregation and discrimination from american life and then go even further here are some of the ingredients of such a program double the expenditures of urban school systems and spend most of the extra money on those suffering from slum shock retrain the unemployed so that they have marketable skills the chicago urban league has had success with demonstration projects in this field working with public agencies private firms and joint projects in other words everyone can share in this responsibility put enough money into public welfare so that we can change the emphasis from relief to rehabilitation institute a massive program of public works to provide jobs and decent housing school transportation cultural and recreational facilities for all thereby making it possible for men and women to earn their living with dignity while they are being retrained for other jobs these programs would truly eradicate the causes of poverty and create the conditions of dignity the costs are little in terms of human benefit large in terms of our traditional ways of thinking in chicago alone i estimate that we would have to spend a minimum of a half a billion dollars a year for the next years ml vf t last spring at the time of the birmingham riots eric sevareid wrote for america this postwar period is surely the period of the negro passion this generation is not likely to find surcease from the negro passion its source springs and the resistance to it are too deeply grounded for easy resolution and its present outburst too long delayed a year later after our nation has taken the first steps towards equal opportunity we find that this passion has grown not diminished it will not subside until we take giant strides why we have returned to the south a vivid recollection of an incident in my childhood still haunts me the gloating and gruesome description a neighbor of the lynching of a gro man screaming in terror and agony as he was dragged into a car driven to an isolated area dangled by a rope from a tree and then shot to pieces by dozens of jeering white men i myself have twice been attacked with fists and a knife for merely sitting next to negroes on buses as a georgia minister i preached and tried to practice brotherhood and fairness for all men only to be called a nigger lover a term not meant as complimentary by some of my church members no cowards hiding behind bedsheets and the anonymity of a crowd ever visited my churches but they visited others nearby sometimes as a threat and sometimes as invited guests even in recent years on visits to the south have seen long lines of ignorant klansmen in automobiles riding through the night and stopping at certain houses to warn of punishment to those who did not conform to the standards set by these men who in their limited outlook are so sure that they speak both for god and for what they think should be the laws of men and all the while the majority of decent law abiding southerners sit by and let the irresponsible elements in society some in official positions of responsibility perform gross injustices and convey an image that still do not believe is true of the average white southerner of late there has been a rash of articles about episodes in all parts of the country where people refuse to interfere when murder rape and robbery are being committed the usual southern reaction to lawlessness and injustice to negroes is a subtle part of this dangerous tendency for the future of civilization to turn away lest one s involvement bring trouble on oneself but we have come back to the south with the intention and the desire to live here the remainder of our lives and not because we approve of all southern beliefs and actions my wife also a native georgian and i wholeheartedly welcomed the supreme court decision of leading to what must ultimately be the end of compulsory segregation in schools and we hope in all areas of life furthermore we deplore the slow pace of integration and the continued injustices the negroes of the south have to bear we do not underestimate the bitterness the prejudice and the violence aroused anew in many southern white people perhaps then there may be those who wonder why we have taken five children into an area of possible violence with the knowledge that educational opportunities are generally not so good in the south as in the north even for those with white skins in the first place we have not come back south with the idea that we are making a sacrifice nor do we think that southern white people on the whole are moral monsters the advantages our children will have as southerners will more than outweigh the disadvantages although it is shameful that the same thing cannot as yet be said for negro children.it would be unfair and contrary to the facts to praise the south by deprecating the north but it is appropriate to point out that we lived in connecticut new york illinois and wisconsin and have found the people in those states person for person to be very much like the people of the south both north and south have their hypocrites their bigots their areas of ignorance their acts of violence and their injustices to minority groups but both regions also have people of empathy courage and vision inconsistency is not confined to the south cultural changes come slowly especially to a land devastated by war and embittered by the lingering injustices left over from reconstruction days when motives of vengeance and corrupt politics in the north and carpetbagger opportunism in the south played havoc with lincoln s plea for malice toward none charity for all but changes must and will come some southern white people in many walks of life have struggled against great odds to hasten these changes people harassed on the one hand by ignorance southern opportunist politicians and resistance to social change and on the other hand by northern opportunist politicians and sometimes onesided newspaper reporting emotion has prevailed reason has thus far never had a fair chance nor has the plight of southern liberals been made easier by some northern white and negro liberals who in their understandable eagerness for reform have found it easy to overlook the fact that love and understanding are neceessary for the white southerner and his problems as well as for the black doctrinaire liberalism has a special bigotry of its own no man is really tolerant until he has made a serious effort to understand those who are intolerant many southern people would not be so defensive and belligerant if they were understood and given the credit they deserve however small that credit may be in racial matters of course i realize that no white man can really understand the bitterness and impatience that inevitably rise within negroes while i deplore some attitudes and projected programs of the black muslims and other similar negro groups and hope for the eventual good of all mankind that the negro leadership such as that of martin_luther_king and the naacp will prevail nevertheless i am not so certain that i could now write as calmly as i do urging patience tolerance and love were my skin black i cannot asree with the black w muslims but i think i can understand how they must feel yet since i cannot properly share the sense of outrage which burns within most negroes perhaps i am insensitive and wrong in pleading for understanding from those who have never been understood.nevertheless i still believe that two wrongs do not make a right and i hope and expect that negro people will not in significant numbers generalize from particulars and hate or distrust all white men negroes can abuse power too and it will be a sad day for both black and white people if rights are won at the cost of that something down inside which keeps men and their societies sane and wholesome it is unreasonable to expect any non negro to adopt all negro methods and goals uncritically or be cast aside as not really understanding or caring there are many of us who care a great deal and have at considerable hurt to ourselves taken on the fight of our negro brothers but understood or not too many of us in the south have for too long gone north never to return and have lamented the fact that social change in the south is so slow we may have our social views rejected if we return but we are still accepted in a way that northerners with similar views seldom are perhaps this is because we know better than to judge all white southerners by the violence or cowardice of some perhaps too the liberal native white southerner knows by his own independent spirit that a proud people have to be respected and loved even when they are wrong i am glad that legal decisions sit ins stand ins kneel ins freedom riders etc are prodding the south into earlier actions than it might otherwise take in racial matters but however trite it may sound or however much it may be denied the south for the most part must solve its own problems although not in the ways proposed by some inch worm white southerners who are willing to go only one inch at a time with long periods of rest between such progressive moves if the united states is to provide the leadership and example for true world democracy i believe that leadership and example in race relations must come primarily from the south while it is true that the average southern white man does not understand the neero so well as he thinks he does and that probably goes for me too it is nevertheless true that the southern white often feels an affection for the negro in a paradoxical if sometimes paternalistic way that many northerners with their secret fear of the nesro do not understand it is my belief that racial problems in the north will never be satisfactorily laid to rest until they are first solved in the south so much of vast importance for our country and the world depends upon how the proud independent sometimes violent and yet gentle spirit of the south's people black and white can be channeled into constructive social uses i believe the south is equal to the challenge and i have come home to help sick and tired of being sick and tired a feet back from a narrow dirt road just off the state cy highway that cuts through ruleville miss is a small three room white frame house with a screened porch a large pecan tree grows in the front yard and two smaller ones grow out back butter bean and okra plants are filling out in the gardens on the lots on either side of the house lafayette street is as quiet as the rest of ruleville a town of less than located in sunflower county miles from the mississippi river sunflower county home of senator eastland and per cent negro is one of twenty four counties in the north western quarter of the state the delta that make up the second congressional district since this district has been represented in congress by jamie whitten chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee on agriculture who is now seeking his thirteenth term from the house on the dirt road there now comes a person to challenge jamie whitten mrs fannie lou hamer mrs hamer is a negro and only negroes or per cent of voting age negroes were registered to vote in the second congressional district in but in when whitten was elected for the twelfth time only persons cast votes although in there were more than persons of voting age in the district per cent of them negro mrs hamer s bid is sponsored by the council of federated organizations a mississippi coalition of local and national civil_rights organizations until mississippi stops its discriminatory voting practices mrs hamer s chance of election is slight but she is waking up the citizens of her district i m showing people that a negro can run for office she explains her deep powerful voice shakes the air as she sits on the porch or inside talking to friends relatives and neighbors who drop by on the one day each week when she is not out campaigning whatever she is talking about soon becomes an impassioned plea for a change in the system that exploits the delta negroes all my life i ve been sick and tired she shakes her head now i m sick and tired of being sick and tired mrs hamer was born october in montgomery county the twentieth child in a family of six girls and fourteen boys when she was her family moved to sunflower county miles to the west the family would pick fiftysixty bales of cotton a year so my father decided to rent some land he bought some mules and a cultivator we were doin pretty well he even started to fix up the house real nice and had bought a car then our stock got poisoned we knowed this white man had done it he stirred up a gallon of paris green with the feed when we got out there one mule was already dead t'other two mules and the cow had their stomachs all swelled up it was too late to save em that poisonin knocked us right back down flat we never did get back up again that white man did it just because we were gettin somewhere white people never like to see negroes get a little success a ll of this stuff is no secret in the state of mississippi mrs hamer pulled her feet under the worn straight backed chair she was sitting in the linoleum under her feet was worn through to another layer of linoleum floor boards showed in spots she folded her large hands on her lap and shifted her weight in the chair she s a large and heavy woman but large and heavy with a power to back up her determination we went back to sharecrop pin halvin it s called you split the cotton half and half with the plantation owner but the seed fertilizer cost of hired hands everything is paid out of the cropper s half later dropped out of school i cut corn stalks to help the family my parents were gettin up in age they weren t young when i was born i was the twentieth child and my mother had a bad eye she was cleanin up the owner s yard for a quarter when somethin flew up and hit her in the eye so many times for dinner we would have greens with no seasonin and flour gravy my mother would mix flour with a little grease and try to make gravy out of it sometimes she d cook a little meal and we d have bread no one can honestly say negroes are satisfied we ve only been patient but how much more patience can we have fannie lou and perry hamer have two daughters and both of whom they adopted the hamers adopted the older girl when she was bom to give her a home her mother being unmarried i ve always been concerned with any human being mrs hamer explains the younger girl was given to her at the age of months she had been burned badly when a tub of boiling water spilled and her large impoverished family was not able to care for her we had a little money so we took care of her and raised her she was sickly too when i got her suffered from malnutrition then she got run over by a car and her leg was broken so she s only in fourth grade now the older girl left school after the tenth grade to begin working several months ago when she tried to get a job the employer commented you certainly talk like fannie lou when the girl replied she raised me she was denied the job she has a job now but mrs hamer explains they don t know she s my child the intimidation that mrs hamer s older girl faces is what mrs hamer has faced since august on that day she and seventeen others went down to the county courthouse in indianola to try to register to vote from the moment they arrived police wandered around their bus keeping an eye on the eighteen i wonder what they ll do the bus driver said to mrs hamer halfway back to ruleville the police stopped the bus and ordered it back to indianola there they were all arrested the bus was painted the wrong color the police told them after being bonded out mrs hamer returned to the plantation where the hamers had lived for eighteen years my oldest girl met me and told me that mr marlowe the plantation owner was mad and raisin cain he had heard that i had tried to register that night he called on us and said we're not ready for that in mississippi now if you don t withdraw i ll let you go i left that night but pap that s what i call my husband had to stav on till work on the plantation was through in the spring of last year mr hamer got a job at a ruleville cotton gin but this year though others are working there already they haven t taken him back according to mississippi law the names of all persons who take the registration test must be in the local paper for two weeks this subjects negroes especially delta negroes to all sorts of retaliatory actions most negroes in the delta are sharecroppers it's not like in the hills where negroes own land but everything happened before my name had been in the paper mrs hamer adds she didn t pass the test the first time so she returned on december and took it again you ll see me every days till i pass she told the registrar on january she returned and found out that she had passed but i still wasn t allowed to vote last fall because i didn t have two poll tax receipts we still have to pay poll tax for state elections i have two receipts now after being forced to leave the plantation mrs hamer stayed with various friends and relatives on september night riders fired sixteen times into the home of one of these persons mrs turner mrs hamer was away at the time in december the hamers moved into their present home which they rent from a negro woman mrs hamer had by then begun active work in the civil_rights movement she gathered names for a petition to obtain federal commodities for needy negro families and attended various southern christian leadership conference sclc and student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc workshops throughout the south since then she has been active as a sncc field secretary in voter registration and welfare programs and has taught classes for sclc at present most of her time is spent campaigning in june of last year mrs hamer was returning from a workshop in charleston s c she was arrested in winona in montgomery county miles east of indianola the county in which she was born along with others she was taken from the bus to the jail.they carried me into a room and there was two negro boys in this room the state highway patrolman gave them a long wide blackjack and he told one of the boys take this and the negro he said this what you want me to use the state patrolman said that s right and if you don t use it on her you know what i ll use on you i had to get over on a bed flat on my stomach and that man beat me that man beat me till he give out and by me screamin it made a plain clothes man he didn t have on nothin like a uniform he got so hot and worked up he just run there and started hittin me on the back of my head and was tryin to guard some of the licks with my hands and they just beat my hands till they turned blue this negro just beat me till i know he was give out then this state patrolman told the other negro to take me so he take over from there and he just keep beatin me the police carried mrs hamer to her cell when they were through beating her they also beat annelle ponder a sclc worker who was returning on the bus with her and lawrence guyot a sncc field secretary who had traveled from the greenwood sncc office to investigate the arrests they whipped annelle ponder and i heard her screamin after a while she passed by where l was in the cell and her mouth was bleedin and her hair was standin up on her head and you know it was horrifyin over in the night i even heard screamin said oh lord somebody else gettin it too it was later that we heard that lawrence guyot was there i got to see him i could walk as far as the cell door and asked them to please leave that door open so could get a breath of fresh air every once in a while that s how got to see guyot he looked as if he was in pretty bad shape and it was on my nerves too because that was the first time i had seen him and not smilin after i got out of jail half dead i found out that medgar evers had been shot down in his own yard mrs hamer paused for a moment saddened by the recollection i glanced around the dim room faded wallpaper covered the walls and a vase some framed photos and a large doll were placed neatly on a chest and on a small table three stuffed clowns and a small doll lay on the worn spread on the double bed in the comer both the small doll and the larger one had white complexions a reminder of the world outside we re tired of all this beatin we're tired of takin this it s been a hundred years and we're still being beaten and shot at crosses are still being burned because we want to vote but i'm goin to stay in mississippi and if they shoot me down i ll be buried here but don't want equal rights with the white man if i did i d be a thief and a murderer but the white man is the scardest person on earth out in the daylight he don't do nothin but at night he ll toss a bomb or pay someone to kill the white man s afraid he'll be treated like he s been treatin negroes but l couldn't carry that much hate it wouldn t solve any problem for me to hate whites just because they hate me oh there's so much hate only god has kept the negro sane as part of her voter registration work mrs hamer has been teaching citizenship classes working to overcome the bad schooling delta negroes have received when they receive any at all we just have nice school buildings she says in sunflower county there are three buildings for negroes of high school age six buildings for white high school students in the county spent per white pupil per negro pupil when applying to register persons as part of the test must interpret the state constitution but mrs hamer says mississippi don t teach it in school the negro schools close in may so that the children can help with the planting and chopping they open again in july and august only to close in september and october so that children can pick cotton some stay out of school completely to work in the fields mississippi has no compulsory schoolattendance law it was abolished after the supreme court school desegregation decision many negro children do not attend school simply because they have no clothes to wear mrs hamer has helped distribute clothing sent down from the north we owe a lot to people in the north she admits a lot of people are wearing nice clothes for the first time a lot of kids couldn t go to school otherwise one time when a shipment arrived for distribution the ruleville mayor took it upon himself to announce that a lot of clothes were being given out more than negroes showed up and stood in line to receive clothes mrs hamer combining human compassion and politicking told them that the mayor had had nothing to do with the clothing distribution and that if they went and registered they wouldn t have to stand in line as they were doing many went down and took the registration test a couple weeks ago when more clothes arrived she relates the mayor said that people could go and get clothing and that if they didn t get any they should just go and take them i went and talked to the mayor i told him not to boss us around we don t try to boss you around i told him obviously fannie lou hamer will not be easily stopped we mean to use every means to try and win if i lose we have this freedom registration and freedom vote to see how many would have voted if there wasn t all this red tape and discrimination if mrs hamer is defeated by jamie whitten in the primary she will also file as an independent in the general election last fall sncc voter registration workers attempted to register in freedom registration books all those not officially registered these negroes then voted in an unofficial freedom vote campaign choosing between democrat paul johnson now governor republican rubel phillips and independent aaron henry state naacp chairman henry received votes the same thing will be done this summer and if mrs hamer loses the freedom vote total will be used to challenge whitten s election backing up the discrimination charges are nine suits the federal government has pending in seven second congressional district counties including a suit in sunflower county where in only per cent of voting age negroes were registered a mississippi freedom democratic party is also being formed which will hold meetings on every level within the state from precinct on up finally choosing a delegation to the national democratic convention that will challenge the seating of the regular all white mississippi delegation in addition to mrs hamer three other mississippi negroes are running for national office in the elections james monroe houston will challenge robert bell williams in the third congressional district the rev john e cameron faces william meyers colmer in the fifth and mrs victoria jackson gray is campaigning for the senate seat now held by john stennis this extensive program provides a basis for negroes organizing throughout the state and gives a strong democratic base for the freedom democratic party the wide range of negro participation will show that the problem in mississippi is not negro apathy but discrimination and fear of physical and economic reprisals for attempting to register the freedom democratic candidates will also give mississippians white as well as negro a chance to vote for candidates who do not stand for political social and economic exploitation and discrimination and a chance to vote for the national democratic ticket rather than the mississippi slate of unpledged electors we been waitin all our lives mrs hamer exclaims and still gettin killed still gettin hung still gettin beat to death now we re tired waitin by tom f driver closing notice is snr up and i am left to ii sing the blues for blues v f for mister charlie during its brief career i went twice to see james baldwin s play on broadway for one thing i wanted more of the performance by diana sands the best any american actress has given all season for another i wanted to make sure whether the play s faults were really enough to force its closing as some critics seem to think or whether as i suspected its virtues did it in i am now ready to maintain the latter and to see in this a phenomenon of some social importance but before arguing the point let me pay homage to the lady diana sands first came among us some years ago in raisin in the sun a soap opera for dark skins and light consciences not much to my liking it required miss sands merely to be pert which she was and nothing more my joy at seeing her unfold in the baldwin play was great in the third act she had a long soliloquy a lament for her dead lover in which she poured over the theater a libation of anger love and blasphemy the sexual language of this speech is direct it demands to be uttered without shame miss sands did it with such conviction that her dignity increased with each revealing line furthermore she played it at the top of the emotional register shouting weeping and pounding the air with her fists an indulgence few performers could risk without disaster here was acting in the grand manner after putting it to the test of a second viewing i can report that it lost nothing in the repetition honor to miss sands for bringing it off to burgess meredith her director for letting her do it and to james baldwin for writing words to make it possible he play itself is based very distantly as baldwin has said on the case of emmett till murdered in by a white man who was acquitted but who later confessed in the play the murderer s guilt is clear from the start and so is the acquittal the jury will give a negro youth a freeman jr rebellious and unstable to the point of courting death runs afoul of a poor white rip torn with enough pride of race and insecurity of personality to pull the trigger baldwin is interested in these two men only as types his portrayal of them is therefore in sketch but with absolute mastery of detail from these sketches our eyes are led to watch the town s reaction to the murder the whites form an almost solid front that abstraction called justice being less real to them than their fear the front is broken at any rate cracked by parnell a newspaper owner in which role pat hingle gave the best performance he has ever brought us a confidant of both the victim s father and the murderer he tries to remain friends with both while seeing that justice is done this of course is impossible and when on the witness stand he has to choose it is the truth he lets go among the blacks the most important reaction we watch is that of the boy s clergyman father percyrodriguez he has long been a spokesman and a bargainer for civil_rights he becomes an agitator ready to take up arms the play is about the breakdown of moderation in the face of antagonisms that are by nature irrational and immoderate james baldwin s forte has never been the making of plots the structuring of fiction nor the psychological delineation of character he is first and last a preacher but preaching in the theater is by no means always a fault let alone something bad for the box office in the deputy broadway has a sermon that is a solid hit and the lincoln center repertory has an other in after the fall neither is written half as well as blues for mister charlie the only trouble with sermons is that the more they are needed the less they are liked the terms in which james baldwin chose to address his audience are not the terms in which they have wanted to listen on the one hand he alienated a large part of the liberal intelligentsia by paying scant attention to the political and economic roots of segregation marxist and socialist theory have not detained him absent also is any concern with the structure of american law and the elective process in other words baldwin stepped right outside the context in which most americans now see the racial struggle to them it is a question of civil_rights a constitutional question coupled perhaps with problems of unemployment job training and other economic factors instead of talking about all this baldwin has taken what will seem to many a reactionary step he has described racial strife as racial strife warfare between the black people and white people that is rooted in their separate ways of experiencing life the difference symbolized in their sexuality baldwin thus opened himself to two attacks that critics were not slow to make that he had swallowed the myth of negro sexual superiority and that his characters were caricatures that is how it happened that robert brustein of the new republic saw eye to eye with howard taubman of the new york times with whom he had intended strongly to disagree they both uttered the damning judgment that the characters were stereotyped as a matter of fact no play about the negro has ever been seen in america that represented small town southern white people more accurately than does blues for mister charlie i will not judge its representation of negroes in such a town not having lived among them what the play sins against is not the reality down south but the social hence aesthetic myths up north on the other hand baldwin alienated the middle class paying audience by presenting a view of the racial conflict that it fears is true unlike lorraine hansberry who wrote the box office success raisin in the sun he did not flatter the audience by telling it what it wanted to believe namely that negroes have the same ambitions aches and pains as other people the moral of that message is that there is nothing to fear james baldwin by contrast has been saying for some years notably in the fire next time that there is plenty to fear he tells us in blues for mister charlie that negroes do not feel and think as white people and that the assumption they do is simply a manifestation of the white s innate sense that his own values and experience are normative the shape of the play is not a comic one of movement from problem to solution which would be a kind of civic reassurance it is a movement in the negroes themselves from liberality to warfare as this movement is not comic neither is it tragic there is no catharsis in it though baldwin is no brecht the temper of his play is brechtian but not marxist it is brechtian in avoiding both comedy and tragedy it is brechtian in that it is a call to action rather than an imitation of action it is brechtian in that it uses what people will think are stereotypes for the deliberate purpose of challenging received ideas it asks us to reconsider whether the stereotypes may not be nearer the truth than the theory that explains them away far from being as some have charged a commercial sort of play this one has failed on broadway for the same reason brecht fails there it frightens people by challenging the status quo while at the same time it challenges their way of seeing the status quo the social significance of blues for mister charlie lies in what it reveals about our fear of fear it should be looked at side by side with the reaction many people made to the threatened stall in at the world s fair the threat of water wastage proposed by brooklyn core and other demonstrations that go beyond attack on specific injustices in a spirit of generalized protest there is indeed something illogical in these actions the public including many white liberals seems to see in them a threat of anarchy and many negro leaders have warned that riots and the temporary breakdown of law enforcement can be expected the north is discovering its kinship with the south and its reaction is beginning to show itself as fear at this point some of our fixed notions display their inadequacy and the baldwin play becomes relevant dogma has it that nothing stands in the way of racial harmony but the ill will of benighted southerners and other reactionaries who deny civil_rights to negroes ill will can be cured in due time by education preaching and better laws this view is so utterly rational and progressivist in character that it cannot accommodate into its understanding irrational antagonisms between racial groups hence it declares contrary to much evidence that sexual envy which no doubt is irrational has nothing to do with the problem when a baldwin says that it does for negro as well as white he is said to be a purveyor of myth the dogma being designed to rule out fear breaks down when fear becomes unavoidable that is just where we are now southern moderates have been there a long time having no adequate resources to help them face that fear having been told it was unrealistic they became paralyzed by it and were notoriously ineffective in southern politics power was exercised by the faubuses barnetts and wallaces who however unprincipled were realistic enough to see that fear existed that it was inevitable and action must be predicated on it on the other side negroes became a political force in the south by virtue of the fact that they who had lived long in fear ceased to be afraid of it they did not eliminate it could not and did not try it but they ceased to try to avoid it and in that moment their ineffectiveness ended i do not deny that an awakened class or racial consciousness had its importance but class consciousness without the courage to face fear is impotent impotence born of the fear of fear is what has been overcome by negroes in the past years and it is what baldwin is talking about in the rev meridian henry who puts down his brief case and takes up his gun and his bible the message is not very sophisticated but it is true enough and it could hardly be more to the point at a time when the paralysis of the southern moderate is creeping all over the country the sober citizens of the north midwest and west if they do not want to be swept onto the sidelines in the next five or ten years will have to learn that some we don t know how much violence is unavoidable they will have to learn that violence itself is far from the worst of evils even in a peaceable democracy the repression of violence by a force that perpetuates injustice is worse the violence of terrified people is worse than the violence of brave men moderates will have to know that fear is their lot those who cannot risk when they are afraid who cannot cope with anything but rational progress will be made impotent by their fear and their impotence will bring anarchy and violence all the closer if baldwin s play is offensive or even just unrealistic to them they will find their moment of truth arrived too late the negro writer in the u.s assembly at asilomar early in august some two hundred people from all over the country and from several foreign countries converged on a rustic state park and conference grounds at california s famed monterey peninsula to meet and talk with some of america s black literary lions they slept in the two dozen or so redwood lodges took their meals in the huge cafeteria and listened and argued and questioned in the chapel and in the lounges and in the brisk sea flavored open air there was excitement as when poet playwright leroi jones unleashing a whisper of his fiery temper leveled the charge of parasite against so many literary critics and there was nostalgia calm but compelling as when saunders redding arna bontemps and horace cayton recalled their personal experiences with their great contemporary the late richard wright there was a moment when the attentive audience grew tense perched on the edge of embarrassment for it seemed that the occasion was imminent for a needless comparison of two poets work as the two poets sat on the podium the auditorium was sprinkled with partisans of the younger poet a firebrand like themselves ready to do public battle but the older poet is also a great lady and while she had no need to concede any corner there being no qualitative monopoly on artistic approach she was all grace said gwendolyn brooks of leroi jones he is a master of language but all was not so temperate at one point two california claimants to literary distinction drew their verbal sabers and clashed before startled eyes in keeping with his style professor robert bone a program sub for a missing star put down the aging poet kenneth rexroth and the poet whose supply of ego is plentiful screamed back across the room don t patronize me with accompanying adjectives which are unprintable it all happened following the reading of a literary paper but there was the strong suspicion that the two men had brought their mutual animosities with them there might have been other even more blazing battles had the conference lived up to its billing but james baldwin who found europe more rewarding for the moment did not arrive and there were reasons to believe that ralph ellison for whom apologies were made on the morning of his scheduled appearance never intended to show up among mr baldwin s waiting detractors were both mr bone and mr rexroth and mr jones has yet to confront mr ellison in the wake of his highly the word is used advisedly negative review of mr jones the blues people literary feuds aside the conference on the negro writer in the united states turned out to be more than less an occasion for airing the intricacies and implications of the civil_rights struggle which surprised no one the race problem is an inevitable trap for the negro writer and there is no honest escape nor is there any objective reason why there should be even baldwin and jones after disclaiming any necessity for writing protest literature find that their work nevertheless falls into that category only ellison looking down from his personal olympus continues to talk as if considerations of art are above and beyond the question of involvement but it remained for ossie davis that full spirited actor playwright to put everything into perspective with an injection of healing humor acting out all the roles from a scene in his purlie victorious he achieved just the right mood for conciliation and acceptance and then he proceeded to tell it like it is the basic task of the writer white or black is to truly describe america to itself mr davis said at one point and then he got down to the root of the matter the negro writer has to write protest and it must be loud and bitter and aimed at corrective action and an emphatic amen langston hughes and the fantasy or harlem here is never any t f ending to the poet s song and the memory of each theme commits him to the eternal struggle of interpreting what other men are content to experience critic to analyze so called negro literature beyond the concept of traditional form they must go back to the roots to the rat infested jungles to the houses without windows and to the faces forgetting that hope does exist they must taste the strange aperitifs of poverty and despair as they are prepared for the symbolic harlem of hughes poetry and prose it is high time for the negro artist to lead them there the poetic odyssey of langston hughes began in cleveland ohio it was there that he was selected class poet while attending high school he accepted the challenge of meters stanzas and forms because they seemed much easier to deal with than ditches and dishes they also seemed to offer adventure so off to the sea he went as a sailor he learned the value of land it became more than soil houses and fences the land was power the land was science and politics the land owners ruled the world after the spell of the sea wore off he tried earning a living with his hands he also tried book learning at college and then journeyed to mexico where his land owning father attempted to reunite his family after a long separation the next decade would take him to the four corners of the world but before then there was harlem a number of his lesser poems turned up in the little magazines and in the form of pamphlets crisis the official organ of the n.a.a.c.p called him son the labor movement intrigued him the socialist and workers party heard in his plain language the inexplicable cry of the common man his early poems offered music to the weary ears of the little guy vachel lindsay hailed him discovered him as a waiter and busboy his little poems of free verse had freed him and finding freedom for himself he was obliged to seek freedom for others the gods would provide many blessings a patron a place to work a place to hide a trip through the southland a movie in russia a folk opera short stories a first book of poems a novel friends foes more poems tighter stories a broadway play and finally the omnipresent jesse semple and what of harlem the gift that gave the gods to him what is the poetry of how deep are the roots what does it mean to be a black poet in a white world why black why not just a poet who calls the shots and what about harlem the sweet flypaper of life the paradox of the wind and rain and sun climbing the backs of domestics porters elevator operators what mysterious realms separate her from the mainland can the poet langston hughes speak of the city within the city and not speak of the white man s concept of her alienness her ugliness can the poet langston hughes find in her dark obsessions the gift of metaphor simile and aliteration can the figurative patterns of negro speech be put to jazz can the human voice with all of its living modulations be made colorless can the strict metrical requirements of good verse give way to the speech of life black life is god really black is the face of a negro child no less beautiful than the face of a child of any land of any race harlem the hughes harlem of imperfectability harlem arising in the sun harlem sweet everlasting harlem of blazing lights and richard wright freezing at night in his thin overcoat working out his salvation as a native son harlem the natural symbol of misery the national symbol of a country s forked tongue and twisted pride harlem echoing her monosyllabic words to the sophisticated deaf ears of her congress her presidents her critics harlem where does the poet langston hughes fit yes i have known rivers older than the flow of human blood my soul has grown deep like the rivers yes my old pa died in a fine big house but i wonder where i m going to die being neither white nor black sweet harlem they walk in the day and dream at night from th to th he sees the neo classical beauty of a whore s twisted mouth and the bottles of juice stuffed in back pockets behind doors in trash cans under the sinks and why is the juice more meaningful than the constitution or cousin jake down in mississippi why is the soup kitchen more powerful than the gospel and the welfare worker more real than christ what is the cause is it my blackness is it your unconcern what does this poet see what does he mean let america be america again harlem your fantasy has lead him to your gruesome face caught in the full fury of your impassioned plight the nautical mile ends with the soft light of boys who would be men if men would make themselves known the fantasy ends when the banks of your river rise up to match the tide of america s indifference when the rats become lilies growing in front yards when the young see through the fa ade of their own bitterness and take the land to be their own when the true beauty of harlem is spoken of and learned like the pledge of allegiance when the people buy books to read books when the lawyers practice law when the politicians politic for the people when the cadillac owners sell out and sugar hill is no longer sweet when time and life and look learn what to see and whom to ask when paul robeson comes home and jesse semple has no other place to condemn when the sun falls on her belly and covers the world because time has come to an end and your poet like the merchant shall have nothing more to sell i think i see your doom harlem langston hughes has known it all the while he has known your beauty but you would not let your poet tell the world laugh harlem laugh the joke is too universal too ironic too beautiful for you and your poet alone another fantasy begins the freedom riders never board the a train the seeminglv wild young men of stall ins are a different breed they have a harlem unlike the caricatures of your poet s best stories and sketches they have arrived for the show down they are not impressed with the intellectual milieu of greenwich village nor the distant echoes of their job conscious fathers and mothers let america become america again has become real for them and what of harlem what has happened to the harlem of langston hughes where are the solemn faces where are the countee cullens and the alain lockes what happened to the subtleties what happened to the dancing girls and the night people spreading joy and spilling juice at the wonder bar your face has changed the world of langston hughes has come of age he had made laughter a precious thing for horror rides the subways for thirty years he has tried to make you laugh at yourself but humor and the forces of evil do not mix no other poet of your history either past or present has known your shame and self respect so well time changes the past the rats are the graven images of what time has failed to do for you the poetry of your face cries for new symbolism and new words we shall never know the fading symbol of thick lips and bulging eyes in our generation time changes the nature and order of things but the poet s song is never ending direct action the library was a t j stuffy place to study race relations judy confided this to her friend as they exited from the great doors let the stone busts breathe the sacred wisdom inhale it exhale it too judy sat on the cool abutment and stared at her girl friend s sandals then into the spring sunlight that reflected in the concrete steps she yawned pulled her brown hair over her eyes and emitted a soft groan of inertia roxanne bouncy as her fluff of red hair laughed judy a three pointsix student moaning over a simple theme i m sick of stripping facts out of books judy said yet she was apprehensive about her newest plan too direct action was not for the sensitive the bay cities were ideal for her project pickets mass arrests limp bodies black marias common sights but her reports were black and white like the headlines that screamed unrest from corner stands her paper on black muslims was rated superior and the phony buyers at grocery shop ins grade a picketing the trial of a cop who mishandled a negro so good it was read in class is a person right or wrong because he is a cop or a negro nearly all the facts judy complained came from printed matter juggled and rehashed it s research when you steal from the many what a gas crazy roxanne gasped your best themes came from close ups you watched in the sheraton lobby and wrote what you saw don t tell me sure sure roxanne knew it all but the reports were mostly contrasts mink coated matrons staring at disheveled pickets should sleep ins wear fancy dress for twenty hour duty colorful descriptive vivid and inhuman judy jerked at her hair till her head was sacked a spray of plastics gone tacky her method was blinding like her hair the more she studied and observed the less she knew her final paper would be a grade a flop if she could really talk to one black person penetrate him in depth it would reveal more than statistics de facto facts and flashy language about the angry versus the responsible one just one black human i can see it now roxanne chimed judy callagh sophomore sociologist walking the park one hand caressed in a black one and the other holding up a list of questions oh god rox i m not that primitive you ve been glued to the late show and whom do you plan to interview judy parted her hair uncovering a dark glance take the needle off the jazz you mean what cat will i prowl with she smirked at her own cleverness roxanne laughed hmmm the truth is in the middle somewhere okay who black zeus roxanne whirled on her him judy you couldn t you wouldn t date him i have mary and jesus roxanne cried goatee off campus agitator coffee house statue jazz buff purple beret no socks the same roxanne s mouth opened and she clutched judy s wrist judy felt angry talons digging her veins honest judy he ll lay you so fast you won t have time to scream rape judy spoke up bravely fine we ll get that over with then we can get down to business there was a long silence before roxanne spoke any qualms judy judy shook her head at the foolish question really inter racial dating was common as as young profs who pray for hipness after all no nnno the only twinge was her father as they strolled away roxanne resigned assured her there was no sweat don t tell him oh i know you ll tell him roxanne added you always do but i still say there s no sweat he s easy going judy plucked a hedge leaf and played with it he s liberal yes she said but he can be outspoken too they parted under the pepper trees at judy s brown gingerbread house roxanne stifled a chuckle as she whispered stay away from the hills honey black zeus and judy climbed through knee deep wild oats till they reached the highest fire road it was steep and when they crawled over the last brink they slumped in the short lush grass panting and laughing the tilden eucalyptus grove was above a shaggy forest with its hair down across the vale was a sloping golf course where sunday drivers pulled at their club carts judy was surprised at black zeus s new demeanor wearing a coffee picker s straw hat light slacks and hiking doggers he was like a mexican vine tender in her native saratoga not at all like his street image three days earlier when she made her first pitch she had been nervous but an hour ago when she called for him at the caffe mediterraneum her attitude had changed as much as his appearance even in the cosmopolitan scene people stared but she felt newly smart the attention said to her there goes a hip gal what dare what poise they could see over the golf hill to the bay in the misty distance the golden gate bridge spanned its graceful authority from bank to bank it s a cool view he said i m glad you asked me up here his voice was velvety the tone easy and sustained nutty but i ve never seen it before when you first asked me i thought crazy a coolschool maid in the woods well he snapped his fingers still crazy what s the theory behind it must there be one gotta his black goatee pointed a challenge at her judy toyed with the rough fibers of a tiny plant myself i don t believe in mixed marriages oh i mean it s okay for those who want it but couldn't take all those fringe problems she looked up at his brown flesh and yellow straw against the azure tell me what kind of white girls go for mixed dating what s the theory behind it hey that s my question he glanced at judy s tanned face laughing i asked first she said conscious that her dodge was a whopper uh lemme see the brand of pink cheeks who date us niggahs judy flew at him don t say it like that black zeus showed her his superior smirk it s my personal privilege cookie get it i mean it s a freedom of sorts oh hell i m sorry well why the broads go for it eh excitement sex it s in to talk about it after they wanna see what s under the rug he shrugged maybe they like to smell the subterranean scene i dunno oh a few mixed couples are sincere they climbed till they reached the summit near the thicket doggers slacks flat heels and black capris parted the tasseled grasses puffing they sat on a solid granitecolored bluff they were conquerors smugly surveying the sprawled masses all around the bayshore gold is my gal color he said like fried trout the pale dolls assume they re improving a bloodand pink gig mmm sweet charity he kissed his fingertips what type am i it was a patronizing question she couldn t resist he looked at her she saw the pudgy lips part to reveal gleaming teeth that s exactly what i ve been wondering he said you seem to be taking me serious that s a scare with any chick i mean i don t get it not that i m bored by your company but you re the first rosy cheek to take me serious yet i suspect you re not taking me seriously just my race what s the angle judy thought the way he looks at me well he knows what he wants my angle to be but she said i told you three days ago black zeus groaned ye gods judy there s one reason i wanted to come here to get away from the problem i just want to see the scenery with human eyes smell the flowers with human nostrils listen to the birds with human ears here i can be me not a goddam problem i m sorry he was blank for a moment then he dug at his cigarette pocket flipping the lighter he touched the tip of her smoke then his blue clouds merged in the clear air as he spoke it s okay judy what can i tell you she sucked hard with each draw and tried to remember her questions one by one they came till she felt like the school girl she was what did negroes think of the sitins shop ins stall ins bulldozer blocking freedom riders snick and core he should relax breathe deeply of nature and react normally black zeus shook his head lovin jesus judy i m no authority on what we think of all that sure i should dig it but i m a backslider i ve got my own miseries what do white women think of careers homemaking sex on the side judy smiled wryly ashamed of her ignorance she had goofed it even before she d finished her own questions she knew this it wasn t the way it was planned and before he d taunted her with his comeback the clear insight had come being black was like belonging to a heavy laden corporation and zeus was no organization man he was an individual or he struggled to be well judy remember the beefs to rox the personal plane girl oh she cried look at the bay the sailboats are toys on a fairy lake zeus smiled as smoke steamed from his mouth and nostrils sweet mamma nature he beamed mother of the year groovey laughing they strolled hand in hand up a gentle rise toward the grove what if we walked a birmingham street like this she asked he shuddered judy feeling his sudden vibration decided it was genuine are you crazy he thundered hey is this part of your research does it matter she glanced up at him lordy i dream about this cussed paper especially one night in that dream i even kissed a negro what was it like it was salty black zeus jackknifed in laughter wanna find out for sure well why not a kiss is just a kiss the next afternoon judy waited for roxanne at the crossroad of causes as they called it where the university s stony esplanade pours into telegraph avenue here the dedicated sat at folding tables heaped high with petitions mimeo tirades and passionate pamphlets these praised or damned birchers the bomb marijuana laws cuban and canal policies ad infinitum volunteers ranged from budding revolutionaries to square jawed preservers judy watched the excited group roxanne was locked in a solemn black muslim with white shirt and dark tie waving a fistful of leaflets was denouncing sammy davis and chubby checker and roxanne s red tresses blew in the breeze as she shook a psych workbook at him at least sammy and chubby married those blonde chicks the poor muslim judy thought rox likely egged him into it roxanne was the type who had a hot spiel for brief periods especially with newly met people they d stare at her wondering ooh what a live one where have i been all my life if rox wanted to make an impression she d leave before running down for this moment judy waited patiently judy herself often plunged into the crossroad debates but not today she felt subdued in thought the two girls shuffled through pedestrians along the avenue at the curb were barreled plants and parked vehicles mostly foreign miniatures with a few domestic cars current and vintage judy s ponytail flopped as she paced her steps past the tobacco and magazine shop the trade in book stores and the window displays of primitive religious art at the mexican taco den with its peppery smells mingling with traffic fumes they turned this was the day they d begin search for a two room flat though they wouldn t move for two more weeks neither was bored at home so they informed their confused parents but a private apartment was inevitable incoming friends would be less inhibited this was their first real privacy of the day and judy knew roxanne was panting for news but she volunteered nothing so you did romp the hills roxanne said well we counted woodticks judy said woodticks toadshnicks judy callagh come to the scene you know what i want to find out was i right am i a greek oracle judy s smile was faraway but amused she nodded judy felt her friend s fingers digging into her shoulder as one intent on destruction the girls stopped roxanne s hard eyes soon melted into impelling tingling curiosity what was it like judy i mean with a her voice was low expectant judy feeling more angry than wisened snapped at her god damn it rox you talk like a stinkin virgin you know what it s like for some time they walked silently as they neared the apartment judy sensed the other s smoldering hurt she spoke up stoically you re disappointed in me aren t you rox well i try not to be roxanne said but a negro i okay rox shall we forget the apartment roxanne hesitated as both girls stared down at the wistaria roots no give me a few days i ll be okay judy for several hours till her date that night with black zeus judy worked at her notes she convinced herself she felt neither depressed nor exalted her mother at breakfast had thanked her for the warning she had no objections to the date but would lack the poise to be present with friends she attended a campus lecture called the flavors of wine two older sisters were married and her brother ushered at a theatre only her father was home it was he zeus wanted to meet they could talk jazz judy had told him of her father s vast collection of old seventy eights mr callagh had not really listened to the records for years he d take pride in acquainting a young negro with the past culture of his own people it was hard to believe he hadn t heard bessie noone or pinetop judy curled softly on a lamplit sofa listened to the men exchange backgrounds her father once a wine vat jockey now had his own package shop on grove he saved and scrimped and invested and went broke twice in between judy injected laughing he pulled a face at his daughter the red nose humped and the eyes pierced as he jerked at his swatch of gray hair black zeus with the keen quick eyes of a carny barker enjoyed the interchange his name was really joe smith black zeus explained but the nickname stuck and anyway he liked the holy identity his real name was very distinguished mr callagh said as he d see when he heard the records judy sat wondering what was in her friend s mind yet sensing she could never really know even if he spoke with scriptural clarity he was once more a new person both in manner and attire he was neither the jumble of emotions as on the hill nor yet a spouter of copied jargon as in his usual dens she had watched him now in three distinct settings he changed with each was it a personal characteristic or was any negro skilled at adapting himself to what the white world expected color consciousness was stupid yet pretending it didn t exist was even more stupid the community was in the agony of growing pains that would be the core of her theme she d call it judging negroes one at a time the barriers involved the talk from all three was easy free and yet it was hampered by inexperience or by nature itself her father sensing this had prepared jumbo sized vodkas even this prompted an excuse i never listen to bessie smith sober he said grinning judy watched as the pair lost themselves in the eternal primitiveness of the blues bessie s slippery embellishments swelled out and filled the room just as she dominated the horn and rhythm some people call me a hobo some call me a bum nobody knows my name nobody knows what i ve done her voice cried up from the depths of some private hell and joe smith s comet sounding low and mean as a tailgate trombone confirmed her every lament the records were worn and sandy it was like dusting off the family album and looking at pictures of back when the legato tragedies the smashed piano thirds the sensitive corroboration of the hom each sound was the visit of an old friend and old confusions too she remembered as a small girl her parents and their friends sitting on the floor listening sipping suffering with a vicarious sense of exaltation there was a return of her ancient wondering all that misery who were all those slaves in the records and why why maybe if people could drink and listen to blues forever well maybe they d forget the love of blood and greed but daylight always came bottles were empty and people began hating again it was the way of the world it was silly musings judy thought she finished her drink and started another so did the men she watched her father and black zeus both were on the floor near the changer their heads were bowed drunk on the sad beauty of the old blues black zeus was in the orgiastic throes of discovery strange strange strange judy kept thinking he was lazy indifferent and unemployed a sensitive lover a sincerely clever adapter but his was a world she couldn t easily comprehend what did it matter he wasn t her boy friend just an amiable hipster who agreed to help a girl with her lessons yet the impression stuck to her like memories of the music he and i he and i and the men weaving a little laughing talking they nodded and argued and agreed and laughed again yes a negro was a natural philosopher he had to be and he was trapped into being a spokesman too as the stack of records lowered so did the mark in the bottle young woman s blues empty bed blues send me to the lectric chair and many others then they began to talk race again and judy despite the restraining warmth of the vodka tensed i m sure of one thing her father said a white man will always ask a negro the wrong question black zeus glanced up so that s what i say what the hell they laughed down south zeus said the ofay i mean they never ask the wrong thing they re always right that s one thing we don t hafta guess well her father said a little bleary eyed waving his glass you won t have to guess here either cause i m a phony liberal judy jumped at him oh daddy you re not either yes i am yes i am he countered shaking his head tell you what mister joe smith i hope you ll come back again especially after judy moves out he looked over at his daughter if she does meaning the choice was hers judy and black zeus traded glances then she looked down at the carpet that s right her father said i hope you ll come again and again maybe you can hep me i mean hip me to this modem jazz he laughed a moment then added yessir i m a phony but honest to god i didn t know it judy wanted to bolster him she wanted to say the test isn t now but if i married a negro i think you d come through gracefully in the end but of course she didn t she couldn t have said it even if they were alone communication even with him seemed difficult black zeus shook hands and said he d better leave and thanks for a most illuminating evening judy followed him to the porch see you around cookie sure she said goodnight joe it was a wonderful evening when she came in her father was gone she heard him in the bathroom and called in a goodnight then she went upstairs judy undressed in the dark and fell on to the bed intent on rationalizing herself to sleep she hadn t intended to let him have her in the hills really she hadn t despite her smart talk beforehand as she neared sleep some hours later she borrowed roxanne s words and applied them to herself give me a few days literature said a l frenchman named bonnard more than a century ago is the expression of man the goncourt brothers viewed the novelist as the historian of the present for henry james the novel was felt life these definitions though somewhat dated are most appropriate for our purposes and will serve as a point of departure for our discussion of the portrayal of african society by contemporary negro african novelists thus we shall be less concerned with style than with content and for the sake of clarity we shall largely ignore the various classifications of novels in his histoire du roman modern history of the modern novel published in r m alberes lists an astounding number of such classifications a random selection of which would include the baroque novel the realistic novel the post realistic novel the naturalistic novel the psychological novel the historical novel the intimate novel the polyphonic novel the mystical novel the ironical novel the lyric novel the picaresque novel the novel of analysis the novel of apprenticeship the new novel the anti novel science fiction mystery stories the de centralized novel and then something he calls the roman puzzle the puzzle novel obviously therefore a word about limitations is in order the speaker is forced by linguistics to restrict himself to novels written in french or in english this means that we shall unfortunately be unable to include works in yoruba swahili or any of the african languages our second limitation is perhaps less serious we shall focus on the african novel which has been something of a stepchild and has received less attention than african verse nevertheless the dividing line between literary genre in africa is indeed thin a story a fable a poem often overlap and there are passages of african prose more poetic than some of the modem verse we hear as leopold sedar senghor points out in his preface to birago diop s les contes d amadou koumba the tales of amadou koumba even within a given genre the walls of the classification are porous our third limitation stems from the authors themselves and from their milieu writing in a language that is not their mother tongue they depend for the most part on foreign publishers and foreign readers have you noticed asks a character in ousmane soce diop s karim that many senegalese never open a newspaper or a serious book they believe an education has to end when they walk out of the school door in un negre a paris a negro in paris bernard dadie of the ivory coast claims that some of his compatriots boast that they have never opened a book written by a negro i would surmise that even the publications of presence africaine have many more european than african readers another limitation is geographical for several sub saharan countries have as yet produced no novelist in french or english there are indications however that new voices from many of these places will soon be heard numerous anthologies are now appearing i even saw one the other day in swedish meetings of african writers have been held in paris in rome in kampala and elsewhere magazines such as presence africaine black orpheus and transition are providing outlets for new authors five of our novelists are from senegal and an equal number from south africa two each from cameroon the ivory coast and dahomey one each from congo brazzaville guinea niger sierra leone and french guiana we have included the latter because he pioneered in this field and because his novels were inspired by twelve years in equatorial africa and because no study of negro african fiction could omit reference to rene maran in a much discussed volume published in dr frantz fanon a martiniquan psychiatrist now dead who became very prominent in the algerian fln divided the writing of colonized authors into three periods the first period he said is an assimilation period when inspiration is european and one can easily tie up these works to a well defined trend in european literature the second period is one of pre combat literature when the colonized person has not yet become a part of his own people he is satisfied with just reminiscing and he brings up old childhood memories ancient legends which he will re interpret according to a foreign aesthetic according to a conception of the world that has been discovered abroad sometimes fanon says this pre combat literature will be dominated by humor and allegory the third period dr fanon continues is one of combat literature now instead of encouraging the lethargy of his people the writer blows the bugle and he awakens them this is a literature of combat a revolutionary literature a nationalistic literature and during this period men and women he says who had never even thought that they would take pen in hand to write for other people to read are in prison or they re facing a firing squad or they know they re going to face a firing squad and they sit down and they write as their hearts and as their passions dictate now with all due respect to the brilliance of dr fanon s expose one can still question its applicability to negro african literature or more particularly to the negroafrican novel where the three periods seem to merge into one that is the assimilationist period the period of pre combat literature and the period of combat literature the first important french african novel for example rene maran s batouala which dates back to is as scathing and as effective a condemnation of colonialism as any african work of fiction published since that date and it has the additional advantage of being written with consummate artistry the well rounded picture of african life the literary expression of african society will of necessity reflect colonialism and its concomitants but it will also include the many other facets of the african s life his culture his problems and his essential dignity what i find objectionable in dr fanon s thesis is the implication that violence alone inspires the highest form of art and the conscious or unconscious attempt to make every negro african author conform to a single pattern a case in point is that of camara laye of guinea whose excellent novel uenfant noir the dark child was criticized by some of the author s compatriots because in their opinion it was not a livre de combat one critic for example admitted that laye is an authentic poet but accused him of practicing art for art s sake and for not measuring up to the standards set by richard wright in black boy i read a part of this african s criticism on the contrary laye stubbornly closes his eyes to the most crucial realities especially those realities that one has always been careful not to reveal to the general public this guinean my compatriot hasn t he ever seen anything except a peaceful beautiful motherly africa is it possible that never once did he witness the tiniest little infraction by the colonial administration perhaps it did not occur to this critic that richard wright and camara laye were two distinct personalities each writing his autobiography according to his individual talent and his personal experiences despite the difference in their approach there is little doubt that black boy and the dark child were motivated by similar aspirations wright who exerted marked influence on mongo beti of cameroon sembene ousmane of senegal and other african novelists would surely have en dorsed camara laye s statement our deepest and most sensitive characteristics are passion for independence and equality to justify this right to independence and equality the negro african novelist has used a wide variety of tactics he has written subjectively objectively ironically bitterly sympathetically in protest or in defense he has written autobiographical novels such as the dark child climbie or down second avenue he has written tales of the bush such as maran s batouala or tutuola s palm wine drinkard stories of miners in johannesburg or a striking railway worker in senegal tales of the teeming urban centers such as ekwensi s people of the city achebe s no longer at ease or beti s ville cruelle cruel city he s written legends historical novels tales of the transplanted african and political novels such as peter abrahams a wreath for udomo and william conton s the african this approach has made his works more readable has carried his message to different kinds of readers and has emphasized the human qualities of his people who for example could fail to be touched by camara laye s poetic tribute to his mother i d like to quote from this not just because i think it s beautiful but because in the english translation this dedication has been cut in half femme noire femme africaine toi ma mere je pense a toi o daman ma mere toi qui me portas sur le dos toi qui m allaitais toi qui gouvernas mes premiers pas toi qui la premiere m ou vris les yeux aux prodigis de la terre je pense a toi femme des champs femme des rivieres femme du grand fleuve toi ma mere je je pense a toi all of that is deleted in the english translation and then the last little sentence femme noire femme africaine toi ma mere merci merci pour tout ce que tu fis pour moi ton fils si loin si pres de toi black woman african woman oh you my mother thank you thank you for all that you did for me your son so far and yet so near to you such is the dedication but the novel ends with the hero on a plane headed for paris to continue his education this is the conflict between the old and the new between tradition and innovation that underlies most of the negro african novels basically it began with the arrival of the european in one of maran s stories bokorro the python asks moumeu the crocodile what s a white man a white man is a man who is not black moumeu replies and then adds but the white man knows how to handle the lightning our authors found that the white man had brought education and exploitation hospitals and haughtiness christianity and colonial ism money and misery knowledge but not wisdom progress but not partnership the african wanted the progress but he also wanted to retain the more human aspects of his own culture in the words of ezekiel mphahlele the south african exile i admire the white man s achievements his mind that plans tall buildings powerful machinery i used to want to justify myself and my own kind to the white man i later discovered that it wasn t worth it it was to myself and to my kind i needed to justify myself i think now that the white man has no right to tell me how to order my life as a social being or order it for me he may teach me how to make a shirt or how to read and to write but my forebears and i could teach him a thing or two if only he would listen and allow himself time to feel africa is no more for the white man who comes here to teach and to control her human material forces and not to learn incidentally my friend mphahlele is a very ardent critic of negritude and i point out to him the negritude in this particular passage to his dismay this kind of passage indicating partial but by no means total rejection of european values inspires janheinz jahn to write in muntu the africans could become black europeans if they wished but they do not want to do so as their representatives unanimously insist nor do they wish to preserve their inherited culture in all its details but they do want to preserve its basic conception of which they have become conscious in their contact with other cultures our novelists reject among other things the white man s greed his arrogance his forced labor segregated churches his hypocrisy his injustice a surprising number of characters in these novels are in prison often without sufficient justification batouala spends two weeks in jail simply because the commandant took the word of an unscrupulous interpreter you remember the scene batouala was the village chieftain and his people hadn t brought in enough rubber and so the commander speaking through an interpreter of course chided batouala and told him he d have to do better next time the interpreter was as i said unscrupulous and he proceeded to tell batouala the commander says that you ve got to bring him so many chickens and some cattle and bring me your brother s young sister i m going to marry her well batouala who understood a little french said the commander didn t say that what s he saying the commander asked oh he called you a nasty name the interpreter said and so batouala went to jail but that s the way the interpreters worked back then in the days of colonialism in coeur d aryenne the heart of an aryan by jean malonga of congo brazzaville yoka is in carcerated because a european wants to seduce his wife another african in the same novel is imprisoned because a white girl visited his home dadie s climbie is arrested on suspicion of being a trouble maker oyono s toundi in une vie de boy is jailed because he knows that madame is having an affair with moreau the prison warden even meka the law abiding african of le vieux negre et la medaille also by oyono of the cameroon spends a night in jail because he drank just a little bit too much and fell asleep just a few hours after he had been decorated by the french udomo is arrested for publishing an incendiary article called a call to the people rise and be free likewise two characters in con ton s the african are imprisoned for political reasons a girl in people of the city is jailed for three months on suspicion of stealing a piece of cloth the hero of achebe s no longer at ease is arrested for accepting a bribe down mphahlele s second avenue south africans are incarcerated for brewing or drinking beer in view of the frequency with which the prison appears and reappears in these novels one would almost be tempted to consider it the symbol of colonialism but a host of other aspects more of them far less gruesome completes the picture we learn in these pages what the africans eat and how they dress we see them at work and at play maran achebe and beti describe their games and wrestling matches we see them at the islamic school in cheikh hamidou kane s uaventure ambigue and we see them at the french school with ake loba camara laye or bernard dadie at the english school with conton at a school in south africa with mphahlele several novelists describe their dances in the novels in fact we follow the african from birth to burial stopping en route to learn about age groups griots totems dancing bride price courtship and marriage listening to their venerable elders regret the traditions of the past and to their young men debate the problems of the day achebe tells us about an osu a person dedicated to a god a thing set apart a taboo forever and his children after him he can neither marry nor be married by the freeborn onuora nzekwu s hero in wand of noble wood cannot marry the girl who is under the curse of the iyi ocha camara laye s father learned the future from a little black snake his mother also had strange powers one day she was asked to help a man whose horse refused to get up laye writes when we arrived at the pasture we saw the horse he was lying in the grass gazing at us unconcernedly his owner tried again to make him get up and spoke to him in honeyed tones but the horse remained deaf to all entreaties his master raised a hand to strike him don t strike him said my mother it won t do any good she went up to the horse and lifting her own hand declared solemnly if it is true that from the day of my birth i had knowledge of no man until the day of my marriage and if it is true that from the day of my marriage i ve had knowledge of no man other than my husband if these things be true then i command you stand up we all saw the horse get up and follow his master quietly away i have told in very simple words and in very exact words what i saw then with my own eyes and to my mind it is unbelievable but the event was just as i described it the horse got up without any further delay and followed his master from thomas mofola south africa bernard dadie ivory coast birago diop senegal ousmane soce diop senegal jean malonga congo brazzaville and others we learn of the africans legends some of which are built around historical characters such as chaka others around places such as the old empire of ghana even more important for an understanding of the african life than these picturesque details and episodes are the many examples of what has been called la sagesse africaine african wisdom one finds this wisdom first expressed in various proverbs original in their imagery although universal in their appeal from rene maran for example you can make children but you can t make their character stay alive is the first law of wisdom you don t hunt a lion and an antelope in the same way from birago diop one never knows how useful the backside is until one has to sit down give your love to a woman but not your trust the hyena who wants to eat his offspring finds that they smell like a goat from ousmane soce diop in a country where people dance on one foot the visitor must also dance on one foot from sembene ousmane money has not roots but it grows in the heart who knows the value of a nut unless it s broken from chinua achebe a man who lives on the banks of the niger does not wash his hands with spittle anger against a brother is felt in the flesh not in the bone and from mongo beti of the cameroon what is woman a stately palm tree and anyone can climb it who has a belt these proverbs are realistic often a bit cynical sometimes poetic and always impregnated with good hard common sense a second source of african wisdom in these novels is found in the black man s ability to adjust to the difficult conditions under which he lives his very survival is evidence of this ability we believe with rene maran that the first law of wisdom is to stay alive the man or animal who cannot adapt is destined to disappear but the african is destined to live wisdom also requires man not only to adapt to life but also to try to improve that life for himself or for his children or for his children s children to make an adjustment to life one tactic used by the africans is their humor irony it s healthy to be able to laugh occasionally to laugh at oneself there are countless examples in the novels of seeing the comic side of an unfunny situation bernard dadie s negre a paris visits a church in the french capital he sees statues of saints along the wall and not one black one among them i repeat he says we have no right to paradise apparently we must frighten st peter an awful lot and i guess he sends us down in the other direction because of the color of our skin a discussion of the europeans shortcomings ends when batouala s father recommends a rabelaisian solution he says we will do better to grumble less about the whites and to drink more you know just as well as i do that except for the bed pernod is the only important invention by the europeans the hero of oyono s chemin d europe the road to europe sets himself up in business as a guide to tourists and stages all kinds of fantastic shows for travellers who come to africa looking for exoticism he sees to it that they photograph the pigmy the monkey who is balancing on a branch the boa constrictor puffed up after eating and the hippopotamus scampering along the edge of the river all of the so called formidable extraordinary sensational scenes and he says my compatriots and i improvised a little rite that delighted our explorers to such an extent that we could see them showing their film at the next cinematographic festival and being crowned africanists the same irony enables chinua achebe to end things fall apart with the district commissioner who stirred up all kinds of trouble musing over the book that he plans to write said title to be the pacification of the primitive tribes of the lower niger perhaps the crowning expression of african irony is camara laye s le regard du roi the radiance of the king in which european and african values are portrayed in an entirely new light clarence the european exiled in black africa must divest himself of his preconceived ideas of morality and justice and stand naked as a child before being received in the radiance of the king the important and varied role played by laughter in african life is recognized by most of the novelists several writers maran conton dadie describe it incidentally you ll find in richard wright s black_power a very interesting passage on the laughter of kwame nkrumah ake loba analyzes the african laugh as follows the african laughs when he s melancholy just as he dances when he s sad laughter also serves him as a response to the stranger who is curious to find out about his customs he laughs to delude his interlocutor or to be evasive in a word he laughs when he s happy or when he s angry or when he s unlucky but all these laughters don t have the same meaning since laughter is a very eloquent vocabulary generally the african laughs to mislead the person to whom he is speaking he laughs to make the other man believe he s not very observant and meanwhile the african is looking over very carefully studying very carefully the person who is trying to interrogate him he dissects the hearts he turns them over and over and then he becomes shut up in his own silence just as if he were ignorant of everything african laughter seen in this light is therefore a manifestation of african wisdom a means of keeping one s equilibrium come what may but there s yet another indication of african wisdom in these novels the determination to improve one s existence the most obvious evidence of this is the zeal for education an area in which the african is less reluctant to accept european values although not without modification the struggle for an education fills many pages of these novels the dark child climbie kocoumbo uaventure ambigue the african in the african william conton summarizes a letter with which his father starts him out on his career as a student then my father went on to remind me that i had now started to climb a palm tree which was high and difficult to climb that many were watching my progress and much ripe fruit was awaiting me on the successful completion of my climb he ended with a warning that if i failed to reach the top those watching me both living and dead would curse me for failing them on the other hand if i reached the top in order simply to gorge myself with fruit i would surely become sick and fall to the ground and die but if i returned to my people to share with them the fruit of my labors then all would sing my praise and thank me and honor those who had brought me to life the new schooling almost always contained painful separation as the youngsters left home for dakar conakry ougadougou paris or london it also meant creaking with the old traditions nowhere in the novels is this more poignantly expressed than in l aventure ambigu'e la grand royale detests the foreign school but nonetheless she insists that her nephew and other africans enroll there she explains we ve got to go to the europeans and learn from them how to conquer without being right moreover the battle isn t over yet the new school is the new form of war fare that is being waged against us the school in which i would place our children will kill in them what today we love and rightly conserve with care perhaps the very memory of us will die in them when they return from the school there may be those who will not recognize us what i am proposing says this princess is that we should agree to die in our children s heart and that the foreigners who have defeated us should fill the place which we shall have left free in explaining this she uses the analogy of the fields what do we do just before the rainy season we love our fields but still we plow them up we set fire to them if our children are going to get along in life we ve got to be willing to lose them for a while at least until they learn the ways of the european and are able to make the necessary adjustment likewise boubou hama in his autobiography stresses the ordeal of separation today thanks to the education which led him to the ecole william ponty in senegal and to a distinguished career he s president of niger s national assembly in addition as an untiring student of african culture he has merged the best of two worlds into an admirable synthesis occasionally a novelist questions the applicability of the curriculum or the competence of certain teachers or the low level of certain education in institutions it s fantastic how illusory what we study in college is says mongo beti on transferring from his school in ivory coast to france ake loba s hero kocoumbo finds himself terribly handicapped and ill prepared to keep pace with his european classmates who are years younger than he on the other hand there s a considerable amount of healthy self criticism in the novels ake loba chides those who are more diligent in frequenting cafes than in attending their classes camara laye s uncle complains about all the students who look down on technical school they ve always thought about a career of paper scratching is that the kind of career that you want a career where you will forever be thirteen to the dozen and ousmane soce diop who s now senegal s ambassador to this country makes a similar observation we the senegalese the urban senegalese we have a prejudice against manual trades there is some progress and some people nowadays are willing to become bricklayers or carpenters and yet this prejudice still exists and some young men would rather live as parasites than to have to work with their hands and he adds a country which does not want to work and which is satisfied with luxury and pleasure is headed for failure in the great struggle for life the hero of bernard dadie s climbie is even more explicit he spends a summer vacation on his uncle s farm and learns these facts of african life at the very beginning we started out wrong but was it really our fault with the european presence the jobs as clerks began more deserving in the eyes of the people who didn t understand that you could leave school without being a clerk either in the administration or in business or in any case always by the side of the european and we all thought that way the european was the master everything depended on him taxis rain and good weather as well and then the uncle goes on to relate the difficulties he had in making the plantation produce and adds finally work and after work independence my child self reliance should be the motto of your generation and you should also run away from the man who doesn t like to work thus our authors stress the importance of developing technical and commercial skills if africa is to attain some degree of economic independence the ill fated hero of sembene ousmane s o pays mon beau peuple attempts a farmers cooperative to start his country on the way to industrialization udomo signs an agreement with the apostles of apartheid even when this means sacrificing the life of his fellow revolutionary and long time friend corruption and conspicuous consumption on the part of public officials are decried by the nigerian achebe while the senegalese abdoulaye sadji now dead criticizes the women of his country for their excessive expenditures on trinkets now that political independence has been achieved by most of these countries the need for a viable economy becomes the no problem and we may well expect to see it figure even more prominently in future novels by africans as their novelists catch up with their economists they will appreciate the urgency of intra and inter continental cooperation in a remarkable passage udomo reduces his fundamental problems to three listen selina he says to the market woman who helped him to become the father of his country i ll tell you what i m after our country has three enemies or rather had three enemies i ve turned one of them into an ally now but let s say there are three i know you can guess one but can you guess the other two no don t bother the first is the white man then there is poverty and then there is the past these are the three enemies this triple challenge will continue to confront the african novelist tomorrow for the alleviation of poverty much depends on the sincerity and perspicacity of the europeans cooperation but the decision as to what should be retained and what should be rejected from the past now rests squarely on african shoulders in all likelihood a determined attempt will be made to eradicate tribal divisions and other obstacles to the realization of african unity which is probably the basic tenet of contemporary african ideology judging from recent examples in african fiction neither christianity nor communism seems likely to become a predominant force by and large our novelists viewing the european representative of christianity as an ally of colonialism have tended to treat it with hostility or indifference african wisdom will no doubt perceive the less debatable ties between communism and a more brutal a more tenacious colonialism at the moment there have been few manifestations of that phenomenon in african life to keep his job in a paris factory and to please his european girlfriend kocoumbo joins the party but he never warms up to its doctrine and he leaves the party after his girlfriend dies summing up we may say that our novelists though relatively few in number and hampered by all kinds of obstacles have attempted to interpret varied aspects of an extremely complex reality with little encouragement a goncourt prize in and several minor awards down through the years they have persevered in a vital but thankless task that of portraying the african s problems aspirations and humanity to the world some of their works have been mediocre others would reflect credit on any literature until recently few of their volumes had been translated even today almost none of these writers can depend on the income from his novels for a livelihood ousmane soce diop birago diop oyono and camara laye are in the diplomatic service malonga achebe and ekwensi have been working for the radio quenum of dahomey mongo beti and conton are school teachers dadie is directeur des beaux arts cheikh hamidou kane is with unicef peter abrahams living and writing in exile in the west indies is the outstanding exception the danger is that the more remunerative positions now available in the emergent african states may prevent them from continuing their literary careers and this paradoxically at a time when there is a ready market for their manuscripts moreover the new africa will need them to describe its new reality collectively despite a fumbling effort here and there they have the experience the talent the imagination and the objectivity the material for a masterpiece is at their fingertips a continent in transition with a new prestige and new responsibilities a world increasingly conscious of its interdependence human relations between african and african between european and african the inevitable struggle against poverty illiteracy and disease the equally inevitable struggle for human rights in south africa and other multiracial areas the quest for african unity the promise of a rich harvest in african life and african letters may or may not be fulfilled for much work remains to be done but on the whole these forerunners have cleared the land they have planted wisely and well they have left their younger brothers grounds for optimism a place in the sun a heritage of hope 11323 100 s
