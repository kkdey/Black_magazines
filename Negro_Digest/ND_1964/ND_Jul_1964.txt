recently i was asked to be a part of a tv panel on the subject should one vote for political candidates who profess no religion in a prebroadcast discussion of the topic at home my children rendered their verdict that one should vote for political candidates with no religion only if they happened to be the best qualified candidates it seemed perfectly obvious to us that our elected leaders should be those who best represent the total interests of all their constituents certainly a candidates religion is to be considered as one aspect of the data about him as long as one remembers that this aspect is only one part of the data it seems to me that one should approach in a similar fashion the question would i want my daughter to marry a negro the same answer should be given by white parents to this question as should be expected from negro parents to a similar question would you want your daughter or son to marry a white boy or girl the answer to both questions if one really has the happiness and welfare of ones child at stake should be only if he or she will make the best husband or wife among the available choices this discussion is not an academic one for me i have one son age  and daughters ages    and  our family is an unusually happy and closelyknit one whoever marries one of four children is in a sense going to be marrying our family whether he likes it or not children in the united states do not always or even usually select mates according to their familys desires but i do not believe that any of our children will be permanently and happily married except to someone who in a reasonable way has the approval of i the other four children the choice of their friends therefore is a matter of continuing family interest furthermore the time of dating and courtship is not far away and in all likelihood will occur partially at raciallyintegrated colleges and universities the philosophy i and ideals of our family will be the primary influence we shall have upon our childrens actions in those crucial years therefore i repeat the question asked in this article is not academic it is a matter of great personal importance to every member of our family more than that however it is a matter of religious and social importance to people everywhere there are many religiously and socially liberal people both black and white who admit privately that integration and its foundation stone the belief in the brotherhood of manwill inevitably lead to the possibility of more racial intermarriages but they ask why disturb the progress being made in other areas of racial relations succeeding generations will not find intermarriage either a social or an emotional problem each individual will be accepted for his own personal worth in marriage and in all other areas without reference to color still others both black and white insist that what the negro wants is an environment that will produce freedom of movement and occupational educational and economic opportunities given this environment he will not either desire or seek intermarriage i cannot agree with either of these opinions although i am more in sympathy with the former segregationists in my judgment are entirely correct in contending that integration will inevitably lead to more racial intermarriage although i believe there may well be less sexual exploitation of the negro race and less illegitimacy quite likely negro young people may come to respect themselves more and act accordingly than has sometimes been possible in the past there will be no real and permanent equality until we quit thinking in terms of skin color if people really are equal why should the color of ones skin make a difference in marriage i can find no satisfying scientific or religious reasonsonly social and economic prejudices since social customs change slowly except under revolutionary conditions it is highly important that we get used to ideas which normally have to precede actions furthermore it is not only a matter of what the negro wants if the equality doctrine is valid then why should white boys and girls be denied the privilege of marrying some negroes who may have more to offer as marriage partners than some white boys and girls i am quite certain that some negro parents would not want their children to marry my children and viceversa even if other social prejudices in our environment were eliminated but where negro and white families do find compatibility there is no logical reason why their offspring should not marry across racial lines if all men really are brothers what i am now saying to the general public i have been preaching directly and indirectly for over  years if i am not to be guilty of that ancient religious custom of giving lip service to one set of doc trines while actually living by another then i must not now reverse myself when the basic issues about equality brotherhood and love are on the verge of becoming personal in a way they have not yet been i must not encourage other people to do what i am unwilling to do myself fortunately however although as a native southerner i was reared in an environment actively opposed to the thesis of this article i find no difficulty in advocating intermarriage for my children nor will this article come as a shock to them they have been taught to discuss all issues openly and fully in an attempt to discover what is true and right for each particular situation they are being taught the pros and cons on both interracial and interreligious marriages and they know their mother and father love them and will love their mates whether those choices be white negro catholic jew atheist protestant hindu rich poor or previously married one should be able to work for ones convictions and to oppose bigotry effectively and courageously without ignoring the need for understanding of those whose opinions and actions differ from ours some people of this present age will never be able to face the problems presented by intermarriage our children however would think of a racial intermarriage except for present social complica tions as they would think of any other marriage they have been trained for the world of tomorrow? where men will learn to live together as brothers or else live under authoritarianism or not at all our youngest daughters middle name is lakshmi the name of a hindu goddess deliberately chosen to remind her and her generation that the world no longer can afford racial religious and national prejudices several years ago i served three years as the minister of a racially integrated congregational church in new york state one of our young people there came from a fine religious family which was constantly growing in its view« points recently this girl an attractive brilliant and talented graduate of an outstanding eastern college for women married a struggling ministerial student with an oriental heritage this was not surprising to my wife and me nor was it surprising to see the understanding way the girls parents leaders in their community reacted to the marriage a small town new york girl does not ordinarily marry an oriental boy especially when such a gifted girl could go on to further education and a promising career of her own but the girls marriage and the reaction of her family were logical results of her familys depth and her own training her church had prepared the way with its own inclusiveness of all races and of widelyvarying opinions several families including ours in that church used a dental clinic where white technicians worked for negro dentists with an apparent acceptance of the situation as entirely normal and right nevertheless there are always dangers in any marriage outside the group of ones peers religiously racially culturally nationally and financially pioneers in changing established social customs always pay a pricesometimes an exorbitant onefor their defiance of the status quo all priests rabbis and ministers to the best of my knowledge urge caution in such marriages sometimes partly out of bigotry but usually out of primary concern for the young people involved all of us are somewhat suspicious of and prejudiced against what is unfamiliar to us at best permanent and happy marriages are hard to come by as is evii  denced in the high divorce rate and the large number of continuing but loveless and problembesieged homes even if young people themselves are able to surmount the barriers of picking mates from different backgrounds their idealism and daring is not always shared by their families parents do not have the advantage of the sexual aspect of love in judging their childrens mates and adjusting to them and as far as sex is concerned there is no guarantee that permanent satisfying sexual adjustments will be made in interracial marriages more so than in other more ordinary marriages many young people discover after marriage that the sexual compatibility they supposed they had is not the reality they had expected either through their rosecolored idealism or their possible premarital sexual relationships the problems of sexual adjustment can be serious indeed with the added complications of intolerant relatives in particular and society in general and the day will inevitably come when one has to face up to the psychological scars and other social punishments ahead for the children of intermarriageschildren never fully accepted in either negro or white circles i would like to urge my children also to be aware of possible confused values within themselves when i was a divinity school student in the early s i occasionally heard of some white girl who had granted small sexual favors to negro boysfavors which she would not have granted to white boys it is not the purpose of this article to compare present day sexual behavior of young people with that of my generation either favorably or unfavorably but whatever ones standards are and whether one is black or white those standards should not be lowered in one area in order to demonstrate ones ideals in another area this too is discrimination for example our family did not go as patients to the abovementioned dentists because they were negro we went because we believed that they were the best available dentists in the area if we had thought available white dentists did superior work we would have used them no matter who said we were prejudiced so i will be disappointed if my children date andor marry negroes merely because they are negro i also hope they will seek to find suitable dates andor marriage partners among young people most like themselves religiously culturally economically nationally and racially but if our children and circumstances decide otherwise my wife and i hereby pledge love and understanding to them their mates their inlaws their friends and our grandchildren it is going to be easier in the world of tomorrow for racial intermarriages to succeed but easy or not should our children decide to marry interracially we will be proud of them for their contribution to social conditions that must come in time 
life among white liberals 
these fierce days j nr v of combat between  ii  negroes and segregationiss t° itle at tention is given to questionable white liberals while many liberals are truly on the level there are some who deserve closer scrutiny for it is imperative that  negroes learn how to recognize and weed out liberal impostors just as it is important that genuine white liberals know how to behave when in the company of negroes understand me i have nothing whatever against white liberals it is only that they do not know quite how to stay in their proper places of course some of my best friends are liberals and i have watched them at close range from coast to coast while i found particularly useful the usual approaches of social anthropologists touring primitive tribes and similar aggregations i do not intend to subject the reader to the rigors of scientific anthropology suffice it to say then that while white liberals proved to be a rather mongrel breed they did fall into discernible categories ii any wealth of data poses the problem of just where to begin but let us start quite arbitrarily with the roving inquirers this species appears to be motivated more by a nosy streak an insatiable curiosity about the negro race than by any true devotion they consist of two distinct divisions those who know more about the negro than the negro knows about himself and those who only recently discovered that negroes actually exist one special faction of the negro encylopedists or the iknowyounegroes variety is the hep cat liberal or the groovy strain these amateur anthropologists delight in conversing with negroes in slangjive and are benignly pathetic in their endeavors to dance and twist and monkey in the manner typical of the negro masses being mainly middle class however they are much too inhibited to master the easy grace of the majority of negroes who are not middle class but this does not prevent the groovy liberal from becoming when in the company of negroes quite allnegro or alltoonegro the moment in fact that they hear the sound of a jazz note or blues tune or the gospel wail of mahalia jackson they automatically close their eyes snap their fingers and stomp their feet in superficial ecstasy at the same time they overwork themselves in the effort to acculturate to negroes and expect too often that negroes are obliged to return the compliment then there is the knownothing type parading as innocents who knew not even that negroes were dissatisfied with secondclass citizenship until the outbreak of the sitin demonstrations other inquiring liberals aside from expecting you to know each and every negro who ten years or so ago chanced to lunch with them in hong kong or casablanca corner the first negro in sight and set him up as a walking opinion poll they expect onthespot answers to queries about negro thoughts and feelings on every subject imaginable from what negroes think about lady bird johnson down to whether negroes really like watermelon and chitterlings ill a contrary variety of the behindthescenes liberal is the twofaced or sneaky liberal who quickly liberates himself from obligations of liberalism in the face of white ostracism only recently i was entering my apartment building trailing some distance behind a middleaged white couple and their daughter the gentleman held the door somewhat unnecessarily for it required a very long moment until i rushed to reach the door in order to honor his exceeding courtesy i thanked him and decided to check my mailbox which was soon discerned to be empty and so i followed the threesome to the elevator unbeknown to my liberal doormans wife wouldnt open the door for anybody else what is this she joked seriouslyhumorously in contempt the gentleman noting my presence tried desperately to inform her of the same while coyly brushing off her remark later however when we were alighting together from the elevator the woman herself attempted to hold the door for me also belonging to the insincere variety is the surreptitious liberal known otherwise as the piggyback or parasitic liberal they are generally fulltime exponents of nonracial causes however noble but failing to attract significant numbers of whites to their movements set out to capture negro discontents as last ditch substitutes piggyback liberals are in other words what might be called liberalswithacause this brings us to another burdensome bunch many prominent nonetheless in the negros protest movement mind you i speak only of a minority faction the big brother division or the umpiring liberal who really seeks to control or constrain negro rebellion while feigning to incite it one species of this genus is the good will liberal who acts as a selfappointed ambassador between whites and negroes the good will liberal counsels negroeswhatever he may say to whitesagainst going  too fast and when once there is the faintest sign of progress in some sphere of race relations he breaks out in glowing glee tooting a gabriels horn of selfglorification only last year this tribe virtually took over the negros celebration of the centennial of the emancipation proclamation with much more intensity than the average negro displayed in all fairness however many were kind enough to invite negro leaders and preachers to sit on platforms during ceremonial programs and dedications to preside over closing benedictions and strut along in the chesty strides of cocksure parades many umpiring liberals predictably include scaredycat characters who operate often unconsciously on the ifyoucantlickemjoinem psychology functioning to dampen the negros discontent once when the first wave of college sitins was underway in the winter of  a negro student leader from alabama state college in montgomery stopped off on a tour at the university of chicagos ida noyes hall to tell of his experiences at one point in the questionandanswer period a white liberal classmate of mine stood up and asked if white students would be able to take part in a proposed regional confab why yes said the negro student after a long and thoughtful pause of course you can take part but we would ask you please not to take over the conference this remark brought laughter and applause from the other liberals present iv on the other end of the continuum mind you are the sincere but equally onerous the overly familiar liberal or as some call them the boon coons no sooner than boon coon liberals are accepted as associates they fall victim to an inclination to leap over the wall of mannerable social distance they display disarming frankness on subjects normally taboo in the present day however unfortunate that may be between the racial groups in this country the cruder type for instance delights in a repertoire of colored jokes more sophisticated varieties of familiar liberals to indicate that they are so little prejudiced that they could themselves be regarded as negroes may remark come on out to california with me you could use a tan this species of the justplainnegro variety have no qualms about knocking the slats out from under a negro friend in order to conspicuously let down their own hair but probably the most disturbing are liberals who overdo the first name bit too prematurely not only that they also usually shorten the first name to some threeletter variation while there is nothing wrong with this on the surface it does imply a pretentious relationship between white liberals and negroes which too seldom exists in fact let us behold a bolder subdivision of familiar liberalsthe partycrashing character these liberals may drop by unannounced for the first time in months leading a pack of friends and relatives from distant points to show off a pretended closeness to negro intellectuals sufficient to allow such random droppingin once in they are likely to saunter over to the refrigerator or bar and remark loud enough for their white companions to hear nate you mean you dont have any of my favorite beer or to their companions can i fix you a drink marge bill pete sue chuck     usually however they and their friends are hungrier than they are thirsty somewhat similar to the partycrashing liberal is the omnipresent strain who not only open your door with the rising sun but stay on so long that a negro host may choke back an urge to call the national guard robert kennedys marshals and the naacp to have the stayinner removed even excuses such as well ive got to go to a meeting now usually have no definite effect oh go right ahead never mind me the omnipresent liberal simply says i want to hear some ray charles anyhow ill just fix a sandwich and relax until you get back whereupon the negro host goes out to the nearest bar for the stiffest drink he can afford while faking away the hours necessary before returning to endure the unshakable guest the most likeable of all species of the boon coon liberal is the lovelorn variety lovelorn liberals can talk of little else but their inestimable love for negroes in general but the maid or the janitor in particular deprived of affection in the cold anonymity of their own white modern civilization they fall back on a compensatorytoo often phonyfondness for negro individuals others are simply bored and searching for distraction from routine such characters are intrigued by negroes mainly as objects of diversion and taboo quivering with guilt over the negros plight lovelorn liberals are given to masochistic rites they gather with similarly afflicted middleclass negroes to engage in marathon testimonials selfrighteously confessing to bygone prejudices now turned to love these guiltridden liberals place on negro companions the burden of supplying free a sort of interracial psychiatric couch during liquor and discussion one liberal broke down bawling in guilt and remorse but no sooner than he was in the presence of whites he became as dryeyed as a desert cactus and appeared as though nothing had ever happened but despite such problems of hypocrisy as the foregoing i have concluded that the true failure of white liberals rests on their incapacity for effecting negro equality they seem unable to do much more than negroes to correct the racial situation therefore the challenge facing white liberals especially in the years ahead will be the necessity for social dexterity in order to keep pace with new standards or changing requirements of liberal behavior
the in the civil_rights crisis
the th anniversary of the emancipation proclamation was celebrated in a most unusual way this momentous event in mans tortuous struggle for freedom and justice was not marked by a worlds fair and monuments of steel and concrete symbolizing mans rededication to the attainment of the ideals of justice and the preservation of democracy for all men in fact there were few formal ceremonies there was no dancing in the streetsno parades and no flamboyant patriotic speeches and certainly there were no rhetorical proclamations from politicians seeking reelection white america seemed curiously embarrassed by this centennial and sought to cloak its awkwardness with an uneasy silence negroes however chose to make  the year of confrontation rather than celebration it was in this year years after the emancipation proclamationthat negro americans insisted that the unfinished business of human freedom and dignity promised  years ago be delivered  a century of broken promises cynicism and cruelty culminated in an eruption of impatience anger and revulsion against continued hypocrisy in place of ceremonies there were sitins in place of the free spending at the fair there were selective buying campaigns in place of dancing in the streets there was the march on washington we must be free by  this goal was not fully realized during  ten years after the supreme court school desegregation decision less than  per cent of negro children attended desegregated public schools in southern states the majority of negro children probably over  per cent in northern and border states are still required to attend predominantly negroor de facto segregatedschools the stark facts are that the supreme court decision has been honored more through the evasion of tokenism has been ignored completely in those communities in which negroes do not take the initiative in obtaining even token compliance and the few if any cases of good faith compliance with courts decision to desegregate american public education the selfdefeating anachronism of white schools and negro schools remains a part of the vocabulary and way of life of americans the majority of american whites continue to resist the negros demands that he be included within the total fabric of american democracy in both the north and the south negroes are systematically discriminated against by labor unions and employers in their quest for jobs and economic security through an effective conspiracy of banking and real estate interests negroes are confined within deteriorating and dehumanizing residential ghettoes negro children are not only still required to attend segregated schoolsbut these schools are still educationally inferior they spawn functional illiterates by the hundreds of thousands and contribute to the perpetuation of the cycle of personal damage community pathology and group ineffectiveness these general and fundamental problems of economic residential and educational discrimination and deprivation which make victims of negroes throughout the nation are compounded by special burdens imposed by the southern states it is difficult for any reasonable person who has not been distorted by american racism to believe that in the seventh decade of the th century there are states in the united statesthe leader of the democratic worldwhere negroes are denied the elementary democratic right to register and to vote for those who are to represent them in the halls of government although a criminal conspiracy of state officials and others deny the negro the right to vote in these states he is still required indeed compelled to pay taxes he  must assume all of the responsibilities and obligations without the rights privileges and protections granted to white citizens this is a mockery of democracy this is selfdefeating cynicism this is tyranny the context within which this moral venom could exist includes an accepted pattern or rigid petty blind cruelty which demands that a fellow human being be denied ordinary courtesies in places of public accommodationsand that he be humiliated or assaulted if he seeks to enjoy conveniences which any white american can take for granted if he is able to pay for them the human degradation and tragedy inherent in this constricted view of mans responsibility to his fellow man is matched only by the tragic irony of otherwise intelligent sophisticated senators trained in our best universities and concerned with profound moral issues in our society when they are not defending a racist way of lifetrapped by the level of their constituents into making filibustering spectacles of themselves the racial crisis of  has been described by many words probably the most frequently used word was the word revolution this is a dramaticbut a misleading term revolution usually connotes the use of weapons or some violent or military approach to social and political change in addition the term revolution usually demands some basic changes in the economic social and political system the negros demands on his nation do not meet these requirements he is not seeking any fundamental or radical changes in the american economic political or social system he is merely asking to be brought within the existing system he is conservative he is accepting the american system he is identifying with the american ideology and is insisting that the american protestations of democracy be taken literally seriously and be inclusive of him if he is not included american protestations of democracy and moral leadership cannot be taken seriously by anyoneincluding americans if the negro succeeds he will help to strengthen america if the negro fails the fatal moral weakness behind the facades of american military and industrial power and verbal democratic posturings would be revealed before the world the year  therefore was a year of revulsiona year of confrontation of hypocrisy it was the year when the patience of the negro came to an end it marked the end of pretense and an increased crescendo of demonstrations and ultimate risks the negro went for broke he stated the issues of human dignity and human equality with such starkness that the american people and all of the people of the world were no longer able to misunderstand them it took  years before the american people could prepare themselves for an honest dialogue on the issue of racebefore negroes and whites could face the awesome respon sibility of honest communication between the races american racism like other forms of superstition was based upon the deep primitive passions pretenses and distortions which seek to protect and perpetuate ignorance in  the delusions rationalizations and wishful ideas of whites and negroes were torn away revealing terrifying truths of barbarity conflicts ambivalences and discrepancies between liberal words and irrational fears within the same person this was the year dogs fire hoses and electric cattle prods were used on human beings by other human beings this was the year when superior white men in the uniform of law enforcement officers had their feet on the throats of inferior negro women this was the year when medgar evers was shot in the back because he loved freedom enough to insist upon it this was the year when negro children were killed while in the church of god in the city of birmingham but this was also the year of james baldwin and a major breakthrough on the american conscience the drama of  reached its climax on august  when thousands and thousands of negroes and whites marched on washington to proclaim the paradox of continued faith in the ability of the american system of democratic government to provide the immediate remedy for their long standing grievances by their presence their discipline and their morale the leaders and participants asserted their faith that their goals could be obtained without major violence and bloodshed time will tell whether this was a realistic appraisal of the resilience and moral potential of our government or a childishly naive wishful thinking a significant clue as to which of these is correct might come from the actions of the senate of the united states on the civil  r i rights bill which is now before it the negro in america has demonstrated that the civil_rights struggle cannot be stopped short of its goals by white segregationists he has faced and accepted all of their subtle and flagrant forips of cruelty and has remained unafraid and stolidly insistent indeed each act of cruelty and barbarity seemed only to intensify the negroes willingness to make whatever sacrifices are demanded for total equality the significant fact  years after emancipationthe fact which should have destroyed a key stereotypeis that the negro was not afraid he has no weapons and therefore could not repeat the idiocy of seeking to obtain moral ends by the immoral means of killing his fellowman he has only the choice of insisting upon living with the full dignity of a human being or dying with dignity because of his insistence in waging his battle for freedom the american negro has only the weapons of courage the power of his personality and the moral and ethical validity of his cause there is however no guarantee that his demands for justice and full equality will prevail no one can yet say with certainty what are the  limits of human barbarity or how corrosive of the positives of the human spirit is the cancer of pervasive racism william faulkner in an anguished honest expression of his own frailty published an appeal to negroes in a national magazine around  or  not to push their demands for equality too far because they would then cause the whites of the south to mobilize for a counteroffensive and if this happened he faulkner would have to get his gun and go out in the streets of mississippi and shoot down niggers fortunately this spectacle of one of our nobel prize winners involved in this type of barbarity was not necessary before his death recently we have seen liberal whites in such northern communities as new york boston philadelphia and chicago organizing themselves to protect the sanctity of their neighborhood schools it might be of some comfort to note that these organizations in these northern communities insist that their activities are not to be interpreted as antinegro or as prosegregationists but one does not know how deep beneath the surface are the furies of irrational racist fears and hatreds this is a calculated risk which the negro must take if he dares to challenge the racial status quo his chances of escaping the fate of the jews in nazi germany may be good only because america does not have a tradition of ruthlessly efficient authoritarianism and continues to insist upon the verbalization of the democratic ideals the dangers to the fulfillment and consolidation of the goals of the civil_rights movement appear to this observer to be more insidious ones than those which are available to the racists or the segregationists if the promises and goals of this movement are to be achieved then certain problems will have to be faced and resolved what follows is merely the attempt of this observer to identify some of the more obvious and subtle problems with the hope that this might stimulate serious discussion among responsible white and negro civil_rights and civic leaders these observations are offered not in the spirit of carping criticism but with the desire to contribute to increased effectiveness and positive resolution of an urgent national and human problem the civil_rights demonstrations of the last few years which culminated with the aweinspiring august  march on washington were most powerful and dramatic methods of calling attention to the negros predicament in the united states these demonstrations were part of the world revolution against white supremacy colonialism and other forms of arbitrary and unjust use of power to subjugate or dehumanize human beings the american negroes desire for freedom and justice will and must continue until these goals are obtained but the momentum and dramatic impact of direct action nonviolent demonstrations will decrease these demonstrations appear to be more difficult to sustain psychologically than are military operations because they do not have the same pattern and total context of psychological reinforcement found in a sustained military operation the individuals involved in these demonstrations must also tend to the daytoday routine of living they must work and take care of their families these demonstrations are psychologically exhausting the more they are used the more they tend to become routinized and reach a point of diminishing returns in terms of impact and effect the positive value of these demonstrations can be conserved only if they are not permitted to become diffuse and unrelated to specific targets and goals and are engaged in for their own sake or as a form of emotional catharsis or blowing off steam it would be most unfortunate if these demonstrations became a form of bread and circuses which provide an outlet for negroes but did not deal with the basic social economic or political problems this would not only be a dissipation of precious human energy but would also be a cruel hoax in this regard one could look with suspicion on the tendency of some white political officials to join some of the more respectable demonstrations and the equally disturbing tendency of some negro leaders to embrace this type of surface but skillful neutralization of a protest movement another danger which threatens the future effectiveness of these demonstrations is the tendency to use them as vehicles for the projection of the egos and personal ambitions of local and wouldbe leaders of negroes these individuals who often do not have the responsibility for the effective functioning of a complex organization can assume postures of militancy and make flamboyant statements which appeal to the crowd without regard to the realities of implementation they need not concern themselves with such mundane things as planning strategy and followthrough it is enough that they have an arsenal of words and are adept at namecalling and are ruthless in their ability to ascribe nefarious motives to anyone who disagrees with them the most successful of these wild cat civil_rights leaders attempt to use the technique of demagogic intimidation of the more responsible civil_rights leaders to the extent that they are permitted to be successful they are serious threats to the effectiveness of the movement the potential anarchy of this situation is analogous to a military organization in which a corporal is permitted to intimidate or countermand the orders of a general if this type of disorganization and lack of discipline is permitted to develop and grow an important weapon in the civil_rights struggle will become a farce and unrelated to the resolution of the basic and serious racial problems serious thought must now be given to the problem of determining under what conditions certain techniques and demonstrations will be used this should be done not because these demonstrations will anger or alienate white friends this argument is unacceptable to  thinking because white friends who are not angered by the injustices but become angry at attempts to remedy them are rather peculiar and clearly useless friends furthermore that type of white friend and admitted enemies are more likely to be angered by appropriate and effective use of demonstrations rather than by inappropriate and ineffectual ones the student sitins freedomrides and bus boycotts were successful in the south because these methods dealt directly with desired objectives they were clear and focused and directly dramatized a specific injustice the selective buying campaign in philadelphia is an example of effective protest because rev leon sullivan and his associates organized it masterfully pinpointed his targets was able to sustain and follow through on his demands and was able to measure directly the degree of his success the following would seem to be reasonable criteria for determining whether a boycott is or is not an appropriate technique to be used  when it is directed against a product rather than a service  when the economic damage or inconvenience is clearly to be borne by the proprietor rather than by the boycotters  when the goals and demands are clear and obtainable  when the action can be sustained until the demands are met  when there is minimum inconvenience to persons who are not responsible for the injustice given these criteria serious consideration should be given to the use of the boycott technique in dealing with the problem of education there might be times when the boycott of schools is the most effective method of dramatizing and calling attention to longstanding educational deficiencies and illsbut this objective can be attained most effectively if the boycott threat is not abused the possibility of eroding the moral strength and power of the civil_rights movement is greatest if civil_rights leaders permit themselves to be caught in the trap and rigidity of militancy for its own sake given the fact that the negro in america does not have military economic and numerical power with which to wage his war for unqualified equality he must rely upon a cold calculating use of intellectual and moral power he cannot permit himself to be shackled to gestures postures slogans and oversimplifications he must be free to deal with the realities and he must be tough minded as he seeks every advantage in a war of maneuver and propaganda irrationalities emotionalism and rigidity in the name of civil_rights goals are no more acceptable than the irrationalities emotionalism and rigidity of racism the fight for racial justice is essentially the fight for the ascendancy of reason and logic over ignorance in man having said this candor requires one to say also that it is ironic to observe that more often than not it is the more irrational and emotional appeals and demands which are responded to positively by those in control of political power and educational institutions it raises a serious question on the value of a trained and disciplined mind when one is forced to observe that logical and reasoned arguments for social justice are so frequently ignored while the threats of the demagogue are responded to should our colleges and universities seek to become relevant to the realities of social change by giving courses in the theory and practice of demagoguery the civil_rights crisis in america has now itself reached a stage of crisis the passage of a meaningful civil_rights bill by the united states senate is mandatory the symbolic significance over and above the practical and realistic imperatives for the passage of this bill without emasculating amendments is indicated by the catastrophic despair and frustrations which will erupt in the negro people if this bill can be killed by a small cynical group of senators this irrationality can elicit terrifying irrationalities in the negro people but the crisis in the negros demands for full equality as american citizens involves the additional dimension of the need for comprehensive planning and strategy if these goals are to be obtained actually rather than merely symbolically this would seem to be true even with the passage of a strong civil_rights bill the negro organizations and groups are now required to address themselves to the difficult task of planning and implementing a comprehensive and coordinated strategy this strategy to be efficient and successful must involve the creation of effective coordinating machinery which has the responsibility of making decisions on specific objectives delegating responsibility to appropriate groups and agencies and evaluating performance and effects of action and if need be exerting discipline or exercising some controls over inefficient uneconomic or ineffectual activities certainly a comprehensive and coordinated plan and strategy must necessarily include decisions concerning the priorities and the energies to be expended and the methods to be used in eliminating racial discrimination and segregation in the key areas of  education  employment  housing  voting and citizen rights and responsibilities  public accommodation a general appraisal of the present level of civil_rights activities would seem to suggest that it could be made even more effective through systematic programs for the gathering of information and intelligence public education and evaluation of effectiveness of techniques and programs it is increasingly clear that the civil_rights movement has received the maximum support that one could reasonably expect from the federal courts obviously there will be cases brought before these courts in the future but the basic legal decisions of these courts clearly establish the fact that race is not a relevant criteria in the enjoyment of the rights of american citizens it might be necessary however for the negro to explore and utilize the technique of using taxpayers suits to prevent southern states from using public funds to perpetuate directly or indirectly any form of racial discrimination and segregation the executive branch of the federal government within the past three years seems clearly to understand the gravity of the racial crisis in america there is little doubt that president lyndon b johnson shares completely the goals of the late president kennedy and has been using his extraordinary political skill and the power of his office in seeking rational and democratic resolution of these issues it is imperative however that negro and white civil_rights groups continue their vigilance in seeing that anyone who occupies this high office in the future continue this pattern more effective ways must still be found to influence the legislative branch of our federal and state governments so that they are more sensitive and responsive to the moral practical political and international imperatives of this issue a summary of the positives and the negatives in the present civil_rights crisis would seem to highlight the following as clear gains within the past two years religious groups have become more seriously involved in action geared toward the elimination of racism in our society the activities of the national council of the churches of christ in america and the intensified activities of the catholic church together with the clear commitment of the organized jewish groups have contributed significantly to the awakening of the dormant conscience of the american people there is also evidence that business and industry are now beginning to understand more clearly that it is not to the interest of the capitalist system to have onetenth of our nation underemployed and restricted from the consumer market in spite of the moral and ethical aspects of the civil_rights struggle the factor of the artificial reduction of the gross national product which inevitably results from racial discrimination in america may turn out to be the most pivotal determinant of change the vitality and growth potential of our economy may well depend upon the capacity to change old patterns of attitudes and behavior and make it possible to exploit constructively an underdeveloped area within our own nation one is reminded of gunnar myrdals recent observation that at this period in history practical economic imperatives and american idealism have converged on the minus side one still is confronted with the fact that american labor unions reflect for the most part a racial rigidity which is inimical to the national interest and of course is detrimental to the interests of organized labor this paradoxthis blindnesscan only be selfdestructive therein probably lies the hope for change continuing evidence of the pervasive moral apathy and political cynicism in the american mass culture must also be counted as a most significant negative in appraising the possibilities of serious success of the civil_rights struggle if the practical imperatives for constructive change were to be controlled by the chance and possibilities of profound moral conversion in the american people there might be cause for pessimism pragmatism rather than ethical and idealistic insights might be our only basis for hope in summing up it is possible that we cannot answer the question posed in the title of this paper with any degree of certainty whatever answer is offered might reflect only the wishes or the cynicism of the particular observer there seems to be no clear guarantees of unalloyed success of the civil_rights movement on the other hand it would be irresponsible to assert the certainty of failure or the perpetuation of hypocritical tokenism as the accommodation to the lack of any basic commitment to freedom and justice to this observer this is neither a time for hope nor for despair rather this is the time for realistic difficult and if necessary painful reappraisal planning and effective action negroes and whites who are deeply concerned about the future of mankind the future of our nation and the significance of the democratic idea must now redouble their efforts to be effective we now know that there is really no easy road to the attainment of social justice this is a tortuous and taxing process we cannot now settle for the form without the substance we cannot settle for the slogans without the actual demonstration of change to do so would reveal the moral emptiness which is the antithesis of social health and national vitality 
zambias prime minister
the result of orderly elections on january  missioneducated kenneth kaunda is destined before the end central african his united naof the year to join the list of african heads of state as prime minister of northern rhodesia which on december  shared in the demise of the tenyearold federation with tional independence party successful in capturing control of the legislature assembly kaunda and his government now assume many of the responsibilities of governing the soontobe independent nation though for the present britain will retain control of external affairs independence is scheduled for some time during  the yearold kaunda has been the driving power behind the march toward independence in northern rhodesia which he prefers to call zambia an intellectual and a firm believer in the power of nonviolence he possesses an eloquence of word that fascinates his african listeners he was born in the remote lubwa region where northern rhodesia borders nyasaland and tanganyika his father david one of those splendid nyasa tribesmen whose restless energy makes them the workers as well as the wanderers of central africa had come from nyasaland to serve as an evangelist for the church of scotlands mission in lubwa his mother a devoted servant of the church brought up her two sons and two daughters in what to her was a foreign land serving meanwhile as matron of the girls boarding school kenneth the bright boy of the mission school went away for further training as a teacher returned at the age of  to become headmaster of the boys boarding school at lubwa had he stayed on there miles from the industrial life of the countryit is unlikely that he would have made the transition from teaching to politics but in  he became a welfare assistant at the nchanga mine in the copper belt a move that marked a turning point for both kaunda and zambia in that year he says he experienced the full shock of industrialism the color bar and racial prejudice for the first time he found himself treated not as a person heard himself referred to as a kaffir a munt kaunda then turned trader buying and selling old clothes cycling hundreds of miles in the remote areas around his old lubwa home at the same time he was serving as an active propagandist for the african national congress becoming national secretary in  even while he was fervently advocating freedom for zambia he was studying gandhis tactics in india which fascinated him as pointing the way to freedom without bloodshed ironically the basis for the prison sentence imposed on him in  was his reading of seditious booksamong them an indian book about gandhi for all his gentle nonviolent approach kaunda has since  been very sure where he is going in politics he split with his friend harry nkumbula because the african national congress party seemed to him to be compromising with the europeans then he formed his own united national independence party dedicated to a policy of one man one vote and to what kaunda calls a colorblind society as he told a public meeting sponsored by his party at kitwe in may  we assure the nonafricans of their rightful place in this country by way of adopting a bill of rights we favor no racist policy and no oppression of one race by another will be tolerated we believe there is enough room in northern rhodesia for all people who wish to make this their home there is room for both private industries and partly controlled industries the only thing we shall ask of private industry is to feed the profits back into northern rhodesia to help develop more industry furthermore if we are going to build a healthy nation it is important to elevate the living standard of rural africans if kaunda harbored hatred in his heart during the years of his work for independence for zambia it was for the central african federation as governed by sir roy welensky for him as for many other africans the very term federation signified a trick devised by the white manin this case britain to perpetuate his rule in central africa when i talked with kaunda in his london hotel room on his visit to britain something over a year ago i found him not overtalkative at first but as we conversed he relaxed and showed himself to be a man whose smile flashed instantly when a word or idea struck him pleasantly he proved quick to reply in general conversation but mild withal i sensed why both friend and enemy refer to him as kenneth the hurt he suffered when he first encountered discrimination and prejudice in the copper country went deep but it apparently did not leave him with resentment in heart or mind obviously he looks on every human being as a person be he black or white in our conversation it became apparent that kaunda was a man of deep purpose convinced that his nonviolent methods would succeed he acknowledged that in the past he had contravened the law by calling unlawful assemblies like other african nationalists he is proud of his record as a prison graduate now that responsibility has come to kenneth kaunda perhaps sooner than he had expected when he was leading the fight against the federation the question faces him can he hold in check the wilder spirits of his party and persist in his policy of nonviolence will he be content as prime minister to govern in uneasy cooperation with nkumbulas more extreme congress partisans and with europeans now comes the test of statesmanship kaunda of zambia has many friends who are convinced that the answer to such questions will be yes and that he will be a real leader in the new life of central africa
was teddy roosevelt a friend of negroes
everyones attention was directed toward the national leader as he spoke on the racial crisis we believe that this country will not be a permanently good place for any of us to live in unless we make it a reasonably good place for all of us to live in    our cause is the cause of justice for all in the interest of all   one could easily assume that this statement was made within the last few months and could only question whether the speaker was john kennedy or lyndon johnson actually the words were spoken by theodore roosevelt as he addressed his friends of the progressive party in  more than a half century ago although the murders marches and bombings of recent months have made the national racial crisis a matter of greater urgency and importance than ever before and have caused it to occupy increasingly more time on the agenda of the president the issue is not a new one to occupants of the white house it now seems timely significant and of historical interest to consider how other chief executives have dealt with the problem the historical background of a current day news event is always of great interest but beyond that it provides insight and understanding with respect to the present situation volumes have been written about lincolns attitude toward the negro and the liberal policies of franklin d roosevelt remain fresh in the memories of millions practically unknown to the general public however are the views and actions of theodore roosevelt with respect to this issue although a republican he was like john f kennedy a harvard graduate and was a young vigorous twentieth century occupant of the white house president theodore roosevelt had been in office scarcely a month when he became embroiled in a racial controversy by inviting famed negro leader booker t washington to dinner at the white house the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the question of possible future appointments in the south the incident would have gone unnoticed except for the fact that in accordance with customary procedure washingtons name was placed on the white house guest list when the reporters saw it the matter quickly snowballed into a national incident that haunted roosevelt for years t r was taken completely by surprise as he had had no idea the event would cause such loud repercussions referring to the tuskegee leader in his voluminous correspondence the indignant president said he would have washington to dinner just as often as he pleased and that i respect him greatly and believe in the work he has done i have consulted so much with him it seemed to me that it was natural to ask him to dinner to talk over this work and the very fact that i felt a moments qualm on inviting him because of his color made me ashamed of myself and made me hasten to send the invitation  although the dinner had no noticeable effect on the north it put an end to all of t rs hopes of winning support for the republicans in the south the comment of the new orleans timesdemocrat was representative of southern reaction when mr roosevelt sits down to dinner with a negro he declares that the negro is the social equal of the white man  roosevelt further revealed his feelings for booker t washington by laughing uproariously as he related to friends a true story about the negro leader it seems that a florida colonel as he had shaken hands with washington had said he was very pleased to meet the greatest man in america washington had protested that president roosevelt was the greatest the colonel had then objected strongly to this referring to t r as a demagogue because he had dined with washington although washington announced his support of taft during the presidential campaign of  due to the fact that t r had condoned the seating of allwhite delegations from three southern states at the progressive party convention roosevelt continued to hold washington in great respect and admiration when the tuskegee leader died in  roosevelt called him not only the most useful and distinguished negro in the world but also one of the most useful and distinguished americans of any race it should not be concluded however from roosevelts treatment of booker t washington that he was totally unbiased even though he accepted as equals those few negroes who at that time had become well educated articulate citizens and leaders he nevertheless revealed many times through his words and actions his belief in the inferiority of the negro race as a whole furthermore it must be remembered that to respect booker t washington as an individual was one thing but to support his philosophy was hardly to be a great liberal for washington believed that if negroes concentrated on education and character development whites upon seeing the progress that had been made would then grant them full civil_rights this view would understandably arouse little sympathy among todays more sophisticated negro leaders on the evening of august   occurred an incident which subsequently revealed roosevelts racial views in a much more questionable light on that night a group of armed men shot up the town of brownsville texas killing one person and wounding two others since negro soldiers had recently been assigned to the brownsville post enraged white citizens immediately blamed them for the crime military investigations seemed to confirm that the negroes were responsible but it was impossible to fix the guilt on any individuals and all steadfastly maintained their innocence because of the persistent silence of the troops the inspector general of the army recommended that all three companies be discharged without honor although they included men with records of service ranging up to twentyfive years president roosevelt after studying all reports of the investigation decided to discharge all the troops the act of punishing all for the crimes of a few would have been enough to have aroused much criticism and resentment but to make matters worse roosevelt did not make public his decision until the day the congressional election in which the republican party was successful in retaining control of the house of representatives aside from the poor timing of the announcement the president maintained over and over again that his decision was in no way influenced by the fact that the troops were negroes and that he would have acted in exactly the same way had they been white he had a difficult time however in convincing negroes and many broadminded whites that his decision was free from racial prejudice the controversy was still raging more than two years later when a bill was introduced in congress to extend for a year the time limit within which the president could reinstate any man who was proved innocent this bill had roosevelts support but on the opposing side was senator joseph foraker of ohio who introduced his own bill calling for reinstatement of all the troops forakers famous april  oration presented a strong case for the theory that shells used by the troops during target practice had been stolen by brownsville residents who then shot up the town themselves the president had earlier dis missed this theory as absurd but after forakers speech he ordered another investigation a few of the negroes were subsequently reinstated but the case was never completely settled the new york times seriously questioned the wisdom and fairness of roosevelts action in the brownsville case and seemed to sum up the feelings of many intelligent persons the final result is the absurdly inadequate punishishment of the guilty and the tremendously unjust punishment of many who were innocent of the crime    another method of investigation with more patience and skill might easily have brought all the facts to light and resulted in evenhanded justice to all concerned  time after time in answer to charges of racial prejudice stemming from the brownsville decision t r cited his political appointment policy as evidence of his belief in judging each individual on his merits as a man without regard to the color of his skin indeed he appointed a number of negroes to high positions but his successoi in the white house william howard taft was convinced that such a policy had not advanced the negro cause since the presence of negro appointees in the south was bitterly resented owen wister close friend of roosevelt felt as taft did that the president did not understand how deep were the wounds inflicted during reconstruction when t r appointed negro physician william d crum to the position of collector of customs at charleston south carolina the senate refused confirmation in the face of a storm of protest from charleston citizens refusing to give in roosevelt kept crum in office by interim appointment in a lengthy defense of his action t r told charleston banker robert rhett that it seemed to him that on the rare occasion when a negro proved to be qualified his good citizenship should be rewarded roosevelt touched off still another controversy in his handling of the indianola mississippi affair when an educated negro doctor arrived in indianola and began to take away negro patients from the lowest white doctors the whites by mob action forced not only the negro doctor to leave town but also mrs minnie cox who for some years had been the negro postmistress the leading citizens of the town who greatly respected mrs cox deprecated the mob action but did nothing to stop it instead of sending mrs cox back under an escort of federal troops roosevelt simply closed the post office thereby forcing indianola citizens to go five miles to the next town for their mail southern newspapers went into hysterics over his action calling it part of his plan for negro domination and miscegenation t r was at a loss to explain the southern mind two months after the indianola incident he remarked in a letter to owen wister that the same fools who turned mrs cox out of office were now depositing their funds in her husbands bank and also had him as one of the directors of a white bank those who would like to classify roosevelt as a white supremacist could find support for their case by quoting his  lincoln dinner speech to the republican club in new york during which he spoke for preservation of what he called the high civilization of the whites and pointed out that civil privileges should not be confused with social privileges a far different thing they could cite his  paris speech at the sorbonne where he spoke of inequalities in moral development and in social capacity they could also cite one of his letters to owen wister in which he clearly shows prejudice against negroes i entirely agree with you that as a race and in the mass they are altogether inferior to the whites on the other hand those who see roosevelt as a great liberal far ahead of his day can also quote from his lincoln dinner speech in another part of which he pleaded for the treatment of each man according to his worth as a man and in conclusion of which he made the following sincere statement i be lieve in this country with all my heart and soul  we shall go up or down together and i believe that we shall go up and not down    because i have an abiding faith in the generosity the courage the resolution and the common sense of all my countrymen they can cite his praise of the negro troops beside whom he served at santiago and they can point to his efforts to establish in the progressive party a more enlightened negro policy than that which characterized the two older parties in spite of these inconsistencies both in word and in deed it is difficult to see how anyone who has studied roosevelts speeches letters and other writings as well as what historians have said about him can doubt the sincerity of his desire to aid the cause of the negro although theodore roosevelt is today considered one of our greatest presidents seldom did he have the support of the majority of the people as he attempted to make some headway in dealing with americas race problem the victim of a steady barrage of criticism time after time he acted courageously in an effort to do what was right surely roosevelt would have applauded last june as president kennedy eloquently told congress why a strong civil_rights law is imperative in this year of of the emancipation centennial justice requires us to insure the blessings of liberty for all americans and their posteritynot merely for reasons of economic efficiency world diplomacy and domestic tranquility but above all because it is right

a balletomane at a bullfight
an aficionado im a q a  good cook j £ in fact im the sort of partisan of la corrida who applauds the bull which of course is no way to win friends and influence people in spain i learned that the dangerous way at my first bullfight when the brave toro routed the matador and sent him fleeing most unvaliantly over the wall i sat there shouting and clapping with unrestrained glee only when my own voice floated back on a wave of dead silence did i realize that my delighted laughter was a faux pas all  eyes in the stadium turned on me and in that uncomfortable moment i fully understood the savage lust for blood and guts that underlies the spanish passion for bullfighting but while i find bullfighting as bullfighting as boring as last nights beer i think bullfighting as ballet is as warmly stimulating as this evenings cool champagne aficionados go mad with rapture when witnessing a languid veronica or illusive chicuelina or a triumphant remate but take that ton or so of bruising beef out of the arena and what have you got movements as pure and symphonic as any ever conceived by diaghilev and though balletomanes for some baffling reason have not yet discovered the fact the most skillful matadors take the art of ballet into spheres unplumbed by giselle or the sleeping beauty of the matadors harvesting the oles on the iberian peninsula at  seasons start luis miguel dominguin ranked as primo don so when the great dominguin condescended to appear in the plaza de toros at palma de mallorca in july just before the two gorings that laid him up toward seasons end my love of the dance dictated that i beat a hasty trail to the boxoffice to assure myself an unfettered view i splurged on a  ticket  pesetas that represented four missed meals to record the occasion for my dull and imminent old age i took along a borrowed motion picture camera it was all worth it i was sandwiched between a taciturn german and an effusive englishwoman mucho calor grunted the german in spanish complaining of the heat oh i hope all the blood wont make me ill gushed the englishwoman these people obviously were not attuned to the spirit of the coming danse macabre it is said somewhat maliciously that manana is catholic spains true religion and that only the bullfight begins on time whatever the merits of the first claim the latter can hardly be disputed promptly at six then the band broke out the gates flung open and the paseillo began a pageant straight out of the middle ages out pranced the proud beautiful stallions bearing officials as elaborately festooned as the swiss guards at the vatican behind them in time to the bands ancient martial music strutted the three matadors as slender as dior mannequins as richly plumed and as proud as peacocks attending the matadors marched the battalion of toreros and picadors no less elegant than their superiors in their brilliant silk tights brocaded jackets and pastel hose only a philistine could think of this gorgeous army as other than a splendid corps de ballet the procession ended the gate of the toril went up and a raging  black bull stormed out snorting stamping a villain more magnificent than any the covent garden stage ever accommodated the illusion was perfect the animal seemed duly fierce but i wondered at its size memory sometimes beguiles but it seemed that my grandmothers guernsey had been at least as big in keeping with the inflexible procedure of this classical drama the army of matadors toreros and picadors ganged up on the bull teasing and taunting it with capes stabbing it with spears leaving steeltipped darts dangling in its shoulders in and out of the arena the assaulters ran fleeing behind barreras taking refuge on the backs of horses throwing up their pomaded heads jutting out their tightly bound behinds exciting mob scene really and then dominguin the stadium exploded as this great man this idol this prince of torerosthe man who had challenged the great manolete and seen his aging rival meet oblivion on the horns of a giant miura  years earlierswaggered out to the center of the arena fresh assured luis miguel twirled his cape lured the lethal horns past his thighs past his fanny ole ole ah it was lovely nijinsky himself could not have pirouetted more gracefully glided and turned with more poetry the bull roared stamped foamed at the mouth so hot and  weary and weak from his bleeding wounds that his knees buckled as he charged but charge he did again and again all but falling on his face a heartrending pas de deux but caught up in the beauty of dominguins line and grace it was possible to ignore the brutes cruel suffering it was even possible momentarily not to admire its dumb courage dominguin warming to his art ran through his repertory of grandstanding tricks he stood a defiant sylph a foot from the nolongersodeadly horns he knelt in the bloodsoaked sand seized the horns and shouted into the dazed brutes ear the fans were ecstatic they went wild then the hero faced his public handsome aloof smiling the prelude to the final act man against exhausted brute a pase natural a pase de pecho ole ole standing straight and imperious dominguin ordered his muleta and sword and then breathless silence man and beast faced each other on the edge of the moment of truth muleta in his left hand gleaming estoque raised in his right hand luis miguel struck a classic pose all grace all poise all valor then swiftly lightly executing a swansmooth jete he drove the steel blade into the solid hulk of valiant flesh somewhere behind me a female voice shrieked and a fainting body tumbled heavily in the stands i think im going to be sick groaned the englishwoman i drew my legs away from her i was wearing my last pair of summer trousers i was grateful i wasnt the man sitting in front of her it was over the toreros swept in and lifted dominguin to their shoulders and bore him in triumph around the arena a shower of flores sombreros and botes rained down from the stands luis miguel luis miguel screamed the crowd tu el primero tu el maestro suddenly impulsively i began to clap and cheer my applause blended with the mad ovation but i wasnt acclaiming the primo don of the ballet of blood and sand alas that spell was broken a team of horses dragged the body of that defeated beast across the arena and in spite of everything i was applauding the dead bull

 do you ever wonder what your barber is thinking when he cuts your hair or shaves you besides being artists of a sort we barbers are men of a thousand personalities talkative when you feel like talking respectful when you express an opinion silent when you want to be quiet we meet people of all types and talk to infants and octogenarians beggars and bankers cops and criminals but do you know what we are really like underneath our mask of politeness while you relax in the soft chair soothed with our hypnotic hands and the suave smell of balms and oils you unwittingly confess things to us and expose the secret nooks and crannies of your souls we know what goes on in your mind but do you know what goes on in ours as you lie helpless under our hands wielding the razor there was a man i had shaved for years i began shaving him when the first soft down appeared upon his cheeks and his skin was healthy and glowing after i had shaved him he would smile into the mirror and exclaim what a shave what a barber you are i would have a thrill of pride at a work of art well done i shaved him the day he appeared in his best suit to be married and the morning he came in disheveled after being up all night when his first child was born i enjoyed watching him mature and take on the responsibilities of a job a wife a family but somewhere along the road he began to falter his responsibilities were more than he was willing or able to bear he failed in his duties then he flouted them his hopes flickered out he became bitter and quarrelsome his friends avoided him his wife left him and took the children with her he was burdened with debts he began to drink his firm cheeks became flabby often after he had spent a wild night i would work over his strained face and look with regret into his bleary eyes i had liked him at first but now i began to dislike him he became repulsive to my touch i wished that i didnt have to shave him but it was a necessary job as he insisted on putting up a front to the world and having his daily shave i tried to avoid shaving him but he would always be there demanding his daily rite from me alone as if he were ashamed to have another barber touch him the shaves i gave him now were not so close and clean as they had been but he would only glare into the mirror with a spiteful word and come back for another shave the next morning sometimes he would not even care how he looked but would stagger into the street without even inspecting my botched job gradually i began to hate him i began scheming of little ways to hurt or disfigure him a slip of the razor here a little nick there where it would be the most conspicuous he would swear when i cut him or frown into the mirror and snarl what a butcher you turned out to be but still he demanded his daily shave his badge of respectability to flash on the world at last i began to loathe him it was then that i felt the temptation often as i scraped the keen steel over his chin i reflected that a little slip a little pressure of the wrist would cut his throat and end his miserable existence as i looked into his puffed features i imagined how they would look with a wide red gash in his throat but i thought who am i to take a life only god has the right to take a human life i wondered why i hated him so much god how i hated him i hated everything about him i hated him more than my worst enemy  knew that possibly there were excuses for his degradation but i hated him anyway and the temptation to kill him remained persisted i thought about it all day and dreamed of it at night the vision of his red cut throat became my fetish i could hardly wait for the morning hour when i would shave him and feel his throat under my fingers his throat where like an artist i would carve my masterpiece one morning when this wretched creature was under my hands i could resist the temptation no longer with a quick deft motion i drew the razor across his throat some lastfractionofasecond feeling of pity or of fear perhaps made me lighten the stroke the wound was wide but not deep and did not prove fatal for the doctors tell me i will live

got five of em i y tt it  told sam as we flat ni £ nosed against the shop window gazing bigeyed at the ship inside the bottle and he says he wants that one more than anything in the world it must cost a lot sam said turning toward me with the whites of his eyes sparkling against his blueblack skin not so much i answered nonchalantly meanwhile futilely clicking the two nickels in my jeans pockets man told jim fifteen dollars i jist might buy it for him for his birthday next month the white areas around the brown pupils increased in diameter where you gonna get fifteen dollars oh i got some saved i told my pal as we reluctantly backed away from the window and proceeded toward the annapolis waterfront a block away besides i could probably make enough to buy it before his birthday  thats almost a month off we wandered in silence looking at oyster boats and people listening to the mansworld talk and taking care to stay out of the paths of the bigger folks wed learned long ago that two tenyearolds dont attract much attention unless they get in somebodys way besides we were sort of fixtures there and on the academy grounds fishing in the severn river running errands for the shopkeepers shining shoes for the midshipmen and coming out pretty good when the middies threw pennies for luck to the indian statue tecumseh on their way to exams but we couldnt count on tecumseh for a while and there were plenty of other kids some bigger which made it bad in competition for the few jobs without admitting it to sam i knew that it would take better than average luck to make up the difference between the five or six dollars worth of coins in my mason jar at home and the fifteen dollars to get my brother jim that ship in the bottle she was flying the danish flag and grandpa jensen had talked denmark to jim and me ever since we could listen jim wanted to visit the old country so bad he said it hurt and next summer when he turned  he was going to ship out on a freighter and get over there he said if he had that ship in his collection waiting wouldnt hurt as much we sat on a camel and dangled our bare feet in the oily green water listening to it lap against the waterdarkened wood sam dug a handline out of his pocket found a hunk of mashed plum near a fruit stand and baited up the rusty hook he lowered the green fishing line optimistically into the water and sat watching the cork sam fished every day and didnt catch much when he did he took it home and his ma cooked it for his supper even if it was a fish three inches long guess they didnt have much and sam said he didnt have a pa today his poor luck was holding or mashed plum wasnt a good bait and hunger ended our vigil before he had a nibble i about wore the two nickels out rubbing them together watching the bobbing cork then i decided they had to go lets go get something to eat    ill buy it didnt take any time for sam to coil the wet line and shove it in a pocket of the oversized denims we walked to the fruitstand where the man let us pick out two bananas from a bunch for one of the coins when we hurried on to a shop where penny licorice whips and peanuts used up the rest of my allowance we sat on the curb in the warm sun and gobbled up peanuts licorice and bananas in no particular order then silently tried to forget that we were still hungry sam finally said formally thank you next time i get money ill buy i knew he would but i knew it might be a spell before he could he continued seriously right now i think ill help you get some money to buy that bottle of ship for mister jim its gonna take more than one person to get that much in the month you got we launched our project with all the enthusiasm two tenyearolds could muster and hunted for jobs it didnt work except for a dime one man gave us for cleaning  fish for him then one day sam let it drop in a try for a job that    were tryin to get enough money to buy mister jim tommys brother a bottle of ship for his birthday the shopkeeper threw back his head and laughed a long time then made the negro boy explain what a bottle of ship was sam told the whole story the shopkeeper listened and asked me why i wanted to buy that present i told him all about my big brother and he put us to work we cleaned out a storeroom for him and burned a bunch of old boxes and trash we got a quarter  and a request to come back day after tomorrow we didnt make any money next day but we didnt spend any either cause a restaurant let us haul out their garbage and gave us each a hot ham sandwich for doing the job the chef even let us eat it in the kitchen where great kettles were steaming when we went back to the shopkeeper hed apparently been talking up our project we swept the place out for him got a second quarter and were told to go over to mr wilsons there we swept some more and were sent to a poolroom that needed a real sweeping plus some trash hauling    magazines and newspapers that had been accumulating for several months sam was ecstatic man the way were going were gonna have enough money for mister jims present in no time his eyes would light up every evening when wed count the money then rush to the shop to see that the ship was still in the window one night after a particularly successful day we stopped just before splitting to go to our homes tommy said sam you dont i have to go into your bank at home id mentioned my savings there by next week well have enough to buy that bottle but half the moneys yours i started sam interrupted no it aint you been buying the lunches and besides i want to be in on the giving this is the most fun i ever had workin we let it go at that saturday before jims birthday mr schmidt at the fish market called us hear you boys need money for a special project he said with a twinkle in his heavilytufted round german eyes well ill give you whatever more you need up to three dollars if youll get me a bushel of softshell crabs here    come back here he stopped us in our tracks and asked if we might need any special equipment we had everything but bait he gave us a quarter to buy some meat for the crab lines and we raced to my house grabbed a dip net and two lines and charged on to a special spot along the severn river we had a halfbushel by noon and a bushel by midafternoon we each took a handle and started off past high red brick walls toward the market singing happily at the top of our lungs we were crossing a small park when three teenagers stopped us what you kids got hey they been catching crabs by golly you guys are smart for tenyearolds    hey jim    come here and see what these kids got a figure got up from a group squatting along the curb some distance away and sauntered over our  way i was relieved it was my big brother jim he recognized me too and hastily dropped a cigarette in the grass along the sidewalk i didnt know he smoked he walked up and said hi punk    what you up to i told him we were making some money he wanted to know what for we gonna buy  sam began who asked you nigger one of the others said but i    will you shut up and let jim talk to his brother you little black    jim whats the matter with you how come you take buttin in from a nigger yeah you turnin into a niggerlover like your brother one of the others joined in looking challengingly at jim jims face got red he turned on me you dont have to run around with him he turned and looked at a scared boy thats better jim give em hell this from a big leering blond jim sams my friend i pleaded besides we were just try » » in    now dont tell me about your dealings with a nigger i dont know whats gotten into you all the white boys in town and you have to play with a jig he looked disdainfully at sams clothes soiled from the days crabbing and i saw something  a look in his eyes that i couldnt remember seeing before you have to pick a dirty one at that one of the other teenagers moved closer maybe we ought to teach the nigger a lesson about running around with white boys lets start off with this he pushed sam over another boy who had crawled up and knelt on all fours behind my friend i kicked the kneeling boy in the stomach and the one whod pushed sam grabbed me better tell your kid brother to scram jim i yelled frantically until jim shook me and said get your butt home and stay out of this he gave me a shove somebody get one of those big crabs i heard him say as i started running for home and help well teach this little coon how to catch one by the claws    i ran panting into the house and upstairs there wasnt a soul there i yelled at the neighbors house and nobody came out there wasnt anyone to help i thought about dads duck gun in the closet then remembered he kept the shells locked up i thought about a butcher knife and figured i couldnt beat that gang even with two knives by this time i told myself theyd probably let sam go anyway i prayed he wasnt hurt bad then i went out on the porch and got a box i took it up to jims room and put his five ships in bottles carefully in and carried them  downstairs into the front yard i went into the shed around back and found a hammer i lugged it and a big rock out front beside the box and went to work methodically id set a bottle on the rock holding it by the neck id swing the hammer and shut my eyes to keep out the flying glass id next hammer the ship to splinters when i finished the five i went upstairs and got the bank i brought it down and worked on it with a hammer it gave after nine solid hits and i began to pick up coins with what i had in the pouch sam and id bought in the dimestore i had enough i was picking up the last scattered pennies when the gate creaked and i figured id had it i expected to get hit in the head but a gentle hand on the shoulder caused me to whirl in surprise it was my dad his sympathetic eyes cut away my fears hello young feller i hear you had a bad day mr wilson heard and saw most of what happened in the park and broke it up just when it was getting rough on sam hell be all right hes with his mother now well have a little talk with your brother tonight youve done a pretty good job of making him sorry already though his eyes surveyed the bits of glass thread  and wood then fastened on the badlymangled bank looks like you were about to spend some money mind if i go along i shook my head and we walked through the quiet cobbled streets we came to the shop with the ship and i glanced in the window it was gone i raced in the door and shouted at the shopkeeper where is the ship wheres the ship that was in your window ive got to have it    easy young man the whitehaired owner said winking at my father i heard a couple of young fellows were after that and i just put it in safekeeping wouldnt want the wrong persons to wind up with such a prize he reached under the counter and set the bluishgrey bottle in front of me shes a real dane and one of the last of her kind i counted the money automatically and pushed it across the polished wood then i picked up the bottle and with dad still silent beside me walked to sams house a sunburnedwhite framehouse with paint peeling and a broken screen on a side window we stepped on the creaky front porch and dad knocked sams mother came to the door kerchiefheaded a pained look in her eyes she didnt ask us in dad spoke i want to apologize for the actions of my older son somewhere along the line i failed and i want you to know im sorry he stepped back and i got my chance can i see sam please no the darkskinned woman said working hard to keep an impersonal tone to her voice sam dont want to see you hes learnt his lesson and will stay away from white boys from now on it shook me but i remembered the ship then will you give this to him i held out the bottle she took it without a word turned to go in the house hesitated a fraction of a second then continued into the dark interior i stood blankly gazing into the house then dads hands reached under my arms and lifted me i cried on his shoulder every step of the way home
george moses horton slave
this poem an impassioned plea for freedom was written by a negro slave who called himself an illiterate genius he addressed the poem to horace greeley and the famous editor published it in his paper the new york tribune george moses horton born a slave in northhampton county north carolina was characterized by dr collier cobb in his book an american man of letters as a slave who owned his master a poet ignorant of the rules of prosody a man of letters before he had learned to read a writer of short stories who was published in several papers simultaneously before the day of newspaper syndicates an author who supported himself and his family before authorship had attained the dignity of a profession in america this slave poet who styled himself an illiterate genius was the first writer in north carolina to support himself from his writings his book of poems the hope of liberty was the first book by a negro in the south george moses horton was born in slavery in north carolina about  the property of william horton when he was about six years old his master moved to chatham county about eight miles from chapel hill the seat of the university of north carolina the young negro boy though he could not read or write began composing poems in his head these poems were composed to the meter of hymns he had heard in church hortons third owner and master hall horton the grandson of william horton allowed the young slave to travel the eight miles from the plantation to chapel hill to sell farm products the students at the university had a habit of amusing themselves by forcing the slaves to make speeches for the laughter it invoked the pranksters were greatly surprised and pleased when horton declaimed in original poetry all eyes were on me and all ears were open the slave poet later wrote and hence my fame soon circulated like a stream throughout the college the university students soon commissioned the young slave to compose love poems which they sent to their sweethearts back home since george horton could not write he dictated the words and the students wrote them down he received from  to  for his poems on the theme of love the following is a specimen of one of his earlier efforts which was dictated before he had learned to write
the slave poet was to a large degree selftaught as revealed in his autobiography on well nigh every sabbath during the year he related did i retire away in the summer season to some shady and lonely recess where i could stammer over the dim and promiscuous syllables in my old black and tattered spelling book after studying spelling for some time horton taught himself to read at first he studied portions of the new testament later he studied miscellaneous poetry and the wesley hymns but the one person who taught the slave poet most about poetry and literature was a novelist from boston mrs caroline lee hentz mrs hentz had come to chapel hill as the wife of the professor of modem languages and she brought with her from new england a curiosity about slavery when the renown of the slave poet reached her ears she asked to meet him in her first novel lovells folly  mrs hentz appended a note concerning horton saying that i have often transcribed stanzas which he would dictate with quite an air of inspiration and have marveled at the readiness with which he would change a verse or sentiment which was objected to as erroneous in expression or deficient in poetical harmony though familiar with the best classic works belonging to the fine libraries of the university he had not been taught to write a legible hand and was obliged to be indebted to others for embodying the dreams of his muse one of hortons poems that mrs hentz particularly liked was printed in her book lovells folly when mrs hentz left chapel hill it was necessary for the slave bard to secure another sponsor this was none other than the leading personality on the campus dr joseph caldwell the president of the university of north carolina dr caldwell initiated a campaign to purchase the slave poets freedom he interested some influential people including james k polk who had graduated in the class of  by this time hortons owner had come to realize that he had an unusual property and the price asked for the slave poets freedom was very high since the money could not be raised the plans for hortons emancipation were forgotten and horton arranged to hire out his time that is he paid his master from his poetry money which he got from the students for the privilege of leaving the farm and living in chapel hill when he was unable to sell his poems to the students he worked either as janitor at the university or returned to the plantation to toil in the fields george horton never gave up his hope for freedom as is shown in a stanza from one of his poems that was composed shortly after the plans for his emancipation fell through on july   at raleigh joseph gales and son issued hortons book of poems the hope of liberty this book was the first book ever produced by a negro in the southern states and it aroused much interest the preface of the book was the first instance in which the general public had been informed that a talented slave poet was in their midst george who is the author of the following poetical effusions is a slave the property of mr james horton of chatham county north carolina he has been in the habit for some years past of producing poetical pieces sometimes on suggested subjects to such persons as would write them while he dictated several compositions of his have already appeared in the raleigh register some have made their way into the boston newspapers and have evoked expressions of approbation and surprise many persons some of whom are elevated in office and literary attainments have now become interested in the promotion of his prospects they are solicitous that efforts at length be made to obtain by subscription a sum sufficient for his emancipation upon the condition of his going in the vessel which shall first afterwards sail for liberia george had heard of liberia and had often expressed a desire to go there he believed he could live a freer life and exercise his literary abilities to a fuller extent in liberia he wanted to be of greater help to his race and felt he could do it better there one of the best poems in the hope of liberty volume was entitled on liberty and slavery which also expressed the slave poets longing for freedom
one of the men of literary attainment who became interested in the slave poet was horace greeley another who became interested in hortons poetry was miss mary youngs cheney from connecticut who taught school at warrenton north carolina miss cheney who later married horace greeley sent the famous editor the poem that begins this article it was a plea for freedom and is printed in its entirety at the beginning of this article the publication of the poem in greeleys famous new york tribune created some interest especially among the abolitionists but the enthusiasm soon waned and greeley himself lost interest in the slave poet only this one poem was published by the renowned editor and thus the slave bard lost his greatest opportunity for gaining his freedom the book of poems the hope of liberty was not a financial success and this left only one man for hope in gaining freedom this last patron dr joseph caldwell the president of unc died in  and with his passing all hope of being a free man faded for the slave poet after the passing away of dr caldwell horton spent the savings he had accumulated for his anticipated trip to liberia on drink he began to beg the university students for money and began to write verses telling of the sickness and distress of his family in order to obtain money he would go from room to room in the dormitories and read these verses to the students always he would close with an appeal to lend a helping hand to the old unfortunate bard george horton became very bitter after all plans for his emancipation fell through and he wrote the following poem entitled the slaves complaint the old unfortunate bard lived on in the village of chapel hill for  years after the publication of his book the hope of liberty in  general william tecumseh sherman entered north carolina on his return from the march to the sea one day in the spring of  one of hortons slave friends came to his shanty and reported seeing a large group of soldiers on horseback horton knew that these were cavalrymen and he made his plans to escape to their lines he went to his master hall horton and asked if he could carry some produce to the village he was granted permission mr horton was not aware that union cavalry was in the vicinity george then loaded his produce in a bag and slung it over the back of an old horse that his master had managed to keep through the four years of the war he headed for chapel hill until he got out of sight of the plantation and then urged the old horse in the direction his friend had said the union cavalrymen were located night had fallen as george arrived at the northern picket lines being unaware of how an army with sentinals operated he rode into the lines and failed to halt when he was challenged the pickets started firing and the old poet leaped from his old horse and lay on the ground this act saved his life george started to sing an old spiritual in a loud voice and the sentinels knew he wasnt an enemy he was allowed to come into the lines of the union cavalry and at the age of about  he was free at last the old poet soon began to write poems for the union troops to send home to their sweethearts just as he had written love poems for the students at the university of north carolina his work came to the attention of a union officer captain will h s banks captain banks took horton to philadelphia and helped him in the publication of his final book it was entitled naked genius and was published in october  in the preface captain banks stated that it would be offered to the public as one of the many proofs that god in his infinite wisdom and mercy created the black man for a higher purpose than to toil his life away under the galling yoke of slavery   shortly after arriving at philadelphia horton was considered as quite a celebrity he was invited to speak at many meetings of people who were interested in poetry soon horton lost the bitterness he had known previously when his freedom was denied he was able to compose in a light vein as in his creditor to his proud debtor life in the city of brotherly love proved to be not so easygoing as in the sunny south for the illiterate genius the people of philadelphia soon lost interest in the negro bard and the naked genius was forced to seek means other than writing to earn his livelihood fame is such a fleeting thing that george moses horton the slave poet died about  almost forgotten by all

i am a black muslim i and proud of it proclaimed cassius clay the new heavyweight boxing champion of the world and a lot of us were shocked no matter that young mr clay has yet to prove that he isnt in the words he himself applied to floyd patterson a cheese champion no matter that he won boxings richest most coveted crown because his opponent couldnt raise his left arm no matter that cassius is an unlettered overgrown boy no matter how you slice it mr clay is a  karat celebrity one of the best known negroes in the united states and his public announcement that he belonged proudly to a fanatical negro supremacy group inevitably raised many hackles among the white majority the black muslims it is true represent a tiny segment of the american negro population all of the most respected negro leaders have disowned them some using extraordinarily strong words but that doesnt make the muslims go away theyre here quite probably to stay the black muslims despite mr clays naive statements to the contrary have no connection with the religion of islam they arent in fact any more muslim than the shriners their platform advocates black supremacy arguing that black is black and white is white and never the two shall meet ironically they share this belief with the diehard white supremacists both arguing that negroes and whites werent intended to integrate negroes have nothing to gain the black muslims argue everything to lose from associating with whites all whiteled efforts for civil_rights they say are a waste of time meant only to delude negroes to my knowledge no responsible leader white or negro considers the muslims seriously as a social or political force for one thing elijah muhammed malcolm_x and their associates are blandly vague when it comes to charting specific courses of future action except for immediate policies and postures they have little to offer the negro and most negroes are far too leery of the primrose path to buy another patent medicine just because the medicine men are black but the black muslims have a message for all americans unfortunately it doesnt seem to be getting through to many of us the muslims are a kind of symbol of the new negro mood a mood widely shared by negroes who laugh to scorn the muslim movement itself the new mood says this is the end of the line we want our rights now and please dont do us any favors the people who may be the most disconcerted by this new mood are the white liberals the friends of the negro those who have been on the firing lines for many years some since the early new deal days are especially rattled by the hard realism of the negro attitude not many years ago negroes  appreciated the efforts of whites to gain their rights for them sometimes they were even grateful twenty years ago when i first encountered the racial justice firing line myself there was a were all in this together camaraderie between negroes and the whites who were battling alongside them the economic and social acceptance of negroes or even a negro by a group of whites or a white organization brought a warm glow in both groups those were the days when negroes and their white friends took unconscionable pride in the achievements of marian anderson ralph bunche and especially jackie robinson even then of course the winds of change were beginning to blow in the midforties an elderly white clergyman and i grudgingly sat up all night on a miserable train because hotels in the town where we were addressing a brotherhood meeting would not accommodate the third member of our trio a negro minister the two of us would have closed ranks with the latter more graciously if he hadnt been a thoroughly disagreeable man who wore his race like a badge and who all but dared us to yield our comfort to the principles we professed while this angry young negro may have temporarily arrested the cause of brotherhood in two white men of good will he might also have taught us that his rights were just that and not privileges today the negro has stopped being grateful for things that belong to him by right things which he has been illegally denied since the emancipation proclamation one hundred years ago and if they dont bristle like rednecked southern hill folk when they hear the expression of a finally emancipated negro attitude the white liberal champions of the negro can hardly be blamed for feeling a little like parents when they learn their grown children are no longer dependent on them perhaps not many negroes are as baldly aggressive as the comedian who purports to run a rentanegro service for people who want to have an integrated party but the humor in this jibe doesnt reflect the wry amusement that many negroes feel when they watch the lastoneinisadirtyword scramble of the white johnnycomelately integrationists novelist james baldwin who is as typical of his generation as the courtly a philip randolph is of his has no qualms about rubbing the noses of the friendliest whites in the dirt of longdenied opportunities not long ago mr baldwin took television viewers with him while he toured san franciscos harlem preening strutting and muttering phrases that blended jeremiah and the new yorker without benefit of monosodium glutamate baldwin bitingly typified the new negro mood when one of the people he questioned gave a disen chanted reply to a blunt query the little novelist would cast down his eyes sagely and mutter the kind of cocktail party apostrophe so often mistaken for the spark of genius mr baldwin did nothing for the negro image neither did the less gifted negroes he interviewed some of the latter like cassius clay espoused the black muslims others told of their encounters with white mens justice and white mens jails several spoke crudely one was obscene and his obscenity brought a shrill giggle from baldwin the churches took their lumps in other candid comments white viewers could help themselves to reactions anger shock fright indignation sadness disgust surely no favorable white reaction was likely negro public relations must have suffered terribly i wondered how many white viewers felt shame shame because white greed and exploitation and intolerance had created among the negroes the same need for demagogues that that other depressed group the old south feels shame for white policies that for generations kept negroes in social and economic bondage that reduced negroes to hatinhand gratitude for white favors that shouldnt have been favors at allbut rights if he had a choice of white reactions this program would arouse mr baldwin and i think most negroes would probably prefer to see shame but chances are he wouldnt much care the american negro has very nearly stopped looking for white approval he is probably more indifferent to such approval than most whites are to the approval of their fellow whites and he is certainly more indifferent to white approval than he is to the approval of his fellow negroes the new solidarity of the negroes is only indirectly the child of ghetto life the latter is a cringing huddling together for selfdefense the new negro solidarity is a proud defiant and for the first time in american negro history a joyful thing the negro long ago put away his banjo and removed the cleats from his dancing shoes in the last decade he has also served notice that the niceties of brotherhood week will have to wait at least until he has the rights that our constitution describes as godgiven for the rest of us the medicine may be increasingly bitter as we wake up to the fact that demands are replacing requests we may not like sitins and boycotts and picketingwe may in fact be right in arguing that these tactics do more harm than good but we have forfeited our right to argue the point by our centurylong foot dragging on negro rights short of widespread bloody violenceand please god therell be none of that we cant even resist much less stop the march and ultimate triumph of the negro rights movement it is truly an idea whose time has come and its much much too late in the day for christmas baskets
the steps to freedom
a dreadful quiet is beginning to settle over the recently tumultuous civil_rights scene here in america it is an ominous quiet which seems to be issuing from the depths of the broken hearts the frustrated dreams and the dashed hopes of those most affectedthe american negro it is like the calm which precedes the most deadly storm it is as if those long dead have returned momentarily to the play of life to set the stage for some subsequent savage act which will send many new souls to join them in the long cold corridors of the misty unknown it has long been known that it is the nature of man to not only be free but to struggle against all forms of oppression whether it be religious political moral or immoral the negro in america has been morally and politically oppressed for over a century and like the many generations of man before him he has been and is struggling against that oppression and its effects he is for example evolving with certainty in the same direction as did the oppressed people of france during the one hundred years immediately prior to bastille day on july   the fact that he is outnumbered by approximately nine to one in population will neither halt nor slow the impetus of his forward thrust for it is as certain as death itself that man must reach out for freedom even in the face of overwhelming odds and inhumane treatment the entire history of mans inhumanity to man reveals that freedom for those oppressed evolves from the public reaction to four basic phases or steps in human behaviour they are in order first cooperation with the oppressor secondthe persuasion of or the reasoning with the oppressor third coercion and threats against the oppressor and fourthviolence bloodshed and death the negro in america today has come to the climax of the third step for nearly two hundred years as slaves and later freed slaves his father and his grandfather cooperated with their oppressors in the vain hope that at some future date their sons and daughters would be able to walk tall in the land as free men and women but this has not come to pass for the sons and the grandsons of the slaves are still not free even though they themselves have been pleading withand attempting to persuadethe sons and grandsons of their oppressors for nearly fifty years many reasons have been advanced as the basis for the continued subjugation of the black man in america some students of human behaviour state that economic competition and drives toward individual security causes the whites to continue to cling to the advantage handed down to them by their slaveholding ancestors others blame family conditioning and tradition that is to say that the son is conditioned within the family to hate what his father hates and to love what his father loves if the father contends that black is a sign of evil then no amount of logic and reason can make the son think otherwise there are other philosophies too numerous to mention here except to state the simple fact that the more accustomed one becomes to oppressing someone else whatever the reason the stronger becomes the feeling of selfexultation and selfworship that grows within him and that the longer these feelings exist the more difficult it becomes to even think of relinquishing them that then has been and still is the conscious or subconscious position of the white man in america today it is the position of the socalled liberal as well as the john bircher and it is the position of the poor white man as well as the rich it was because of these tenacious viewpoints that the disgusted oppressed negro population launched what is popularly known as the negro revolt this writer would prefer to call it the transition to the step before the revolt inspired by the courageous stands taken by a few outspoken negro ministers in the racehating south the dejected negro all over the country took heart and began to look upon themselves with pride the embers of their dying hopes once again began to glow and from that feeble spark a few great writers took their pens and fanned those embers into a blazing flame baldwin lomax and others reached to the heavens with brilliant words and phrases and sounded the clarion call of freedomfreedom uplifted exultant and rededicated negroes of all ages and from all walks of life began to march side by side with whites who felt their urgency and to sing the songs of liberty in the north in the south in the east and in the west they sang they picketed they demonstrated and they marched into the face of vicious dogs and danger into fire hoses and furious oppressors and into the dark jails thus in glory began the third act or more definitively the third step toward freedom this was the coercive phase the large dissenting crowds the loud dissenting voice the pulse of poverty throbbing in anticipation of the better life to be the eager surging forward motion of that part of the nation which had long been held back but now beheld the light of freedom within reach these were the determined two hundred and fifty thousand people who gathered in the nations capital on august   and demanded release from bondage this too was the anticlimax the desperate appeal to bring the  play to a happy conclusion this was the final bid for the goodwill which never came for those who would oppress still do and those who hate for the sake of hate itself have still not changed their minds indeed they have stood their ground nothing has changed except perhaps that the subtle discrimination which existed before the great march is subtler still    and now as the curtain prepares to fall on act threethe flame dies and the stage grows ominously still all that is left of the great anticlimax are the children playing in the ashes of what was once a brightly burning flame in the wings stand the ghosts of john brown of medgar evers of john fitzgerald kennedy and of many morewaiting patiently to set the stage for a long and bloody act four should act four begin there is no doubt that the black man will perish in america for he has neither the means the numbers nor the methods to pursue his goal with arms this fact within itself would not be so terrible men have died before in order that their children might go free if a man is not willing to die for his principles then either his principles are not sound or the man himself is not worthy of holding them the curse of black slavery still lies heavily over the rocks and rills of america it hangs like an ominous cloud over the highest mountain and it creeps like an odorous vine through the bright valleys of wisdom and truth tainting the christian church warping the nations children and twisting the minds of even the most knowledgable men that we must rid ourselves of this pestilence before it destroys us has long been known and were it not for the awesome expectation of the eventual fulfillment of the prophesies it might well be that the blood of the american negro is the only blood that is whole enough to wash the stain away the problem however goes deeper than that and the implications contained within it are heavy enough to shake the very foundations of the earth this then is a prophesynot just a mere conglomeration of words it is a prophesy accompanied by a prayer that the fourth step in the american negroes fight for freedom will never be taken for if this bloody act in the play begins the spark from it will ignite a holocaust that will destroy not only the white man but the population of the entire known world it will be the beginning of a conflict the likes of which has never been witnessed by mankind true there have been wars and rumors of war since the beginning of time several years ago a writer for the new york times noted that in  years of recorded history there have been  years of war and only  years of peace these wars no doubt were fought in many lands for many reasons but never in the history of man has a war been fought merely on the basis of color yet should the american negro be forced to take the next step and take it he will for there is no turning back and thus provoke his end this is the type of war that the world will become engaged in the black brown yellow and the red men three fourths of the worlds population long dissatisfied with the treatment afforded them over the centuries by the white men of the world have for years been banding themselves together on these common grounds and all of the american millions poured out to them under the name of foreign aid has not been enough to halt this trend nor has it been enough to buy their love the rising nations of africa invariably join the causes of asia castro of cuba is spreading his influence over all of latin america including mexico the gateway to the united states france who claims her heritage from egypt and africa is wooing the darkskinned people of asia africa and latin america japan and the far east have joined hands and the fearful dragon of red china is rattling its chains so hard that white russia our former bitter enemyhas fearfully jumped into bed with us and with our allies missiles and nuclear fission are no longer the exclusive possessions of the two great powers and there is enough fire power around in the rest of the world to also blow us off the face of the globe while we are busy blowing someone else up it is of prime importance then that the fourth step in the american negroes fight for freedom be forestalled this is not to say that he should not have his liberty for certainly he must it is merely stated here that the curtain for the third act should not be allowed to fall until the act itself is brought to at least a workable conclusion this can only be accomplished by a miracle of concessions that must be made by both the american negro and the american white man they must first of all together concede that there is a cultural chasm of approximately one hundred years between them and they must combine in their efforts to bridge this gap before it is too late by holding the negro back or standing on his shoulders the white man has amassed most of the wealth in america and all of the power that wealth brings with it by allowing himself to be held back that is to say that by not fighting and dying for his rights in the first placethe american negro has put himself into a cultural position that will make the acceptance of freedom most difficult for him when it finally comes let us therefore not be naive to fully integrate is to eventually assimilate and amalgamate how can two groups of people amalgamate without conflict if their levels of culture and understanding are at  opposite poles    the problem now before us is how to unbrainwash those who have been thoroughly brainwashed and how to erase the bitterness and disillusionment of one hundred years in a few short months it will not be an easy task but it must be done the cultural gap between the races in america created by the slave trade and its after effects must be quickly closed and forever sealed if we are to survive as a nation difficult though this task may be it can and it must be done the fortunate white man who has profited much from this dilemma created by his ancestors must now spend some of this money to pay for vast social work programs retraining and educational projects aimed at the betterment of not only the unfortunate negro but the unfortunate white as well he must pay this bill because the negro has not been allowed to profit and can not afford to pay the negro meanwhile must take inventory of himself and gird for his new role in society no longer will he be considered as just a boy he will be considered as and he must assume the role of a man willing and able to assume his full share of the responsibilities that accompany the rights that he has fought so long to acquire when this is done the bright glow of liberty will again envelope this land and our children will walk hand and hand together in its glow setting an example for the rest of the world to follow
