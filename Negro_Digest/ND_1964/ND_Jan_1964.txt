civil_rights struggle
i look toward  a p one fact is unmistak ably clear the thrust u £u jj emancipation will increase rather than decrease the immediate assessment against the backdrop of the summer of  could easily be one that anticipates less activity because some measurable gains have been made in hunone relates directly to the other on thanksgiving weekend  sncc workers gathered in washington to discuss the ways and means of bringing some measure of economic independence to rural negroes at a threeday conferencewell named for food and jobssncc workers from alabama mississippi georgia and across the south discussed techniques of fighting employment bias of fighting the political and economic stronghold racists have on the american scene and finally new ways to protest against this unjust system of segregation sncc workers who had been beaten kicked some who had been tortured and shot at gathered to discuss formation of an america where no man is hungry none jobless where no man beats another where no one goes to jail because he attempts to register to vote nineteen sixtyfour will see the beginning of a new political awakening among negroes no longer will urban negroes feel their votes are flowing downward into a machine and no longer will rural negroes be afraid to brave police clubs and guns to stand all day in line to register in  the negro movement will become the peoples movement a movement for all the hungry all the poor all the voteless in  we will remember president kennedys words a man must sometimes sit down for his rights in order to stand up for themdreds of individual communities as well as across the nation however closer scrutiny of the negro revolution will reveal that the awareness of his gains has only whetted his appetite for more gains and more quickly an ancillary force is the fact that whereas a year ago only a sprinkling of cities south and north had been involved in demonstrations picketing etc now there are nearly  cities where under the banner of nonviolence some baptism of fire has taken place the negro as a community has increased his skill tremendously in quantity and quality the civil_rights legislation now before congress will feel the intense focus of negro interest it was born in the streets of birmingham amid snarling dogs and the battering of fire hoses it was fashioned in the jail cells of the south and by the marching feet in the north it became the order of the day at the great march on washington last summer the negro and his compatriots for selfrespect and human dignity will not be denied if a filibuster occurs the nation might well fasten its safety belt once the bill is written into law there will still be the matter of implementation state by state and community by community then of course there is the matter of wider use of the technique of selective patronage as popularized is at this moment an elaborate plan to broaden the base of selective buying in order that the power of the negro consumer market can be used as a lever to pry open the door to wider employment opportunities the negro has learned his lesson well if you respect my dollar then you must also respect my person the advent of monstrous automation coupled with the negro comprising the largest segment of americas semiskilled and unskilled labor force makes equal employment opportunities one of the priority concerns of the negro community in  the innovation for this year will be largescale selective buying programs aimed at the giants in the consumer industry i do not foresee any widespread turning of the negro to violence this will perhaps be a glowing commentary on the success of the nonviolent method in bringing about social transformation that produces tangible results the last years record has demonstrated that nonviolence is more than pious injunctions to do good for evil it is also a practical technique that has maintained a sense of hope in the american negro community that america can realize the dreams of the founding fathers  should compound the gains realized in 
in projecting the shape of things to comealways a perilous ventureone needs not only the guidance of the past but also a comprehension of the social economic and political factors fashioning todays patterns in no era of contemporary american life are these factors more in flux more erratic than in race relations the one definite thing that may be said is that winds of change along the civil_rights front are blowing throughout the nation theres no present indication that they will subside in  by the end of  it was abundantly clear that the two most powerful instruments for change possessed by the negro are the ballot and the dollar the problem confronting the civil_rights organizations in  as the effective mobilization and utilization of these resources in the fight for freedom there will of course be supplementary activities but the main thrust will undoubtedly be political and economic the national association for the advancement of colored people has already ordered steppedup voter registration campaigns by its branches in every state in which negro citizens reside in sizeable numbers that is in every such state except alabama where a state court injunction still bars naacp activity the naacp is the only national civil_rights organization which has carried on a steady voter registration campaign year in year out since  it has had roving staff members one working out of richmond va and one out of memphis tenn organizing and supervising voter registration drives in scores of localities to achieve the goal of maximum  registration requires not only money but also thousands of volunteers to perform the necessary drudgery of doortodoor canvassing in local communities rallies and speechmaking are helpful but they are not enough alone to get additional names on the registration rolls important too is concentration on the goal of registration and the avoidance if at all possible of provocative sideline activities that may stir certain communities and result in publicized brushes with law enforcement officers but which do not actually add names to the voting lists the kind of civil_rights law that emerges from congress will in large measure depend upon how convinced members of congress are that we mean business as far as voting is concerned the earlier we get effective campaigns under way in the new year the stronger the law there is now no doubt that a civil_rights bill will be enacted in  the question is how strong a law the goal of the naacps nonpartisan political program is the election of candidates committed to civil_rights irrespective of party label the votes the naacp seeks to mobilize will be for the man and what he stands for and not for the party the other major front on which decisive action may be anticipated in  is the economic not only negro consumers but big business also are beginning to realize the potency of the races  billion purchasing power properly mobilizedthis immense economic force can open up new employment opportunities for negroes at all levels exploration should be made also of the further mobilization of the financial resources of the race to provide capital for retail businesses industrial and manufacturing ventures distributing systems and financial concerns there will be intensified economic action in  particularly in local communities there may also be calls for nationwide action against products the manufacturers or processors of which engage in discriminatory practices recent surveys reveal an increasing responsiveness among negro consumers to proposals for such action other important programs will be required in  to stem the excessively high unemployment rate among negro workers these include legislation to stimulate the economy to provide public works and to institute a massive retraining program for workers displaced by automation discrimination against negroes in apprenticeship training programs and skilled employment must be halted either by legislation court decisions or direct action certainly publiclyfinanced construction cannot continue to bar negroes from skilled jobs abolition of such discrimination is a  imperative in addition to political and economic action there will be important activities in other areas in the civil_rights struggle as the need arises there will be demonstrations to gain specific objectives the fight for open occupancy in housing privately financed as well as public will continue as will the struggle to eliminate segregation in education in nonsouthern states as well as in dixie the outlook for substantial civil_rights gains in  is as of this writing more promising than ever before there is a new national administration committed to civil_rights legislative and executive action and with presidential elections coming up an enlarged negro electorate will be able to exert greater influence in the political arena an increasing number of southern cities having learned well the lessons of birmingham and jackson are prepared to make adjustments in accordance with constitutional requirements there is also growing awareness that the supreme courts antisegregation decrees cannot be permanently circumvented and above all the negro remains firmly determined to forge ahead unrelentingly in the struggle for full equality
the year  probably ™ £ will be known as the i t year of the passage of the first civil_rights legislation accommodations provision i expect that the bill will be passed in the second session of the present congress it will also are beginning to realize the potency of the races  billion purchasing power properly mobilizedthis immense economic force can open up new employment opportunities for negroes at all levels exploration should be made also of the further mobilization of the financial resources of the race to provide capital for retail businesses industrial and manufacturing ventures distributing systems and financial concerns there will be intensified economic action in  particularly in local communities there may also be calls for nationwide action against products the manufacturers or processors of which engage in discriminatory practices recent surveys reveal an increasing responsiveness among negro consumers to proposals for such action other important programs will be required in  to stem the excessively high unemployment rate among negro workers these include legislation to stimulate the economy to provide public works and to institute a massive retraining program for workers displaced by automation discrimination against negroes in apprenticeship training programs and skilled employment must be halted either by legislation court decisions or direct action certainly publiclyfinanced construction cannot continue to bar negroes from skilled jobs abolition of such discrimination is a  imperative in addition to political and economic action there will be important activities in other areas in the civil_rights struggle as the need arises there will be demonstrations to gain specific objectives the fight for open occupancy in housing privately financed as well as public will continue as will the struggle to eliminate segregation in education in nonsouthern states as well as in dixie the outlook for substantial civil_rights gains in  is as of this writing more promising than ever before there is a new national administration committed to civil_rights legislative and executive action and with presidential elections coming up an enlarged negro electorate will be able to exert greater influence in the political arena an increasing number of southern cities having learned well the lessons of birmingham and jackson are prepared to make adjustments in accordance with constitutional requirements there is also growing awareness that the supreme courts antisegregation decrees cannot be permanently circumvented and above all the negro remains firmly determined to forge ahead unrelentingly in the struggle for full equality
nineteen  sixty three has presented a confrontation with every american citizen as to the dimension of the problem the intensity and the alternatives no american can now be indifferent the future of race relations both immediate and long range will be dependent upon the response to that confrontation rights bill is not passed at a much accelerated pace even if the bill is passed demonstrations will be necessary to insure its implementation and enforcement in the new year there will be several new emphases in addition to those of the past  a drive will be made to broaden the base of support for the civil_rights revolution more allies will be sought from other minority groups and from sympathetic american whites  the revolution will move into an important new stage of noncooperation with segregation and discrimination the demonstrations will continue to exhibit and show the depth of feeling on this issue which exists in the negro community to increase motivation and unity among our ranks and to spotlight the problems for all america to see but in  expanded ranks and new allies will be urged in the words of thoreau to see to it that they do not lend themselves to the evil which they condemn in other words there will be selective buying on a larger scale than ever before investments will be withheld from institutions which subsidize and practice segregation the revolution will not be fully completed in  but it will be moved a full measure forward i predict further that president lyndon b johnson in spite of being a southerner will prove to have convictions and feelings in behalf of civil_rights at least equal to any of his predecessors we will not always agree with him and will not approve at all times of his actions at such times we will of course say so but i expect him to be a positive force in the civil_rights situation rather than a negative one
let us all be black together
i am your child and yet i v alien from you you £ are comfortable educated negroes uninvolved in movements  j mtu and that sort of stuff and you have made me comfortable well groomed soontograduatefromcollege but we are different as different as black and white this feeling of alienation came upon me when i returned to home and school in the north after a summers work with the student nonviolent coordinating committees voter registration projects in georgia and mississippi i left a place where people risked their jobs and personal safety so that  they could vote and returned to one where the right to vote was uncontested and people wouldnt even try to develop significant black political strength i left a place where people shared food with me when there was not enough for their own families and came back to one where negroes have to be cajoled with the promise of a picture in the newspaper so that they will give to help their own people a place where social workers say you know we actually go out in the streets and talk to those people and i felt alone why what happened one answer has presented itself i learned in that summer of dirt roads pavement ends where the negro section begins jail demonstrations efforts to help people see that they had a right to vote and mass meetings that i am black while you in your minds are white i am black in that i am proud of my roots in africa and in slave america and in that i am involved in the fight for the wellbeing of black people you are white in that you live and operate within a framework of white values many of which are not applicable to the condition of our people most of us are pretty tightly bound to the negro race and to its progress or lack of progress some may escape into a white world by way of intelligence money or luck but most will remain bound together by the ghettos by customs by color like it or not at this point in time in history negroes and whites are not alike the differences go much deeper than mere color we are a different group of people we are not the economically stabilized socially developed group that isif we are to believe the sociologiststhe white americans whether we are to believe them or not is a color of another horse what is important is that this concept of what americans are has led to the adoption and maintenance of values which are not applicable to us we cannot be highly stable secure people when negro unemployment is twice as high as that for whites when  counties in mississippi have less than two negro voters each when in greenwood miss negroes have no access to a public library when men make  a day picking cotton in season and children are taken out of school to work in the cotton fields we are not this stable group and yet your values are those of such a group for example you have asked or will ask how can we insist that a man serve us at his own lunch counter the answer is that private property is inviolable only if the society is so highly developed that most property needs are taken care of this is not so for us right now people are preparing in mississippi in alabama to bcold and hungry because winter is here the value of the privacy of property  cannot be strongly held by people in such a situation such a value must be generously mixed with the proposition that as long as what you have affects me and my serious need i have some influence to exert over it many of you are afraid to go to jail because you have built up in you a respect for law the respect is good but the laws being attacked were made without any consideration of you and are enforced to keep you down why should i respect a law whereby i could not even walk with nine people outside the negro section of albany ga there is another white value held by you which is of great importance at this point the term white must be qualified a strict division of black people and white people is not meant the reference to white values is to values of the large part of american society which is white that is that every man should go for himself this ideal holds well if most men are able to satisfy their needs but consider the fact that many men in our social group are not able to do for themselves in the first case the white case the social group can maintain itself and grow using the every man for himself value but in the second such a rule is senseless now in the light of our disenfranchisement in the south poor schools everywhere joblessness it is into this second case that we fall and the point is that the negro people cannot flourish and develop if we hold to the value that everyone should make it on his own that is a white idea appropriate perhaps for a white society certainly inappropriate for a black one we must instead make it a value to help one another continuously this may be taken religiously but that is not my emphasis the emphasis is on a more worldly point  that you must become black a legitimate response to this cry of alienation is that one should expect to be alone when he becomes involved in a cause but the issue is not really the aloneness rather it is that we cannot afford its source your white values we must be black together if we are not to run this race in vain 
mister ambassador
c t rowan is a yearold new  frontiersman who for the last eight months has been the united states ambassador here when he flew into town last may  he began a whirlwind round of what might be called total diplomacy carrying the message of america to as many finns as he could reach in the shortest possible time helsinki has been used to a more traditional diplomatic approach and mr rowan promptly broke all the traditions taking the capital by storm but he would have taken helsinki by storm in any case for carl rowan happens to be a negro in fact the news of his appointment had set all finland buzzing not because of any racial prejudice for none is evident but because of a curiosity about a race rarely seen here and so the press informed the nation on the rowans arrival that the ambassador and his sons are chocolate brown and that his wife is considerably lighter but it was soon apparent that the finns felt that color aside this ambassador was definitely out of the ordinary he went on a constant round of speeches travel receptions bull sessions bowling golfing and taking the steam with university students and others in the sauna mr rowan is convinced that as a spaceage envoy he should undertake anything that might help provide a broader understanding of america and what it stands for the usual career ambassador in helsinki quietly settles into diplomatic routine after the stripedpants procedure of presenting credentials and paying ceremonial calls upon fellow diplomats and finnish officials but mr rowans traditions are not from the world of diplomacy he was catapulted into his ambassadorship after  years as a newsman and two as a state department custodian of press relations as deputy assistant secretary of state for public affairs hurtling into diplomacy with all the furious energy of a kennedy election campaign the fledgling ambassador  crammed five major speeches into his first six weeks along with three forays into the finnish hinterland to pay official visits to southwestern and northern cities from the outset newspapers and magazines featured pictures of the ambassador of his wife vivien sons yearold carl jr and  yearold geoffrey and miniature greyhound gomez many of the pictures were of diplomatic activity finns had never seen before his excellency was shown for example walking atop an iron fence with his boys or hunting through a neighbors back yard for a baseball while the lady of the house hung up the wash a popular magazine after his first week here ran a feature article headlined the most colorful ambassador in helsinkia headline that caused mr rowan to toss his head back in laughter at the end of his first month however he was happy to note that his whirlwind brand of diplomacy was beginning to be reported without reference to his race but he says even in that first month when finnish newspapers almost invariably described him as darkskinned he only rarely had any consciousness here of being a negro the few times that he did were when he listened to voice of america or bbc broadcasts on race riots in the united states or when he had to discuss them at news conferences he won admiration for declaring that he was not ashamed to speak of the riots even though they were a national disgrace he stressed that the negroes of america had made great progress in the last two decades and that they now had more government support than ever before at the same time finnish newsmen who had the opportunity to participate in a bull session with him were flabbergasted by his willingness to tell stories at his own expense about his experiences as a negro in the united states one that caused special astonishment was an account of mowing the lawn of the house he had while he was with the state department in washington a white woman driving a big car pulled up to hail him as boy and ask how much he charged his only pay for mowing the lawn he replied was the privilege of sleeping with the lady of the house mr rowan surprised helsinki in other ways as well he does not give the impression in closeup of an aggressive personality likely to make a fastpaced debut as an ambassador heavy set he seems to move almost languidly speaking  with a slow drawl bearing the stamp of his native tennessee he seems much older than his  years he says he grew old at an early age he was in his late teens before he set out from his redclay home town of mcminnville tenn where he had romped barefoot along » streets filled with sharp stones these days he sometimes looks i  i i ii  speculatively at his two sons about the best dressed boys in helsinki and wonders if they will ever amount to anything for they have never had to go barefoot he left mcminnville with  cents in his pocket carrying his clothes in a cardboard box his road led first to a summer job in a nashville hospital then to a negro college and it being wartime on to a united states navy officer training school as one of the first negroes to be admitted under what was then a new policy he was the only negro in a class of  he says and that ages you fast but world war ii in which  yearold ensign rowan served as a communications officer on two vessels in the atlantic turned out to be his big break it got me out of the race situation for it led to his move north he went on to win his bachelors degree from oberlin college in ohio his masters from the university of minnesota and a job with the minneapolis tribune on which he achieved acclaim for his reporting on the negro in the south and on social conditions in india and other asian countries his articles became the bases for three books he received honorary doctorates from simpson college in iowa and hamline university in minnesota attracting the attention of president kennedy he was appointed to the state department in february  named ambassador early this year he came to helsinki determined to judge for himself whether there was justification for the suspicions often encountered in washington about finnish relations with the neighboring soviet union he was not content to let the usual circle of business and uppercrust finns and some other selected leaders dominate embassy functions in a bid to talk to as many finns as possible he is struggling to gain something of a conversational ability in the exceedingly difficult finnish language since most people in this farmerdominated northern country speak only finnish he said in an interview that he had nothing against the elite he and his wife like culture and good cognac as well as the next people he declared but he thinks that the revolutionary changes that the world has undergone in the last two decades have also changed the requirement of diplomacy making it necessary for the spaceage ambassador to reach the masses in a great variety of ways it is just as much an ambassadors job to go bowling golfing or to a track meet he said as it is to go to the endless number of teas and diplomatic receptions finns in general appear to be impressed and pleased with ambassador rowan and his accent on public relations one official has already compared him with john moors cabot now united states ambassador to poland who has been highly popular wherever he has served because of his insistence  on meeting and discussing america and its ideals with as many people as he could managehere in the early nineteenfifties and subsequently in sweden colombia and brazil mr rowan has also made a deep impression here with his speeches which he writes himself aware though he is of finlands delicate position between east and west he deems it his duty nevertheless to express his countrys views without equivocation and so in a speech in which he decried the sovietled assault on the united nations he suggested that it had been mounted because of clear evidence that the uncommitted peoples these new members of the un have by and large exactly the same goals as do the people of the united states and the rest of the free world such remarks would scarcely seem extraordinary in the united states but to many finns accustomed to the increasingly careful finnish pronouncements of recent years they appeared a bit startling though welcome what does mr rowan hope to accomplish here he has no grand strategy but already his pattern of diplomacy is clear his is a mission largely to the finnish masses but he also wants to get on such a casual basis with finnish government leaders that he can telephone for an appointment just to chat and not only when he has official business to transmit the ambassador apparently can take partial credit for one of the most significant publicrelations triumphs the united states has ever scored in finland the outpouring of proamerican sentiment by the unexpectedly large and enthusiastic crowds that greeted vice president johnson during his september visit before leaving washington for helsinki mr rowan had pressed hard for more attention to finland by highlevel americans going abroad the johnson visit was said to be an indirect result of this in general besides trying to enhance if possible the already excellent finnishamerican relations mr rowan wants to be aware and make washington aware of any way in which the united states can act to assist the finns in achieving their fundamental goal of maintaining their independence this he said may mean doing nothing but for a man with a record of vigorous action doing nothing appears unlikely
reminiscences of a white man
for a long time it seems f  the people of this coun£ try have listened to g what the white man «carcsx said a bout the negro you got the feeling that it didnt make very much difference what the negro said about himself and of course no one cared what the negro said about the white now the tables appear to be turned whites and negroes alike are listening to what the negro says about the negro and what he says about the white as well they may not like what the negro saysthey may not even like to listenbut they have to listen and they do its possible that no one is really concerned about the experiences of whites any more about how and why they react to negroes it was this lack of concern that caused me to begin to do some thinking of my own experiences with negroes i began to wonder how typical they were and if i were to talk about them what they would sound like would they seem hypocritical or immature or prejudiced or oldfashioned or what at first i tried to think of significant things you know what vital impressions did i have from my childhood and adolescence but  could only remember a few and in retrospect they didnt seem nearly so consequential but i thought id jot them down and mull them over a bit for example i recall that in college i debated whether to ask a negro girl out for a date it was a particular negro girl and she was very pretty but i suddenly decided against it because i realized i had thought of her as a symbol and not as a person a few years later when i did have my first date with a negro she wasnt nearly so pretty and the party was stilted and boring not because of her being there in any sense but just because it was a dull party and i never asked her out again because we just didnt click several years ago i was at a small gathering on a hot stuffy cleveland ohio night except for my date and myself and one white husband of a negro girl the guests were all negro a lawyer and his wife an urban league counselor half a dozen others we were sitting around some on the floor and a few in chairs drinking beer and munching fritos listening to some faraway jazz on the record player suddenly i became aware of a new note in the room a tone of hostility an edge of tensionid never felt this before the conversation had slid from the comfortable agreement on race relations and the unfair treatment by whites to a deep hurt resentment the talk had left its intellectual level and was crying out in anguish even the vocabulary had changed the speech was no longer crisply northern but was slurred and casual i recognized that my skin had been forgotten that the heat and liquor and generations of hurt had conspired to bring to the surface a side of my friends which i had never seen before which produced a strange feeling of confused guilt within me and made me unhappy in knowing that a door was barred to me for me it was a weird experience one which ive never been able to communicate in words to anyone who had not also experienced it i was looking into a deep abyss and could not see the bottom but i still knew that my friends were staring at me from that abyss and i didnt know how to meet their eyes the topsyturvy evening quickly righted itself and we were soon deep in a discussion of the city government but i never forgot the look into that abyss what am  trying to say can any of you help me when i was in seventh grade i lived in a moderately wealthy long island community where negroes entered only through the back door and very few people ever thought about an alternative one day it was on the lawn of our house perched on a small rise and looking into a lovely green canyon that i had a furious argument with a temperamental redheaded friend named frank cummings frank insisted that negroes were as intelligent as whites and i insisted that he was wrong suddenly he shouted oh you stupid bastard and he jumped on his bike and shot away i guess i was a stupid bastard because i later learned that he was right but at the time i was confused and upset i cant pretend it was a major factor in my development but it occurred over twenty years ago and i still can recall the incident vividly i wonder if frank ever realized the chain of thinking that his furv instigated in the days when maids were  a month every thursday and every other sunday off we had a regular girl my parents decided once to hire a negro girl and i hated her because she pushed me around like none of the white girls had ever done they got a second negro when the first left and this one was worse i swore to them at least as a sixyearold can swear that i hated all negroes and never wanted another negro maid did this early experience scar me from liking negroes forever i dont think sosomehow those girls just didnt belong to the category negro but to the category maid psychologists have frequently pointed out that actual contact with members of a group seems to determine attitudes less than the learning that occurs through the parents alberts father was a gardener for a familv near our home and the entire gang of fifthgraders played football together in a nearby park no one ever questioned alberts right to play with us albert was the fastest most agile and most likely to fumble and he was usually picked second or third out of the eight or ten of us who gathered together one day albert tried a  takeout block he missed and rolled over several times then he began to holler and shriek and writhe snaking along the grass on his legs his thighs his buttocks his head everything but his feet he groaned and cried and yelled and the tears were streaming down his face anxiously we crowded around him trying to find out what he had broken his head or his leg finally he stopped his gyrations long enough to look at us through the gushing tears i swallowed my gum a moment later eight white boys and one negro boy were hollering shrieking writhing snaking along the grass other events stick out in my mind the first negro guest i had in my home when  was a college freshman and how concerned we all were that he feel at home i hope he did a year later i happened to be hitchhiking near his home in chester pennsylvania late christmas afternoon i called him and was quickly invited for turkey leftovers the home was in the shadows of some immense mills dirty and noisy and as l hitched back to baltimore that night i contemplated some of the inequities of life hes a medical doctor now i recall taking a couple of attractive white dancers to a small cabaret in the negro section of cleveland a squarebuilt negro entertainer little and lithe did a dance to the most raucous music ive ever heard and the dance itself was about as subtle as a striptease well one of the white girls got up and started to dance with him one of those wonderfully spontaneous things where the sex symbolism was so obvious that it was almost too real to be symbolic the place went wild and a few dollar bills floated down to the floor along with a lot of small change we tried again two saturdays later but you just cant recapture those things the first negro girl i made out withthe front seat of my car on a dimlylit street in front of her house each touch carrying the fear that her father or brother would peer out the window it was just like the times i made out with white girls the reverend james hargett used to be in honolulu before coming to los angeles one afternoon when we were chatting in his office he told me that a local negro not one of his parishioners came to see him in great distress he told the reverend that supposedlydemocratic hawaii had many people with racial prejudices and that even a little old japanese lady turned him away violently when he was looking for an apartment to rent the negro a lightishcolored fellow said that he asked to see the rooms whereupon the woman muttered in pidgin no room hereyou cuttype man and she drew her first finger across her throat then slammed the door little did the poor negro know that he was not suffering from antinegro feeling but that he was mistaken for a filipino a group in hawaii which has a reputation for knifefights and sporadic violent killing the irony was pointedthis negro receiving discrimination because someone thought he was not negro karamu theatre in cleveland has mixed casts in its shows and the casting is frequently done without any regard to skin color sometimes this leads to gross miscasting such as the dark negro woman who played a swedishamerican housewife with a thick pseudoscandinavian accent ineffectually disguising her georgia speech but one of my favorite stories was told to me by an actress at karamu a lovely and lightskinned negro girl who played a romantic role opposite a somewhat darkerskinned man one evening after the show a heavily rouged middleaged woman approached her and said pityingly i think you did very well my dear but how can you stand to play a love scene with a negro man my friend retorted casually because im a negro woman when last seen the matron was scurrying to the parking lot we never even had a chance to tell her that the male romantic wasnt negro but a white but my favorite story was told to me by two friends who lived in savannah georgia for a year marianne had hired a cleaning woman one day a week a person she contended was both more intelligent and better educated than most of her neighbors after a couple of weeks marianne and clare came to respect each other and they formed the habit of eating lunch together along with the baby greg and fouryearold sheila after about six weeks of this sheila announced abruptly at the weekly lunch mommy janie told me clare shouldnt eat with us we shouldnt have a nigger at the table mariannes heart disappeared through her shoes as her face colored like the setting sun clare stopped eating suddenly looked at her plate sheila then turned to her mother mommy whats a nigger clare and marianne laughed so hard they almost collapsed but with different parents sheilas learning in prejudice might have begun in earnest i also remember ralph bunche speaking at my college graduation eugenes concern when he took his family to tennessee to teach a white man in fort worth who contended that the bible didnt apply to negroes because they werent human the negro physician who lived in my lilywhite cleveland suburb and his daughters who made the most of their high school the allnegro audience at karamu that laughed at the wrong parts of take a giant step and threw my cues completely off the acute fear of a friend when we doubledated to a cleveland blackandtan spot josh white his cigarette tucked traditionally behind one ear talking and singing with us until four in the ayem whats the purpose in all these disjointed vignettes nothing of significancenothing with the impact of the negro contacts with the whitesnothing of the drama of the sitins im just trying to tell you some of the things that happened to me these may be typical of the middleclass selflabeledliberal collegeeducated white perhaps they irritate you perhaps they amuse you perhaps they have provided you with a few noteworthy insights into me
letter from an awol soldier
i am a negro a gi i v and awol having  lost some seventeen j  pounds in weight after suffering a recurrent chronic back ailment coupled with longlasting headaches generally feeling rundown and weak and not being able to get a long enough break to somewhat arrest my condition i then went over the hill awol after two weeks of rest and recuperation in seclusion the headaches are gone and ive regained most of my weight my chronic condition is also somewhat relieved during the idle hours of the past few days ive had a chance to thoroughly analyze myself as an american negro soldier and what i see amazes me i remember sitting in a classroom one morning during basic training after having just heard about the sunday morning bomb killing of four young negro children in birmingham on the radio listening to a white chaplain and an officer literally stand on their heads preaching the justices of democracy how we must defend our freedom if we want to remain free how we should be willing to lay down our lives to protect our country and our way of life i looked at them and marveled i wondered to no end in complete amazement how white democracy can deny a black man nearly all the rights they put him in uniform to defend while at the same time expect him to perform his duties ungrudgingly to a country and a system which seemingly strive to deprive him of his dignity and i wondered silently if all the white people in america thought i should be willing to let them send me to germany with an ml rifle in my hands to stand ready to guard the white germans freedom and liberty with my life or willingly let them send me to vietnam to perhaps die in defense of vietnamese and so that the oriental there could live in freedom when either a vietnamese or a white german could come to the shores of free america grasp from me the freedom which i went to his homeland and died for he would then be more free than i who have lived here through  years of slavery segregation lynching bombings discrimination patriotism and bravery through a civil and other wars and still i would be the hopeless rightless citizenless nigger at the bottom of the barrel    contented but then i realized that there  were few blacks in the class me being a rather dusty darkie im sure the sick disgust was quite evident on my face i wondered what the chaplain thought of my intelligenceif he thought i had any if he really thought id be willing to lay down my life for secondclass citizenship to prevent some enemy from taking it away from me and finally there being only a few blacks in class if he was at all aiming his talk at us we had quite a few of these orientations or brainwashing sessions as i secretly referred to them if a man is free and democracy is all the things they tell him it is and if he has lived it he will know it it would not be a necessity to constantly pound these things into his head at this late date if democracy meant everything to me they told me it does i would know it no one would have to tell me over and over again but then on the other hand maybe these orientations were aimed primarily at us darker ones many times i wonder about my shadowy future in america as a nineyearold child in the south i wondered i wondered when i went downtown with my mother to buy the weeks groceries why it was that we had to drink from a separate fountain one marked colored i wondered why we had to sit in a separate back room when she took me to see the dentist and why she called me back in anger when i went to peep through the divider at all the white people sitting in their section i also wondered why all the white people we passed on the streets looked at us that way and why my mother always dropped her head and would scowl at me for not doing likewise i wondered why we always went through the back door of the towns only drugstore and why i got slapped across the mouth when i asked mother why in front of white people she later explained apologizingly in a choking tone of voice we cant come through the front door son because were not white sensing the fright and hurt in her eyes i pretended to understand she patted me on the head and i held her hand tight as we walked back hometo protect her i thought from all the white people who wished her harm for reasons i did not understand and i wondered why my teacher punished me the next day at school when i refused to place my right hand over my heart lift my left hand and point it toward the flag pledging allegiance to it one nation under god with liberty and justice to all  i was at a loss to explain to her why i refused but something within my young mind held me back i was not bitter then for i did not understand then but today i am alert aware observant and i understand yet i harbor no bitterness only sadness grief and a desperate confused longing to know who i really am i am not a communist nor a black muslim though i cannot condemn all of that black sects teachings but i shall never in all the days of my sanity believe that we negroes will be able to push all the white people back into the sea then get on their vessels and sail back to africa from whence the white man stole us and give this land he stole from the indians back to them i am not a member of the communist party so i take it im not a communist however i find it difficult and confusing to distinguish the difference between the definitions of communism and democracy i am told that under a communist system a man is told where he may or where he may not work a man is told where he may or where he may not go a man is told where he may or where he may not live a man is told with whom he may or with whom he may not associate i was bom black am still black was told and am still told that i am living under a democracy which is in complete contrast to communist teachings one would have to be of rather minute intelligence if he is black and is not puzzled by these definitions when applied to his daytoday existing if it seems that my mind is twisted and warped and i am an idiot i extend to you my most humble apologies but i was born in america in the little backwoods  southern town of conway south carolina where racial discrimination and segregation kept me in the niggers place where each day meant a tougher fight than the day before to hang on to my pride and selfrespect where many a night my elders would pray to holy god that out of the coming of the black night would not commence a raid on our section of town by a group of white men who called themselves ku klux klan to remind us that their cruelty was our way of life because we were black and they were white that it was not so much for us to fear allmighty god but rather the allmighty white man if i am not yet ready for most of the human rights white people take for granted how then have they arrived at the conclusion that i am ready to serve in their army if i am told that my mere presence would lower the standards of their neighborhoods then it confuses me as to why my mere presence does not also lower the standards of their armed forces the question booming inside my mind now is not what the army will do to me when i get back for im sure ill receive whatever punishment white democracy will deem justified the question most frantically booming away inside my brain now is can i find the strength to serve a society which so boldly denies me most nearly all that which it says im obligated to preserve
a champions lost ambition
the day of the march on  washington for jobs £ and freedom my thoughts turned back  years to a day in  when as sports editor of the baltimore american i met a herford for the first time uncle al was the manager of joe gans who died in  and to this day still is rated the greatest lightweight champion of all time in boxing i visited with herford in his office and asked him why gans a negro was so deeply revered in his home town at the top of the south where negroes had little or no opportunity i had been in baltimore only a short time but already several boxing men had pointed out to me the open market where gans as a boy had scaled fish and shucked oysters the folly theater where he had his first fight and the goldfield hotel which he had built for negroes with his purse from a memorable round fight with battling nelson which he won on a foul at goldfield nev in  these places were spoken of almost as shrines the manager went to his safe and dragged out several large scrabooks filled with clippings and pictures of gans career which we pored over let me tell you a story that will answer your question he said joe was every inch a little gentleman he never flaunted his position and the white people loved him for his humility baltimore went wild when he won the championship with a oneround knockout victory over frank erne at fort erie in  telegrams of congratulation deluged us and informed us that a royal welcome awaited our return home with a band salute and street parade and a public dinner to follow as our train neared baltimore joe and i were seated opposite each other in a parlor car joe was wrapped in deep silence his sad expression even more doleful than usual  isnt it wonderful joe i asked being champion and all that it means to have all of those folks enthused about you and all of the money you are going to make ill bet your mother is proud of you joe didnt say anything for a long moment then he said wistfully yes mr herford it sure is wonderful but do you know what im thinking  what i asked  that id give it all upthe money the fuss the championship everythingfor just one thing  whats that i asked  for a white boys chance in the world 
paradise lost
and missiles fell upon g a v the earth  days and £   nights and they g blotted out all swarm  ing creatures and animals and birds of the air and fish of the waters and all mankind but two only mr sippi was left and the woman who was with him at the last bomb shelter on the earth now the woman was darkskinned and she stood in the front of the last bomb shelter on the earth and the man was whiteskinned and he sat in front of the last bomb shelter on the earth and because the skin of the woman was not white the man had enmity to ward her and he would not let her enter into the shelter for which he was the registrar he said unto her go to your own bomb shelter negra this shelter is for whites only but there was no other bomb shelter in all the earth for her to go to there was only one and it was segregated now the last missile on the face of the earth had been launched and even as the man spoke to the woman it was flying toward them from a distant land the men at that launching site had tried to launch another missile but it had exploded on the site blotting out the men and they had been the only living things left in that land and so it came to pass that the darkskinned woman and the whiteskinned man mr sippi the registrar were the only living things left on the face of the earth now there could have been other living things in the part of the earth where mr sippi was the registrar for his bomb shelter was a good bomb shelter and it would have given protection to those creatures who could have been in it for forty days and forty nights while missiles fell upon the earth but the shelter was in a part of the land where men and women were darkskinned and mr sippi would not let them enter into the shelter because it was segregated and so they were all blotted from the face of the earth the darkskinned creatures had had their own bomb shelter one for colored only and many had gone  into it before the first missile fell it was separate but not equal and it had caved in on them and blotted them out even before the first missile fell now mr sippi was a smart man and that was why he had given up the name of governor and taken the name of registrar so that he could be close to a bomb shelter and he knew that the missile was flying toward his part of the land and that any living person inside the shelter would not be hurt but still he would not let the darkskinned woman enter into the shelter because of the color of her skin the woman said unto him oh mr sippi suh if you do not let me into the shelter the last woman will perish from this earth and only you will remain and then you will die of old ageit is possible suhand all mankind will be blotted from the earth mr sippi said unto her i will go to jail before i integrate this bomb shelter the woman wailed unto him oh mr sippi suh let us go into the bomb shelter where it is safe and cleave unto each other and multiply and give new fruit to this destroyed land you will be a second adam and i will be a second eve now when mr sippi heard the words of the darkskinned woman his enmity became so great that he forgot about the falling missile and fell upon her with fire flashing in his eyes and the demon in his breast he smote her until she cried out  for mercy but he did not give her mercy he blotted her from the earth gods will be done he said and with his words the last missile fell on the last man on earth and blotted him out and the earth became again without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep

tom morgan bent his t p lanky body and g switched off the little  y portable radio there would be other news but none as vital as that first flash  papa what does it mean morgan looked down at his twelveyearold son it means he said carefully that in the fall youll be able to go to the white boys school his lean hard right arm dropped protectively around the boys thin shoulders joey twisted his neck to look up at the satinyblack face so like his ownthe proud jaw the generouslymoulded mouth the liquid black eyes were tranquil yet alive with intelligence and deep thought had left its tracings on the high forehead joey searched the face but could find nothing to justify his disturbed feeling he shifted his sneakered feet uneasily but the nameless fear kept growing to hide it from his father joey dropped his face and pulled away from his fathers arm he crossed the bare floor of the small living room away from his father away from the radio away from the lumpy slipcovered sofa where his mother sat nervously rolling and unrolling a corner of her apron joey sat down in the old wicker rocker and set it in motion the room was divided by two panels of dusk creeping through the unshaded windows facing the fields and was quiet except for the rhythmical creaking of the rocker then joey spoke above it i dont want to go to the white boys school his fathers deep voice was studiedly impartial its more uptodateyou could learn more i dont care joey rocked forcibly youd be a fullfledged doctor in no time the rocking stopped four years ago joey had gashed his hand chopping wood a dignified man with a black bag had come to the house immediately the man had stopped the pain with a big needle then sewed the cut with small measured stitches as dainty as his mothers prizewinning embroidery then and there joey made up his mind to be a doctor his mothers soft voice cut through with hands still fingering her apron and cocoavelvet cheeks flushed with anxiety she said tom the new lawit doesnt say a boy has to go to the school if he doesnt want to does it tom sighed he could understand even though he didnt entirely share ellas distrust of whites he sank down on the soft beside her gently his powerful black hands reached over stilled the quivering small brown ones lifting them both into one palm and covering them with the other ella he said joey isnt obliged to attend that schoolnot according to the state law but this country has a more powerful law    the rocker creaked as joey strained forward to hear the words were addressed to his mother but directed to him the declaration of independence continued tom rules that all men are created free and equal    words    words    words exploded ella snatching her hands away from toms they dont mean a thing ella tom said slowly remember the day i got my promotion in the air force those words had meaning then didnt they ella stared sullenly didnt they persisted tom that was different she mumbled not so different her husband pointed out then i took a step forward    now joey can help all our people take a step forward    think what this will mean to our little alice when shes ready for school the room was gloomy morgan snapped on the table lamp at his elbow and looked across at his son you see that dont you joey youd be helping alice and others like her the boy didnt answer isnt that what a doctors supposed to do prodded tom help people joey nodded reluctantly sat silently for a minute then flashed a smile of singular maturity at his father i will change schools he said quietly the summer slipped away and with it much of joeys courage his mother had a pinched look and she no longer laughed as she had before every night long after joeys nine oclock bedtime he could hear her shrill tones mixed with the low angry ones of his father with each passing day joey got more mixed up one minute he dreaded the opening day of school the next he could hardly wait for it finally it was at hand an unusual september morning for the south frostbitten and windy it was hardly dawn when his father called him so we can have a little talk before you leave he explained joey didnt mind he hadnt been asleep the water in the scarred tub was icy but joey bathed thoroughly then dressed with great care he had to be equal at least from the skin out the kitchen was cozy and warm and joeys favorite breakfast was on the rickety table but he couldnt  eat much and his mother ate nothing at all after breakfast with the wind whipping at the tiny window they got down on their knees ella morgan now oddly calm in a low sweet voice talked to the lord about her boy then tom said a few words they prayed a long time when they got to their feet joey saw that it was nearly time for the school bus he grabbed his cap and the presents from his parentsa shiny lunch box from his father a bright red pencil box from his mother he kissed them and started out the door his fathers husky voice called after him dont forget son were all gods children joey got on the school bus he was the only colored boy but the driver gave him a smile and a pleasant hello there joey sat down on the only empty seat next to one of the boys there was a snort of disgust as the boy untangled his crossed legs and lurched across joey in frantic haste to push out into the aisle from then on the fivemileride was a nightmare whispers scornful laughter and eyes that glared with hate at last the bus pulled up in front of the school through the window joey saw lines of people grownups girls boys some of them carrying signs his legs stiffened so that he could hardly get down the bus steps as he stalked through the crowd they pushed hooted and waved signs in his face joeys blurring eyes couldnt make out the words for some reason all he could think of was his fathers line were all gods children joey wondered    back in the little house ella morgan watched the clock when it was past the hour for the school bus she consulted her husband hes probably riding home with somebody we know tom suggested or maybe he decided to walk    you know how he loves to walk the afternoon deepened at dusk tom rose abruptly ill go and meet him as his loping stride carried him out of sight ella slipped to her knees to pray she couldnt leaping to her feet she flew out the door and down the road she had been running a long time when a station wagon pulled up at the wheel was josh brannon the white man from the big house on the hill he peered out curiously anything wrong mrs morgan hysterically ella gasped out the words with great kindness josh helped the trembling figure into the station wagon now he instructed cheerfully you catch your breath little lady    well find that boy of yours they raced along the dark road suddenly ella shrieked the car screeched to a stop at the side of the road on his knees was tom morgan in front  w of him was a small still form josh brannon had only to glance at tom morgan to know the man was in shock he was staring blankly at his boy ella screamed piteously as she rushed at her child brannon pulled her away and felt for a pulse it was faint but joey was alive tenderly he gathered up the little figure and called sternly to ella and tom this boys got to get to a hospitalhurry ella pulled her dazed husband into the station wagon    as the doctors carried joey into the emergency room brannon put his arm around ella and led her to a bench joey will be fine he said but joey wasnt fine joey morgan was dead the doctor told them death had come from a welldirected rock  thrown with such force it had crashed halfway through the skull ella was stunned dead she kept repeating you mean joeys gone and wont be back   you mean hes not here that hes in heaven brannon fought back tears yes he said im sure hes in heaven but brannon was wrong joey was not in heaven not quite at that moment he stood before the pearly gates his name had just been given to the recording angel who went to tell st peter its joey morgan reported the recording angel age twelve st peter looked down the pages of the golden book you must be mistaken he said it couldnt be joey morgan the recording angel insisted i just talked with the boy    cording to the book a doctor joey he spelled his name for me morgan was to be welcomed here st peter looked bewildered at the age of  one year after he thats very strange he said ac discovered the cure for cancer

mitch came out of the cool dimness of the bar and started down the block to the bus stop the city heat which seemed sticky and grimy was reflected off the pavements scarcely tempered by a slight breeze which was itself hot and dusty beer always relaxed him and he walked loosely jauntily with an athletes grace full of confidence in his own youth and power he came up to the bus stop with a casual arrogance hardly noticing the people loosely grouped around he thought of the letter in his pocket the committee has voted to make available to you  a year in europegoddamn the spook halfback isnt doing so bad all you had to do was to learn to manoeuvre in their world speak their language    his hand went automatically to the back pocket of his jeans for the book which he had found as necessary a part of the use of the transit system as the token the book was by some white psychologist who had probed into the psyche of an old tribal chief in south africa and seemed to have been shocked to death at the levels of conscious disguised and subliminal hate that his probings had disclosed and him a psychologist too mitch thought sourly the white mans innocence syndrome again such incredibly childish and outrageous naivete serves him right what in hell else did he expect he found the book a trifle obvious unless of course you were ofay in which case you could be discomfited by the africans image of yourself and your world mitch knew that he wasnt really reading the book that while his eyes leaped over the words his mind was detached he became aware that he was in fact brandishing the book it made a symbol because of the angry bold words of the title and the corrugated black face at once barbaric and pathetic which adorned the jacket the picture of the chief with his collapsed untidy old mouth which even bitterness couldnt firm up and his ancient and murderous eyes was startling strange how fidgety people could become when confronted with anything real like hate and death or any symbol of these things its like white americans when confronted with anything negro that wont fit the accepted justifications and myths    maybe it is just because they have been too insulated too wellfed have been made to feel too fraudulently secure entombed and comforted in the pink and white pastel blandness of their white society for too long that a thing like a snarling black face can disturb them mitch thought and closed the book the knowledge that he himself was compensating projecting being smug feeling superior was amusing hell he had every right to his own prejudices and resentments like everyone else he let his glance deliberately and overtly challenging rove over the faces of the people around him at the bus stop the usual city groupthe same gray armoredup faces and the same shabby perpetually soiled look that the nonaffluent members of the affluent society seemed to wear like a membership badge in some secret organization that existed for the perverse pleasure of giving the lie to the societys assumptions mitch noticed with some disappointment that nobody appeared affected by his defiant glanceand such arrogance in the gesture too like a flamenco dancer or a matador and no one noticed so remote and tired they seemed so damned remote and tired each one turned in on himself completely caught up in the closed backreaches of his own concern the community of the city hah how mechanical somehow listless and enervated they were mitch found himself changing position quickly and impatiently as though by doing so he could assure himself that he was as yet undefeated and vital and that there was a force an energy in him that would not let him be still he recognized his posturing for what it was and grinned sardonically at himself you shouldnt have to prove it baby you dont have to prove a thing whats it bouf said in the blacks they arent really white but shades of pink and yellow and grey he began to amuse himself by staring openly at his companions to see how accurate that pronouncement was that little man christ hes bright yellow probably takes the sun at coney island with a fat shapeless wife and a horde of kids on sundays and two little boys discussing da movies in adenoidal brooklynese they were colorless their faces marked by an urban pallor a girl in her early teens standing slightly knockkneed her braced teeth chomping on a wad of gum her hair in curlers stood gazing vacantly at nothing she was whitish and pink in streaks and patches mitch noted and in a few years she will probably be beautiful or at least chic from nine to five anyway until she gets married then back to baggy shorts and daytime curlers then he saw the woman she was tall and wellfleshed with a strong wellformed face mitch looked into her frank gray eyes and looked away surprised she had actually seen him actually looked at him this sudden and totally unexpected contact surprised him he retained the image of rounded womanly arms a simple sleeveless cotton dress belted at the waist like an ancient greek tunic and light sunstreaked blond hair preparing himself he allowed his eyes to move methodically across the group until he was looking directly at her the sunlight shone off her hair and dress and she appeared strangely clean her face untouched by makeup she returned his gaze from eyes that upset him by their unexpected serenity he realized grudgingly that she was not to be easily reduced to selfconsciousness and he returned to looking at his book she is he thought a wholesome looking woman but it isnt the neuter kind of sterile wholesomeness that madison avenue uses to sell its beer and cigarettes no its something more personal a fullysexed carnal cleanness that is altogether outofplace among such soiled looking city people he tried to engross himself in his book but he could not forget the alert liveliness of the womans eyes oh well i guess some of us manage to retain some humanity he thought yet for some reason the womans tranquility jarred him she defied the neat compartments into which it was his habit and his defense to fit and therefore dispose of all white people hell they were either smug deluded and completely out of touch with their own existence or hyperanxious and neurotic this woman clearly did not fit into such categories his reflections were broken by a new sound introducing itself into the steady drone of the street noises a little negro man very drunk who might have been  years oldthe signs of his drinking showed too plainly in the destroyed facewas babbling at the woman youre a nish girl    ah like you    dont you like me have a drink now he was leaning on a signpost precariously close to the woman offering her his flat bottle half full of a vellow wine mr here baby have a drink he insisted dribbling saliva youre a nish girl lets have a drink uh a tense silence held the crowd for a minute nobody seemed to want to look at the drunk except for two little boys who were grinning two middleaged women were now a part of the crowd mitch hadnt seen them join the group but somehow they had become conspicuous backs stiff stringy necks bristling with a suppressed yet communicated outrage they stared up the street with their lips moving silently yeah mitch thought disgraceful disgraceful what is the world coming to i agree with you you old hags the drunks voice was growing louder its initial wheedling intimacy beginning to harden into anger mitchs first impulse was to laugh the woman was so much taller appeared so much stronger than the wasted little drunk that his approving almost condescending youre a nish girl was funny but it wasnt really funny oh well maybe she is his girl mitch thought snickering at the absurdity of the idea and if she isnt its like the man said tis a consummation devoutly to be wished it wasnt working the mental wisecracks did not relieve the embarrassment he felt growing and his anger at himself for feeling vulnerable and compromised by the actions of some drunken negro he didnt know fed his discomfort  the woman was behaving rather well he observed with a twinge of resentment she had pulled herself erect stepped away from the drunks breath but she had not lost her composure she caught mitchs glance and her eyebrows arched in a tolerant whatcanido expression which whatever it was supposed to do only succeeded in crystallizing mitchs anger he jerked his eyes away furiously dont look at me bitch im not involved he wanted to say the other people at the bus stop were stubbornly maintaining their detachment nothing was their business yeah but what are they thinking the slobs heres food for all the prejudices you want and need so badly to cling to mitch thought something to go home and tell your friends about and cluck over and to remember on the day i come into the neighborhood the drunken monotone continued ranging in a pathetic burlesque between courtship and rape at once threatening and cajoling youre a nish girl    dont you like me the drunks mind seemed finally to register the snickers of the two boys a humiliating testimony to his own presumptuousness and ineffectuality his voice grew louder his stance mockmenacing and he tried to introduce a note of toughness into his voice he appeared to want to walk away but now that the incident had become public he seemed unable to do this or to accept the rejection that only his drunkenness could have disguised as less than inevitable he tried to threaten not gonna ask you again gawddam have a drink he waved his bottle belligerently ish good stuff i tol you we kin have fun dont you like me stop it you stupid sonofabitch mitch thought stop it you are giving them excuses still he felt an unreasonable compassion for the little man if only the bitch seemed threatened how goddamn composed she is he found himself wishing that it was night that the area was secluded that the drunk was niggerbig razorscarred and evillooking what would happen to her goddamned miss ann composure then he thought and yet she was reacting with unusual patience leave her alone man dont do this to yourself to her hit her rape her anything but stop that goddamned whining stop begging not like that man not like that and you white woman be disgusted or uncomfortable or best of all afraid but not so damned unreachable at least recognize his existence some other way call a cop even another headwhipping in the basement of some precinct wouldnt scar the poor drunk as deeply as this public evidence of his own futility then hed be a threat or even a pestsomething to be stamped on but he would have broken in he would be something the drunk was trying to be mean now his voice grew louder and he caught the woman by the arm desperately trying to be tough to evoke some reaction but in his bleary eyes were tears maybe from the dust and glare maybe from shame at the absurdity of his role watching him mitch knew sickly that this was no new role for the little man the woman gently disengaged her arm from the drunks grip and walked to the other side of the bus stop nearer to mitch she managed as she did this to give the impression that she was acting more for the drunks protection than for herself the drunk stood gaping at his empty hand then removing the cap from the bottle took a long drink letting the wine run down his stringy neck he stood in the middle of the sidewalk shaking his head and noisily clearing his throat there was a look of foolish drunken bewilderment on his face as he stood there blinking and now mitch saw that his late victim was looking at him with concern disgust he thought angrily or anger thats what you are supposed to feel not pity its way too late for your pity way too late for that oh hell if he starts again i should stop him she doesnt deserve to be molested and embarrassed still he knew and was confused by the knowledge that had the drunk struck her hed have been outraged he would have stopped him and been truly sorry and maybe even felt a little guilty but he would not have been sickened in quite the same way oh goddamn this messedup schizophrenic rubbleheap of a society this stupid screwedup accumulation of inherited guilt and hate and endless retribution for that poor conflicted ineffectual drunk incapable of being lover or defiler destroyed denied full growth and in his warpedness not even malignant enough to evoke disgust what is left him and the woman why did she have to be embarrassed and me caught in the middle between them mitch looked at the drunk a shabby forlorn figure now as he stood outlined in the glare ten yards away isolated when the drunk passed his hand over his face his eyes cleared for a moment and mitch felt the physical presence of vulnerability and sadness that somehow shone from his eyes in a sudden moment of clarity it passed and he was coming over to the group again mumbling and slobbering his face set in lines of drunken stubbornness the sunyellowed little man saw him coming and a look of hesitance flickered across his face then apparently reaching a decision he started toward the drunken negro oh a defender of white womanhood too mitch muttered now where does this little schmuck think hes goingto set things in their proper perspective aloud he said easy pal just stay where you are ok and he caught the wouldbe knight reassuringly by the arm  his grip as strong as he could make it and he noticed the man wince as he checked his movement mitch wasnt sure why he stopped the man except that it was action a way of declaring himself but he felt certain that the man was grateful at being spared any involvement above all mitch did not want the drunk to swallow another defeat and at the hands of such a seedylooking little white man he stepped deliberately in front of the blond woman then his back almost touching her making it impossible for the drunk to reach her he folded his arms and pretended to read  scush me man gotta see someone mitch pretended not to hear the drunks voice grew angry as he became aware of what mitch was doing ah said outta ma way man whats the matter anyway oh oh im sorry sir excuse me mitch did not move whaddya tryin to do man who do you think you are anyway the drunk sounded really indignant now suspecting that mitchs action was telling him that he was making a fool of himself triggered the first anger that mitch had noticed in him mitch realized that he was glad to see this change it was a hell of a lot better than the shamed halfservility halfanger of a few moments before he felt a fierce compassion for the little man yet he knew that he would hit him if it became necessary now whos defending white womanhood he thought bitterly and something close to hatred rose in him for this woman who had done nothing but be white and desirable man dont do it please dont do it i dont want to have to   mitchs voice was low insistent almost a whisper for some reason he did not want the woman standing just behind him to hear it was very important that she did not dont do what what are you talking about the drunk demanded with drunken truculence outta mah way jes who the fugg do ya think ya are he was obviously finding in mitch a more legitimate object for his wrath mitch wanted to throw his arm across the thin shoulders to lead him away and to say be cool man im with you dont do this to yourself dont do it to me like we stand together man lets forget it instead he stood in front of the little drunk feet spread arms folded feeling his face harden and his eyes growing hostile the bus was stopping behind him he heard the doors open and people entering the drunk looked past him and something much like relief reflected in his eyes to be immediately replaced with blustering anger he started to speak and mitch cut him off mister he said im not sure what i did to you but im sorry i really am he tried to make his voice and manner convey diffidence if i can only give this cat back something he thought the drunk contemplated the sudden capitulation blankly for a few seconds scarcely able to hide his surprise and confusion mitch wondered how long it had been since anyone had thought enough of the derelict to be scared of him youre lucky the drunk growled jus never try to be so lucky again youre one real lucky young punk messing wid me hah he punctuated the last phrase with a jabbing finger thanks thanks sir mitch said as he stepped into the bus through the window he saw the drunk point a final warning finger in his direction before turning away poor screwedup little guy probably feels real tough now mitch found a seat and immediately riveted his eyes to the book he couldnt shake the engulfing sense of personal loss and of being somehow diminished himself excuse me her voice was clear but hesitant i just wanted to thank you for    she broke off when mitch shook her hand from his wrist and levelled into her eyes a steady hostile stare i hope you dont think i did you any service miss their eyes locked for a short time and mitch wondered does this broad think im going to apologize for the drunk does she think i did it for her cant she understand that it might have been for the drunk or for me or even for the goddamned race but not for her he felt like the betrayer of some vaguely understood bond his mind groped frantically for the word the gesture some way to establish clearly to her and himself that he had acted only out of a desire to save something of the drunks pride to keep him from another encounter with the white mans jail but he could only glare into her earnest gray eyes under the seething inarticulate fury of the glare she flushed slightly and lowered her eyes somewhat appeased mitch continued the pretense of reading scowling down at the book mister i think you might not have understood and what might i not have understood miss he stared at her again that and her voice faltered again before his mute hostility that ii think i understand i dont blame him oho she understands he thought what the hell does she understand a generous compassionate tolerant white woman well shes either too late or too early who in hell needs her compassion or understanding hope she chokes on it dont you think you should blame him miss no man has the right drunk or otherwise to molest a woman or is his case special the woman looked astonished no no she said i just mean that well that it wasnt his fault    it wasnt mine either oh lady how could anything be your fault i dont know what you are talking about mitch rudely changed his seat asking himself as he got up now what the hell are you mad about now
james baldwin the writer
i am the man i suffered i was there runs the quotation from whitman that introduces the reader to james baldwins second novel giovannis room then what did he bring back and if suffering can be said to have a depth how deeply did he suffer the answers are to be found in his books and more recently in his meteoric rise as a public figure i know these questions in an article on a writer printed in a writers journal could be answered very simply if somewhat evasively by merely listing baldwins accomplishments in the field mentioning a few anecdotes about his personal life and quoting a handful of his multitudinously pithy sentences this would be a relatively harmless albeit academic approach and the result would be appallingly innocuous at best a kind of childs garden of james baldwin at worst the deadly list of a pallid bibliographer or a landscape architect i choose a more personal track in the hope that with luck i might accidentally succeed in giving the reader a little of the feeling of the man i suppose this is to venture into a nomans land to move out precariously beyond the wire and to hope however naively that whatever fire i may draw will be badly aimed my point of departure is some years back in denver before i met james baldwin although i knew and greatly admired his work which at that time consisted of two novels go tell it on the mountain and giovanni s room and two collections of essays notes of a native son and nobody knows my name his powerful third novel another country was nowhere in sight except for a few oddments scattered throughout the quarterlies and the vitriolic yet loving indictment of america the fire next time hinted at in small asides in most of his essays was not as yet a glint in anybodys eye that time in denver at which i have chosen to begin i was sitting in a grubby bar drinking too much beer and smoking too many cigarettes the piano player who sometimes blew a sweet coronet and dug around in the bass of the piano accompanying himself with his left hand had just launched into a blues of his own composition his name was kenny whitson he wore an auburn goatee short cropped hair and his eyes were  very bright and intelligent he sang a little off key in a flat nasal voice          you got to lissen to yousef ever time you talk if it aint the truth brother then turn you back and walk i was struck by these blues and writing about baldwin now with three novels and three collections of essays to his credit a collection of short stories to be published this fall and also his first play it seems to me that if these blues were meant for any living writer they were meant for him he does listen to himself painfully im sure and carefully sifts out as much truth as he can get hold of and nobody not even the very saintly gets a full dose he listens sounding himself and his rage and pain his courageous hope and loving concern all the seasons of his emotions are lucidly contained in his straightforward and gracious and aristocratic prose a prose without peer in contemporary english and graphically embodied in nearly every national magazine from mademoiselle to life to the cover of time we have a visual record of the man and his passion during his grueling whistlestop stumping for the congress on racial equality core baldwin has had the audacious tenacity to explore and attack two of our most sacrosanct totems sex and color and if he has like any writer approached his subjects with a revolutionary attitude still he has written about them with all the tenderness integrity love and courage befitting his care for america his concern for its destiny and future there is no easy way for americans to think about the subjects of color and sex because americans are used to thinking about both topics only as americans the only way we can think and we are an odd race whether the opiate is religion or sex gin or beer lsd or hallucinatory mushrooms we always find an excusecalling it a reasonan alley in which to hide or a diaper with which we gird our barely controlled loins we wear armor when we should go naked when silence is all that is required work because leisure causes anguish and fall asleep when labor is demanded all this is not meant to suggest that americans are somehow more stupid or less enlightened than say the french the swedish or the japanese rather as baldwin has pointed out innumerable times i want to suggest that no matter what your particular country may be there is always the special and unique problem of having to reevaluate the institutions of your land in terms of yourself not in the terms laid down by society as constituting your self social institutions and rules are i suppose always normative but when they become sacred and totemic they are totalitarian and dictatorial and what makes the initial venture in the examined life another country entirely so difficult and dangerous and often fruitless and destructive is that when one comes to criticize the totems of say sex and color one is immediately confronted with a seemingly insoluble dilemma you discover you are thinking in precisely those terms which the cause of your enquiry has already rejected as inadequate but this is if i understand him the journey baldwin has invited each of us to undertake the unexamined life is not worth living i conceive of my own life as a journey towards something i do not understand which in going toward makes me better he wrote in nobody knows my name i conceive of god in fact as a means of liberation and not a means of control and in the fire next time he returns to the concept of god grown totemic in the intervening years if the concept of god has any validity and any use it can only make us larger freer and more loving if god cannot do this then it is time we got rid of him james baldwin is a thin short man he is in his late thirties his face is a long oval his lips thick and broad and his two front teeth are divided by a gap his mouth is as conrad wrote of kurtzs voracious and his eyes are lively protruding from his head as if squeezed out by their thick lids it is his voice that surprises you at first then it is his concentration and the passion with which he delivers his sentences he speaks softly as if off the top of his soft palatte his rs come out as ahs his os with an aish sound and his face is softly composed almost maleable in its expressions but hard and determined from listening to himself he speaks easily and clearly and he is always willing to say that he hasnt an easy answer to that one or that his interlocutor is confused the terms are wrong we cant talk clearly about that    yet and his face may break into a broad warm smile or he may laugh with a visceral ebullience peculiarly his own he is a beautiful man and a very brave one and a writer we should all be proud of especially when he presses our faces into slops of our own making in one of his finest essays a love letter to norman mailer called the black boy looks at the white boy baldwin makes a distinction marking out the difference between mailer and himself that will later appear as one of the fundamental axioms of the fire next time there is a difference though between norman and myself in that i think he still imagines he has something to save whereas i have never had anything to lose or perhaps i ought to put it another way the things that most white people imagine that they can salvage from the storm of life is  really in sum their innocence it was this commodity precisely that i had to get rid of at once literally on pain of death i am afraid that most of the white people i have ever known have impressed me as being in the grip of a weird nostalgia dreaming of a vanished state of security and order against which dream unfailingly and unconsciously they have tested and very often lost their lives this essay caused an apparently irremedial rift between mailer and baldwin time and again mailer has snipped at baldwin in print baldwin has never replied the split came over baldwins criticism of mailers white negro the maileresque portrait of the american hipster and existentialist somewhere in the rebel albert camus wrote that every act of rebellion expresses a desire for order and a nostalgia for innocence and mailer and baldwin mutually enjoy the rebellious existential stance both are concerned with the same issues but their divergence is so radical and drastic that it often seems they inhabit altogether different worlds where baldwin is religious in some fundamental rockbottom sense mailer is romantic where mailer has gone into the penumbra of experience where he has traveled to the very edge and lingered too long and been wounded perhaps fatally baldwin has moved from the outskirts of the city into its epicenter and made his uncomfortable residence in the groundzero of the american heart consider the difference in the ubiquitous figure of the white negro mailer has come to terms with atrocity by romanticising it out of focus his hipster is white with a black soulwhich is junky the essence of hip his hipster lives we are told continually with the terms of death his benighted unconscious stamped with a limp metaphysical version of the extermination camp and the possibility of thermonuclear destruction that fire next time and his hipster is concerned with transcending the maddening mechanism of time of kicking it entirely and entering what cummings called the one hell of a universe next door the only example of such transcendence mailer has produced is sexual orgasm in short whether mailers effort is a brave one or a useless one his nipsterthe salvation of this cancerous worldis sadistic anally erouc an orgyhunter murderous and benumbed to such an extreme point that his only source of real pleasure lies in committing sexual atrocities but wnen atrocity becomes thus palatable and sweet however romanticised and apologised for one has produced the monstrosity of an intellectual buchenwald where true to their penultimate calling mailers hipsters are the guards at the outermost periphery of experience giggling in their towers and clutching their machine guns like a young lover his new bride necrophilia is not a way to come to terms with death and a romantic abstraction of the ghoul or necrophile is neither very hip nor very existential the pity of all this is that a fairly competent talent is wasting itself by merely reveling in the signs of a creeping putrefaction he diagnoses all around himself the american bedroom has become a private concentration camp baldwin said talking quietly on the themes of color and sex and sexuality sexual morality and sexual responsibility is one of the biggest themes an american writer can undertake its part of his responsibility as a writer an obligation to himself i suppose i put it in this way because america at least in its conversation comes on as so sexually enlightened and sophisticated well it simply isnt true baby in giovannis room a novel ostensibly concerned with a doomed homosexual relationship baldwin explores the notions of responsibility and morality in the beginning of the novel david meditates on his life with giovanni and on giovannis imminent death on the guillotine people cant unhappily invent their mooring post their lovers and their friends any more than they can invent their parents life gives these and also takes them away and the great difficulty is to say yes to life this and a few other sections from giovannis room have been recorded recently on calliope records on the back of this record there is a short illuminating quotation from the new york times in which baldwin states his attitude toward writing i think i really helplessly model myself on jazz musicians and try to write the way they sound i am not an intellectual not in the dreary sense that word is used today and do not want to be i am aiming at what henry james called perception at the pitch of passion  in giovannis room and his third novel another country baldwin comes close to realizing this desired perception another country explores the problems created by color and sex in the lives of eight new yorkers it is written in a straight thirdperson narrative style and its hero and protagonist is a woman ida scott she is the only character in the book that baldwin simply presents to the reader unlike the other characters baldwin never analyzes ida revealing her motives and weaknesses to the reader encapsulated in several paragraphs ida reveals herself and she moves through new york like a fallen angel waiting for its wing to heal she has no delusions she is aware of her need for love and she is equally aware of the limitations imposed on her solely because of the color of her skin even this knowledge does not cause her to live or love resignedly she is to use an archaic phrase courageous  and unlike the doomed giovanni or david ida also wounded and betrayed is still able to say yes to life without having to lick her wounds she has not made a peace she lives in a world of wartorn emotions and has come to terms with her world perhaps because she is such a stride forward for baldwin idas strength is in fact so great that she has forced life to come to terms with herself the virtues represented by ida scott become moral and philosophical principles in baldwins latest and most controversial book the fire next time fire is part autobiography part doomsday prophecy and part exhortation the spirit of rebellion camus writes in the rebel can only exist where a theoretical equality conceals great factual inequalities and the rebels most persistent gnawing question is is it possible to find a rule of conduct outside the realm of religion and its absolute value this is one of the basic questions posed in fire and in terms of this searching query the factual inequalities of the racial situation are brutally unmasked god gave noah the rainbow sign no more water the fire next time fire is a tough grim book its message is love and what gives the book its body and sinew is baldwins personal experience as an american negro incarcerated in harlem a ghetto in which he was set down to perish simply because his skin was black the details and symbols of his life constructed and preestablished for him long before his birth this is the more grisly aspect of a functioning totem and harlem in baldwins eyes is a kind of unguarded extermination camp in which the victims undo themselves because they have allowed themselves to believe what the man whites has said about them it is one thing and not an easy one by any means to be an american it is entirely something else to be both american and black yes it does mean something something unspeakableto be born in a white country an angloteutonic antisexual country black once we have learned to love each other then according to baldwin we shall no longer require the negro as a symbol and a scapegoat an essential ingredient in filthy jokes and a pornographically murky symbol of sexual prowess but if we refuse if we continue to hold the negro in abeyance the result might possibly be disastrous if one is permitted to treat any group of people with special disfavor because of their race or the color of their skin there is no limit to what one will force them to endure and since the entire race has been mysteriously indicted no reason not to attempt to destroy it root and branch this is precisely what the nazis attempted their only originality lay in the means they used it is scarcely worthwhile to attempt remembering how many times the sun has looked down on the slaughter of innocents i am very much concerned that american negroes achieve their freedom here in the united states but i am also concerned for their dignity for the health of their souls and must oppose any attempt that negroes may make to do to others what has been done to them    whosoever debases others is debasing himself that is not a mystical statement but a most realistic one which is proved by the eyes of any alabama sheriffand i would not like to see the negroes ever arrive at so wretched a condition italics baldwins throughout this piece i have often compared baldwin to camus this comparison i believe is apt and precise baldwin like camus before him is staking his life on life itself and without the help or hindrance of religion he is looking for human nobility and grandeur in a world that is possibly heading toward selfdestruction nobility graciousness courage candor and bravery are pretty unhip concepts sin love and guilt have been laid to rest on the analytical couch and the spirit of rebellion has been totemised into managerial conformity but in the strong pen and compassionate heart of a small wiry relatively ugly man called james baldwin a kidnapped pagan we have a voice that embodies the dilemmas of our epoch in the same way that camus represented ourselves to us perhaps if the bones roll right in the future america will be very proud having produced a black replica of camus at this point i suppose all one can do is offer baldwin a few prayers the groundzero of the heart is far more dangerous a place to sit than the nomans land of the mind

after almost a century of blissful indifference only rarely jolted by an unavoidable headline the civil_rights story has made the front pages the american press failed to sense the big story until the sharp barbs of the news were so painful and so persistent that even a naive high school newspaper reporter would have been forced to react it was difficult to ignore the separate but equal ruling of the s the klan and its cross burnings made an occasional paragraph and the brutal lynchings managed to find their mark in the columns but only when the historic  supreme court decision occurred did the members of the fourth estate begin to dig beneath the headlines and a couple of paragraphs until the sitins autherine lucy little rock and james meredith even the  flurry had begun to subside in many a newsrooms apathy file one cannot point to ralph mcgill and his atlanta constitution and proudly shout there by the omnipotent journalism gods stands the mighty press it would be as inappropriate and inaccurate to picture mississippis governor ross barnett as the prototype politician the inexcusable fact is that the american press one can generalize in this instance waited stoically and in situ for the civil_rights story to come to it rather than going out aggressively and courageously to meet it it was so easy to locate irrespective of ones point of publishing even in our shiny makebelieve world of sports it was not the writers with their unique space and language prerogatives who brought jackie robinson and his brilliant afroamerican counterparts to the national pastime this small but significant act was written and produced by a quietvoiced retirementyears figure named branch rickey who some eight decades after appomattox smashed the long tolerated colorline in baseball true one could point to the finelypenned stories of the magnificent jesse owens and his championship efforts in the  olympic games in then nazi germany but even then before and after the same sports writers were mentioning the negro leagues and some of their nonpareils more as gestures of curiosity than of shame or perish the thought to crusade they couldnt hide owens and his super achievements in the face of the socalled super race but it was easy to write off the other outstanding athletes of his race the willie mays hank aarons larry  dobys and ernie banks of that era merely could look longingly at the minor and major leagues frustrated and ignored even in new england the press was supine new england where the underground railroad had flourished where william lloyd garrison and his liberator had championed the cause of slaverys abolition where humanitarian row stood mutely but majestically on brattle street and its environs the reverse freedom riders and some effective public protests finally have stirred editors to awakening and to action in june of this year the very able and respected associated press news analyst james marlow commented in one of his columns    the great flurry now by the government churchmen mayors businessmen and others to speed up desegregation raises an embarrassing question for white people north and south why didnt it happen sooner    the government and some churchmen mayors businessmen and othershad been moving but at a snails pace to end racial discrimination but negroes had to force on them the realization they hadnt done enough fast enough    it is not irrelevant that marlow failed to include his own profession in his righteous denunciation even thoughtful and concerned journalists of marlows high character tend to view the responsibility of the press from the inside looking out only occasionally do its members take that exceedingly difficult look from the outside looking in and then they do so privately some correctly note that the american newspaper world has been no more the procrastinator in its belated recognition of the civil_rights issue than the other three professional estates this is the weakest and most cowardly rationalization of all the press is not a vast complex of community house organs designed to attack critical issues only when the management or the establishment feels that such action is inescapable a responsible press is obligated to move unhesitatingly into the arenas of controversy and calamity irrespective of whose oxen are gored surely one of the big stories within the civil_rights story itself was the escapism of members of the legal profession the teaching profession the religious and those of industry and government all of whom refused to use their special training and influence to tear the cancer of bigotry and inequality from the breast of the nation but where was the trenchant pen of the editor the cutting unrelenting coverage of the reporter the challenging paragraphs of the columnists the driving inspiration of publishers reporting of the civil_rights dilemma has been and still remains to a great degree highly sectionalized in style and in content hodding carter hazel brannon smith and recent pulitzer prize winner ira harkey jr join with georgias ralph mcgill and a handful of others as beacons in a sea of southern despair the three mississippi editorpublishers are not necessarily what one would term integrationists but they have at least had the courage to report the civil_rights story without a builtin hominy grits chittlins and chess pie bias they have shown unwillingness to move with the mob in the middle of red neck country in the face of economic sanctions very heartless and effective ones too the vilest of insults and the loss of lifetime friends their respect for the realities of the news in concert with mcgill little rocks harry ashmore and a select few have shown that the pages of the press may indeed be used to report fully and with fairness even in the terrifying face of hatred and fanaticism many southern editors and publishers are quick to point to the insipid or complete lack of birth control news reporting in northern newspapers this comparison is used as a rationalization for their own inadequate and myopic coverage of civil_rights although they are unquestionably correct about the spinelessness of most northern newspapers when the subject of birth control is whispered the analogy is as worthless as a chocolatecovered syllogism two ugly editorial wrongs make nothing right in life or in journalism more guilty than most have been our fabled columniststhey of the crystal ball set the rearvision mirrors the magical sources and the supernatural ouija boards where were lippman reston lewis jr lawrence the alsops and so many of them during the recent generations even these the socalled elite you classify them according to your own preferences touched the civil_rights story rarely followed it through not at all missed entirely in many cases in unwitting concert with the more bourgeois members of their journalism dailectic there is a tragic touch of stubbornness within the heart of the story of the press failure one finds that a great many members of the press are as unwilling to admit their belated awakening as the segregationists are unwilling to concede that a society that terms itself democratic cannot tolerate a slave system de facto or de jure one highly regarded magazine editor said to me   i think that the american public was slower than the press on this one and that the press has pushed as hard as it could in view of audience interest which is always an inhibiting factor  thus the old and battered canards are again put to useaudience interest and the slow american public slower than the press when editors talk that kind of drivel in  it is not difficult to understand why this number one american story withered so long on the communications vine  our newsmen cannot claim sudden awakening almost a quarterofacentury ago there were some highly regarded american reporters who recognized that the pressure cooker of civil_rights history in our nation was in danger of exploding a number of the nieman fellows at harvard university in the late thirties gathered regularly with some negro students to deliberate and discuss that subject among the harvard members of that exploratory dialogue was then law school grad student and currently usia legal counsel samuel allen allen recalls that the newspapermen concluded even then that civil_rights was americas priority news beat william lloyd garrison was saying that almost a century earlier he recognized the newsworthiness of the story and reported it in undiluted doses suffering the manhandling of a boston mob who found garrisons unrelenting jabs at their conscience most unpleasant civil_rights was and still is for many who prefer comfort and security above all an unpleasant subject the kind one would prefer to push aside or camouflage despite their special responsibility above that and beyond that of their readership the members of much of the press have subscribed to the same brand of escapist philosophy and immorality some of the northern newspapers have editorialized a good deal but close scrutiny reveals a fascination for afghanistanism as they point their aroused editorial anger at their southern neighbors ignoring the de facto segregation in their own natural circulation area were journalism a religion of orthodox character there would be a long and somber line to the confessionals for the great majority absolution would be highly unlikely 
to most new yorkers today to whom the word means anything fort greene means the fort greene flouses the largest public housing project in the city which stands between downtown brooklyn and the brooklyn navy yard to the eye it is mostly negro though the official figures show that a fifth of the  apartments are occupied by whites and another fifth are occupied by puerto ricans it would probably surprise new yorkers who recall stories of gang fighting in the fort greene area to discover that above the housing project in a little park stands one of the major monuments in the city it commemorates the prison ship martyrs of the revolution and was designed by the great architects of new yorks age of elegance mckim mead  white who also built the university club the columbia university campus the nyu hall of fame the pennsylvania station and the brooklyn museum this monument contains a great central column standing amidst urns and eagles a magnificent staircase down which one may approach the project a comfort station designed like a greek temple which puts the utilitarian structures of mr moses to shame from the site one may view the entire housing project and a good deal besides all this provides a rather grander setting for gang rumbles than they usually find it does not pay to extract too much symbolism from the accidental coming together of a mostly negro housing project and a great monument erected by an earlier city and yet one does not have to force the symbolism because between the new york represented by the monument and the new york of the housing project there is a close intimate link historical irony makes the elite of that older new york and the poor negroes of the project both for the most part protestant indeed more han half the protestants of new york who are only a quarter of the population are colored and since the work of the city is so often divided along religious lines it means that the old elite and its institutions churches charitable societies hospitalsoften find they have inherited a special responsibility for the negro fort greene is rich in symbols bordering the park to the south stands the huge bulk of the brooklyn technical high school one of the specialized high schools of the city system which have often served as the first step in the economic and social advance of many boys from earlier immigrant groups it is the potential bridge between the project and the monument numbers in  the city had  negroes there had been an increase of  in ten years coming after an increase of  during the s during the s the white population of the city dropped by almost a halfmillion the new york of  was oneseventh negro see table  new york of course is not alone in this great shift in population in deed it has a smaller proportion of negroes than other great northern cities in  chicago was  per cent negro philadelphia was more than onequarter negro and cleveland and detroit had even higher proportionsboth  per cent new york is so enormous that even large population changes affect the proportions slowly in newark for example which is a city of  the negro population increased by  between  and  and newark became onethird negro but the kind of change that transforms a city the size of newark is for new york only a neighborhood shift the negro population is younger than the white though not as young as the puerto ricans thus it forms a higher proportion of both the school population and the juvenile delinquent population for demographic reasons alone there are of course other reasons why there are more negro juvenile delinquents in the next decade owing to the fact that about threetenths of new yorks schoolchildren almost all white attend parochial and private schools the negroes and puerto ricans will together exceed the rest of the public school population the negro population is still in large part new to the city in  half of the entire nonwhite population of the city above the age of  had come from the south these americans of two centuries are as much immigrant as any european immigrant group for the shift from the south to new york is as radical a change for the negro as that faced by earlier immigrants the negro immigrant has not had the good fortune of arriving with useful skills and strong institutions nor has he found a prosperous wellorganized negro community to help him the negro community in the city is indeed an old one but age has done nothing to prepare it to meet the problems of mass migration in  before the first decade which saw a sizable migration from the south new york had  negroes less than  per cent of the population negro writers who remember that antebellum new york negro would often write about it with something like nostalgia but in those days aside from a tiny negro upper class of minor government employees and professionals the community consisted almost entirely of domestics laborers waiters unskilled workers negroes accepted an inferior place in society and in this inferior place despite the existence of distinctions of class and status poverty was matterofcourse and segregation was universal this group could do little for negroes coming up from the south and from the west indies during the first war the negro population increased rapidly in  it was  about  per cent of the population in the s mass immigration from europe came to an end and the negro population of the city more than doubled the migrants poured into a new york in which they could not eat in a firstclass restaurant go to a firstclass hotel or get a job in the white world aside from some specially reserved government jobs above menial labor and yet the city did offer a large variety of jobs at pay much higher than negroes could get in the south and as important it offered harlem a more exciting and stimulating environment for negroes then than any other place in the country segregation helped make harlem alive it is hard to envisage as one walks the streets today with the buildings forty years older and the population greatly changed what harlem was like in the s in those days negro entertainers and musicians were a rarity on broadway and one had to go above th street to find them because of the unbroken pattern of segregation harlem included everyone in the negro communitythe old tiny upper class the new professionals and white collar workers the political leaders just beginning to take over the old political clubs the artists and entertainers and writers as well of course as the domestic workers the laborers and shady characters writing in  james weldon johnson described a harlem few of us would now recognize but he helps explain the enormous attractions of  new york even though the city did not offer the advantages of jobs in heavy industry available to negroes in chicago and detroit in nearly every other city in the country johnson wrote the negro section is a nest or several nests situated somewhere on the borders it is a section we must go out to in new york it is entirely different negro harlem covers one of the most beautiful and healthful sites in the whole city it is not a fringe it is not a slum nor is it a quarter consisting of dilapidated tenements it is a section of newlaw apartment houses and handsome dwellings with streets as well paved as welllighted and as wellkept as any in the city    the question inevitably arises will the negroes of harlem be able to hold it will they not be driven further northward residents of manhattan regardless of race have been driven out when they lay in the path of business and greatly increased land values harlem lies in the direction that path must take so there is little probability that negroes will always hold it as a residential section this makes strange reading today it made strange reading only ten years later when another major negro writer claude mackay wrote a book on harlem ten years of depression had been for the negroes a disaster that almost rivaled slavery mackay quoted estimates that  per cent of the population was on relief  per cent held wpa jobs dependent on casual labor and household service without salaried jobs without businesses harlems residents suffered far more from the depression than any other part of the city white workers knew what it was to go two or three years without steady work but a case of special distress in the white world was the norm in the negro world harlem became more frightfully crowded than evereven though there were high vacancy rates in adjacent east harlembecause the population was so impoverished the negro population continued to rise through natural increase and migration but much more slowly than in the s in  on the eve of world war ii it stood at  with the war a new period in the history of the negro in new york city began the age of harlem as the seat of the negro renaissance and of depression misery drew to a close as new areas of negro settlement in brooklyn the bronx queens and the suburban counties were opened up and rapidly increased the war created a new new york for the negroesnew in the kinds of neighborhoods where they lived the kinds of jobs they held the role they played in politics and social life and in their image of themselves and their relation to other groups central in this transformation of the negro position was a revolution in the level of income that was typical and in the kinds of jobs that became accessible leadership politics intergroup relations whatever the situation in other communities the negroes of harlem and other new york communities are deeply involved in politics they register and vote in substantial proportions their newspapers keep up a continual flow of political news they are active in club membership and in the support of political leaders clearly politics is seen as an area in which to advance the interests of individuals and the group what do negroes want out of politics what everyone else wants jobs on all levels from the most humble to the highest recognition and prestige and the advancement of group interests it is perfectly clear on the national level what policies are necessary to advance group interests but new york is not washington and not the south there is no insuperable problem in getting almost any law or policy against discrimination in almost any area adopted and in getting it enforced the issue is will it really be helpful if it is a matter of getting the right to register and vote or integrating the restaurants political activity can be clear direct and effective but there are no such simple political objectives left for negroes in new york there are already laws against discrimination in employment and housing and while their administration can undoubtedly be improved the agencies that enforce them the city commission on human rights and the state commission for human rights have negro heads or high officials and negro staff membersthere is not much more to be done along this line the board of education actively tries to integrate the schools there is no discrimination in higher education there is probably no discrimination in restaurants and hotels it is hard to see how it could be maintained in the face of the influx of african emissaries and officials the committee on civil_rights in manhattan found in a sampling of east side restaurants in  that more than twofifths were discriminating it rechecked in  and discrimination had dropped to  per cent since  it has had only five reports of discrimination and it now considers this problem settled and the main problem to be housing in new york city it seems there are no easy problems any more or easy solutions the improvement of the negro economic position requires such complex and farflung operations that it is hard to see how it can be made a simple political issue it involves such matters as retraining the unskilled better education all along the line stronger motivation so that people will take advantage of retraining and education opportunities changing the structure of new yorks economy changing the role of the unions even if new york were to adopt a minimum wage of  an hour the effect might well be to increase the level of unemployment among negroes to a midwest level rather than to improve their general economic situation in housing as in wages and employment the need is for radical policies that make improvement in the situation in general and these are not particularly attractive to negro political leaders in the city or any others for that matter they do not urge that lowcost and other governmentsupported housing be restricted to vacant land sites which is the one sure way of increasing the overall supply of lowcost housing in the city such a policy would mean that they preside over areas of decaying slums while their supporters escape to greener fields instead one finds the popular program of attacking landlords for inadequacy of maintenance proposing ever harsher measures to enforce good maintenance demanding more frequent and more severe inspections by city agencies these are worthwhile policies but to concentrate on inspecting a declining and aging stock of lowcost housing does little to increase it or to deal with the conditions that make it possible for landlords to get high rents for crumbling apartments the kind of political courage that would be involved in tracing out the real impact of rent control on different groups in the city is simply not heard of in american politics in effect there is little public discussion among those active in city politics of policies except in response to the most blatant scandals there is certainly no more than this low average of discussion among negro political leaders there is probably less in recent years the emphasis has been on political jobs all good things are scarce and involve conflicts and on the question of the proportion of jobs in city elective and appointive posts held by negroes we find rancor and bitterness and strains on old political alliances and allegiances there is nothing really new hereevery new group tries to get the nominations and jobs it feels it is entitled to and these are always more than the older groups which fought their way up to a certain proportion of jobs and nominations in the past feel the new group has a right to but who is to determine what is the right proportion congressman powell in  demanded that negroes should get  per cent of the jobs in a democratic city administration since  per cent of the enrolled democrats in manhattan are negro he said they held only  per cent of high political postscommissionerships board memberships judgeships even so negroes are doing better at getting political jobs in new york than anywhere else in the country chicago having about  to  negroes has only three negro judges    new york having about  negroes has seventeen judges two supreme court justices one general sessions judge four city magistrates three domestic relations court judges six municipal court judges and one city court judge this comes to just about  per cent of the judicial offices in the city in addition in new york city unlike chicago many negroes hold administrative positions at the cabinet and subcabinet level whatever the strains in politics the clubs and committees form one of the most important arenas in which the people of different groups meet and test each others feelings and capacities and powers new yorks politics serves much more as such a meeting ground than its business certainly more than its formal social life and probably as much as its cultural life new york has good race relations and it has been helped in this by a number of factors the city does not have politically powerful neighborhood homeowning groups electing their representatives to the city councils to fight the spread of the negro community and the taxsupported expansion of social services in any case the city council in new york is weak it is the board of estimate dominated by officials elected by the entire city electorate and the mayor who wield effective powerand these are far more susceptible to the city wide negro vote the important role of culture in the city means that talent and genius have a status which transcends group membership and which is not found as commonly in other american cities and then the remarkably varied group life all through the citys history means that all the groups have been somewhat mellowed in their attitudes toward other groups and that new yorks irish and italians are probably somewhat more tolerant in their outlook than irish and italian groups in other cities this mellowness is aided by the large proportion of jews who traditionally and probably because of their traditional lack of power have learned to eschew violence and favor negotiation and conciliation and liveandletlive policies and yet within this context of overall good relations it is just in relations with the jews despite their generally liberal outlook nonviolent temperament and their similar experience as a minority facing problems of discrimination that an observable level of tension has recently developed it would be easy to exaggerate this tension sensitive just as the negroes are and also timid and vulnerable jews inflate small incidents then contributing to our awareness of this tension there is the fact that the jewish community supports as italians and irish do not professional organizations devoted to good intergroup relations this means that any sign of tension immediately becomes the focus of specialized professional concern sometimes from several different jewish groups and is rapidly brought to the attention of leaders in the jewish and negro groups and appropriate governmental agenciesscad coir the police the mayors office the governor perhaps so it is easy to exaggerate the degree of tension that exists between negroes and jews and yet it exists its existence at all is paradoxical and since it also involves to some extent the somewhat frayed relationship of the negroes to political liberalism in general it is worth examining to begin with antijewish feeling is endemic among negroes as professor kenneth clark and novelist james baldwin have at different times observed in the jewish magazine commentary because the negroes keep bumping into the jews in front and ahead of them expanding into jewish neighborhoods in manhattan the bronx and brooklyn less so in queens negroes become the customers of the many jewish shopkeepers that have remained behind they become the tenants of the jewish owners of property whatever the personal qualities of shopkeepers and landlords negroes are thus often in contact with jews who are making a living from them the tension between landlord and tenant in new york and particularly landlord and lowincome tenant is in any case extreme and it is understandable that it takes very little for it to become tinged with antisemetic feeling but in addition to this large range of unfortunate contacts the negro also meets the jew as an employer this is likely in a city that is onequarter jewish the likelihood is increased because of the heavy jewish concentration in the citys small manufacturing in garment factories in small plants assembling electrical products toys and novelties plastic products and the like the negro operative in lowwage jobs is likely to find he has a jewish employer once again here is a situation in which a natural conflict of interests can be interpreted in group terms and is likely to contribute to the strengthening of traditional stereotypes of jews to boot the negro is even likely to find in many of the new york industries in which he is employed that the union has a jewish leadership and jewish staff and he resents this thus in the lowwage laundry industry a negro and puerto rican working force is represented by a union whose top leadership is jewish the worker does not know nor perhaps is it relevant that these men may have built this union at great sacrifice twenty and thirty years before all he knows is where his dues are going and who is on the payroll there is one particular form of negrojewish conflict which is too important not to mention trivial as it may appear and that is the large number of negro women engaged in domestic labor for jewish housewives many of these contacts have produced good relationships but they have also led to the feelings of exploitation and resentment that are almost inevitable in the masterservant relationship in a democratic society one can hazard the guess too that the democratic ethos of jewish lifewhich explains why jewish waiters are the worst in new york probably also helps to make many jewish women poor employers of domestic help the democratic camaraderie of the jewish housewife with her negro servant alternating with the uncomfortable haughtiness of someone not used to a servant might both tend to create more resentment than the steady formal relationship maintained by housewives with a longer tradition in the use of domestic help perhaps too the liberal jewish housewife feels guilty in relationship to her negro servant and this too might lead to the complementary feeling that the guilt is justified in any case it is interesting that one study which has gone into this matter shows a stronger feeling of antisemitism among negro women than negro men and the authors suggest that this masterservant relationship may be the cause even the middleclass negro often meets the jew in a situation in which one is formally an inferior the other formally a superior as negroes move into the governmental agencies which are one of the most important areas of employment for the upwardly mobile they come into contact with all the groups that have preceded them but in particular they come into contact with the group that got there before themjews vho in the s entered government service in large numbers this means that the negro schoolteacher now often works under a jewish principal that the negro social worker very often has a jewish supervisor the top social worker james dumpson commissioner of social welfare is a negro on the whole these relationships between teachers and social workers whose training and work tend to develop a high degree of tolerance and insight have been productive of some of the healthiest and most satisfying interracial relationships that one may find anywhere nevertheless the relationship between inferior and superior in a hierarchy is inevitably tensionproducing and the conflict between different people is always subject to interpretation in group terms thus the dissatisfaction over social services for negroes and in particular the fact that they are run by whites and do not give sufficient jobs to negroes often takes the form of complaints against jews and jewish agencies an inevitable byproduct of the distribution of wealth teachers doctors and social workers in the city for example under a banner headline they let them die the amsterdam news reported on february   dr raphael gamso the new superintendent of harlem hospital admitted to the amsterdam news that he ignored dr aubrey maynard director of surgery when he permitted resident doctors from mt sinai to enter harlem hospital and pick out a number of negro patients whom they carried off to mt sinai for experimentation what actually happened was that service at the city harlem hospital almost collapsed as a result of a shortage of physicians and mt sinai a jewish voluntary hospital agreed to take a number of cases it seems to have selected over dr maynards protest some of the more interesting ones a month later the amsterdam news attacked the higher horizons program and in particular its director daniel schreiber and its reporter wrote while the program experiments with negro children there is a dearth of negro teachers connected with the program particularly at the administrative or policy making level amsterdam news march   disproportion in wealth and power introduces a hazardous element into the best relationships our latin american neighbors who know us so well and in so many ways seem capable of turning in the twinkling of an eye from friends to enemies so too in the case of negrojewish relationships the good relationships cannot help but be affected by the disproportion in power whatever the good will on both sides just as in underdeveloped countries governments insist that the foreign investor take on a certain proportion of native employees so have the political organizations of harlem insisted that the jewish storekeeper have negro employees and so too they now demand that he use negro salesmen they lack only the ultimate power of expropriation but if they did jewish and other white business might fare as badly in harlem as the american investments in mexican oil or in cuba we can press our colonial analogy a bit further for if the jews in an earlier parallel to colonialism may be seen as exploiters they are also paralleling the later development of colonialism those who help and assist the deprived group this role is if anything more exasperating than the former one negroes know that in new york jews play a disproportionate role in pushing for the kind of policies that help negroes it is true that these policiesfair employment practices fair educational practices fair renting practiceshad their origin on the agenda of jewish organizations at a time when they were as important for jews as they were for negroes but the fact is that as times changed as they became more definitely policies in which jewish selfinterest was less clearly involved jewish organizations with their rich resources in money staff and contacts continued to press for them very often negroes were drawn into these activities and while they played an important role the largely jewish liberal organizations pushing for these policies soon became aware of the very different levels of participation organization and moneyraising capacity in the two communities james wilson tells the story of the most effective of these organizations which had their origin in the activities of jewish liberal civil_rights agencies the fight for an open occupancy ordinance in new york city the bill banning discrimination in housing was led by the new york state committee against discrimination in housing nyscdh    it was created largely at the instigation of the leading jewish organizations in new york in  after the failure of a court attack on the stuyvesant town antinegro policies    four major state laws and two new york city ordinances were passed in large part due to the efforts of this and related organizations white primarily jewish groups have been the most important single factor in the committee from the first an effort was made to involve negroes in its work and a sizeable number of prominent negroes have played important roles and occupied top positions most of this negro support has come from the ranks of negro professionals who are officers or executives of other organizations public and private with an interest in    housing    some important white leaders of the committee however    wish in addition for negro grassroots support those who work together in such organizations represent part of that alliance of liberal and minority forces which has played such an important role in the city for thirty years but on the other side there are the grassroots elements who are relatively distant from such activities and the press and political leaders who talk to them and it is as easy to arouse resentment and prejudice against a more advantaged group that is being helpful particularly if there are other contributing factors as against another that is more distant more powerful and more hostile finally there is and again the colonial analogy is helpful the central problem of political representation jewish and of course nonjewish too political leaders who have for years represented neighborhoods that have changed to negro and puerto rican occupancy have discovered that regardless of their votes in civil_rights and other issues the negros want the job for themselves it is against this background that the exposure in  of borough president hulan jacks connection with a jewish real estate developer and his trial for accepting a financial favor from him was particularly exasperating for it so happened that it was the crusading new york post that uncovered this relationship in the course of a longextended investigation into public policies affecting housing the new york post had a jewish publisher a jewish editor and a large jewish readership it is also true it has the most distinguished negro reporter in the city it had the only negro columnist on a nonnegro newspaper and a large negro readership but all this did not matter the post became the villain of the case of what was referred to darkly as the plot to drive negroes from public life and it was implied too that it was a liberal and jewish plotin view of the prevailing political outlooks in new york a jewish plot would have to be a liberal plot and vice versa meanwhile about the same time the longdelayed trial of adam clayton powell for income tax evasion came up even though jews had little to do with this and even liberals had little to do with it the threat to the top elective jobs which negroes held touched such sensitive spots that this was irrationally also considered part of the jewish and liberal betrayal of the negro and indeed there is a strong element of rationality in the irrational amalgam for whatever the attitudes of liberals on civil_rights in new york city they are tied up with good government forces represented best by the jewishowned new york times and a large part of the negro community will not feel very sympathetic toward those who search out every example of financial gain from public office while no leader in the group will openly favor illegal gain it may seem unfair to negroes that their representatives in public office do not get the gains from it that members of other groups have in the past alas times have changed and it is harder and harder to make anything from public office in any case whatever some negroes thought privately about hulan jacks dealings with unger hardly a voice was raised against him everyone supported himeven the ministers now admittedly everything we have to say to explain negrojewish relations is also true to some extent of italiannegro and irishnegro relations and yet there is less feeling expressed against the irish and italians perhaps for many negroes subconsciously a bit of antijewish feeling helps make them feel more completely american a part of the majority group there are probably other irrational bases for this antijewish feelingantisemitism is a complicated thingand yet the special tieup of jews with liberalism is certainly important but political issues as well as personalities symbols and the fate of private attempts at gain do play a role in the developing tension between negroes and liberals despite the fact that the battle over civil_rights is a regular occasion for northern liberals to match themselves against southern democrats at national political conventions negroes cannot help feeling that liberals do not quite do enough the liberals are part of the same party that includes the south as well as most of the new york negro voters and are always open to the charge of holding back in the fight for civilrights bills how much of ones time and influence should one devote to this issue how much else should one let go from the negro point of view whatever time and effort one devotes are hardly enough what this means then is a steady strain between the liberal and the negro which can often become quite bitter the bill of complain then is that the liberals frame the negroes they dont put up enough of them or give them enough recognition they dont fight hard enough for civil_rightsin fact they hypocritically fight just hard enough to get negro votes and the reaction has been a new rise of negro exclusivism and nationalism the feeling that negroes have to go it alone and should trust no one but themselves and the idea that any disinterested common action with democraticminded whites for public policies to improve the condition of negroes is an illusion an extremist element has been a permanent part of northern negro life since the s it has recently rapidly increased in strength stimulated by frustration over the south and the rise of independent african states the nation of islam black muslims and similar groups are not likely in view of the much higher level of education and sophistication among negroes today to be anywhere nearly as successful as marcus garvey was in the s more important however is the adoption of this exclusivist feeling by a wide range of negro leaders publicists and intellectuals this development has been as rapid and sudden as the leap in the number of independent states in africaand the two phenomena are not unrelated the impact of twenty independent negro states all with representatives at the un in new york is already striking and while some of the africans are patronizing the beauty parlors of harlem many american negroes going the other way are discovering that they can leave their hair unstraightened there is quite a difference between the subtle and complicated early essays of james baldwin on the relationship of negroes to america and his writing in scarcely less subtle but envisaging the possibility of a much more radical divorce of the negroes from white america than he had earlier contemplated there is an even sharper difference between the subtle and somewhat amused treatment of african nationalism in lorraine hansberrys play raisin in the sun and the passion of her advocacy of african and american negro nationalism in  there are obviously many types of exclusivism and even so this is only one part of the spectrum of opinion to be found among negro leaders a philip randolphs american negro labor council organized in  is exclusivist but it exists to exert pressure on a labor movement from which he does not wish if possible to isolate himself the leaders of the national urban league and the naacp and core resist the exclusivist trend and still include many whites though the proportion of whites in leadership and on the staffs declines as men of ability and training in the negro community grow more abundant these organizations still represent the old negroliberal alliance the local naacp branches in new york and elsewhere include few whites and are far more exclusivist in their outlook and the gap between them and the new nationalist groups is not so great it is to this grassroots nationalism and exclusivism that adam clayton powell and the amsterdam news appeal here when an attack is made on liberal allies the assumption is that they are not allies at all but enemies what the future of this exclusivist outlook and feeling will be it is hard to say but it does not seem that it can be more than a temporary tendency no group or interest gets very far alone in american politics particularly in new york city there are too many groups too many interests for anyone to adopt the attitude that its strength its numbers require little cooperation with and accommodation to others whatever the psychological satisfactions of the present mood it is doubtful that it is the way to get gains for the negro community in jobs in influence in prestige or in practical policies one can reject white standards of beauty one can devote oneself to the study of african history and culture one may support the policy of african states there will be more and more of this and this is all to the good but africa and nationalism and exclusivism will have as little to do in changing the conditions of american negro life as israel and zionism have to do with the conditions of american jewish life emigration is only for the few the problems are here and they must be solved here and the main impact of the nationalist mood sincere and passionately felt as it is will be to serve more flexible politicians and leaders in getting gains and concessions we have indicated often enough our feeling that negro communal organization is weak and insufficient to make much impact on the great needs of the poorer and disorganized part of the community as oscar handlin wrote in his study of negroes and puerto ricans in new york    the ability of new groups to develop an adjustment that would assure the individuals involved a healthy creative life depended both on the nature of the hurdles to be surmounted and on the resources available for doing so the hardships of the negroes and puerto ricans arise from the fact that the hurdles are unusually high and the resources unusually meager one must read the negro new york newspaper with its regular appeals to the community to raise pitifully small sums for the local y or other institutions to discover how fantastically difficult it is to raise money in the negro community handlin points out that when sydenham hospital was integrated it also shifted from a voluntary to a municipal hospital two sets of institutions manage to raise money those fighting segregation and for equal rights naacp nul core though they raise less than they need and much of that comes from whites and the negro churches in the negro communities of new york as elsewhere in the country it is difficult to underestimate the importance of the negro churches when one says negro church it is possible the image of the storefront sect stomping and hollering taking outlandish names and twisting the common heritage into strange forms still comes to the mind of many whites it is not these churches that we speak of though they of course exist are important in the lives of the people involved and are also of some weight in politics we have in mind the large institutional churches in wellequipped buildings with various group activities with associated social services with a large membership and a prominent minister these churches which elsewhere in america for most groups and for most vital areas of concern are fifth wheels are in colored america and in colored new york in the center of things and they play a role in politics that the churches of no other group can aspire to or would dare to it is not unimportant that adam clayton powell new yorks first negro congressman is a minister that gardner taylor the only negro member of the new york board of education in  was also a ministerand that both men lead particularly large churches baptist claiming  members it is also not without significance that milton galamison former head of the naacp of brooklyn and one of the most prominent figures in the fight to desegregate schools is also a minister of a large church presbyterian james h robinson of the presbyterian church of the master ran for borough president on the liberal party ticket and was spoken of as a successor to hulan jack there are other ministers who play some role in politics and the new york negro minister is in general far less cautious in indicating his preferences from the pulpit than the white minister the negro newspapers regularly devote a great deal of space to church activities and report on the politics of the national denominations in the greatest detail in  and  there was a bitter struggle going on in the national baptist convention for leadership between gardner taylor of new york and j h jackson of chicago it was headline news in the negro press it is not untypical of negro church politics that after a wild convention in  the matter ended up in courtbut the court refused to take jurisdiction this battle involved the fundamental question of the attitude of the church to the new militancy of negroes in south and north but the main point to notice is that it is not often that an issue that is as central as this to a group becomes the basis of struggle in white denominations when j h jackson was victorious in  one of his first steps was to remove martin_luther_king from a position in the baptist organization we have magnificent descriptions of the old fundamentalist storefront church in literature for example james baldwins go tell it on the mountain and we have good sociological descriptions of these churches no one has yet described the negro middleclass churches which seem often to make up for the loss of fundamentalist fervor by becoming as heatedly involved in the secular political struggles that affect negroes it is this kind of church that is rapidly becoming the dominant type of church we find as part of the middleclass development among negroes that the same social changes that have made the city church a problem for white protestants may begin to make it a problem for negroes members are beginning to move away from the areas in which the big churches are located to the suburbs the church becomes to some degree the institution of an absentee membership and new ethnic elements move into the neighborhood around the church with no relationship to it and just as the white churches long ago had to consider what to do as their neighborhoods changedand the majority sold out and followed the membership with a few remaining to serve a peculiar function as city churchesso we find some negro churches considering the problem of a new puerto rican group around its doors here and there in brooklyn and the bronx negro ministers are beginning to think in terms of a mission to the puerto ricans just as some white churches are finally beginning to think in terms of a mission to the surrounding negroes and just as conservative members of the white protestant churches find it hard to think in terms of a universal church open to all so do some negroes used to the comfortable community church the only institution that is entirely theirs find it hard to envisage bringing in puerto ricans but the mere fact that negro churches must begin to think in these terms shows to what an extent they have become part of american protestantism participating in its intellectual and theological development and its problems gardner taylor has served as head of the protestant council of new york j archie hargraves minister of brooklyns nazarene congregational church became secretary of the board of home missions of the congregational christian church in  since the same factors affect them that long ago made their impact on white protestants one may see the signs of the time when secularization and specialization will affect the negro churches as they affect the older protestant denominations and when these churches will be less flamboyant but also very likely less influential the day will come in the negro church when the minister is not wealthier than his parishioners and at that time the minister will not wield the influence that he does today interestingly enough even the development of elijah muhammads temples of islam suggests the change in negro religion and politics it does not have the flamboyance of either marcus garvey or father divine it emphasizes traditional virtues as do all storefront churches no smoking drinking women but less because these are sinful than because by saving his money and devoting himself to his business the negro may make himself wealthy and successful this is indeed a nationalist and racist movement but it is surprising how much of horatio alger there is in it tooand that reflects a great change in the negro community elijah muhammads young men remind some people of fascists and yet they wear dark business suits and are proud of their selfrestraint and their discipline the temple of islam service an admirer of the movement tells us is sober and restrainedonly handclapping greets a point well made thus even the most extreme of presentday negro movements suggests the extent of the shift to middleclass patterns and the power they now possess in a community of a million people one can see pretty much what one wants and this is as true for negroes as for any other group one can see the large mass of problems that are high up on the agenda of city government and civic groupscrime delinquency the breakdown of family responsibility and one can see the increasing numbers who achieve middleclass status and for whom the only problems are those created by the prejudiced and discriminatory behavior of others one can see demagogic selfserving leaders in politics and church and civic activity incapable of seeing any problem except those created by the white man and one can see an increasing body of competent leaders very often professionals on the staffs of private and public agencies quite up to facing directly and squarely the problems of the group and who yet give no ground in their insistence on equality one can see the huge ghetto concentrations and one can see the ever larger areas of integration in work civic activity politics housing one can dole out an evenhanded justice saying on the one hand there is this on the other that and it is true among a million people there will be enough examples for any argument and yet how do we cast the final balance how do we envisage the future here there are no agreedon scales there is only the judgment of those who try to see the whole picture in the light of past history and to discern future trends our own judgment is that in the north a new phase in negro leadership must begin the era of the leaders who sought accommodation to an exploitative white world has come to an end everywhere even in the south the era of the leaders of protest has been in full swing in new york for a good twentyfive years though it has only recently arrived in the south its achievements in the city have been great but it is now entering an era of diminishing returns and because there are as a matter of fact few additional gains to be made in new york city by protest the protest leadership shows a tendency to become irrational shrill and ineffective the situation in other citiesfor example chicagoand in the south is entirely different but the worst of it is that important tasks necessary ones on the agenda of american negroes are shirked and ignored these are tasks that conceivably no one but negroes can do it is probable that no investment of public and private agencies on delinquency and crimeprevention programs will equal the return from an investment by negroled and negrofinanced agencies it is probable that no offensive on the public school system to improve the educational results among negroes will equal what may be gained from an equivalent investment by negroled and negrofinanced groups and an increase in the numbers of negro teachers and principals it is possible that no effort to change the patterns of the negro lowerclass family will be effective at a time when the white family is in disorder when strong families of whatever kind native and ethnic show signs of disintegration but if anything can be done it is likely that negro agencies will be far more effective than public agencies and those of white protestants succeeding the period of accommodation then and the period of protest one can detect the need for a period of selfexamination and selfhelp in which the increasing income and resources of leadership of the group are turned inwards and already a few voices are raised to make just this point this is the argument that john h johnson publisher of ebony and jet suggested at the  convention of the national urban league ebony it should be pointed out is itself rather more selfhelp oriented than the protestrooted negro newspapers and its circulation in new york is probably greater than that of the local new york weekly negro community newspaper the amsterdam news this is the argument of carl t rowan the distinguished negro reporter in an article in the saturday evening post everywhere in america the argument can be met by the counterargumentlet the white world reform itself first even in new york one can say this and most negro leadership does but the question is whatever the origins of the burden on whose shoulders does it fall and how can it best be overcome
