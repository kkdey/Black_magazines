the f rst afro­american theater

ne of the highest y priority items among  r those of us who are e concerned with t h e to define our theater for us just as we afro ­americans must define who we are within the framework of our own cultural heritage we  ­­t­ ­ ­ history theory and criticism of afro­ american theater is a redefinition of afro ­american theater within the framework of af ro­american culture we must not continue to accept a euro ­american concept of what theater is what constitutes a good play or a bad play how an audience ought to behave and so on if we do we will never even begin to discover the vast and beautiful and exciting history of our own theater the distortion of afro­ american theater history has been made possible primarily through the single device of allowing somebody else  must also define what the word theater means to us and what good theater is within the context of our own culture for example by euro­american standards a play must be done on broadway to be co­nsidered worthy of serious critical and historical consideration of course there are a few exceptions to this rule in the form of long­run off ­broadway hits but even the exceptions must be produced in the city of new york to be eligible for consideration as a worthwhile american play there is clear evidence to support the theory that euro­ americans mean to define afro­ american  theatrical success in their terms as well for example a book was published in  under the tite n egro playwrights in the american theatre ­ by doris abramson a white woman the only negro playwrights in the a nerican theater according to the content of miss abram sons book are t h se whose plays have been produced in the city of new york by applying this euro­american definition to afro­american theater historically important afro­american playwrights such as john ross randolph edmonds thomas pawley owen dodson james butcher and ray mciver are excluded simply because their plays had not been performed in new york prior to  some have been produ ced since when historians apply euroamerican definitions to afroamerican theater history prior to the confederate rebellion   they generally conclude that afroamerican theater did not exist for this reason afro­american theater history prior to the confederate rebellion has been almost completely ignored most afro­american theater history since then is also ignored and for the same reason but let us take one thing at the time the casual student of afro­americantheater might easily conclude that the first afroplays are not lacking in af roamerican culture then this must be a case of using euro­american definitions to determine what afroamerican theater is miss abramson implies that the first play by an afro­american of any consequence at all was h arlem written by wall ace thu rman in collaboration with  wiliam jourdan rapp a white man in  apparently then h ae passed the euro­american test of what af ro­american theater ought to be primarily because a white man re­wrote the play when we deal with afro­american theater in an afro­american  cultu ral context we discover that even in new york   wasnot the beginning nor was  in  or  a mr brown opened  a tea garden in what was by then a thriving community of free afroamericans in new york mr brown had previously been a steward on a ship that sailed between american play was the escape  new york and liveroool en  ­ a leap to freedom written by william wells brown in  even a work of the stature of john hope franklins from slavery to freedom says so but according to landamong the early entertainers at the tea garden was a man named james hewlett whose entertainment consisted of portraying the roles of several diff erent characters  miss abramson the escape is not in one p ­ erf ormance within four or really even a play nor is caleb the degenerate written by joseph s cotter in  she says that both of these plays are crude and that they are reall y tracts meant for the library or the platform  according to the dictionary crude means uncult ured but whose culture is at issue certainly these  five yea rs mr brown had built a theater seating three or four hundred people in this theater a group called the af rican company performed one member of the company ira aldridge went on to be­ t come one of the most renowned actors of th century europe but what of the african company itself playbills of african company after those two performcompany perf ormances indicate ances cannot be accuratev docuthat they must have performed as regularly and definitely charged as much as the other theaters operating in new york at the time still the african company has been labeled by a few white theater historians as a bunch of amateurs whomade no significantmark upon the history of theater short of being picturesque on the other hand most white theater historians ignore them completely an undated african company playbill probably from  or  lists a performance entitled on the slave m arket it seems reasonable to assume that the perf ormance did not take a stand in favor of the institution of slavery would such an event be of no historical importance a later playbill announced that on june  and   the african company would present for the second time a play called king shotaway  the play was billed as having been about a sjave insurrection on the island of st vincent and based upon the actual experiences ofmrbrownwhowas both playwright and manager of the company is not the production of a play by an afro­american in  about a slave insurrection a significant mark upon the history  of the theater  what happened to the african  mented at this time however the company had been repeatedly harassed by the new york police department prior to that occasion  in other words they had been ttrown in jail what must have been the attitude in the white community in  toward an afroamerican theater company performing a play in which slave insurrection is encouraged a play in which the hero is a hero because he leads his black brothers in a violent rebellion against their white oppressors is it any wonder that neither the african company nor mr brown was ever heard from agai n james hewlett who played the role of king shotaway managed to continue his acting career in december of  hewlett appeared at the spruce street theater in new york apparently in his one­man show in which he played several different characters in one perf ormance and did imitations of the leading white actors of his day february   was announced as his last appearance at military garden  prior to his departure for london where he was to have appeared at the coburg theater there are apparently no record s at the cobu rg of hewletts appearance there there are however  records of hewletts return to new york for perf ormances as late as september   of cour e ira aldridge also went to london and to the coburg theater where in october of  he launched a career that was to eventually lead to recognition as one of europes leading actors at any rate with the demise of the african company neither hewlett nor aldridge would ever again appear prof essionally in a play written by an afro­american playwright for an afro­american audience with an afro­american acting company managed by an af ro­american the closing of the af rican company in  opened the door for the euro­american theater establishment to saturate afro­americans with the idea that the good the true and the beautiful must be determined according to euroamerican standards within a euroamerican cultural context but what if we use afro­american culture to derive our own definition of afro­american theater then we go back to the oral traditions of africa instead of the literary traditions of europe then we can deal with theater as a total event that may include narrative storytelling storytelling in dialogue form persuasive speeches sermons song dance or instrumental music in any number of conceivable combinations and we can deal with theater as an event that evolves orally rather than a specific set of words fixed for all time upon a page from this cultural context africans arrived in america some slave some free all oppressed from this cultural herit age black slaves held their white captors up to public ridicule among themselves in what has since been perverted into the negro minstrel from this cultu ral heritage also developed the afroamerican preacher the storyteller and the singer of spirituals as implements for the oral transmission of history mythology and ethical standards it is within these events that the roots of afro­american theater lie ahead there is a long and difficult struggle to reconstruct these events outside of a euroamerican racist context this job is more difficult than the usual task of historical research it is more difficult for two main reasons first because white historians have conspired whether deliberately or unconsciously to destroy all records of significant cultural achievement within an afro­american cultural context by  afro­americansliberal white historians have managed to convince us that they were helping while recording and loudly applauding only those cultural achievements by afro­americans that mimicked euro­american culture in addition afro­americans were compelled to lie about what they were doing and why they were doing it what kind of punishment would have been in store for a black slave who told a white man who the minstrel was really making fun of or where the spirituals were really  talking about going our ancestors were obliged to practice these deceits upon the white man in order to survive only when the afroamerican theater historian is able to break through this double wall around the truth will a thorough history of afro­american theater be possible

the american theater isnt really the americantheaterhow  america be anything but a black artists dream black theater is a term that says where blacks in this non­existent american theater would like to go not where they are no real american form has emerged in this countrys short history in the late twenties when eugene oneill and the provincetown group tried to do new and vital work that one percent that mak e up the theater­going audience retreated with shock however in the thirties oneill was joined by clifford odets irwin shaw sidney kingsley maxwell anderson and paul green and the country thought it had finally found an american theater unf ortunately it had not it had only succeeded in producing an ameri can august strindburg via oneill and different forns of russian literature via odets anderson and their contemporaries the crossing of contemporary american ethnic with traditional european theater seemed to be the american way america had taken what seemed to be the best of europe however what seemed to be the best emerged as the cover of a very complicated book in terms of physical structure theaters are still to this day of the proscenium type thats used all over europe these theaters were designed for operas from their inception every new stage design is based on an earlier european design discovered by careful research  plays are written tofit into something similar to a box this makes most of the plays identical plays written in the thirties were presented in boxes american plays cannot be restricted by theaters designed for european opera paul green who worked with the stanislavski­oriented group theater in the groupsbeginning and whowas an innovator in pioneering black drama in america white desses abrahams bosom n ative son hymn to the rising sun moved to outdoor symphonic fortn he went back to his home in north carolina and again pioneered one  of the f ew true american forms in symphonic drama   oneill vho experimented with black plasdreamy kid emp ero jones all  gods childen got wings ­ moved deeper into his own f amily and emerged as one of the finest american playwrights and the only  one to ever win the nobel prize the plays about blacks written by these white men were vi eved by a white audience thats how the  were meant to be viewed no attempt to change this pattern occurred until the mid­fifties after the demise of the negro theaters  in harlem and the f ashionable night out in harlem became unfashionable it was about that time that a series of small community  projects discovered that survival meant developing within the community actors who had worked with the white groups were instru mental in developing black community groups in new york it was rose mcclendon frank wilson fred oneal in chicago it was  ted ward in cleveland it was charles gilpin the communit naturally meant among black peers gradually the plays changed from revivals of white plays with allblack casts to original dramas written by writers f amiliar with the black life style the plays no longer were written for white acceptance since no white people would see th em  in sch ools y m c a s negro digest apr il  churches across the country from los angeles watts to new yorks harlem plays tried to communicate to those nearest those next door this was done out of necessity out of a need to survive the audiences were few but they responded more blacks tried their hand at pl aywriting in the thirties and forties the communists tried to use theater in the fifties the politicians tried to use theater  in the sixties social worke s tried to use theater theater communicated directly and quickly there was no way easier or cheaper to reach black people then in the late fifties lorraine hansberry s raisin in the sun hit raisin reaffirmed in blacks the necessity for more involvement in black theater as a matter of fact lonne elder iii robert hooks douglas turner ward and ossie davis were all in raisin in the sun until the late fifties no black writer black actor black director or technician had benefited financially from any of the plays about black people which had been presented in years previous it had always been a white producer or white writer who had profited phillip yordans anna lucasta is a case in point marc connellys geen pastures porgy  bess in abrahams bosom    on down theline   are all cases in point the years   and  marked the beginning of the coffee house theaterin new york the socalled alant­garde the outcast theaters cafe cino cafe la mama and the hang­outs of the beat generation blacks were accepted in this circle because the circle itself was about freedom the destruction of the system in the early sixties the poverty programs around the country came into existence social workers tried to use theater and young people who had only dreamed of participating in the theater arts now had the opportunity to participate through so­called cultural enrichment programs tow ards the midsixties these projects became more serious the message became the medium serious black writers submitted their plays after realizing that the plays wouldn t be done in the mainstream theaters the underground flocked to see productions of these writers the writers received major attention from the same critics who reviewed plays on broadway and off­broadway  street theater and guerilla theater emerged asforerunners of black  theater street theater takes theater directly to the people who canin the street was the first to nake an attempt she discovered almost immediately that for people in the inner city to relate performers had to be multi­racial it became impossible for theater in the street to present its repertory in english alone spanish communities insisted that plays presented in their community communicate to them in their language guerilla theater is an attempt at git prop theater it attacks the government in general and the injusti ces of war in particular both forns u sed black people to help solve problems that were not directly related to the immediate needs of black people young blacks dissatisfied with the poverty program structure moved out on their own and set up their own thing this wa s true of the new laf ayette theater this  theater had been a part of harlem youth unlimited new laf ayette theaters director robert macbeth had a vision that went beyond the limited idea of har­yous federal project macbeth wanted a theater controlled exclusively by black people free to experiment within black culture free to try newforms thesamefreedomthat black americans fought for in all  the other areas of their existence this could hardly happen within a federally supported project the new lafayettetheatermoved into  its new quarters at the old elk hall in  and macbeth started to build what he believes to be a black  theater the foundation of this theater must be the community around it the classic function of the theater is to project and illuminate  the feelings and concerns of the community which sustains it thus the theater like the church is a community ritual and black the ater cannot emerge until it is free of the european concept until we change our language yea h as we wont be free until we change our  music we wont be free until we change our theater until we begin to do the rituals again when we tat doing the rituals again and stop doing plays the new lafayette theater is a theater that can become a black  theater when it is no longer supported by foundations when it has to exist because the black people of harlem want it it will be black  the new lafayette theatre in its four years came into its own when ed bullins the young black writer from philadelphia via san francisco journeyed to the new lafayette he brought with him a collection of pla ys that were written for black people they are so directed  for black ears that whites reading them learn more about black culture than do the blacks to whom  the plays are directed however there is little doubt of bullins direction unlike many black writers who exist without benefit of a permanent company bullins writes knowing that his plays will be performed his position is very similar to that of oneill and odets oneill had the provincetown company to test his plays and odets had the group theater odets also had harold clurman and elia kazan as well as some of the finest trained perforners outside of the moscow art theater bullins has the possibilities of a similar playwright ­company relationship but it is important that we understand the difference between a black eugene oneill and a true black playwright at this time there can be no black theater unless it is a free theater or a cooperative effort by all involved whenever money enters into the picture it is best to treat theater as a business unfortunately most of the black people who are active in theater or those on the sidelines hoping to jump into theater should be treated precisely as one would treat a white boy there is a magic which theater images project in the minds of black writers and black performers they dont see theater as ever having been fair to them  and they are absolutely correct an art form that is unfair to white people is twice as unfair to the few black people who try to crack it a ­  play produced by foundation support in a black community and playing to no black people is the same as a  play produced by limited partnership off­broadway playing to white people in both casesitsthe audience that determines the plays validity to the performer and writer the negro ensemble company is no diff erent than the american place theater is no difj eent than the new lafa yet te theater before a company of performers come together they are individual in their thinking and in their actions one thinks of oneself before he thinks of the collective and since everything about him is the same as the things away from him his thoughts usually remain the way they were when he entered the new surroundings by way of elaboration the last poets and leroi joness spirit house movers are projections of new thoughts and fresh attempts at form because they are not confined by time and space real estate is not important european concepts are not attempted their form of presentation goes back to early american form ie to the minstrel shows blues spirituals even in many cases to moans and screams in leroi joness case he learned the european forms early and therefore learned early how meaningless they are to the expression of the black life style on the other hand the last poets never learned european forns at all they found their form in black music and from black musicians the american black actor doesnt  have the proper frame of reference his is a european concept it is basically the same with the black playwright he is less than three qecades out of the eu ropean tradition whether he is with the negro ensemble company the american place theater or the new laf ayette theater his frame of ref­ f erence and his form will be the same breaking that tradition might be what james brown the mu slims smokey robinson and rev c l franklin are doing theirs might be the real black th eater whatever it must be a bitch being artistic director in a theater where  blacks negroes and colored people are all together the audiences that attend plays written and performed by black artists are usually of three types whites who want to be flagellated  liberals who either want their fears confirmed or those who want to steal the art  and the f ew blacks who go hoping that it will be good because blacks are involved for those who want to get flagellated there are all those horrible get whitey plays that are usually written directly to white people ignor­  ingblack peoplecompletelythese plays are meaningless no one with any knowledge at all believes whats happening on stage the liberals are in anoth er bag they are not interested at all in the real play the real theater they want the moynihan report confirmed  all those reports from the welfare department verified if all this happens then intellectual discussion can be set nothing will happen as a result of these debates one or two black intellectuals who almost al ways are invited and who always start the discussion by stating that they haventseen the play but    you know these intellectuals well  they all got their jobs because the black nationalists raised a lot of hell and finally the black audience is just happy to see something  black on stage they are not excited by reviews they want it real tell it like it is they are only a few and they are mostly students  and its usually very difficult f or them to get to the theater this is the audience that black writers try to speak to however theater eco nomics are  years ahead of them when it should be equal to them and so it came to pass the day black artists realized they would  never be accepted in the main­ stream of american life it came very early in theater it was and still is the nut that few blacks are  able to crack this is due to the direct and immediate image projected leroi jones called it revolutionary theater the plays that  will split the heavens for us will be called the destruction of america the heroes will be crazy horse denmark vesey patrice lumum ba but not history not memory not sad sentimental groping for a warmth in our despair it was an art that had to express in beautiful  and artistic form the life styles of its participants black participants wanted to create their own othellos their own willy lomans this came too when the country as its artists was and still is going through terrible changes political and social after  years blacks can no longer believe anything white people say and are indeed making them face up to their lies nothing short of death could force the blacks to be negroes black theater cannot survive under the present conditions black perf ormers and black technicians cannot invest it with the same rules and regulations that characterize white theater its like telling a child that he is a man as vantile whitfield director of the perforning arts society of los angeles pasla  inf ormed us black theater is embryonic black theater is about the destruction of tradition listen to ronald milner playwright and directoof spirit of shango theater in detroit run it down  it will be a theater having to do with love of ones self and ones personal national and international family with wariness and hatred of ones personal national and international enemies with ideally points as to how to break their grip and splattertheir power it exists to make way for black thought and black artistic expression ideally it should be in a black community it cannot be directly supported by a foundation but an

ong pressed to the t limit in so many facets of his life the black  man of the sixties undergo close scrutiny at the beginning of a decade even more promising than the sixties in an interview with patricia bosworth of the new york times february     lonnie elder called attention to the diverse angles of vision among black playwrights black writers have a particular frame of reference they cant avoid the ghetto or the terrible deprivation or the experience of bigotry and racism  they are inthe ­  spoke out   n many midst of it all and they have to fight  ways both because of and in spite of unbearable pressures and restrictions one of the most productive and most exciting manifestations of his outward thrusts has been a reactivated and energized black theater the theatrical ferment of recent years has crystallized into two major forms the theater of the black experience and the theater of revolution the existence of these major forms indicates different angles of vision for black playwrights as well as for their audiences and critics and all three must  to get on top of itthere is an awful kind of purity in this kind of experiencele roi jones ed bullins ralph ellison douglas turner ward we all express ourselves differently as artists but we all create from the same basic need we are men and we want to belistened to ed bullins in introducinghis new plays j om the black theatre speaks of a wide range of plays revolutionary plays include we righteous bombersby kingsley b bass jr who is said to be ed bullinssonjiby sonia sanchez and the black bird by marvin x bullins recognizes the existing diversity well enough but he fails to note that in general there has been little emphasis on historical plays using a historical figure in a revolutionary play is not the same as writing a historical play among the plays of the black experience on the other hand are lonne eiders ceremonies in dark old men douglastumer wards day of a bsence ed bullins goin a btfjalo charles gordones no place to be somebody  and adri­ enne kennedys cities inbezique onthe matter of historical plays however loften mitchell certainly one of the most informed men about black theater both historically and currently said this one thing missing though from the current pictureis historical theater it is mitchells view that theater should reflect a peoples history not just current treatments of the angry i hate whitey theme such plays as william branchs a wreathfor udomo and in splen ­did error truly reflect this history very recently the new york times conducted a suvey among theate people asking them which plays they would like to see revived ruby dee includedthis observation among othersi n splendid error william branchs play produced off­ broadway in the fifties deals with the historic confrontation between two giant americans frederick douglass and john brown i remember that it was exciting and most relevant to todays  racial dilemmas the same thing can be said of course about branchsa medal fo r willieas its recent boston revival proved what is being said here is that the historical play has not yet emerged as a direction to beequated with those of the black experience and  revolution the matter of audience is undoubtedly more critical for the playwright of the theater of the black experience because of the diversity of the audiences for such plays in a  essay in anger and beyond  the negro writer  and american literature saunders redding gave seriousattention to the problem and it is a problem ­of audience after pointing out  the historical differences and the causes of those differences between black and white audiences he came to this conclusion  that the gulf between the audiences had been closed and that the black writer can now write without being either  false to one audience or subservient to the other amplifying this from another angle douglas turner ward says that  for a negro playwright committed to examining the contours con­texts and depths of his experience from an unfettered unimaginative  negro angle of vision the screaming need is for a sufficient audience of other negroes better informed through commonly shared experi­ence to readily understand debate confirm or reject the truth or falsity of his creative explorations not necessarily an all­black audience to the exclusion of whites but for the playwright certainly his primary  audience the first person s of his address potentially the most advanced the most responsive or most critical only through their  initial and continuous participation can his intent and purpose be best conceived by others wards day of absence illustrates his point as funny as the images and memories are the bitter truths and ironies are all too apparent  black maids waiting on cold street corners f or buses in the morning all converging on the opposite street comers at the same time in the afternoon too tired to clean their own houses when they get home porters sweepin g the streets in front of shops in the early morning or polishing brass on bank  doors what actually happens in the play is that blacks mysteriously disappear for a whole day including some of those in positions of  power in government who were not known to be black wh at is true is that black people have often wondered what white f olks would do if all the black s disappeared ward has implemented alexander popes powerful line what of t was thought but neer so well expressed the play of course reveals the completely chaotic state of aff airs without black people  and it dramatizes a secret wish which  no doubt every black person has had at one time or another the play illustrates the way in which a black audience can relate to a black playwright on the basis of commonly shared experience experience which whites necessarily perceive in a different way addressinghimselftothematter of audience too james emanuel critic and an editor of dark symphony says the truths of negro life then should be the staple of writing directed toward negroes specifically and negro writers should tell those truths  and to insist that negro writerslimit themselves to work which they think serves negroes alone is to deny the general humanity and universal significance of negroes what is good for a black audience is good for any audience or reader to refute that isto minimize tlie meaning of a black persons life this is not inconsistent with playwright william branchs insistence upon the playwrightsfreedom to choose his audience and to direct himself to any group he wishes to at the time he has the urge to write there are times he says when he has something to say to black people and there are other times when he has something to say to whites this is a matter of emphasis not exclus  on alice childress believes that black writers should direct work toward black audiences but she is aware of the fact that black audiences are not always waiting with open arms for every word we have to say many of them listen with a white ear they want playwrights to say just enough but not too much it is not the simplest thing in the world to write for a black audience on the point of just enough there is an excellent illustration in the now­defunct black culture weekly december     the play being attacked by barbara ann teer is big time buck white at first all is hilariously well with her all of them are definite folk images and character types cats you would find on the corner of any black communityhustlingoffthepoverty program the actors work well together they have a real warm feeling bouncing back and forth im laughing so hard i didnt realize that my head was beginning to ache after awhile sic i started massaging my temples and said to myself where is all this tension coming from these brothers are funny as hell  but it soon became pretty obvious that the brothers were depicting the most negative niggerisms we have i mean its no secret we have millions of messed up confused lost directionless brothersfloating around lets be honest thats reality it is also true that we have millions of brothers who are still into an opportunistic solo hustling thing yeah we got em so  expose em why not but then after you expose em then wh at you cant just create these nigger figures and leave them hanging out there for no reason other than to say to whitey look how dumb ignorant moneyhungry power­crazy ego­starved black men are    i include whitey because  percent of this audience is also white but then what do you expect downtown now im beginning to dig whats really being put down and im getting a little nervous and uncomf ortable its getting worse sic instead of better like three quarters of the evening has gone by and ive had it with all this negative shit niggers doing nothing but fussingfighting and cussing i mean im really feeling embarrassed almost naked you know like stripped damn big time buck white hurry up come on in and save these poor niggers straighten em out after having identified the characters as definite folk images and character types to be found in any black community  miss teer then charges the actors with having come all the way from watts just to get on a new york stage make buff oons of black people to really strip them of all their dignity  for no apparent reason other than to make money and to show the white playwright obvious contempt for them yet one reads this about big time buck white dick wiiiamswhenwilliamswasfirstapproached about doing the play    he was so detennined that it come through ashethoughtitshouldthat  he reworked most of the dialogue deleted one character altogether and completely changed the character of buck white ive tried to  make him honest and very concerned at one point we almost had to bar tuotti the playwright from the theater it takes a black  writer to really know the black experience and communicate it im convinced of it there arent any buts about it   to the extent that williams assumes responsibility for the play he must be considered in any discussion of black playwrights and  their audiences the substance of what williams and tuotti put together white richard watts of the  new york post summed up as sound and fury signifying very little black garette robinson in black culture weekly summed it  up this way  big time buck white is a funny spoof it is a peak of comedy sitting like a pimple on a base of tragedy the acting and  direction are excellent the play itself however falls short in that it has failed to explore in depth the causes that have produced the  tragic characters of b a d  beautiful alleluia days without this exploration it comes on like amos  and andy in the space age a similar thing happened to ed bullins in the wine time the reviewer began by asking is this play really necessary it attempts to reflect what is happening with the grass roots brother and sister telling it like it is but not like it is and like it should be what is needed in our community is a black theater that will produce black plays plays that will create positive images of brothers and sisters    plays that move brothers and sisters from spending their lives drinking rotgut and rot mind wine and becoming warriors that have a revolutionary task at hand and a new world to create a denunciation of old stereotypes follows the typical religious sister in everybodys business the wino the sanctified young sister the hustler and the typical negro cop but so what he asks since the play doesnt move from being a reflection of negroes doing their selfdefeating thing obviously telling it like it is over and over is not enough  as harold schonberg said recently in attacking concert offerings damn this endless concentration on the familiar the problem we are illuminating here of course is not the validity of the criticism but the fact that it supports alice childresss contention that a black audience does not necessarily assure the black playwright a receptive audience what the black audience really is was the focus of a recent study by thomas johnson of the new york times january   he was forced to conclude after scores of interviews with people concerned with black theater and audiences that it was impossible to tell how many black people were regular theater goers the figure is thought to be small compared to white audiences but at the same time far  greater than it was before the last decade of black activism johnsonsidentifiable list of black audiences included the following  the loose sprinkling of color amid the masses of whites clogging the sidewalks nightly in front of such hits as man of la mancha fiddler on the roof  and   the comparatively larger groups of blacks that come out to see either black performers or black themes such as hello dolly  the even larger and mostly young adult groupsthat frequent off ­broadway houses supporting the increasingly popular production of the negro ensemble company such as ceremonies in dark old men and the new york shakespeare festivals publictheaters production of hair and no place to be somebody  the growing number of evolutionary­minded black activists who following the black art concept popularized by leroi jones see the theater as a tool for the creation of social change  the audienceparticipants being developed by new concepts in black theater that are creating styles out of the black style of life one of the more advanced of this school is the national black theater workshop of barbara ann teer and  the many black people who go to all types of theater  thus far we have indicated how much different angles of vision of  black playwrights the wide range of audiences and the limitations posed by critics who embrace one or more of the black audiences to say nothing of white ones pose problems of freedom of choice for the playwright of the theater of the black experience much of the current theatrical energy is being spent upon revolutionary theater which is still a developing rather than an established genre in the first place the playwrights regard themselves as obedient to the black aesthetic  but what that is is not clear to anyone including those who write about it it is currently mired in rhetori c and confusion partly as a result of this confusion many of the plays are totally undisciplined in written form as well as inproduction  some are sketches not plays at all but  some of the playwrights do not seem to know this loften mitchell while optimisticabout the growth of the black audience and positively delighted over the numher of young black writers who are actually getting audiences at the same time expresses anxiety that the unworthy plays being staged might vitiate the gains now being made one of the things which leroi jones did foblack theater was to articulate a new kind of anger and to seek to devise a black aesthetic free of traditional western components in an essay written before his writing became lessliterary and more revolutionary jones reacts to the fact that now it has become possible f our writers to come from anyplace young negroes old negroes as simply anonymous writers but writing about specific experiences which are informed by  the place where they are by what this place has made them and where they came from he contendsthat whatever the expressions  and experiences available the playwights most important obligation is to tell it all exactly like it is in a  essay in hone on the revoltltionary theatre jones tries to say what that is and the freedom he once permitted black writers has vanished along with much of his style the revolutionary theatre should force change it should be change    the revolutionary  theatre must teach them whites thei deaths it must crack their faces open to the mad cries of the poor it must teach them about silence and the truths lodged there it must kill any god anyone names except common sense the revolutionary theatre should flush the fags and murders out of lincolns face one thing which stands apartfrom the rhetoric and confusion is the revolution ary playwrights clearly specified audience he chooses to write for black people in black neighborhoods in new york only weeks ago the cast of leroi jones slave ship walked off the stage of the theater in washington squa re methodist church because the location of the theater was not relevant to the black community the revolutionary playwright cannot assume though that the neighborhood community is a ready­made audience bruce e million of detroit writing in black theatre no  argues that in order to revolutionize the theater the composition of the theater audiencemust be radically changed and that audience recruitment is the central issue his detroit experience hasled him to some rather startling conclusions unless provision is made for compulsory subsidized theater with compulsory attendance the voluntary theater will remain a useless ornament    decoration for the upper two percent that free theater like box office theater will change nothing its like bikinis to eskimos and that street theater is more romantic than good    its like saying the culturally deprived should have deprived theater milliam is attacking some very popular notions but the most significant aspect of his attack is the radical position he adopts in response to the difficulties of attracting local black audiences a clear definition of a black audience does not create one and playwrights of the revolutionary theater have to deal with thisf act in the final analysis this examination has illuminated something of the complexities in the relationship between black audiences and black playwrights whether of the theater of the black experience or the theater of revolution despite these complexities the sixties have  produced substance excitement and innovation not the least of which is the increasing number of young people even children coming into the theater as patrons and performers their interest in the sixties will become their commitment in the seventies the indispensible and firm basis for sustained growth in black theater 
on black theater in america 
he year  was a kind of mixed bag for r devotees of black others were goin a buffalo which was too much like last years in the wine time the characters were ­­it theater in new york the same defeated despairing types  on the plusside there were more plays by and about black people than ever before including a few memorable ones which showed once again why black theater is really whats happening theatrically in america today among the top plays of the year was ed bullins we righteous bombers an overly ­long but righteous play dealing with the psychological and physical problems facing a group of black revolutionaries it was one of the most thought ­provoking productions of the season evoking heated debate in black circles for weeks after its opening this was one of three offerings at the harlem ­based new lafayette theater where bullins is playwright ­in ­residence the who pop up in most of bullins works there was also ritual which was a good idea gone astray i think it was designed to be a shared emotional experience between the performers and the audience but it was too contrived to be effective other top plays were slave ship  a powerful and soul­stirring work by leroi jones dealing with the horrors of american slavery and the deadening effectsit hashad on black people five on the black hand side a sometimes dragging but very together love comedy about a black family by charlie russell a black quartet four searing comments on black ­black and black ­white relations by jones bullins ben caldwell and ron milner and where its at a  fast­moving musical revue done by ernie mcclintocks afro ­american studio for acting and speech one of the most significant things about all these plays is that they were all written primarily for black audiences and though all were not revolutionary they dealt with issues and life­styles of black people in this racist­do minated society this past season also saw the closing of the great white hope after  performances the pearl bailey­led hello dolly troupe leaving broadway to go on the road and the continuing success of the rock musical h air with blacks in several key roles there was also the opening and closing of such plays as sambo the gingham dog the ofay watchers and buck white that one­ week fiasco which tried to exploit the presence of muhammad ali in the title role the last three mentioned were all unsuccessful attempts by white writers to deal with black folks on the negative side there was little progress in solving the financial woes of black theater except for we righteous bombers all the top plays opened in white­ i owned theaters black people have not responded in sufficient numbers to put the theater groups on a more secure financial ba se again i must say that this is partially the fault of black theater people themselves they are still too divided to coordinate their artistic and financial efforts for the maximum benefit of everyone instead of black theater­goers being confronted with an at least tactically unified group they are besieged for support by a dozen small theater groups all seeking their allegiance sometimes by downing the character of those they consider their rivals black theater will never flourish this way one can only remember the dictum that necessity is the mother of invention and hope that necessity will eventually force the black theater groups  into closer cooperation there were two more interesting developments on the new york theater scene this past year one  was the continuing problems of the negro ensemble company nec which had the kind of season where nothing they did left any lasting  impressions last year they gave us ceremonies in dark old men which had a long off­ broadway run after leaving nec but this  year one had to check out old playbills to remember that they did man better man a musical by trinidadian playwrighterrol hill t the reckoning which dealt with a confrontation between a slick black pimp and a racist southern governor and the harangues  which consists of four short plays by joseph walker their import did not extend much beyond the confines of the theater i nec which has received over one million dollars in ford foundation grants now claims to have run into financial problems announcin e   via new york times ad that they are in desperate need of funds to continue their operations  at the level of the past two years another new development this past year was the arrival of charles gordone and his widely­ hailed no place to be somebody white critics were ecstatic about it but many blacks have expressed misgivings about this work which is filled up with self ­loathing greenwich village negroes going through changes in their relationships with each other and their weirdo white friends playwright gordone who describes himself as par­indian part ­french part ­irish and partnigger and ho wrote in the new york times that    i believe the idea of black theatre is dead  is obviously vriting about people he knows well they can still be seen in village hangouts no place is well written and the acting is superb nathan george as johnny williams gave the best acting performance i saw all year nevertheless black people had best beware while laughing at the dialogue and marvelling at the acting no place to be some bod is full of cold contempt for us nows the time to encourage everyone to support black theater with donations and by attending performances of groups such as movement black a dance theater group roger furmans new heritage theater the last poets anywhere you can catch them  barbara ann teers national black theater workshop whose members are still concentrating on getting themselves together and whose sunday afternoon get­togethers are a harlem highlight the ajass shows which are a must for anyone really interested in black culture since they are the pioneer group the community theatre of the harlem school of the arts the bed­stuy playhouse and alonzo and the players  two brooklyn groups while we are waiting for them to come together for the benefit of all we must continue to support them peter bailey 
you speak of the south and blackness r everyone outside of the c el south automatically assumes that south is  far behind them but the south is not an arid wasteland things grow year ­round in the south especially if you take the time to tend to them the way things are supposed to be tended if you speak of black theater and mention the south most everyone outside of the south will laugh at you as if to say that new york is the only place that black theater really exists although if you push some of them they will readily admit that black theaters allegedly exist on the west coast and in chi­t own   but black theater is here too has been here for a long time it is amazing that in these years of black awareness people have ignored what is perhaps the area where black theater will find its strongest black audiences gilbert moses co­founder and former artistic director of fst directed slave ship this summer along with two or three other plays as part of fsts summer program slave ship  which played throughout louisiana and mississippi wasper formed in places  where the name leroi jones not f assumes that south is to mention ameer baraka  has rarely if ever been heard before the production was presented to  audiences many of whom were seeing black theater for the first time in their lives the admission was free but who took notice of it no one except of course the black people in greenville mississippi who were ready to revolt after the performance was over and  who were only reluctantly persuaded to go home and then there was the entire audience in west point missis­sippi which rose to its feet waving fists and singing when we gonna rise up  the song which is included at the end of every slave­ i ship performance   and there was also the large gathering of sunday picnickers students and others who witnessed a performance on the  lake pontchartrain shores in new orleans the same play that southern university refused to allow in its auditorium all who saw it got the message but the people who were supposed to be in the know said nothing at all about it and if you hadnt been there to see it happen then you would never have known it went down because  there was never any coverage of it on the other hand now that the play has opened in a new york theater at  a seat everyone is seeing it and talking about it the big diff erence however is that now slaveship is playing to paying audiences in new york and is being reviewed by all of the white critics and it is a pity that no one got a chance to see it when the people of the south saw it for  then they would have seen a slaveship that could not possibly be seen in new york or anywhere else they would have seen a slaveship  that the audience experienced not as if it were scenes of slavery from negro history but rather a play that the audience readily identified  with as scenes from their lives or as one young black in west point said out loud as the slave driver was whipping the slaves i want to  see you after the show but thats ju st the way it has always been and will continue to be for a long time to come it is ironic  that though gilbert moses did a fine job of directing both versions of slaveship  the people who are supposed to be in the know about black theater will remember only his new york work and not the magnificent production that really moved literally thousands of people in the south we need to reach out and link up with each other we need to stop being so cliquish and parochial in our attitudes about what black theater is the real vital black theaters exist where ever our people are during the summer and fall of  the black mind jockeys the poets of blkartsouth fs­ ts writingacting workshop had the opportunity to perf orm from the east coast­south carolina and floridato as f ar west assan antonio texas everywhere we went we found ready audiences and in many places we were pleased to find black community theaters developing the witersactors and artists of thesouth just asthose in the north and other sections of the country  cannot do it alone we need the strength of all black hands working togetherwe will need more than the spot coverage which is too often all thatwe get we need more of our workpublished by the few black journals that now exist and also more recognition for the publications that we arenow producing  therest of the country must begin to recognize that we the south are a force in black theater and we are we are by the simple fact that we are playing to masses of black people we are carrying the message to neople who have seldom seen or heard itbef ore we are speaking to audiencesthateagerly want to know what is going on we believe that the best way to buid a black theater is to work with our own people using as much original material as possible we believe in sparse non­complicated sets with the emphasis on getting across the point of the play to the audience we believe that you cannot import theater we have had to learn this the hard way  f or ultimately our theater should speak to the black community peopleto­people rather than outsidertopeople we must build a black theater ourselves for certainly no one else can do it we will not become theater by rhetoric or by presenting f our or five new black plays a year we will not become theater just by wanting to become theater the writers of blkartsouth have produced some  scripts in the last year of which six were produced by the theater these six were written by val ferdinand kush tom dent  and sharon stockard if there is to be a black theater then the people must come together and produce it we must write our own scripts and direct our own shows and learn how to do everything else that is necessary to produce this theater we believe in a yea r­round theater of actuality as opposed to a theater that exists for f esti vals and negro history week  we in the south believe our work is as strong as that in any other black theater but the fact remains it does not matter how strong we are as individual theaters and groups of black artists unless we collect our strength it will amount to nothing the strength of blackness lies in the collective thrusts of diverse black forces if black theaters are to shake off the death grips of trojan horse white funding and the patronage of established and influential white critics we must produce a unified black theater movement and no  matter how strong any single black theater is if we do not link up together there will be no black theater for our grandchildren to know i envision that if we want to we can show more brotherhood than we have up until now we can work closer together than we have  up until now and we can in the very least communicate to each other what we are doing there is no reason in the world for us not to know of each others existence once we have begun to know and to recognize each other then we can get on with getting together our outlook for the year  is to continue our work of developing an indigenous black theater we expect to be able to produce at least eight productions by the winter of  the black mind jockeys will continue touring the country reading their work and they are always available for dates for more information call or write the free southern theater n miro  st new orleans la  our workshops in drama and writing which have proved to be very successful will continue as a permanent part of the theater program we will also include a variety of areas that are not strictly theater but that go hand in hand with our theater such as our black newspaper for the new orleans  area the plain truth the development of black artists in our graphics workshop and the expansion of our journal of the black arts  nkombo but more important than the work we are doing now is the need for all of us to begin to understand that black theater  cannot grow unless we all grow we need each other to survive and thats all the seventies will be about for black people surviving if we survive this decade then we can say that we have done something that we have built something we can have black theater and anything else if we really want it and are willing to work together to erect it support black theater wherever it appears ­val ferdinand 
he voices have said that the white man would not care about the condition of watts    after the revolt of  the white man would tum his back what the hell you burnt  it down you bad bad people now reap the rewards of your action and fortwo years it seemed as though the voices of hate were  right programs flooded the area to last just long enough to raise hope and then plunged the despairing further  into despair rumors ravaged the gullible talented young men were brainwashed destroyed forever there was a young man yes he is  still alive but was is the correct word    he was talented as a writer employed by a major studio the way to a new future opening up  and then the voices of doom hate both black and white began to pull at this target it did not take long we as a people are unfamiliar with some subtleties of the outside world  the voices said let the worst of the politicians win let them reach to their lowest level and then perhaps the rest of the nation the world will rise up in indignation and disgust any day a person might walk into the watts writers workshop and hurl his all too familiar challenge hey when you dudes gonna get that building you been talking about you know whiteys giving you a snow job dont you we didot know we could not allow it to be for the summer was  coming and no matter what the papers said no matter what property was burned nothing compared to the  lives that paid the price of a few days shouting to the world to hear us the man had been caught flat ­footed he had to hear us he had completely discounted the fire of dignity that pulsates in the guts of man even black men the heel of his boot had pressed so long so hard against the neck of the black man until it had gone to sleep and the man had been taken unaware but it would never happen again the blue and white armoured truck that carries and shields  policemen would see to that the four cops to a patrol car the continually circling helicopter the nice new green sedan all these would see to that it seemed that the only things the cry of injustice had done was to awaken the oppressor to a more energetic form of oppression and to the people the fence surrounding them grew higher the guards stronger and more plentiful the voices of hate surer but there were those who did not allow this to make them lose their faith ithe humanity of man those both black and white who saw watts as a battlefield in which the words of man had to become real somehow someway the friendliness in eyes had to be turned into a  definite object an act had to appear out of all the smiles and handshakes that would stand as absolute proof some people argued jobs thats the only way others education yet others culture    and they were all right a place center workshop whatever you wish to call it where all of these things could be combined it was a natural the watts writers workshop was doing fine why not add a dance class an acting class why not a teacher of english and black history in one year we placed in college three young men who had no idea of the possibility of furthering their education a play big time buck white using one of our members in his first role went from the workshop to off broadway  david moody is now in the musical version in san francisco other members have become television writers jeanne taylor has sold a script to tvs room  odessa cleveland an actress has signed to tour europe in a tennessee williams play louise meriwether has sold her book and is t receiving offers from the movies mildred walter has sold her book lily of watts charles baireuther a new member has already made  a sale of a short story and in a few days the acting class will be presenting new plays it was as though the entertainment industry had suddenly said now just a minute we are one of the foremost industries on the  west coast and admit we are  percent white it is not right it is not what america is all about and it is up to us to be among the first  to change it image film television are a powerful convincer persuader we were a part of the makers of the black image    we must  help change it the studios came down and offered money but more than that    knowledge individuals offered to teach classes it was hard at times the meeting of minds almost impossible but it happened a group called peoples inc  came down hey you know there isnt a theater in watts    we started to throw them out if we and watts watched and waited you cant get a permit for this  was echoed    so the council peoples inc and budd went to city hall sometimes we had calm meetings sometimes    but the pernlit came    and then the estimated figures began to soar   if we skimp here no its got to be top shelf all the way     needed now industry we called    were not begging just open up the door and well do it ourselves new estimate     hey man  the voices asked    yes the voices sounded a little different hey manwhats happening some of the once most vocal didnt know who the hell did they were a young group and the sincerity showed through    hal stalmaster bob cohn bruce corwin and david zeitlin met with budd schulberg myself and the watts writers workshop council a film theatre in the workshop a  great idea    and so the concrete touchable object was born a place in watts for film to be shown no more eight­to­ miletripswell wellwell bull the voices said its summer again here comes whiteys conbut things began to happen material began to arrive men carrying long­rolled sheets of paper walked around the building and made figures in notebooks    were now skeptical but silent something was happening not a whole world but it was happening the workshop began to overflow with talent looking for outlets and suddenly the industry discovered a new way of reaching talent we would like a goodlooking girl about  to     a young man of  and a child of five can you help me could we help them ha they were almost to hollywood by now but what about the closed unions what about behind the cameras  who is going to run the equipment in the watts theater set up training facilities its harder but the way is there and so it is going there are many more people i could name forty­one members of the workshop not long ago worked in a picture halls of anger not a big deal to you but sometimes when a brother pa sses you pick up on that new look that new pride hey and you look proud too that is if you helped do it harry dolan 
whos got his own at cheyney 
by donald evans
h eyney state college is a  small school  a few miles outside of philadelphia its student body spredomnantlyblak coming largely from the ghetto areas of philadelphia like most colleges today the student body at cheyney state is crying for more voice in school affairs they had been demonstrating for several years prior to my joining the faculty in  one of their grievances centered around a need for more programs dealing with the black man and his peculiar situation in this country the administration had ears open so it seems but were slow to act and so the conflict reached a point of confrontation  the young blacks against the system it was probably thought that more campus activities would occupy the students time and therefore alleviate some of the tensions whatever the reasons behind it i was hired to begin a drama program on cheyney s campus prior to my return to the school i had graduated f rom the institution in the early sixties the theater program was an annual play put on by an english class or the catch­ascatch­can drama society in the past they had served up a bill of things like beck et and m edea with an occasional foray into works like the bloodknot done im told in  percent white face  there were no lighting facilities no scenery and no costumes to give us a crawling start the auditorium doubled as classroom and general meeting room and was tightly scheduled in short we really had to build way in the back of my mind was the idea that cheyney state would become a good place for playwrights to try out new works and a theater devoted to the resurrection of seldom performed works by black playwrights it was already september and we still had not found a strong script to open with contacts with playwrights proved that the writers were   being looked at by established companies or readying their plays for new york openings or  connected with a group that promised immediate production for whatever they turned out or  not interested in seeing the play done by a group of students one writer who had been produced in new york was so soured by the reaction of the critics that he no longer wished to see the work done whatever the reason we were in a bind earlier in the year i had met ronald milner at lincoln where he was writer­in­residence having had so many of my brothers close the door in my face i was somewhat dubious about approaching ron for permission to do whos got his own however hearing of my dilemma and anxious to find out about the reaction of an audience like cheyney he gave us the go­ahead by this time we had already performed two plays in the series an old classic from  and a little known work by a major writer rons play was definitely better than the second and asstrong as the first plus it was here now and relatively new it also turned out to be the most rewarding and exciting involvement of the year because it had somethingor rather several things that most of the new plays by black writerslack a definition of these unique qualities comes best through a description of the production from first reading to final performance first reading the first reading of whos got his own was approached with a bit more anxiety than usual i had worked with the performers on two productions already and had agood idea of their abilities i also knew that this play called for real acting there was no model for them to  copy and we really had to create characters i wasnt sure that the actors were capable of examining themselves deep enough to find a  germ on which to build the angry and frustrated people who lived in the world of the playtheir black­ ness alone told me that they had the experience but i wasnt certain that they had the skill to turn it into something creative and powerful additional uneasiness resulted from the fact that i knew ron mil­ner personally and therefore had an increased desire to do justice to his play like most of the young playwrights i had talked to ron was very much concerned about the kind of production a college group might give whos got his own past experiences had proba­bly lefta few negative impressions regarding the quality of work done in some schools my own group be­ ing new and never having tackled anything with the depth of whos got his own i was a bit tight myself  especially since he had said he might get out to see the show the anxieties however did not last long as soon as the kids started reading the script i knew we were going to be okay we sadown around a table and did a dry read­through  a read­through that was anything but drytwo pages into the play and the students had  found some bit of the characters that came close to their own experiences the session was constantly interrupted as the students voiced their immediate reactions unlike the first sessions on the plays which preceded whos got his own these interruptions were not of the  questioning kind they understood the motivations and nuances of the lines these young actors were commenting on their own lives and the similarity between the feelings of clara and tim and their own the session was becoming a kind of therapeutic talk session we were getting very close to each other comment getting together is extremely important in doing any play the cohesiveness of the company often makes exciting theatre of the most mediocre material and a loose company can make garbage of the best work imaginable one of the problems black groups have is finding a work they can really get­together with doing works by non­black playwrights do not give the actors the experience of delving deep into their emotional selves to find an element of truth for the black actor such plays are always classical in that they must be approached th r ough technique rather than psychological truth a good bit of the black actors training is therefore left out because he does not often have the chance to student actors margie barnes as clara and marilyn suiter as m ama in cheyney s p roduction of whos got his own by ronald milner go inside himself and use emotions as a basis for a characterization the problem is also presented in many of the works by black playwrights who concentrate so strongly on the argument of the play that they neglect to make the argument come from strong characters in dramatically moving situations to deal with a work that is totally propagandistic does not stretch the actor he must concentrate his efforts on the lines only a good playwright however realizes that a point can be made indelible through characterization one of the out standing qualities of whos got his own is that we react to the play because it presents us with p eople the ideas are one aspect of the total creative activity of the work realizing that he is tim jr  a real live character an actor has only to make his equipment give formtothepersonin ordertomake the argument tangible so many of our revolutionary plays are mere harangues they do get the points across but the question is whether or not they give the argument any repeatable form to illustrate the point further one need only to look at big time buck white although this work is not by a black playwright it is perti­nent here because it perfectly illustrates the result of a fusion of cultures white playwrights have long since lost their interest in plays of character they have concentrated their efforts on things best called theater pieces in these works the accent is on the how plays have been done in which the two characters are ping­pong balls papier­mache dolls and boxes none of these things have character the actor then must rally around the idea or the image at best these works have a temporary impact they are temporary because people react to people big time buck white is mid­way between the old ­fashioned people plays and the new see it plays because buck white is more a thing than a character he represents an idea but is without a history as a person our involvement then is totally surf ace we can take home the argument we can even groove to the conception of the role but we do not store big tim among our cast of memorable people of the theater he is an idea not made tangible by character the therapeutic first session of our production of whos got his own was exciting because we had found peop le who turned­us­on like real­life characters they presented us with possibilities rather than answers few black writers present young actors with such indepth characters after the initial reading it was obvious that the actors were committed to the play and would hustle to work out its problems the big problem in act  dealt with the characterizations for the churchmen not having a history and not really moving throughout the act there was very little to hold onto surely we knew black ministers and this would help define attitude and rhythm for the characters we also knew however that there is no  such thing as a ministe ­type  except for the stereotypical things presented through the mass media were these men who worked the store­front church like those in james baldwins amen corner or  were we dealing with the sophisticated college trained big edifice minister in the middle­ class church the lines worked both ways we knew that we couldnt strain the idea of the ministers piety too much for fear of ending up with a  docile purlie victorius the fact that the deacons had little to say was not a boon like the minister they required a totally creative approach we had to  make a world for them to operate in outside that of the play except that they provided an extension of tim  anger they were really  extaneous and we felt that the scene would have been tighter with the three characters fused into one the only other choice was to risk  the danger of creating three cliches comment one of the great dangers in dealing with black drama is the natural tendency toward the  cliche this is somewhat different from creating stereotypical characters in that it is based on the idea that the black actor or director  knows all about the character because he has encountered the type before the point of honesty in interpretation lies in the shared experience of the playwright and the actor i director thestereoty pe however assumes that what is seen  is truth both premises lead to uninteresting characterizations they do so because neither will result in the depiction of a person the problem is a very minor one in whos got his own but many of the new plays are based solely on this kind of cliche we are presented with a young militant or a mother  and that alone is supposed to be enough to define the rest of the relationship the ont positive aspect to this kind of writing is that it gives the director a degree of freedom not experienced when the characters are fully drawn the play can be played differently six million times but without ever approaching a definitive or genuinely moving conception of the work shorter plays often present us with cliches merely because they are short and time does not permit an in­depth characterization act ii is by far the most compelling section of whos got h is own it is probably so because it presents us with very definite movement clara tim jrs sister carries the act and the action carries her we begin with a small girl who so we think has been naughty  but we end with a full­grown woman wrestling with very severe identity problems tim also moves a great deal in this act at the beginning he is a cocky angry and vengef ul man very self­assured and seemingly on top of the situation by the end of the scene however he is probably the most confused member of the f amily and as we later find out on his way toward manhood it is only mama who stands still yet there is ample opportunity for growth in this character she has gained new knowledge  knowledge which could possibly have shaken all supports from a weaker character it is mama who has the very strong curtain speech which implies that it is her development that we should surely have noted we found it difficult to get to the end of the act with the smoothness we desired because of structural elemen ts in act ii we saw it as being a solo by clara which became a duet by clara and tim and ended in a solo by mama the problem seemed to be that in order for mamas final solo to be effective the theme character  had to be introduced and reinforced throughout the act in short mama was far too passive in the early scenes of act ii for her powerful final speech to be the result of gathering power we instead are given two­thirds of clara or tim jr what are you saying this was the only section of the play that gave us any line difficulty because of the repetition of lines showing mamas confusion the interplay between clara and tim works beautifully because of milners skill with language the actor does not have to pl ay at being angry or cutting he just has to read the lines the power and passion of the lines in act ii are increased because they perf ectly define character and condition the words are the words of clara and tim the playwright does not become cute and write in literary cliches or try to win the profanity race but instead gives us a scene without a single dishonest or extraneou s word comment there is a great difference between writing language that is ethnically honest and writing dialogue that moves and defines a dramatic situation in attempting to  create for the stage the language of black people many of our playwrights have overlooked the fact that all language must be refined c and selected if there is to be any kind of artistic concern present to take a street corner conversation and duplicate it without change on  stage would not necessarily result in the creation of an interesting scene it takes the skill of a playwright to organize and refine the language and to support it with meaningful action stage language is a depiction of real conversation but it is not real  in that the playwright hones away all of those things which do not communicate but are a part of each persons individual idiosyncracies  with the rise of improvisational theater the playwright has lost some of his artistic control language has become less important than the image following this trend many of our revolutionary playwrights have attempted to record the scripts of some of the  street­comer action interesting for their realism but they are not plays they are transcripts of an action the untouched language of the spontaneous improvisation
