a rejoinder to
by william j wilson
the march  issue of negro digest vincent hardj it l wrote a passionate and thoughtprovoking letter to black i r students and faculty in the north which seriously challenged the legitimacy of our creating various programs to effect a more meaningful black experience on predominantly white campuses in hardings own words his letter was written in the spirit of black ecumenical concern as we move towards a new humanity and he encouraged those of us to whom his remarks were directed to respond i am therefore taking this opportunity to react to professor hardings very timely letter since space will not permit an elaborately detailed rejoinder to professor hardings arguments i shall here concentrate on what i take to be the basic points of his statement if i understand his position correctly he maintains  that white northern institutions as a result of black student pressure have recently discovered the need to enroll more black students to hire more black faculty and to establish various levels of blkoriented curricula and in attempting to deal with this problem they have begun to exploit black schools in the south by recruiting competent black faculty by entering into serious competition with the southern schools for the best black students and by pirating some afroamerican curriculum which had not been destroyed by integration  that such activities are threatening the survival of black institutions because they are not in a position to compete elfectively in terms of the fabulous scholarship and financial aids offered to the best black students and the attractive salary figures assistance for research and other inducements extended to black faculty  that black students and faculty of northern institutions are participating fully in this common destruction common in the sense that their activities circumvent the concept of the black university and impede the development of new levels of black solidarity not only by demanding the enrollment of more black students the recruitment of black faculty and the establishment of black studies programs but also by helping to raid black schools to meet their demands  that serious questions can be raised about the fruitfulness of such demands and the contradictions they entail eg if only a few institutes in afroamerican studies can live with significant integrity where should they develop and would it not make more sense to bring  black students to a blackoriented professor in the south than to take him away from his campus  that a program of action to deal with these problems and make it possible for us to serverather than destroyeach other includes a establishing special visiting professorships rather than raiding of black schools b creating a consortium in which one or more black and one or more white schools would pool their funds and jointly participate in the recruitment of black students and thereby provide each student the choice of spending three years at a black institution and a year at a white institution or vice versa c encouraging white institutions to make long term substantial financial investments in the black academic institutions and d organizing institutes to train future teachers of black studies programs at black colleges especially those black schools that have the resources to launch such an institute immediately eg the atlanta university center since i shall have to challenge professor harding on several points of a fundamental nature i should like to begin with a brief statement of the no less important arguments with which i find myself in general accord i agree with professor harding that the frantic search by white college administrators for black faculty if left unchecked will threaten the survival of black schools and that many northern black students and faculty are either consciously or unconsciously contributing to this precarious state of affairs moreover i agree that questions may be raised about the practicality of some northern student demands and the contradictions they entail furthermore i agree that a program of action is needed to correct this unfortunate situation my areas of disaccord are concerned with a number of professor hardings specific criticisms and recommendations and more importantly his tendency to altogether ignore or to treat in a cursory fashion certain very crucial matters pertaining to the black higher education crisis let me begin by amplifying this point as it specifically relates to the recruitment of black students if those of us who are involved in increasing the enrollment of black students on northern white campuses were committed to the view that we should only search for the socalled best black students professor hardings arguments would have an unshakable foundation and we would be forced to seriously reappraise our efforts although professor harding seems to confine his remarks to the elitist segment of the black student population i do not know of any massive recruitment campaign which is designed to enroll hundreds of black students each year that restricts itself in this manner on the contrary in response to or anticipation of black student demands northern colleges have developed a proliferation of programs to enroll high risk black students attempts to discourage such efforts would in the final analysis be catastrophic for the hundreds of thousands of denied black students who were until recently virtually ignored by institutions of higher learning they were the forgotten black students from impoverished backgroundsconcentrated in northern ghettoes they either did not meet the entrance requirements of nearby state colleges or did not have the financial resources to attend opendoor black colleges in the south in fact black students who lived in the south had a greater chance of entering colleges than those living in the north for instance we know that in  approximately  percent of the black high school graduates in the south enrolled in institutions of higher learning mostly black schools in the north however except in the state of california which has a large number of opendoor junior colleges the situation for black students was critical i would like to focus very briefly on the new england area for here the critical state of black higher education throughout the north is most forcefully exemplified in  there were only  blacks enrolled in the colleges and universities in new england including junior colleges or  percent of the total student population because the few black students attending new england colleges at that time represented largely the managerial and professional segments of the black population one author was led to conclude    that as far as the economically and socially depressed main body of american negroes is concerned it would not matter at all if new england colleges and universities closed their doors tomorrow black students demands have helped to produce steppedup recruitment efforts and although the figure is still pitifully low there were more black students enrolled in colleges in the state of massachusetts in   than there were in all of new england in  and the massachusetts figure is expected to dramatically increase over the next few years for example at the university of massachusetts we expect to have nearly a thousand black students by the fall of most of whom will come from the ghettoes of springfield and boston we are not recruiting students who would ordinarily go to black schools in the south but students who would have difficulty enrolling in any college in fact there are presently several high risk students on our campus who were rejected outright by black schools because they did not meet the conventional entrance requirements the emphasis on increasing the enrollment of black students is certainly not restricted to the state of massachusetts large state universities and colleges in the north are on expansive recruitment campaigns in the ghettoes some enrolling as many as  black students a year these programs  assist students in getting admitted to college  provide financial support needed to attend college and  furnish academic assistance needed to stay in college in the past denied black students were measured by the same academic criteria that were applied to other students no recognition was given to the crippling influence of ghetto schools by using such criteria these students were usually rated as academically marginal at best being marginal in these respects however may have nothing to do with their potential or intellect it merely indicates that they do not meet the conventional white middle class standards of admission it is incumbent upon black students and faculty in the north to continue to pressure their respective universities to abandon the system of recruiting only the best students which therefore ultimately leads them to search for students in the south i think it is ludicrous for black students from say northwestern university to go all the way to atlanta georgia searching for black students when there are thousands of black students in the ghettoes of nearby chicago just itching for a chance to enroll in college  as northern universities continue to recruit the forgotten black students of the ghetto it is entirely conceivable that in the very near future and unless an equally concerted effort is made in the south an overwhelming majority of black students will be concentrated in these institutions and i would be hard pressed indeed to tell a black faculty member who was recruited expressly to satisfy the needs of these students that he should recognize his true obligation and teach in a black institution as the enrollment figures of northern black students continue to mount their needs cannot be denied however i do not feel that in order to satisfy the needs of increasing numbers of black students in the north black schools in the south should suffer it is for this reason that careful consideration should be given to professor hardings suggestions i shall discuss this matter shortly i was pleased to see professor harding at least acknowledged the fact that many faculty and administrators at predominantly negro colleges have been reluctant to grant that our experience as a people was worthy of serious academic exploration in the final analysis this obstacle has to be overcome if professor hardings suggestions are to be seriously entertained only a few black schools have the orientation which would permit immediate implementation of his proposal we cannot ignore the rigid resistance to change described by nathan hare gwendolyn midlo hall and others who have taught in traditionallyoriented negro colleges it is ironic that these schools provide a good deal of the opposition to the black university concept and the creation of afroamerican curricula it is additionally ironic that the administrators of predominantly negro schools have now been forced to recognize that they have indeed a valuable commodity in their black professor and although they are unable to compete with rich white schools for his services they may now find it necessary to at least give him the same rewards they have traditionally given to their white professor i recognize that professor harding did not address himself specifically to this issue but it comes up time and time again in a critical assessment of his proposed solutions to which i now turn considering our sadly limited resources professor harding states can there be more than a few really excellent programs of institutes of afroamerican studies no doubt may of the premature black studies programs will fail if for no other reasons than a lack of qualified personnel to staff them and a lack of commitment on the part of white administrators to keep them in operation this is a serious problem that demands a thoughtful and creative formula we may quickly dismiss therefore the rhetorical suggestion that it might make more sense to bring  black students to a blackoriented professor in the south than to take him away from his campus as the institutions in the north continue to enroll thousands of black students it would be physically impossible considering the limited space and resources of southern black schools and financially unfeasible to ship all of them or even a majority of them to the south only a small percentage of the total number of black students in the north would be able to take advantage of this opportunity this would create a most unfortunate situation for those who are forced to remain moreover unless the receiving southern institutions are blackoriented we would be exposing the already uptight northern black students to the traditionallyoriented negro colleges which as i emphasized above have yet to acknowledge the legitimacy of black studies programs however professor hardings suggestion of visiting professorships for southern black teachers in northern institutions is a feasible temporary solution to this problem i emphasized the word temporary because i am convinced that even with such visiting professorships the demand for black professors far exceeds the available supply and the gap will rapidly widen it cannot be denied however that this suggestion would help to alleviate the pressure on white administrators and lessen their frantic search for permanent black professors as a stopgap solution then the visiting professorship idea should be immediately implemented an arrangement could be made with white institutions to hold a moratorium on the recruitment of permanent black faculty from the south in favor of visiting black professorships with the proviso that these institutions be permitted to hire as permanent faculty those black professors who personally initiate such an appointment i should think that if white administrators were assured of the participation of black faculty in this regard they would be willing to cooperate in this connection professor hardings recommendation that white institutions make long term substantial financial investments in the black institutions can be realistically entertained more specifically our historic experiences in this society should certainly make us aware that when men have to choose between protecting their own interests or preserving the interests of others they almost invariably decide in favor of themselves altruism regardless of how justified rarely plays a major role in important decisions black people in their interactions with whites have painfully found this proposition to be universally true accordingly in order to assure long term commitment white institutions have to be made to recognize that they have a vested interest in financially supporting various endeavors in black institutions for example in return for an agreement to financially support research programs in certain black institutions white institutions might receive the cooperation of black professors in accepting visiting professorships to staff their black

ear brother harding the questions and concerns that you raised although heavily weighted with ramifications for both our present and our future have for too long eluded our attention thanks to you they now command our attention i find myself wanting to say how right you areabout everything you said but your comments deserve more than that i feel that we not only have to explain the thinking or lack of it and action which led up to the present state of affairs but that we also have to offer something towards the resolution of our present difficulties and for the realization of our goalthe black university while i do not wish to belabour or lengthen unnecessarily the points i wish to make in this response i can see no way of adequately explaining what has occurred outside of recalling somewhat in detail the rather complex formation of events which preceded the present situation i do hope that you will bear with me near the end of august  i was visited by brother bill moore a representative from the monterey peninsula black community which is situated near the santa cruz campus of the university of california bro moore had come to inform me that the community he represented was presently engaged in a struggle to get the university of california which is committed to erecting some twenty colleges on the santa cruz campus to devote the seventh college erected to the teaching of the black experience more specifically they wished the college to be named the college of malcolm_x and be designed to reflect the heritage of the afroamerican people its instructors to be of the black experience degrees up to and including the phd to be awarded in afroamerican studies and a forum room open to the people to be built in the college as a center for the expression of the finest minds and talents of the people of color i was further informed by bro moore that the drive to obtain public support for the proposed college was already underway and that he was presently seeking the support of all bay area student groups my response to the brother had been conditioned by several months of rather intensive thought and action on this and other like subjects much of this is also worth recalling for five years prior to the summer of bro moores visit i had been active in bay area black student circles first at san francisco city college and later at the university of california at berkeley just as it should have been we had protested everything at one time or another oppressive campus rules and regulations meager black faculty discrimination in athletics american involvement in south african apartheid and in rhodesia the vietnam war the draft discrimination in admissions policy and the resulting small number of black students all earned our contempt and verbal condemnation there can be no doubt that all these were outrages before which we had to cry out but once we had cried out we returned to feeling vain and empty we felt there had to be more that we could do but were yet uncertain common landmarks and mutual outcries would soon bring us to the same neck of the woods but at that time we were still trying to define ourselves trying to delimit the scope magnitude and horror of our circumstances and things continued to crumble around usmaking our path difficult to trod the civil_rights movement folded malcolm was murdered and the first long hot summer began to whisk away the people we wanted to save then in  sncc was reborn black and many of us found new hope this development was followed by a noticeable concern about reaction and some of us began to see what the other thing was that had to be done creative action began to take the place of reaction two merritt college students bobby seale and huey newton left their campus and organized the black_panther party the black students at san francisco state went into the black community to organize and recruit they had already begun to develop black curriculum a handful of black students from the university of california went into east oakland to work for mark comfort a black radical who was then running for the state assembly we were all acting on the notion that protest alone would not suffice it was clear to us that if we were to survive we would have to come forth with meaningful programs of action we next entered a period in which there was much talk about and general recognition ofwhat the ultimate solution would be but there were and still are many thousands thet we had to reach train and prepare for this inevitability thus the need for black studies loomed large and clear and almost simultaneously we responded to it i should add that at this point early  our efforts to develop black studies by and large had not yet gained notoriety or been widely publicized we were still thinking talking writing and organizing however one thing was clear to all concerned if education was to play any part in our survivalit would have to undergo a radical qualitative change we also realized that we would have to take it to some people while enabling others to come and get it thus in nearly every set of demands for black studies there is language which deals with community participation and admissions policies but there were and still are problems that remained unresolved and this gets us almost back to bro moore in june of  the black students at the university of california having conceptually developed a program of black studies the previous spring began to cast around for someone to headup the program this effort greatly expanded our awareness of what was going on around the country to begin with we had made a selfdefeating concession to our masters at the university reluctantly we had agreed to try to find someone who by understanding and commitment would be palatable to us and by credentials would be acceptable to the white university this of course is a near irresolvable contradictiona contradiction about which our worse fears and suspicion would later be confirmed but naively and foolishly we tried and in the process an even greater contradiction the real rub came to light again and again everybody and anybody who had even the slightest commitment to what we had in mind was either already committed to some place school or had too many offers to consider another one when this was not the case the person sought was usually grappling with what has emerged as the central issue that we face today ie will we be able to develop one worthwhile black university if we all persist in our efforts to develop little ones all over the country i specifically recall one scholars lament that he had worked for the last several years with the hope of completing his degree and meeting with other scholars at some point of conversion to develop a black university he was now being torn apart by offers many of which were so lucrative that he was greatly distressed by having to reject them but most of all he was distressed by a development which he felt would surely result in the dissolution of his dream of a black university the wholesale development of black studies programs throughout the north it now appears that he was even more right than he thought anyway as we continued in our search for someone to head up black studies at berkeley and found more and more people unavailable became clearer that black students throughout the north were mustering for a stampede in the direction of black studies indeed as i look back it appears that nothing could have stopped this the black student revolts that occurred on the northern white campuses in late  and  were in the breach long before martin_luther_king jr was murdered in april  this is borne out by the unavailability of anyone who could relate to the action of black studies both before and after dr_king was murdered the stampede did not surprise us we knew it was coming we were just in no frame of mind to stop it the events of the time may or may not have contributed to our inability to arrest our energies and change directions but i am rather certain that no single event caused our behavior the overall causes are certainly of a more ancien sic character the basic problem of course was that this was no way to build a black university which was something most of us agreed should be done clearly we were being divided and scattered in as many directions as there are white northern colleges and universities but we made no concerted move to check it instead we all attempted to comer as much of the terribly limited black talent as we could and to outstrip one another in the development of black studies not everyone however was oblivious to what was happening a few people agreed that the most ideal setting for the black university would be some southern negro college with a surrounding metropolitan black community and a rural black community within reach those who favored this model imagined that such a community might indeed become the nucleus from which a black nation could spring i should add that the proponents of this notion were notare not unaware of the various ideological challenges to this concept not the least of these is the bakunian argument that there should be no building of any kind until the present system of oppression is destroyed to which proponents of nationbuilding respond that it is unlikely that this can be done without some base of support which is controlled by the protagonists this is of course a major question for those of us who favor the creation of a black university and ought to be decided as soon as possible but let me go on there have always been persons among us who have argued that no black program of any kind should be placed in white schools the people who make this argument generally believe that we should be setting up schools in the black community and there are really few people who do not agree that this should be done the problem here is that there are obstacles involved which many of us feel we are not presently geared to handle foremost among these is the aggressive recruiting activities being conducted among our people by major colleges and universities all over the west coast whereas we could match the aggression which is still minimal we are in no position to match the lucrative aid and assistance packages that they are handing out and until we have done a sufficient amount of ground work we will not be able to compete with the name and prestige of these institutions no matter how unearned and unjustified these names and their prestige are and this is not a fact to be scoffed at indeed recent efforts to force these same colleges and universities to deal with our needs have been seriously hampered by the lack of participation by many students who refused to get involved because they were afraid that their money would be cut off or that they would lose the opportunity of attending big name schools that they had always aspired to attend we dont like this but the average brother is still more entranced by the notion of attending cal than he is about attending any school that we could get together in the community this is a problem to which i see no solution until we have begun to be more realistic in our assessment of it at berkeley we finally decided that the only way we could even hope to deal with this trend and perhaps reverse the attraction syndrome of which so many students are victims would be to set up some kind of black program that would act as a kind of catch mechanism this is to say that we had no intention at this point of actually institutionalizing any black studies program in a white school instead we hoped simply to have enough of a program to catch the minds and energies of those students who would surely come to berkeley and direct them to where they were really neededthe black community we had no illusion that just getting black students into the black community was going to solve allor anyof the problems there on the contrary we had actually experienced the fallacy of this notion we had always encouraged students to go to the community and to offer service anytime we managed to get a few of them to actually do this invariably the same problem would arise they had no skills or experience that qualified them to deal with the problems they found there they were no different from the white social worker all they did was remind the people that they had problems but in most cases they could offer no solutions they could render no positive service and this turned the people off so we were aware that we not only had to catch people and direct them to the communitywe were also aware that we had to give them something to take there this was our thinking about the catch action and black studies at the time most important of all perhaps was that feature of our thinking on black studies which opposed its institutionalization it was our belief that if such a program was institutionalized it would at the same time be deradicalized and reduced to a purely academic experience and we could see no good coming from an isolated sterile dissection of the black experience we refused to consider any program that would not have arms for action beyond this our concerns centered around what happens to people who get caughtup in institutions we imagined that it would be very easy for concern and enthusiasm to be replaced by indifference and complacency we saw this as a real threat and made all kinds of arguments against it we argued for instance that instructors working in the program should not be tenured this to us was very important because we saw it killing two birds with one stone first of all a number of opportunists who valued the security and prestige of tenure would be discouraged from getting involved from the outset and second we would be able to purge the program from time to time of those influences which proved negative we had not wanted to develop a program with any aspects of permanence we wanted a program that we could pick up at any time intact and sit it down anywhere that we wished and we were sure that we would have to do just that if the program effectively did what we wanted it to do i have bothered to call the occasion of bro moores visit and some of the thinking that preceded it from memory because it sheds a great deal of light on what we were thinking and what was happening on the eve of the great stampede we can see by this rather vividly how sometimes when we begin to move we abort the ideals of our initial intent so how did we respond at that time to the proposed college of malcolm_x watch naturally because of our commitment to the creation of a major black university in the south and our belief that most northern programs should be of the catch type we were predisposed to believing that the proposed college of malcolm_x was a bad idea objections were both primary and secondary the latter centered around what appeared to some of us to be an insidious even if unconscious attempt to legitimize malcolm_x our concern about this was based on an unusual amount of emphasisboth in bro moores verbal explanation of the proposed college and in the literature written for its promotionon the conclusions reached by bro malcolm after his trip to mecca while we did not wish in any way to challenge those conclusions we still found the amount of attention given them disconcerting it was as if the entire bitter experience of malcolms life had been subordinated in importance to the assertion that no one who knew him before and after his trip to mecca could doubt that he had completely abandoned racism separatism and hatred such as this never fails to strike me as being weird and specious i mean it is as if the problem of racism and hatred in america is primarily one of black racism and hatred and we therefore ought to rejoice when a black man abandons racism and hatred kind of reminds you of the common fallacy regarding violence in this country if we black folks werent violent everything would be ok it also occurred to us that any institutionalizing of malcolms name based on such a premise could only serve to reduce the impact of the revolutionary meaning and significance of his life further still our reservations were enhanced by the subtle but unmistakable connection which was being drawn between this proposed undertaking and the philosophy of nonviolence wouldbe patrons were being asked to sign a statement of support which began i wish to show proof in the form of positive action that i support nonviolent projects that will give evidence to the black community that we are interested in them and are willing to accept their ideas on what is best for them it is possible that our comprehension of this statement was awry but it appeared to us to clearly imply that the proposed college was expectedeither through its realization or its functionto contribute to the perpetuation of nonviolence our suspicion of this was greatly increased by bro moores verbal assertion that he believed the college would show goodwill on the part of whites thats fine we thought if others wished to believe this but we remained convinced that any effort to further nonviolence or to show goodwill by exploiting the name of malcolm_x who again and again cautioned us against trickery and taught that nonviolence was suicidal was both insulting and misleading i should like to make it clear that i am not attempting to take on the philosophy of nonviolence here that indeed is the subject of another argument as i stated we had other reservations of a more primary nature to understand these it is necessary not to forget our stated commitment to the creation of a black university in our opinion this was a commitment before which all other considerations having to do with the higher education of blacks should yield in light of this the proposed college of malcolm_x it was thought would affect prematurely the develop
institute of the black world basic assumptions the institute of the black world approaches the controversial and highly significant issue of black studies in america with five basic assumptions they affect the character of all that we do and all that we plan to do in the arena of black studies these are the assumptions  that black studies is really a field still being bomin spite of all the discussion which seems to take for granted the existence of an agreed upon body of thought this is not to deny the existency of significant and often unappreciated work related to black studies which has already been done but it does deny the fact that there is any clear understanding of the specific ways in which a profound mining of the black experience challenges and transforms the basic educational structures of the nation  that the establishing and the defining of the field of black studies stand logically as a task and a challenge for black people in america and elsewhere others may be called upon for assistance but the initiative must be ours  that the institute and its sister institutions of the martin_luther_king jr center and the atlanta university complex are in an excellent position to play a central role in defining the field and creating some of the models so urgently required in this task of course we must find ways of combining the thought and activities of those black persons throughout the nation who are working at the black studies task often in scattered and isolated situations  that a unified rather than a conventionally understood academic disciplinebound approach to the creation of black studies is not only desirable but absolutely necessary indeed this unified approach is central to the demands of most thoughtful black student and faculty groups across the country  that a serious building of this field is the task of years and not a makeshift program for a few persons to do in several weeks or months 
institute of the black world basic program elements against this background of assumptions the planning staff of the institute of the black world has been working towards tentative models for more than a year benefiting of course from the older hopes and dreams of such predecessors in black studies as w e b du bois charles s johnson ralph bunche and alain locketo mention only a few already it has become apparent to us that several elements must be a part of any creative wellstructured approach to black studies we have understandably sought to include them in our own planning among these elements are  serious research in many areas of historical and contemporary black existence which have either been ignored or only superficially explored iethe black church and its theology comparative black urban development in the new world comparative slavery  the encouragement of those creative artists who are searching for the meaning of a black aesthetic who are now trying to define and build the basic ground out of which black creativity may flow in the arts encounter among these artists on the one hand and scholars activists and students on the other must be constant in both formal and informal settings  continuous research on those contemporary political economic and social policies which now shape the life of the black community in america and which determine its future it is clearly necessary to develop a think tank operation which will bring together the many varieties of black approaches to struggle and existence in america this must be done of course in a nonpolemical unpublicized black setting  constant experimentation with the meaning of black studies for the surrounding black community and openness to the possible input from that community into the creation of black studies the twowayness of the experience is essential and must be encouraged  the development of new materials forand new approaches tothe teaching of the black experience which must grow out of laboratory situations at every grade level  the training of a constantly expanded cadre of persons deeply immersed in the materials methods and spirit of black studies who can help supply the tremendous demands for personnel in a variety of formal and informal teaching environments  the creation of consortium models which will make possible the constant interaction of black students and faculty on northem and southern campuses around certain selected foci of black studies this must also expand to the encouragement and development of contacts among black students scholars political leaders and artists from various parts of the world for it is clear that black studies cannot really be developed unless we understand more fully both the unique and the common elements of our experiences in the black diaspora  the gathering and consolidation of those library and archival resources which will facilitate the development of black studies as it proceeds towards definition  the establishment of a publishing enterprise which will not only make available the results of the experimentation and study of the institute but which will also encourage that increasing number of authors and researchers who wish to present their work from the heart of a black matrix  the gathering cataloging and critical analysis of those black studies programs and personnel which have already developed across the nation so that we may begin to gain a fuller sense of direction possibilities and problems this process began with a summerlong seminar in june  and will continue with monthly seminars of black studies directors and several larger working conferencesat least through the summer of  the institute of the black world sees all of these elements as crucial to the development of creative models for the kinds of black studies programs which will not be palliatives but significant pathways to the redefinition of american education and of the black experience these are therefore the elements which have guided us so far in the establishment of our own institute

a national conference for black teachers was held in chicago in april  educators came from all sections of the country and from all levels of educational involvement from wayside rural classrooms to widely acclaimed and distinguished colleges and universities the primary concern of those assembled was to become united around the causes and effects of crises in education and to recognize that the solutions to these problems could and would only come from black educators who recommit and rededicate their lives to these ends a basic structure was put together specific tasks were delegated and the word went forth that the newlyorganized a a a e association of afroamerican educators would begin to deal with and search for all means to educate in the black community qualitatively in atlanta georgia the following year august   the guiding principles were clarified to express that in order for a real and lasting educative process to have support and acceptance legitimacy it must have as its base the total involvement and total dictates of each local area or community in order to achieve total involvement with the entire black community participating the madison avenue style of executive management and hierarchal omnipotence had to be ruptured this style of management was the cause of the initiation of the conference the black communiversity evolved from a monthlong concentration on the historical evolution and development of the black manfromafrica through our present situation in america during the month of february  in chicago black liberation north many groups and individuals worked in unison to bring culturallyexpressive programs to all segments of the black community the project was a success from out of this endeavor a black congress was formed and from out of this congress a black communiversity came into being classes were scheduled teachers volunteered and black students enrolled at this time over  students were involved in the curriculum    the question now is that a strong demand has come forth to attempt to broaden the scope of the services that the communiversity offers and to develop a structure that will envision and encompass the totality of the black community thereby unifying all partsas only an educative process can all educationoriented organizations or groups are being called upon to assist in the structuring of a more comprehensive educational system toward this end a weekend conference has been planned for july  and  in chicago the location will be announced later 
is our intention to review briefly some alternatives to the v present systems of education that have been setup for us £ by suggesting a separate and independent system of education for colonized blacks in america i white people have institutions while black people have institutionalized leaders this paper could have been called an alternative to black charismatic i leaders you can kill a black charismatic leader but how do you destroy the white institutions which produce black charismatic leaders an alternative is to build our own institutions institutions are created to perpetuate the system that sets them up therefore if a racist system creates institutions the institutions must reflect racism understanding this one concept makes it very clear that all schools attended by black people are doing exactly what they are supposed to doperpetuate the idea of white superiority and black inferiority even when some blacks are led to believe they have reached europeanization they are rejected because rejection devices for all nonwhites are built into the institutions two of the most important things about institutions are  they are selfperpetuating and  they never produce an alternative for outsiders today black schools are structured so as to be both reactionary and repressiveto both black teachers and black students our new school system must serve as the instrument for black resistance to white dominance and as this immovable force propel black people toward selfunderstanding and clear directions of goals our new schools must provide us with alternative solutions for arriving at our newly deflned and newlyaccepted goalsfor our students and our teachers are our future it is within our new system of education that our children may receive the assistance and acquire the stability to forge our new lifestyles this system must enable them to recognize respect resurrect and create new and positive images for from out of this will come the rhythmic dynamic and futureoriented base for total and lasting access to power this new system will become established as the fundamental cornerstone upon which all other institutions will be solidly built these new institutions will become our first line of collective defense against white cultural oppression other educational institutions have withdrawn even their semblance of support for black people    and we are left to build our own this is a challenge but not an impossible dream when one considers the timeliness of this necessity and when one operates within the confines of a properlychanged frame of reference the basics are already present to begin to build the last two decisive social groups yet intact and caught up together our students and our teachers two strangers in a world unknown and to be explored will create this new system of educationwith and not for the black community therefore we suggest an independent educational systemtotally accountable to the black community and financed supported and controlled by black people the purpose of an alternative system  to help black people students parents professionals etc understand what is being done to them and at the same time reveal to them the drama of everyday local national and international events  to help black people understand the relationship of the black colony in america to the white metropolitan society in america by studying euroamerican colonialism  to help the black professional who is confused and now stands helplessly by as the white colonial worldandthe black resistance movement prepares to destroy him  to help black students who are presently struggling without a proper frame of reference  to help black parents and their children who shoulder the total weight of victimization and exploitation  to help black community organizations which have attempted to stand and serve as a bulwark or retaining wall between the white oppressor and the black oppressed  to also help community organizations understand all methods of mobilization to cope with the fundamentals of true and victorious resistance to acquire all of the basics for communal survival and to become fully acquainted with a definitive difference between organization and movement ¦ steps to an alternative system of education i local community leaders a identification and communication with local leaders  identify communicate and meet with organizational leaders or their representatives at an appointed time and place  the purpose of the meeting should center around the possibilities of total community alliance or at least total community cooperativeness and legitimization strengthened by the membership of each individual group all concerned should aim for a unified tactical goal independent system of education which in this case will be the search for an answer to the problem of urban innercity education  the head of each organization or his representative should submit an oral synopsis of his organizations activities goals accomplishments and strategies  an overview of views and concepts about an alternative system of education should be made with sanction and a cooperative acceptance from as many groups as possible and necessary plans should be made for a citywide conference ii student groups the same or similar procedures as suggested for community organizations should be used contact existing black student organizations in a high schools b universities c other educational institutions iii parents the same procedure should be followed with parents only parents should be organized within a given school district or specific school all however should be invited to attend and participate individually until organized or from any private or parochial parentchild school involvement iv teachers and other professionals teachers should be organized by school districts at the elementary high school or college levelpublic private or parochial other professionals should be organized according to the dictates of their particular field of endeavor and according to how their expertise can best be meshed with the total program
malcolm s a community college with a new perspective
by charles g hurst jr
he deplorable state of public education in the united states
t
f leads to the conclusion that the future is bleak and unpromis
ing for millions of black americans who are being tolda f constantly that education is a ticket to freedom to coin a term familiar to all in the black community education in
the united states from kindergarten through college is in a mess from
the standpoint of a community that is witness to the many failures of
education to do what it claims as its jobnamely educatean insidious
hypocrisy is being perpetrated compounded by a callous white public
that does not seem to care moreover the black community is becoming
painfully aware of the high level of undesirable waste occurring as
more and more students emerge illfitted to serve themselves or society
the results may be seen through serious erosions in community confidence
and a reluctance of the community to participate in educational
programs that demean without teaching
recently released statistics by the chicago board of education showing
that attempts to teach reading are exercises in futility even at the
eleventh grade level are carbon copies of those released sporadically by boards of education in all parts of the united states these statistics document the absolute inability of public school systems and programs as presently constituted to meet the urgent needs of a large majority of black children and youth and for that matter the needs of the poor generally black or white the overall verbal level for eleventh grade students in chicago is  percentile points below the national norm the reading level for vast numbers of black students in high schools such as crane high school in chicago is  points below the average and only slightly better than the zero levelor complete illiteracyat the eleventh and twelfth grades strangely and tragically attempts to pinpoint responsibility for the failures of public schools expose one of the most sophisticated systems of buckpassing in existence the end result is to place the blame on the student or more insidiously to recreate the myth of black inferiority such practices are not only unfair but also destructive as well simply as a matter of selfpreservation this country can no longer afford to permit the managers of education to miseducate or not to educate at all and to escape the consequences of their failures hopefully it is not too late for education to put its own house in order but for this to happen education must be willing to take a new view toward itself the students the community the curriculum and teaching practices to begin with we in education can no longer hold ourselves above reproach for the failures we produce we must be willing to readily admit that our record in urban education is a sad one with little if anything to recommend it or us further we have lived too long on the records of the past and upon the achievement of a few who make it in spite of us not because of us finally we must face squarely the fact that many students get absolutely nothing out of their school experience even many who graduate are unable to read or write at a literate level we are obviously in an educational crisisa crisis more subtle than a hunger crisis or military crisis but a crisis nonetheless the dangerous potentialities of the educational crisis are demonstrated through the antisocial behavior of many of educations rejects and the fatal consequences ensuing from their attempts to survive in a world where the odds are stacked against them anyone seriously interested in analyzing the etiology of the crisis must be well aware of the causes and of what we must do since  our country has undergone almost unbelievably swift revolutions in science and technology economic and political affairs and demographic and social structures but despite revolutionary advances that have made travel to the moon a routine miracle education in the united states has adapted to space age demands with lethargic reluctance five specific problems appear to be paramount  the demands of a space age and computer paced society for the certifications provided by education  the sharp increase in the number of people seeking an education especially black people  the unwillingness of the society to meet the costs of mass education  the inherent inertia of the educational system  the inertia of the society itself and the racism that is so deeply embedded in every aspect of american life to meet challenges to the nation of current crises in domestic as well as foreign affairs education will needmore than moneyideas courage determination and a new will for selfappraisal reinforced by a will for creatively conceived change as matters now stand education has not shown either the ability or the willingness for searching selfcriticism neither has it been able to seize opportunities for innovations that will help teachers achieve more in classrooms filled with distractions and angry students it has failed to infuse the needed knowledge and methods required to meet the current crisis while exhorting everyone to change education has remained stubbornly resistant to innovation and new ideas in a larger sense the crisis of education is the crisis of the greater society and thus it is the urgent concern of all citizens committed to the perservation of our present way of life i firmly believe that the crisis of education in the black community can be overcome a critical selfanalysis is a beginning a reeducation and sensitizing of teachers is a second step a relevance and upgrading of curriculum is a third an effort to truly involve the community in school affairs is a fourth application of some new theories of teaching and learning as suggested by repeated research findings is a fifth and a new responsiveness to conditions and to the people education purports to serve is the last i list here but far from the last in possibilities if education is to provide the answers we need so urgently rather than faulting its critics who are engaged in an exercise of love and faith the managers of education would do better to take stock of educations obvious weaknesses and move to do something about them continuation of programs and techniques that do not work is wrong and a breach of public trust the black people of america deserve the best that education can produce not the worst essentially therefore it is to the thousands of black youths and disenchanted adult poor to which a community college in an urban ghetto must address itself the following statement of philosophy representing the raison detre of malcolm_x college should make it abundantly clear how this can be done limits of space will not permit a full discussion of proposals for each educational level thus the present paper must be limited to a delineation of a relatively new kind of institution the community college that is serving as a reclamation center for the human problems created by callously inefficient public schools yet many of the principles and philosophies are basic to contemporary education at any level malcolm_x college is a concept of the future whose past is rooted in the enslavement of black people so pervasive is the heritage of slavery in this society that we must constantly struggle to keep from unconsciously allowing to develop at this institution situations which serve to enslave and to exploit rather than to develop and actualize human potential the processes by which ideal slaves are made have been described as follows step   establish and maintain strict discipline   step    implant in the bondsmen themselves a consciousness of personal inferiority    step    awe them with a sense of their masters enormous power    step   persuade the bondsmen to take an interest in their masters enterprise and to accept his standards of good conduct   step   impress them with their helplessness to create in them a habit of perfect dependence upon their masters clearly if we do not wish to perpetuate the systematic psychological and social enslavement of black people we must develop articulate and practice counter mechanisms which will serve to liberate ourselves and our students such mechanisms as the following have been instituted at malcolm_x college step discipline follows from a precise understanding of what must be done and why it generates from within the individual and the group and is enforced by each individual in the group step a deliberate effort is made to develop a capacity to master whatever one aspires to learn to succeed in whatever one aspires to do step those in positions of authority endeavor to empower their colleagues and subordinates teaching them how to use power for the good of all step the enterprise is viewed as belonging to the people specifically to those people in the community who voluntarily express an interest in itand hence the standards norms and values permeate from the base to the apex in terms of the kind of institution desired by the students and the community step people are helped to help themselvesto learn from failures rather than seek to avoid them to be honored more for having tried than for having succeeded the educational model to which we subscribe is built upon a different assumption about the nature of potential human ability than is typical of most educational institutions while we recognize variation we know that the ability potential of the average black american is well beyond the normal demand level of the most rigorous academic programs and hence we justify a maximum social effort to develop the abilities of all people concomitantly any failure to achieve high levels of performance constitutes a group social failure rather than an individuals failure we propose to educate our students for three goals freedom individuality and service  freedom in a very general sense refers to a freedom from external constraint malcolm_x college is characterized by free access to the resources of the institution the city the world the role of staff and student body is to remove the obstacles which block the path of those seeking the more specific freedom defined as the capability to deal creatively and effectively with ones situation we take the position that in order to achieve positive freedom students must be encouraged to actively and consciously attempt to utilize their personal resources their life style and their experiential background in the classroom the student must become skilled at identifying needs problems and issues which affect the nature and quality of life in his environment and then use them in his research hopefully he will learn to relate his learning to the problems of his community with a view toward ultimately finding solutions to the communitys problems as well as his own  individuality cannot genuinely exist without the freedom described above the thrust of this perspective is to resist any simple accounts of what a person really is or intends to become and allows for distinction between ones real self and ones apparent self the real self is in our judgment dynamic and expanding and defies prima facie or merely quantitative assessment individuality presupposes a social context and yet underscores the uniqueness of each person in that context our notion of individuality is characterized by builtin capacities not necessarily apparent for good which are inseparable from the good of the community and ultimately of all mankind  service involves being a contributing member of society by bringing ones unique resources to bear upon human problems particularly the problems confronting the black community as with the others this concept recognizes that the truly educated man is also a learned man but more than that he is one in whom learning is combined with an understanding of social injustice and a commitment to correcting it at malcolm_x college we reject the educational process which places didactic instruction at the core and we propose that the time has come for us to control our zeal for imparting knowledge and skills and to concentrate our efforts on developing the individual student by education for individual development i mean a program consciously undertaken to promote such qualities as flexibility creativity openness to new experiences responsibility accountability and commitment education no longer can be a pouring into it must be a means of providing the climate and conditions in which the greatest possible development of potential can take place further we reject organizational structures which tend to be paternalistic administrators and faculty know best students know least we propose organizational structures in which power is shared and the participation of all is guaranteed finally we must emphasize that malcolm_x college is a black institutionone in which the educational services are designed to serve in a unique way the goals of black people as the community becomes more clear about the kind of society it is trying to build we will design our educational programs to promote the black agenda there is emerging a degree of concensus among black people that our educational system has to prepare our young people to play dynamic and constructive parts in the development of a society in which all members share fairly in the good or bad fortune of the group and in which progress is measured in terms of human wellbeing not prestige buildings cars or other material things whether privately or publicly owned in essence we believe that our kind of college with a black oriented curriculum and philosophy is in a unique position to deal both with the ills of our society and with the human consequences of its derelictions as an integral part of the community itself the institution can and must be creatively and flexibly responsive to the communitys needs as well as to those of the individual inhabitants where necessary the college must serve as a catalytic agent to synthesize the varied components of the community into a viable force for liberation never losing sight of the individual the contemporary educational institution must be concerned at all times with massive changes of social and economic conditions which may enhance the communitys potential for successful selfdetermination creative response to educational needs becomes in consequence only one even if the most important of the educational institutions responsibilities leadership where there is a void and unlimited supportive assistance where there is a need represent the basic tenets of a practical philosophy of commitment that views liberation of any oppressed people as the specific charge for all democratic institutions if education can not participate enthusiastically in achieving this aim it does not deserve to exist finally if education does not begin to educate for the kind of humaness implicit in some of the aforegoing paragraphs education will cease to exist a victim of its own inertia

n october  in durham north carolina the black community saw its dream of a relevant black educational institution become a reality with the opening of malcolm_x liberation university in an old warehouse which had been cleaned out and renovated on the th of october over  black people from durham and communities around the country gathered in front of the building site to listen to the dedication message of sister betty shabazz widow of brother malcolm_x sister betty charged the participants in the ceremonies and black people around the world with the task of organizing for black unity and building for the black nation with the opening of the university have come several questions concerning the need for such a venture on the part of black people why malcolm_x liberation university why durham north carolina why in  in order for us to answer these questions we must understand somewhat the political struggles of black people in durham as well as in other communities around the country in the spring of  a concentrated effort was started in durham to organize black people to bring about better living conditions the effort had two basic objectives  the involvement of black people in the decisionmaking apparatus of the local oeo office of economic opportunity poverty agency  the creation of neighborhood organizations to press for improvement in such areas as the lack of traffic stop signs playground equipment street lights etc in the black community initial organizing efforts proved quite successful neighborhood councils were formed the community action agency granted representation to these groups for a while it seemed as if the democratic process might actually work for black people but the optimism was shortlived for black people ran into a brick wall when they pressed for more substantial changes such as housing repairs street paving and public housing reforms when black people met continuous opposition in their efforts to bring about change the tone of the movement became more and more militant the next two years saw important changes in the thinking of the community people the neighborhood groups pressed for autonomy from the oeo poverty agency tactics for change accelerated rapidly petitions changed to pickets picketing evolved into mass marches mass meetings gave way to protests characterized by violent confrontationsall this in two years the militancy of the community drew the attention of black students at duke university and north carolina central university in addition links between the community and students were formed during a summer intern program in  in which black college students from throughout north carolina lived and organized in the neighborhoods this involvement created a new atmosphere of co operation between black college students and neighborhood people during this time black students at duke university underwent some important ideological changes they began to work more in the community and with the black nonacademic employees on campus the students began to think and talk in terms of the critical question of the relevance of the entire educational process to the needs of the black community they concluded that the process as it exists is in fact irrelevant events on campus at this time began to move in rapid succession there were a series of protests and confrontations which culminated in the students seizing the administration building and demanding that a black studies program be established and controlled by black people throughout these confrontations and protests the students found that they had the strong immediate and active support of the organized neighborhood groups it was all of these ingredients and of course the subsequent refusal of duke university to speak to the question of relevant black education which led the students and the community people to take a second look at their efforts a simple truth was realized throughout the movement that those who are oppressed cannot look to those who oppress them to deal in any way with the nature or source of the oppression if black people in durham north carolina wanted a relevant educational institution they would have to build it themselves it was decided that the next logical step was the development of malcolm_x liberation university ideas for the universitys development were obtained in a series of meetings with students faculty and black people from communities throughout north carolina these meetings ended in the late spring of  at this point an outline of the university had been developed which served as the base for its continued development during the summer months of  a task force of former students headed by brother howard fuller worked with the community people in durham and other black people around the country in order for the university to open in the fall so we can see that the answers to the above questions can be simplified thusly malcolm_x liberation university opened on october   in durham because it was an idea whose time had come it had come because of a logical progression of events which had occurred both in the black community and on the campus of duke university the overriding purpose of the university is to provide a framework within which education can become relevant to the needs of black people training at the university therefore is geared toward the analysis of the american system and of all other institutions of colonizing societies which serve the process of black dehumanization beyond this however the university represents an attempt to develop a functional black ideology which will serve as a guideline for black people and will further define and develop a program to build selfreliance it is the feeling of those at the university that if we are in fact serious about black liberation then we must be speaking ultimately of black independence and if we are speaking of black independence then we are speaking basically about these things  the control by black people of our goods and services  the control by black people of our consciousness  the control by black people of the mechanisms of force and violence malcolm_x liberation university then is essentially concerned with the building of black selfreliance in order to help bring about black independence the curriculum of the university is broken into two sections running for approximately  to  months each the first section broadly defined as the ideological and cultural part includes five basic topics plus physical development and language classes the five topic areas are  independent african civilization  slavery  colonialism  neocolonialism  independent african world each of the areas is designed to provide the student with a knowledge of the historical social economic and political framework of black existence both in this hemisphere and on the continent the second section of the curriculum is set up to give intensive training in some of the basic skills needed to build selfreliance for black people these skilled areas are  food scientists  architects  medics  engineers  black expressionists  teachers  communications technicians there are also community seminars which are offered weekly by students or instructors at the university the student body at malcolm_x liberation university is made up of  regular day students and approximately  who attend the night seminars these students represent a wide range of geographical areas from massachusetts down the east coast and into mississippi there is also a wide range in their educational backgrounds most of them have had some experience working in the black community organizing neighborhood problem  groups or organizing youth groups students with rural backgrounds have worked in such enterprises as coops and simple farming many of the students backgrounds show that they dropped out or were asked to leave their former schools and colleges for political activism because of these varying backgrounds innovative teaching and learning methods are of a necessity at the university the malcolm_x liberation university experience is a young one still there have been and there are still some difficult hurdles to overcome but those who are attending and working with the university are very serious about black liberation this seriousness is reflected in a statement which was made public prior to the official opening by howard fuller the main organizer and present head of the university we view malcolm_x liberation university as an integral part of the black community therefore we will be involved in any activities affecting the community    there will be neither guns nor drugs of any kind in the building    therefore if this building is invaded by socalled law officers of a federal state or local variety on the pretext of looking for guns and dope it will be just thata pretext    we will be about educating black people this building will serve as a base for that education we will not take any invasion of it lightly we will consider any invasion as an act of aggression against our people and we will respond accordingly thus far no response has been necessary but the concept which the above statement embodies is always kept in the minds of the university participants this concept is that in order to build institutions to bring about a better future for black people we must be constantly aware of the present day forces which seek to blunt such efforts we think that malcolm_x liberation university will not be stopped but we recognize the need for the spiritual as well as the physical support of black people wherever we may be

th the rape and penetration of the african continent by the europeans resulting in the destruction of african independence the ability of african people to determine establish and control an education that functioned in their behalf was destroyed a dependent relationship between african people and european people has since then been maintained in three areas  they control our minds and instill white consciousness  they control the ability to provide goods and services agriculture health industry etc  they control the mechanisms of force and violence from the local cops to nato one of the results of this dependency has been the growth of the assumption that the only valid and legitimate standards of wellbeing are those of white supremacy white power and white nationalism white consciousness is always equated as human consciousness education is the primary instrument used to instill i consciousness the educational i process that we are forced to un i dergo demands a commitment to white standards and values it insists that we become white of mind if not white of skin and that our commitment be to the assumptions practices and priorities of white supremacy and white nationalism this assumption is usually ex  pressed in such phrases as the struggle for equality other examples include equal employment equal housing equal pay equal toilets etc this of course avoids the question of equal to what this catechism of equality only addresses itself to the everchanging specific manifestations of our oppression it avoids the question of independence maintaining that america is my homecontrary to all historical evidence the question for us is whether to be equal or to be free to be dependent or to be independent to be integrated or to be liberated the history of the equal rights mode of struggle shows that this mode of struggle has only resulted in the maintenance of domination and the continuance of dependency as justice roger b taney of the u s supreme court said in  the black man has no rights that a white man need respect we are an african people as a people our struggle is one for independence there are three stages in the struggle for independence  selfreliance  liberation  independence selfreliance is the condition of relying on our resources as a people in order to accomplish any number of specific tasks and responsibilities that contribute to our liberation and independence this can mean for example the ability to develop our oil resources in nigeria our minds in a school in washington d c our bauxite in the caribbean our gold in south africa or our water resources in the sahara there are countless specifics in essence it means proceeding to utilize all of the skills that exist among our people selfreliance concretely begins to break the dependence forced upon us by europeans for the last  years it begins to consolidate the collective strength of our scattered nation and to focus this strength on the tasks of reclaiming our natural and human resources which will lead to our independence the hand and mind begin to function in a liberated and liberating manner independence is the ability to possess our minds and consciousness the ability of our people to produce the goods and services necessary for the wellbeing of our people and the ability to protect and defend what is ours we have said that the first step in our struggle for independence is to become selfreliant a critical area in this regard is education it is necessary that we begin to assume responsibility for our own education in order that we begin to determine what our interests are and what responsibilities we have to collectively assume we cannot realistically expect the institutions and programs committed to white power to meaningfully commit themselves to the interests and priorities of african people we have the responsibility to begin to establish schools that function in the interests of african people such schools will  outline a course of study that will develop the body the mind and scientific and technical skills that will be be used in the interest of african people  each member of the school will be expected to fulfill a teaching responsibility within the larger african community  establish and encourage  standards and values that commit our people to the struggle for african independence in fact the educational process undergone in this school will intensify the neverending conflict of interest between european peoples and african peoples it is not our intention to prove with this school and others that will be established that we are able to provide the credentials necessary to function comfortably within the framework of white america itis not our intention to occupy students minds with passfail or phdistheroadtosuccess delusions we are not charting a route to mainstream america as j j jones has said harvard and other freak factories has ruint more good niggers than bad whiskey this is the task before us to teach the truth of our situation and what we must do a we are an african people our history has been that of an african people and our future will be that of an african people b african people are at war with european people and have been for the last  years c the struggle of african people is for an african nation while it is important that a number of battles for selfreliance be waged in the americas by african people we should always politi cally see those battles in relation to the struggle for an independent african continent d we must use our human resources for the development of the physical resources of africa we must use our political resources to advance the independence of africa e in any society education has two functions  to carry on the culture and traditions of that society and  to provide the skills and training necessary for the development of that society our education must function in this way as an integral part of society in the interest of the total society as opposed to the interest of the individual as a people we are fragmented geographically eg we live in the u s brazil caribbean senegal gambia etc and we are fragmented in terms of our consciousness eg afroamerican afrotrench afrojewish afrogreek etc that is to say we define ourselves and our interests within european frameworks given this fragmentation we find ourselves in an indefensible position as a people at this point in our history we must forge our fragmented people into a strong nation as edward blyden said we need some african power some great center of the race where our physical pecuniary and intellectual strength may be collected we need some spot whence such an influence may go forth in behalf of the race    we need to collect the scattered forces of the race and there is no rallying ground more favorable than africa an african nationality is our great need we should not content ourselves with living among other races simply by their permission or their endurance our school therefore begins to extricate our people from the american nation and focus them on the development of an african nation this requires  a knowledge of the african past and a commitment to the african future  the development of the scientific and technical skills that will be important to the capacity to deal meaningfully with the resources within the african world  the development of language skills important in order to communicate within the african world and also in order to broaden the range of available information  travel to the african continent in particular and more generally to the various parts of the african world  that the educational process not be allowed to be contained within any single physical facility there is a teaching responsibility to be directed towards meeting the educational needs of the community  a special concern is given to the ways and means of communicating varying kinds and amounts of information within the african community whether it be from northwest washington to southeast washington or from new york to nairobi or from texas to trinidad  physical fitness and training be an important concern we must understand that strength in body is as important as strength in mind and that there is a relationship between the two let us finally repeat that the fundamental task before us is that of building a nation which will be responsive to the needs and interests of all african peoples we must begin now to integrate the vast body of skills that exist among african peoples into the work of nationbuilding we must put our total being into this task with total commitment to the establishment of independence for african people

quarters of a century it wuz four stories and housed anywhere from four to five hundred people the odd shape of the triangle building created long hallways which were seldom lighted by anything other than daylight dashed through the dirty sometimes paneless windows or trickles of light that crawled from overunder the apartment doors the first floor contained two storefront churches one penny candy store one auto supply store one gypsy fortune teller and one herb and sacraments store that doubled as a policy station duck and bunky were standing in front of the building when blue got there

good time to vacate the scene while the white boy wuz the brunt of the hostility 
ment of the black university this made all kinds of sense when we considered such things as our limited resourceshuman materialthe distribution of the black population and the most fertile sitesfor the black university as i have already stated rightly or wrongly many of us agreed that the black universityat least the mother campus would be best situated in the south assuming that there were others who would agree with this again rightly or wrongly we naturally balked at what sounded like a major development outside of the south we could not help but view any such development as being premature we were also concerned about what appeared to us to be a purely academic approach to the many problems of the people of color neither could we overlook the fact that the college would ultimately be controlled by whites as it was to be part of a white university which is controlled by a racist board of regents and a reactionary governor even more disturbing to us was the fact that the college would be at santa cruz which is certainly not an area with any significant number of black people relative to other areas in california and at the time of the proposal there were less than a dozen black students on the santa cruz campus we couldnt buy the college of malcolm_x but unknowingly we were getting ready to stake our lives on another bill of goods i now recall how some of us shivered with fear for the black university when the santa cruz people spoke of setting a national example perhaps some expert on mass psychology can tell us how ironically even those of us who opposed such developments and had perceived some of the dangers would soon come to speak the same language less than three months went by after bro moores visit before the cry of black studies now was raised across the land many of us who had been the opposition found ourselves leading the charge in berkeley after nine months of fruitless negotiations over our catch action we issued an ultimatum in january for several months prior to the ultimatum asian students chicago students and native american students had been engaged in a crash effort to develop their own programs these were nearing completion when the ultimatum was issued when it became clear that we would have to go downand that the other groups would probably have to do the same at some future datewe joined hands and asked for a third world college to house the four programs it might be said that our catch action died a natural death but the memory of the college of malcolm_x and our response to it three months earlier wasis extremely painful constant vigilance constant vigilance now brother harding i must attempt to deal with your letter more directly i too believe that some of our actions have placed us in bad company in trying to assess what might have been our greatest mistake i seem unable to avoid thinking that it was to assume that every white school which had even the smallest number of black students ought to have black studies most white schools will never make a workable adjustment to such programs still more of them simply do not deserve such programs but im getting ahead of myself this is something that i should return to all black students are not interested in black studieslet alone a black university au naturels dashikis and bubas have caused us to become presumptuous traditional motives for going to college are still very much alive the students want in and college is still the gateway when they came in different attire and coiffured differently many of us assumed that they wanted out for the most partwe were wrong but it is true that you can never fool everybody in this case it was mainly the socalled negro teachers who were not fooled they seemed to recognize immediately the difference between a change in style and a change in motive the new black thing was clearly a case involving a change of style and the socalled negro teachers recognized this one might think that they would have immediately called a conference as they so hurriedly have for a thousand other reasons to warn the students that they were dealing with style instead of substance but no for obvious reasons this was not in the cards what did occur instead was that prestohundreds of socalled negro teachers suddenly became black instructors out the window went murrays tuxedo royal crown and straightening combs the buba business had a new market books dealing around black folks were rushed into print course outlines were developed others were borrowed sold or stolen and letters and circulars carried the good tidings of jobs for black instructors  the students were told to keep on pushin when schools were not sending out such letters and circulars various other programs were the entire country is now literally crawling with black programs and everyvhere the end result is division and confusion but we face an even greater danger what must be one of the greatest dangers we now faceif not the greatest dangeris the obvious creation of a class of opportunists who are determined to make off black studies what texas millionaires have made off oil in common parlance i would call them hustlers like the story of the ship at sea without fresh water we are fast approaching a situation where there will be black experts everywhere and not a drop of expertise this brother harding is what many of us are presently in league with and it is a league that we must break with very soon if we are ever to have our own on many occasions the central issue in our struggles with white administrators has been that of autonomy and in most cases we have not gotten it although in many cases they have acquiesced in such a manner as to offer the illusion that we have gotten it this is of the utmost importance in assessing fully the danger of the aforementioned problem because we do not have autonomy over the programs we are creating quite often when we discover that we have a dud on our hands which may be the whole program or someone in it we are unable to get rid of itthem this of course is very risky monstermaking and has considerably stiffened the demand for self determination there is yet another unseen danger in trying to operate without the power to purge when necessary quite often we do not really know the people we bring in to teach and administer us if no struggle occurs which calls for a demonstration of their commitment it is safe to assume that we never really know where they are alas in many cases when struggle has occurred more often than not we have discovered that our black and third world instructors were on the other side at best they were for themselves this was graphically illustrated during the strike at berkeley when only six third world faculty and administrators out of approximately seventyfive would agree to go on strike when we asked them to of course there were all kinds of reasons why they couldnt many of which could have been offered by the students who were on the line but then its ok if students get offed they should keep on pushin  so that faculty and administrative people can continue to multiply and give credence to the lie but i really didnt wish to get into all this i only meant to say that we have learned that it is extremely dangerous to act as the head of a house when you cant bring people in or put them out when it comes to that point i should like to suggest right here that one simple way of dealing with this problemwhile checking the overall shotgun approach to the development of black studieswould be to rule out from the git go any development of black studies in those institutions where we are unable to gain the autonomy necessary to control them i fear if we fail to do this now we shall all suffer for it later but the total solution of this problem calls for more than one move the other moves i feel represent a partial response to your questions regarding our sense of vocation as is clearly borne out by the problems we face regarding programs and personnel there is an urgent need for us to begin to identify both faculty and students who have a serious long term vocational interest in developing a black university and getting them to work on it immediately if successfully carried out this alone would probably kill twothirds of the nonfunctional black studies programs in the country somehow at some time we have got to make it clear that black studies is not a mere cultural phenomenon which one relates to by parading around in the latest nationalist garb and talking bad sooner or later there just has to be a parting of the ways between those who just want to be in either the thing or the know and those who want to aid in our liberation through education we are simply no good for one another it will also have to be made clear that black studies has not come about to guarantee jivetime boogaloo opportunistic students degrees by padding their grades at present there is an immense amount of outright shuckin and jivin ie students expecting grades of excellent for writing papers which in essence say only ive got my shit together which is doubtful or im doing my thang others expect good grades for simply reaffirming the fact that whitey is doing his thang this is not the way to liberation and i think we should stop letting people believe that it is students who want to play football basketball go to europe become stockbrokers get into the movies become black capitalists or playboy bunnies should be taughtwarned and left alone most certainly they should be identified we have committed some regrettable mistakes because we failed to identify them in the past many of us saw them walking around looking militant and felt compelled to create campus revolts in their behalf this was certainly not the least of our mistakes but let me move on i had hoped that i could deal with the questions that you raised at the end of your letter in the order that you raised them however as i have attempted to respond torather than just answeryour letter a large part of the order has already been preempted but i will at this point attempt to go beyond the body of your letter to those numbered questions that remain you will i hope permit me one exception questions numbered  i see no way to proceed without first dealing with these clearly there cannot be more than a few really excellent programs in afroamerican studies in this country the scarcity of our resources leaves no doubt about this take for example what is happening in northern california in the san francisco bay and surrounding area there are some  major and minor colleges and universities all of these are presently in the process of developing black andor ethnic studies programs really i can think of only a dozen or so black instructors who may have more than an elementary understanding of what is actually meant by black studies of these i can think of less than half a dozen who have demonstrated or expressed any genuine interest in developing a black university further still if we started to speak of less than  to  a year in salary i would be afraid to bank on more than three of these on the brighter side if we can call it that the situation is somewhat better with concerned students but this glimmer too is dulled when you consider the task at hand the development of some  college programs not to mention the demands being made by local and surrounding high schools given these circumstances not only in california but across the nation it is easy to appreciate the absurdity of trying to develop black studies at random but even if this could be done it would be certain to weaken if not totally dispel any effort to develop one or two major programs anywhere so the question of where such programs should be developed becomes key perhaps for a change we are actually in need of a conference to decide where we should or should not attempt to develop black studies and if such a conference were to be called it should be made clear to all concerned that the purpose of the conference would be to bring together all of those persons who are not only concernedbut who wish to devote their energies to the creation of a black university if this is not done and we bring an amorphous group of people together to discuss black education in general we run the familiar and often catastrophic risk of lapsing into needless oration and generalities this is not to say that we do not need or appreciate the support that we presently haveonly that someone must actually do the work now something is implied here which ought to be dealt with what is implied is that some differentiation is being made between black education in general and the black university in my opinion this is a necessary differentiation it is my understanding that we who wish to work towards the development of a black university are not saying that we wish to dictate or control everything educational that has to do with black people instead we are simply saying that we believe that there should be a black university in other words i do not believe that we are implying that no school other than the black university should attempt to have its curriculum reflect the presence of black people indeed i think we all agree that this should be done i think however that we ought to be saying to our own people that any major program developed should in some way be either directly related to or at least complimentary to the development of the black university otherwise such programs are bound to do a disservice to the black university by contributing to our already disturbing state of diaspora once we have decided where the mother campus of the black university is going to be i can see no difficulty in then determining where other programs should be developed you raised the question  of how you our brothers in the south might be of the greatest help to us in the north how much of your energies should be spent in consulting and lecturing in the north at our request when you have so much business to take care of down there i am tempted to answer this question by saying that you should do nothing with respect to the northjust continue to do your thing down there but that would be too blatant an expression of my bias for what you are doing there as opposed to what we have gotten involved with here then too there are some things that you can do for us without adversely affecting what you are doing there first of all you can help all of us by using your influence and ideas with other sincere black educators to help us form some kind of an accrediting association to deal in the area of black or afroamerican studies it seems our only chance of insuring some degree of integrity when so many things are happening i think we could also expect such an association to be able to determine which programs schools in the north are worthy of your attention visits consultation lectures etc and which ones are not the national association of africanamerican educators should facilitate an easy start in this direction all we have to do is relate to it other than this i urge you all to persist in your loyalty to the  black students who study with you in the south even in the face of tempting salary offers and the handful of us who have been farmedout as window dressing for the prestigious institutions of the north you have the ball essence and they are simply waiting to steal it after we have tackled you in answer to question no  it is my opinion that you should refuse any offers from either us or them until some arrangement regarding the above has been formalized  there is presently nothing in white institutions that is worth imitating anything that we could create in them to imitate might just as well be created in the right place to begin with  it would make a great deal of sense in my opinion for us to attempt to provide as many serious northern black students as possible with exposure to the blackoriented brothers in the south and the southern black experience in general indeed many of us have already developed a vision of our circumstances that is tunneled because we lack such exposure as is evidenced by the tone of this letter i found your suggestions for action wholly appropriate and in keeping with our needs of these i do not believe that enough can be said for the usefulness of a scheme such as the consortium that you suggested unless some such arrangement is effected we may reasonably expect not only a continuation of the present rape and deprivation of southern black institutions but it appears that we can expect an escalation of this situation whether or not we are able to create such consortiums may be largely determined by our ability or willingness to communicate the sordidness of these circumstances and to move constructively to prevent them still there is the need to be more specific about what to do and where to do it and it is here that i wish to offer some further suggestions it is a fact that we are still in the midst of a general stampede in the direction of black or afroamerican studies it is equally a fact that this approach black studies everywhereanywhere is not conducive to the construction of one really good program anywhere therefore we ought to decide where such programs are really neededcan function and devote our time and energies to these alone the  to  million people that we are concerned about are spread across the country west coast east coast midwest and south the task as it appears to me is to construct some programs that will bring as many of us together as is possible to insure that at least four major programs directly related to the black universityare developed in the country broken down here is how i see this on the west coast and pacific northwest california has the largest concentration of black people this concentration is primarily in the northern and southern parts of the state within the northern and southern parts of the state the black population is dispersed in such a manner that to speak of an educational endeavor expected to affect all of them is to speak of at least two sites in both the northern and southern parts of the state say two in or around the los angeles area and two in or around the san francisco bay area on the east coast the black population is concentrated primarily in new york new jersey and pennsylvania here any action expected to affect a majority would probably require three sites possibly four because of the unusually large number of people in this case i cannot guess about where these sites should be because of my limited knowledge of the areas involved i merely wish to convey that an expanded effort will be required in this area in the midwest the folks are primarily in illinois michigan and ohio again the action should probably be triple then of course there is the south where more than half the souls still are as i have already related many of us feel that this is where we should attempt to do our main thing the mother campus of the black university other than the fact that you have already made a notable start there which probably exceeds anything that we have done in integrity i am inclined to believe that there are many more reasons for this decision that are rather obvious i am further convinced that the south is the place when i look and see not only beautiful potential sites for the mother campus but so many beautiful sites for extension programs of all kinds  now what i am saying here should not be construed to mean that we ought to undertake the establishment of nine universities at least not at this time i am instead suggesting that we attempt to create one university and eight catchvrelated totype actions to support it i mean this is my vision of your consortium ideally constructed we name the sitesthe schools choose the people see that the money is pooled recruit the students and faculty and send the kindling down south as we have seen so many promises swell and fail to gain the crucial burst needed for an overflow of success i fear for the ebbing but yet unborn and contained black university pray to all damballa first that we do not fail this time but there must be something that we can do to lessen the possibility of a failure one thing that we have not done in the past is to be specific enoughboth in terms of our interest and our commitment we can think talk and write about everything but we can only act effectively on one thing at a time nearly everyone among us can recall attending meetings conferences etc where we dealt with so many things we were told so many things to do that we seldom accomplished any one of them in our haste to do them all possibly we can avoid this if we remember that our goal is the black university we canmust and will be concerned about everything else but some of us must work towards the establishment of the black university if it is ever to become a reality it may at this point sound foolishly ambitious but the best possible assurance we could provide to see that our dream is not stillborn would be to find a way to pay a small but devoted group of people to work fulltime towards the development of the black university and the aforementioned supporting actions otherwise the risk of failure that we run is incalculable your commentary regarding finances hardly calls for any response save a resounding amen and an affirmative nod you are certainly correct in assuming that the time has come for the northern white institutions to do something more than attempt to destroy the black institutions of the south there are so many ways in which they might begin or be forced to contribute positively that i could hardly begin to list them but i should not pass one of these many black graduate students across the country are being paid to act as teaching assistants in their respective schools but who really needs these teaching assistants many of whom are already qualified instructors are there not enough white graduate students in white northern schools to teach introductory courses and to grade papers surely these guilty committed and concerned white institutions would not mind paying the salaries or some part of them of those black students who wished to do their assisting in the black institutions of the south where they are really needed this is something that militant black students and black teacher recruiting programs should look into the autonomous black foundation of which you speak is long overdue why did we not think of this at a time less pressing for its need most of us know about foundations who establishes them supports them operates them and keeps them going black professionals the middle class bourgies artists and others whose faith taste style and nerves hope that they will not be offended by the jargonor intimidated will not allow them to do anything else must be urged to get going i such is a common excuse for doing nothing 
words other black faculty persons have evidently taken a similar point of view how does that way of producing blackness fit into our rhetoric concerning the needs of the community is it really more imitation that we must have now  considering our sadly limited resources can there be more than a few really excellent programs or institutes in afroamerican studies in this country is it possible that the recent announcements of the creation of at least two dozen such programs will lead to even more dispersion of our black talents rather than to the consolidation we so badly need for this period if only a few such black research and teaching centers can live with significant integrity where should they be developed indeed where will they find nurture during a period of prolonged struggle  to move to an even more directly personal level have any of you considered the possibility that it might make more sense to bring  black students to a blackoriented professor in the south than to take him away from his campus in other words have you questioned your own locations seriously in the light of our need to gather ourselves together  have you given serious thought to your own sense of vocation the building of the black university whether it be realized in one or a dozen locations demands totally committed teachers organizers and administrators who have moved beyond jiving to real work what about you perhaps you dont know that black students in the south on the negro campuses are also calling for more black faculty where will we find them concrete suggestions for action  on the recruiting of black faculty for northern schools if this must be done during these days when the supply of wellequipped blackconscious brothers and sisters is so limited then why not work for the establishment of special visiting professorships rather than outright raiding of black schools under such an arrangement faculty from the south could be invited for one year we could teach one course in our specialty each quarter or semester and be available for many kinds of counselling there would also be freedom from the many ordinary academic pressures of our southern campuses and time as well as secretarial and research assistance could be made  available for more research writing and publication at the same time we would not be wrenched away from the southern schools on an indefinite basis in a sense this would be no more than a token presence of course but it represents a temporary measure which might have some mutual benefit while we discuss the questions above and while we seek to increase the supply of brothers and sisters who can do the job  on the recruiting of black students there are obviously hundreds of thousands of black students outside of the colleges who ought to be involved in some meaningful experience of higher education since your institutions have obtained funds from many sources for some of this task why not make at least part of that money available in more creative ways for instance a consortium of one or more white and one or more black schools could be created solely for the purposes of recruiting black students through some pooling of funds mostly yours in the north black students could then be approached with this offer here are the funds you need to go through college you can use the money to attend for example morehouse dillard cornell or the university of illinois if you choose a black school we ask only that you agree to spend one of your years on the predominantly white campus strengthening your brothers there if you choose an overwhelmingly white school you will have the privilege of going home for a year in this way black students could take the money from white schools and use it in any way they choose besides under the new conditions now prevailing in both black and white institutions the exchange could not help but be fruitful  the issue of finances is a crucial one especially as it relates to the future of black colleges some institutions would obviously serve the cause best if they merged with other schools to create new strengths and expanded facilities but even those which remained need to be enlarged and endowed in ways that black schools have not known up to now why for instance should it not be possible for prestigious northern schools to use their prestige to help obtain special research grants for certain work which can be done well only by black scholars or why should your more affluent northern institutions not be pressed to make other significant financial contributions to the life of these schools they now so blithely seek to rape the united negro college fund might be one general depository others can be found perhaps an autonomous but well funded black educational foundation ought to be established with its single mission the financing of creative ventures in black education this would not exempt the existing white foundations of course it would simply mean that this black institution would be able to give all of its time and energies to the task so far it has been relatively easy to get white institutions to perform certain kinds of moneyproducing acts on behalf of black education on their own campuses perhaps the time has come to press them to use part of their budgets even sections of their endowment funds to help establish such a foundation or otherwise to make longterm substantial investments in the black academic institutions these would of course constitute no more than preliminary steps towards restitution certainly it is no accident that such proposals fit the pattern of what the former colonizing nations must do to be of significant assistance to the areas they crippled  finally it is apparent in the current rush to blackness on the part of white institutions that there simply is not the beginning of an adequate supply of persons trained in afroamerican studies it is imperative for usand for youthat we move urgently to fill that gap in ways other than the stripping of the southern black campuses the various institutes and phd programs in this field which have appeared over the past year are obviously meant to meet the need as well as to satisfy you and to keep you off certain backs but i would argue that most of them cannot and will not do the job indeed some of them may die as soon as you stop blowing on the other hand it is only logical that black institutions in the black community if properly funded organized and led could probably do the best job of creating new scholars in the field of afroamerican studies this seems especially likely in those places where traditions libraries and faculties seem at least adequate even now and where students are pressing sometimes reluctant others towards blackness in atlanta that has been our basic assumption and a group of us have moved towards the creation of such an institute for afroamerican studies we think that black students throughout the nation should know this and should ponder its possible meaning for your own presents and futures as some of you know there are in the atlanta university center six negro institutions in various stages of their search for blackness on the faculties are more than  persons whose training experience and teaching in the field of afroamerican life and culture are at least significant the slaughter collection of negro literature the georgia state archives and the newly begun martin_luther_king memorial library a documentation center for the movement combine to present unusual library and archival resources on the black experience apart from such tangibles we are also beneficiaries of the spirit of the great pioneering work in black studies done in atlanta by such persons as w e b du bois e franklin frazier rayford logan e s braithwaithe ira dea reid and many others it is against this background of past and present resources that we are now in the process of creating an institute for afroamerican studies under the umbrella of the martin_luther_king jr memorial center research teaching celebration and action are to be the central driving forcesall focused on the life and times of the peoples of african descent i mention the institute here because it will need many things which you can help provide it will need millions of dollars the best staff from every part of the african diaspora students who are ready to take care of business and it must have continuous exposure throughout the black community the schools you attend could help raise funds for this institute for they will need our products both human and informational if they are to be transformed into viable situations some of you will ultimately comprise the staff and student body the plans you now have for the afroamerican studies in white settings must be reexamined and challenged by atlanta in short i am proposing that you help this institute become the major black educational creation of this generation you have a kind of leverage in the white world which must not be dissipated in minor ambiguous victories more importantly you have a power which must not be turned against meaningful black institutions the challenge to help create such an institute to break down the many brittle assumptions of conventional american education to move consistently towards our intellectual roots in the struggle for liberationthis is i think a challenge more appropriate to your power as you ponder these matters i trust you will remember that my questions and proposals are meant to be only some of the ingredients in a dialogue which must take place among us the letter is written in the spirit of black ecumenical concern as we move towards a new humanity the words are my own but the concerns are shared by many other persons on the southern campuses we look forward to appropriate response from the north east and west  
black studies as an academic discipline
by preston wilcox
laremont college c f is to be commended  for convening a cone ference on the subject jssue biac k studies as an academic discipline considering the amount of ivory tower energy that has been invested in proving that the only way black students can achieve is to deny any association with their own cultural heritageand the historical inequities designed to destroy itthis is an important step in the right direction claremont colleges efforts to explore this subject in a systematic fashion may be the first step in the direction of its own rehumanization this observation is made because of the ease with which a large number of whitecontrolled institutions of higher education have dodged the intellectual issue they did so by setting up separate and sometimes autonomouslycontrolled black studies programs without taking one step to decolonize their core curricula the organized resistance to courses such as swahili is a case in point not only were efforts undertaken to invalidate swahili as worthy of location within an academic curriculum several mainstream scholars challenged its relevance to descendants of africa all this took place in the shadow of freshman orientation courses which function mainly to acclimate students to the campus but not necessarily to education for meaningful survival and liberation but one can not permit himself to be carried away by the opportunity to explore this question recall that the concept of academic discipline as perceived by most scholars does not include authentic blacks as full participantsnor does it seek to define them as equals it is a creation of a white supremacist society one in which scientific colonialism was utilized both to conceal the reality of racism and also to label black scholars as unqualified the criteria by which most white americans have earned their phds has had little to do with white merit it has had more to do with white oppression white scholars have not had to compete with black scholars as students or as codefiners of the social fabric of this society i call this phenomena the satchel paige syndrome satchel paiges very excellence as a baseball pitcher increased the possibility that he would not be admitted to the major leagues until he was thought to be over the hill this reminds me of a white friend who was the florida state champion in the  yard dash while in high school he graduated the same year as did bob hayes now of the dallas cowboys bob hayes may not have the trophy in his homesince he was prevented by the white segregationists from competingbut everybody in florida knows who the real champion is a corollary to this analysis is the content and style of the academic format shaped deliberately to include and deepen white control over blacks and to exclude authentic inputs such an academic concept can only be fully understood as being politically and intellectually oppressive colonialistic in action and white supremacist in content the phding process which is similar to that of the making of a priest requires that candidates surrender the right to think for themselves to the doctoral committeesin the same way that a candidate for ordination takes a vow with the pope the political nature of academic disciplines as applied by mainstream scholars raises a further question the socalled apolitical stance of mainstream scholars is in fact a fabrication such a policy merely conceals the politics behind it under a fagade of scientific objectivity to apply the same criteria to black studies as has been applied to white studies is to ensure that black studies will become white studies  a new social contract that claremont college has raised this issue to the level of intellectual inquiry is a commendable effort only to the degree that such an inquiry respects certain basic understanding about the issue being engaged a whitecontrolled institutions of higher education have survived as full members of a societv in which it is illegal to be human herewith defined as being a positive relationship with one of minority group status a poor person or one who is different from oneself b whitecontrolled institutions of higher education have survived not as instruments to reshape society but as tools of the same society that has assigned illegal status to the groups mentioned above c the thrust of black studies programs must remain at the level of a movement they must resist institutionalization and any partnership which is not pluralistic humanistic in function and integrally related to the liberation and restoration of all black people more than anything else black studies programs must be viewed as instruments for the development of the black communitythey should not become token instruments for the legitimation of white institutions of higher education d the scientific colonialismdefined by galtung as that process whereby the center of gravity for the acquisition of knowledge about a nation is located outside itself  w must be replaced by scientific humanism wherein the center of gravity for the acquisition of knowledge about black people is collected controlled managed and distributed by black people before this issue can be systematically approached then a social contract involving the following points must be made a the powersthatbe in the white controlled institutions must get involved in overcoming the racist practices that benefit them in economic and educational terms to the disadvantage of black and other minority group students recall that most such institutions are organized as though we reside in an egalitarian society when in fact the democracy they espouse is a hypocrisy blacks are not treated as equals by whites because of the essential meaning of being nonblackin style habits behavior etc part of the meaning of being white is to define blacks as being inferior an active manifestation of white superiority stokely carmichael raised this question for whites when he wrote it must be offered that white people who desire change in this country should go where that problem racism is most manifest the problem is not in the black community the whites should go into white communities where whites have created power for the express purpose of denying blacks human dignity and selfdetermination  b the black studies institute must be involved systematically in redefining understanding and codifying the black experience to ensure that a body of relevant and transmittable knowledge is developed this effort must involve the development of new definitions of old perspectives an increasing reliance on black selfaccreditation and the planful use of instinctual understandings such as selfconcept functional anger and the like the old perspectives have assigned inhuman status to blacks the efforts of blacks to integrate with whites has led to a new level of white paternalism whites keep the real power blacks become acting colonial relations agents traditional ivory tower intellectualism is in fact a higher form of antiintellectualism it isolates theory from practice separates apprehension from comprehension thought from action and conceals the politics of social control behind a facade of a political intellectuality this new social contact should be characterized by a pluralistic approach to curriculum development and management and institutional governance the white segment of the institution should be involved in getting its house in order while the black segment does likewise the interface between these two should involve a continuing identification of shared curriculum and decisionmaking and opportunities to increase the possibility that a legitimate integrated institution will result a whitecontrolled institution can never achieve the status of authentic integration neither can a predominantly white institution achieve that status such a status can only be achieved within a racist society if the student body is predominantly minority group and the control at the least is multiracial with clear divisions of labor and responsibility  significantly the meaning of education and the educational goals of the university system should undergo a process of reordering student orientation should engage students in beginning to learn about that particular contribution they want to make toward the betterment of the society of which they are a part the traditional plan orients students into participantconsumer roles into the system rather than as participantproducers a second order of business is that of enabling students to learn how to think for themselves rather than the way we would like to have them think part and parcel of the process is enabling students to begin to view education as a tool for their own liberation as a political instrument if you will rather than as a means to make it this new social contract will foster a different set of social relationships a an identification of a shared responsibilityblack and whitein defining the role of an educational institution within a democratic society and how to achieve such a society b an identification of those decisions which are the exclusive purview of the participating partners as they relate to the various componentsadmissions course requirements faculty status curriculum content etcof the university system this new social contract will foster a different set of social relationships between the participating partners rather than competing with each other to define and redefine the white and black positions each will be assigned to defining a human position in his own terms rather than competing with and confronting each other they will find themselves competing with and confronting themselves the first rung on the road to meaningful selfeducation whites will not have to feel like patrons blacks will not have to feel patronized importantly white administrators will not have to learn how to make relevant decisions about blacks instead they will be called upon to give up their need to do so blacks in turn will not have to expend decisionmaking energies teaching whites to understand the black experience these energies can be better utilized deepening its implementation the rationale for proposing such a social contract is based on the following a among the many consequences of our racist society is not only its impact on the blackwhite encounter but its impact on how people feel about themselves others and their frames of reference white unity is a factor then of the common negative attitudes toward blacks whites perceive each other positively largely because of their common disdain for black people and not because of a positive identity with whom they are to make a humane decision affecting black people is antiwhite in the view of most white people black unity thus far has derived from common oppression and exploitation and less from a development of positive group selfinterests this pattern is gradually being reversed by the black_power ethos black people are relying less and less on a humane response from whites they are utilizing their skills and resources to increase the degree to which they control and define their own lives b as most institutions of higher education have operated they have systematically overlooked the legitimate concerns of black people the communities in which they reside and their legitimate aspirations black students until very recently were significantly absent on most such campuses as a consequence large numbers of students have been educated not to be able to perceive and deal with black people and their experiences on a humane level not only is there a missing body of knowledge but effective ways and means of collecting interpreting and understanding it have yet to be developed 
toward a definition before black studies can earn the status of an academic discipline whitecontrolled institutions must recognize their inability to so accredit them black studies should not become a replica of white studiesnor should they be perceived as being a reaction to the failure of institutions of higher education to include such programs as an integral part of their curricula the thrust for black studies programs developed not on white college campuses but at selma birmingham and at the march on washington it was on the civil_rights battlefield that blacks learned that an appeal to the white conscience had to be replaced by an appeal to black consciousness that the alternative to white oppression was not integration but the mounting of black_power that white people could not save black people from exploitation and degradation as long as white people benefited from them in order to fully understand this movement one must understand jim formans black manifesto as an attempt to define a new socioeconomic contract between white donors and black recipients it is based not on white philanthropy but black restitution grants made to black students should be perceived not as white charity but as the return of legal entitlements to a group on whose backs this nation was built the concept of reparations must be fully understood as a prerequisite then to understanding the subject at hand black studies can not be perceived as an academic discipline as long as the program resources are whitecontrolled andor managed james boggs has discussed the subject of black capitalism as being mythical and irrational he has raised the question in order to warn blacks against displacing whites as economic exploiters of blacks as a means to urge them to develop a new set of socioeconomic relationshipsnonexploitative in nature and collectively incomeproducing in operation his point seems to be that racism and capitalism are so deeply intertwined that they shape and are shaped by each other this behavior on college campuses is seen in the pattern of utilizing federal grants and special programs as a way to increase the inventory of black students whites continue to get paid to serve as gatekeepers for the onebyone admission of black students on criteria established by whites and not blacks as forman has put it    we have always resisted attempts to make us slaves and now we must resist attempts to make us capitalists  the reparations concept based on the articulation of a humanizing socioeconomic contract between white donors and black recipients and the recognition of a need to develop a humanizing socioeconomic network of relationships within the black community are important to understand this externalinternal relationship construct became the basis on which the national association for africanamerican education began to develop an educational paradigm addressed to an understanding of the black condition it began by defining the black educator as follows students parents community leaders clergymen businessmen activists moderates college professors teachers educational administrators and all who are actively involved in the educational liberation and survival of the black people  it attempts to avoid exclusion on the basis of social class ideology age occupational role andor organizational affiliates the paradigm under discussion focused attention on education for life rather than education for scholarship it was based on the interrelationships between the phases of psychosocial development and the social systems under which the change and growth take place the family the neighborhood the city the nation and the world threaded throughout the paradigm was a concern with the physical and mental health of black people and a positive association with their own cultural heritage this paradigm was to provide the foundation on which education for black humanism was to be based the concept of academic discipline was to include these considerations as a sine qua non importantly it was to provide the framework on which new and substantive bodies of knowledge about the black condition were to be linked it would require that such issues as selfconcept reparations cooperative and collective economic enterprises psychological and political liberation a reordering of given values be systematically addressed and understood i many black scholars have begun to address these questions from a variety of perspectives and as they would operate within a functional black university james boggs has sketched out some guiding principles as they affect relationships between student and community research and community theory and practice intellectual studies and manual work studies and social change students and teachers and students to one another and subject matter productive or technical skills black culture social change and interdisciplinary relationships  as he views it the educational process must restructure blackwhite relationship and i internal relationships among blacks as it operates scientific colonialism vs scientific humanism any serious and studied review of the writings and productions of mainstream scholars will reveal three major shortcomings one is the tendency to define black people as being in need of white accreditation before earning the right to be perceived as humans the white supremacist policies which undergird such efforts are concealed behind a facade of objectivity this tendency is observed as follows a the practice of comparing black and white statistics without taking into account differences in opportunities emanating from the reality of white institutional racism b the concealment of the exploitative nature of the relationships between social class groupings blacks and whites and less chance communities and the larger systems in which they are embedded c the labeling of the same behavior by whites and blacks by the use of different sociological terms d the tendency to treat blacks as equals only as it relates to negative criteria such as crime statistics drug addictions etc e the tendency to view the problems of blacks from the perspective of negative individual and group characteristics rather than perceiving such problems as being one consequence of their treatment within a white racist society thinking black scholars are aware of the fact that a william whytes organization man should have been labeled the white uncle toms b the only effective analogy between white and black families has little to do with the role of the woman it has more to do with the presumption of white male superiority and actual black male genocide the fact of the matter is that white suburban families are matriarchial even though the man is in the home c the residential patterns of this nation have less to do with land use choice and income than they do with discrimination minority group exploitation and the overprotection of the vagina of white women by white men d the ghetto cannot be understood as an orientation ground for becoming middle class its structure approximates that of a plantation or a prison system controlled externally and internally by outsiders the problems of the ghetto are whitegenerated whiteproliferated and whitecontrolled flowing from this recognition should be an understanding of how the judgments of many scholars and those of their students have been systematically screwed up many of us cannot distinguish missionaries from mercenaries clergymen from conmen nuns in habits from prostitutes in habits teachers from wardens students from inmates policeman from the gestapo criminals from philanthropists and pimps from able parents this phenomena has increased the possibility that the perceptions of the student submit him to easy external controland that he too will be educated to use knowledge to manipulate rather than to liberate this phenomena is further characterized by the rhetoric of oppression in the use of words to present the illusion of a democracy that does not exist really means really means real lx means mr really means really means really means  school decentralization really means a third shortcoming is the failure to draw upon the natural shrewdness of the black community to define its own problems and aspirations the current proliferation of autobiographies biographies novels position statements and social studies produced by blacks themselves are characterized by a a lesser degree of intellectual fragmentation such writings are marked by a discussion of the impact of white institutional racism an awareness of the political realities and the interrelationship between separate concepts icebergs slims biography of otis tilson a black homosexual describes male castration and homosexuality in one person as it has been seldom understood otis writes    my reason for telling my story is not money im telling it for my poor dead papa and myself and the thousands of black men like him in ghetto torture chambers who have and will be niggerized and deballed by the white structure and the thrill kill police  he further links the degradation of the black man as it occurs both down south and up south a papa had some importance and a sense of worth down south even though living conditions were subhuman up north poor papa would become a zero unimportant to everyone even to his wife and children  b the use of the subject of study both as the sources and interpreters of the data not only has this provided a new source of data but a body of missing knowledge for instance very few libraries have a category white institutional racism most libraries still view the race problem as the negro problem as discrimination as racial and cultural minorities heading home  it may appear that i have refused to confront and examine the subject issue black studies as an academic discipline it only appears that way the crucial issue requires a redefinition of the concept such that blacks are perceived as and treated as humans with a common heritage african descendency and victimization by white institutional racism to discuss such an issue in the setting of whitecontrolled institutions requires several prior actions it is these prior actions to which this statement has been addressed a the articulation and implementation of a new coequal and parallel social contractextending from admissions to governance b the replacement of the philanthropic socioeconomic contract between blacks and whites with one which is based on the legal entitlements of black restitution c the development of the technology leading toward the establishment of a cooperative and collective socioeconomic network of relationships among blacks d the replacement of scientific colonialism with scientific humanism e the development of a systematic and transmittable body of knowli edge about the black condition black studies is an academic discipline fully accredited within the black world it is that body of experience and knowledge that blacks i have had to summon in order to learn how to survive within a society j that is stacked against them the white campus then is a means to an end not an end in itself it is a place to learn the mans language as a second language to understand his institutions so as to be able to subvert and humanize them to hone ones mind to apply ones intelligence to an understanding and alleviation of the black condition to internalize a need to participate in ones own liberation to contribute to a sense of black nationhood in the last analysis this nation can not be a human nation until black people and other minorities say and behave as though it is in the same sense any white institution which seeks to evaluate black studies program on white oppressive criteria can never be a great institution until black students so accredit it 
black studies at this juncture
by j frank yates
year ago the entire country was being £ swept with demands by black students for more relevant educational institutions what were those demands about what has been done what remains to be done only after hundreds of black studies programs have actually begun has the real message of that movement made impact many have thoughtindeed hoped that the black studies movement of  was simply a fad to be sure there was definitely spontaneous contagion in the movement this is a necessary part of any mass action there are however underlying issues that will either sustain the work of the serious black studies programs or lead to new crises if they fail simply stated a school or educational system justifies its exist i ence in a community by fulfilling two functions first it must impart the skills needed by the people to maintain their physical existence r second it must cultivate and transmit traditions and ideological concepts that meet the peoples psychological and moral needs to  perform satisfactorily a school must be able to deal with both issues simultaneously the rebellious black student of  was say n ing essentially that his schools black and whitewere adequately fulfilling neither function but es l pecially the second j we should examine that second function closer what really is ideology the concept has various i facets milton pokeach the open and closed mind and t w adorno the authoritarian personality isolate several of the core ideas they stress that ideology  represents an institutionalized set of beliefs that one just picks up an organization of opinions attitudes and valuesa way of thinking about man and society other students of social movements emphasize another essential feature applied to this discourse they imply a fundamental relationship between the two functions of a school in the words of daniel bell the end of ideology pp  ideology is the conversion of ideas into social levers    in essence the ideology running through a society does much to determine how the people perceive themselves the perspective from which they evaluate all issues even the very alternatives they imagine clearly the course of human events is determined largely by just such factors i submit that the creation or development of a new ideology permeating the lives of black people is one of the most important if not the most important issue facing us today if such a black ideology already existed we would not see hundreds of agencies and organizations operating in our communities with all of them getting essentially nowhere if such an ideology already existed it would no longer be necessary to keep in stock a thousand and one powerful black orators to stir the black masses to action if such an ideology already existed it would not be necessary to create crises to solicit black support that soon peters out we are not the first group of people to experience the need for a new ideology the very group we recognize as our nemesis the white americans have experienced such a crisis in fact the resolution of their crisis has had much to do with the creation of ours winthrop jordan white over black chronicles the identity or ideological conflicts felt by the white american people during and shortly after the revolutionary war the american ideology that evolved from that period had at its core the notion that a true american was essentially a slightly modified anglosaxon the definition of american consciously excluded j nonenglish european influences the incorporation of blackness into the recognized concept of americanism was so absurd that the idea was never seriously considered reality and the official ideology of americanism could not and cannot be reconciled consequently white america has had to maintain two ideologies the official ideology incorporates all the ideals expressed in the countrys official documents the real ideology provides the foundations for racial oppression since a societys ideology serves as a basis for the attitudinal and belief systems of its people the duality and inconsistency of the american ideology implied a corresponding duality and inconsistency in the model american white personality all the various notions of cognitive balance can be applied toward understanding the probable result that result has most often been denial and compartmentalization we cannot deny that to some extent black people too have internalized aspects of the dual american ideology this is the crux of the issue dealt with here the situation is more complex than that involving whites in that neither portion of the american ideology has been adequate for black americans there have always been the rudiments of a functional black ideology in our communities however it has had to contend with tremendous odds for its mere survival let alone growth we control few instruments of communication and education the result has been three distinct and often inconsistent constellations of ideas attitudes and beliefs permeating black society small wonder that so many black individuals experience hangups and more important there is little to maintain our programs for change many including harold cruse crisis of the negro intellectual and rebellion or revolution and other cultural nationalists have recognized the ideological need of which  speak their proposal that cultural nationalism is necessary to fill the void does not seem adequate the american political economic and cultural apparatus seems far too complex for cultural nationalism to be sufficient the final resolution may however involve some aspects of cultural nationalism it is incumbent upon those seriously committed to black studies to seek out the ideological positions that would be most beneficial to black people black thinkers especially black psychologists must aid in the development and transmission of the new black ideology this is the challenge of black studies at this juncture unless it is met we have simply added another agency to the pile and the next explosion will be just a bit stronger perhaps then we will deal with the gut issues of a black ideology and ultimately a truly american ideology

keeping on top of the scene for some people gameplaying is a fulltime preoccupation not only does it keep them on top of things it also has solid benefits playing the black intellectual game for example actually encourages them to read the books everyone is talking about making it possible for them to rap with authority about important current topics and that is definitely a plus that game neatly ties in with the black militant game which is all the rage just ow and which has merits of its own in attentiongrabbing a brother can come on like gangbusters with a boss fro and a handtailored dashiki set off with a soft silk turtleneck and a big brass pendant and that game dovetails beautifully with the swinger game allowing a brother to make the scene in imported bellbottoms direct from carnaby street and expensive italianmade boots shined to a gloss name the game and some brothers are right on top of it but the black revoultion is not a game nor are the legitimate aims of the black revolution served by assorted poseurs and hustlers playing revolution across the country a small but determined body of black men and women are dedicating their energies  and in many cases their livesto the task of liberating black people from the psychological shackles which have rendered them powerless for centuries in whatever they doin education in art in music in literature or in community servicethey are concerned with shattering the old ikons of whiteness and with validating in the minds of black people regenerative black images and black idols and a black perspective on the world these serious men and women know that intensive and unwavering vigilance in the cause of black consciousness is necessary to break for all time the debilitating cycle of hope and despair which has characterized black life on this continent for  years their task is monumental and it is not made easier by the diversionary tactics of the gameplayers it is imperative that the black community know the difference between the committed and the comedians
