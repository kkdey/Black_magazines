black historys earlv advocates 
by benjamin quarles
black history is now coming of age  its midwife was carter g  woodson  a man of impressive scholarship he opened the rich vein of the black past from  until his death in  his pathbreaking work as author editor and publisher provided the base from which others could operate but woodson himself was indebted spiritually at least to a host of th century black leaders who had sounded a call for a revitalized study of afroamerican history all the present rests on the past said frederick douglass in  in addressing a washington d c audience honoring him on his st birthday in  james mccune smith like douglass a reformer called for an effort to place on the record a true account which the blacks now bear to this republica concise statement of the facts embodied in their resistance an elevation against odds sufficient to crush any ordinary variety of human species unless this were done wrote smith the grief among future scholars would match that of the ancient savants at the loss of the alexandrian library like other black leaders of the th century douglass and smith did not believe in reading history for historys sake to them the uses of history were of a more practical nature history as they saw it was an instrument it enabled one to understand the present thus suggesting a course of action furthermore to these black leaders of an earlier day a knowledge of history was useful in terms of their hopes for the future to go somewhere they felt was easier if one knew that he had come from somewhere they did not subscribe to the lachrymose concept of afroamerican history as nothing but an unending tale of persecution and suffering moreover they felt that a study of history would help in promoting racial selfrespect history rightfully told would refute the charges that blacks were inferior as never before or since the charge that black americans had no history and that africa had an unstoried past dominated the thinking of white americans of precivil war days aware of negro slavery in the south they tended to think that negro and slavery were synonymous reflecting the cultural arrogance of the western world during the th century they thought of themselves as civilized and of africans as barbarians black leaders rejected these views their protests grew louder with the coming of black weeklies the first of these appearing in  followed three years later by the inauguration of the colored convention movement the latter was a coming together generally once a year of negro leaders with racial advancement their aim it was natural that the new colored organizations would come to the defense of africa extolling their old world forebears we claim to be the offspring of a parentage that once for their excellence of attainment in the arts literature and science stood before the world unrivalled so ran one of the resolutions adopted by the colored convention of  this refrain of ancient african glory was echoed by any number of black speakers and writers africa was the garden and nursery where learning budded and education sprang orated david nickens at a fourth of july celebration held at the chillicothe ohio african methodist episcopal church in  william g allen a journalist and later a college teacher prepared a public lecture entitled the origin and history of the africans according to a reporter who attended his lecture at the old south church in danvers massachusetts in april  mr allen commenced with the somewhat startling assertion that africans originated the arts and sciences and gave the first impulse to civilization the reporter was impressed by allens irrefragable proof comparing him favorably with george bancroft greatest of the american historians seeking information on early africa lectureminded amos g beman a clergymanreformer addressed a letter on april   to the great dictionary compiler noah webster then but a month from his death the learned lexicographer fired back a preemptory report of the woollyheaded africans who constitute the principal part of the inhabitants of africa there is no history and there can be none that race has remained in barbarism since the first ages of the world undeterred by websters reputation beman drafted a lecture on the origin and history of the african race as a home agent for the american missionary association beman delivered this lecture to black audiences throughout new england  other leaders who joined in the movement to reclaim africa included samuel ringgold ward martin r delany and jeremiah b sanderson where is the history of the negro lamented clergyman ward in  i think we need not despair he added for we have our glorious fatherland africafar superior to the proud and abuseful anglosaxon which is saying very little in  the versatile delany journalist student of medicine and subsequently niger river explorer army major and reconstruction politicianwrote that africa was destined to rise in the majesty of ancient grandeur in a later book delany cited herodotus and diodorus siculus as proof that the world was indebted to early egypt and ethiopia for the propagation of religion philosophy arts science and literature which now illuminate the world in similar vein jeremiah b sanderson assured a stockton california audience that to african blood and mind we owed the sphinx the pyramids the greek alphabet and the popular mythology of greece and rome a fluent speaker with a love of learning sanderson was the foremost black educator in california in the late s organizing schools and teaching black historys early advocates did not ignore the home scene the role of american blacks who had stood out from the crowd few negro newspapers did not at some time or another recount the bittersweet story of phillis wheatley the slave girl who became a poet in writing about her some newspapers reproduced the letter which george washington had addressed to miss phillis from cambridge massachusetts on february   others who might be signalled out by the black journals included benjamin banneker the mathematician and surveyor lemuel haynes learned pastor to white churches richard allen key figure in the founding of the african methodist episcopal church denmark vesey slave insurrection plotter and nat turner the most familiar of all to readers black or white historyminded blacks constantly called attention to the contribution that africanamericans had made in americas wars a colored convention held in detroit in  took note of the war of  in which black men had shown themselves to be valiant soldiers at the battle of new orleans a convention of new york state blacks meeting at albany on august   declared that the splendid naval of achievements on lakes erie and champlain in that war were owing mostly to the skill and prowess of colored men black valor in the revolutionary war was a theme dear to afroamerican readers of history hence they hailed william c nells colored patriots of the american revolution published in  nell whose father had been a steward on the general gadsden during the war of  broke new ground in his book although he did not confine himself to the revolutionary war the book impressed the scholartheologian theodore parker who recommended it highly to historian george bancroft when you publish your next volume wrote parker to bancroft i hope you will send nell a copy negroes get few honors nells book had opened with the story of crispus attucks in the boston massacre the first to dieon the eventful march   when the british soldiers fired into the crowd attucks had won a tragic fame that blacks would keep green in memory military companies in cincinnati and new york took the name attucks guards in  a group of boston blacks led by nell petitioned the state legislature to appropriate money for a monument to attucks but with no success in  boston blacks in protesting the dred scott decision held a crispus attucks day at faneuil hall with the banners and flags decorating the walls the singing groups with stirring airs and the impassioned speakers the affair was memorable crispus attucks day would be observed every subsequent year in boston until after the ratification of the fifteenth amendment in  among the admirers of attucks was young john a copeland jr one of the black john brown raiders captured at harpers ferry in october  as he sat in the charlestown jail awaiting the hangmans noose copeland thought that he saw a relationship between harpers ferry and the boston massacre at the beginning of the revolution wrote copeland in a letter to a friend the first blood spilt for freedom was that of crispus attucks and in the commencement of the struggle for the freedom of the negro slave the first blood spilt was that of a negro one who had come to try andfree his wife from the cruel hand of her master dangerfield newby black achievers and the black past were the themes of two nineteenth century blacks who were themselves historymakers in  former slave william wells brown abolitionist and literary light published the black man his antecedents his genius and his achievements opening with an essay asserting that blacks had been leaders of civilization at certain periods of history brown presented a series of  brief biographies these included ira aldridge the greatest shakespearean actor of his day and seven haitians including toussaint louverture a far more ambitious book a twovolume work was produced by george washington williams a manysided man at one time or another a civil war sergeant major ordained minister lawyer journalist politician and diplomat in  williams produced his history of the negro race in america  a creditable effort encouraged by its success williams in  brought out a lengthy book on the black troops in the civil war distressed at the dearth of information on black history williams wrote a letter to the new york globe published in its issue on june   proposing that an american negro history society be organized societies  with a combination literaryhistorical outlook had existed among blacks since  but they were local rather than regional or national the williams proposal was hailed by black emigrationist henry m turner who called it a grand conception a south carolina weekly new era voiced a hearty concurrence it is time that the negro had a literature but a national black history organization would have to await the th century coming in  with the association for the study of negro life and history the new century would also bring other changes in africanamerican history notably in the calibre of writers and the widening of the clientele nineteenth century blacks who wrote history were men who as we have seen busied themselves in a variety of fields and occupations they did not profess to be professionally trained historians brown never intended as he said himself that his book should be considered as a history of our people williams had no formal training in the writing of history although from his extensive readt ing and his many contacts he had writes john hope franklin doubtless caught some of the new scientific spirit with the exception of williams and to a lesser extent of nell these early writers of black history did not bother to furnish their sources this tendency to dispense with formal documentation sometimes led them to claim more than the evidence would support moreover these writers lived during a spreadeagle era one given to bombastic and exaggerated language and this general proclivity for overstatement sometimes crept into their style writers of black history in the th century were as to be expected better trained in the discipline they wedded excavation to exhortation many of them devoted their entire careers to history teaching or writing moreover they tended to view black history as something not to be known by blacks alone but by whites also they believed that to the extent to which white people knew little or nothing about the historic role of their black countrymen to that extent they were living in a makebelieve world of the past indeed the blackrelated areas and aspects of american history loom so large and significant that today it is not surprising that many able white scholars have increasingly turned their attention to that rich lode nineteenth century exponents of black history were moved by a need centering largely within the black community the th cen tury practitioners shared this overriding concern but added to it a belief that white people too should be exposed to the liberating effect of black history  perhaps a viewpoint that links the old and the new was expressed in a pamphlet a knowledge of history is conducive to racial solidarity written in  by charles victor roman a doctor of medicine of philosophy and of law the negro never made any history because if anybody made history he was not a negro wrote roman i am not for preaching ethnic antagonism nor endeavoring to give a racial tinge to the facts of history but i do wish to widen the fields of taught history to include negroes who justly belong there 
the fight to reclaim african history
by john henrik clarke
he confrontation and the conflict that i am referring to did  r  v y not start at montreal for over ten years black scholars inj ii r terested in african studies have questioned white academic domination over this area of study black scholars were the  w pioneers in this field and their formal interest and work goes back to the early part of the nineteenth century in an article african studies in the united states that i wrote for the aprilmay issue of africa report i called attention to the serious questions that some afroamericans are asking about the role of white africanists in the new african studies programssome of these questions are why are so many americans now studying about africa why are most of them white americans why are there so few black americans in decision making positions in present day african studies programs in light of the prevailing american attitude toward africa mainly negative before the freedom and independence exploration what is the basis of white americans interest in africa now these questions often asked but never answered motivated the formation of a black caucus at the eleventh annual conference of the african studies association in los angeles california in october  the caucus was called by dr p chike onwuachi director of africancaribbean studies center fisk university nashville tennessee among those participating in the formation of the caucus were michael searles and nicholas onyewu federal city college washington d c lenard jeffries columbia university john h clarke associate editor freedomways nell painter san jose college jean douglass of new york city and shelby faye lewis of southern university baton rouge louisiana after several meetings of the caucus and one with the executive board of african studies association the following statement was issued the african studies association is called upon by the black caucus to immediately direct its energies towards rendering itself more relevant and competent to deal with the challenging times and conditions of black people in africa in the united states and in the whole of the black world in moving towards this objective we charge the association with taking the steps necessary to immediately broaden black participation in all phases of the associations operations we note that at present only one black person is holding a policydeciding position in this association dealing with predominately black countries and societies too few of the program chairmen and participants are drawn from black africanists and in general the association reflects the white caste and is identified with a white posture while trusting the academicians in the association we urge that black people be recruited for participation in the african studies association and that representation be drawn from those engaged in fields closely related to african and afroamerican studies with particular emphasis on black youth inside and outside the universities we see the future prospects of a vital and meaningful association linked directly to the significant strengthening of its ties with black africanists we encourage asa members to seek out african and afroamerican scholars to direct the rapidly developing afroamerican studies centers in the united states finally the asa must address itself in a meaningful and educational way to changing american public opinion based on deep racism and ignorance about the black people when the african studies association takes as its subjects the statement of the black caucus was discussed after it was read to the group by michael searles and submitted to the board of african studies association the result was that an ad hoc committee of the asa was created to inquire into the possibility of implementing the demands of the black caucus it was decided that a meeting would be held in new york during the christmas holidays john h clarke was chosen by the group to organize this meeting michael searles of washington d c was chosen to be acting chairman john h clarke chaired the new york meeting in the absence of michael searles who could not attend the following topics were discussed  the organizations structure its legal status its formal officers its role as a clearing house for information relating to african studies its functions framework and its goals  the financial backing of the association   association membership and recruitment of members  the permanent location of its secretariat  the proposed name of the caucus and the feasibility of publishing dr nicholas onyewu suggested that the caucus consider holding its next meeting at federal city college in washington d c after an official invitation from the president of federal city the meeting was set for june  through june  the washington meeting ibrought the african heritage studies association into being the main findings and recommendations of this meeting are as follows  report of the committee on relations with african studies association and other groups and organizations  relationship with the african studies association  afroamericans and africans should be given a role in the decijsionmaking process of the african studies association that is africans and afroamericans should be placed on all decisionmaking comimittees of the asa  the black caucus of the asa should be consulted about  appointments of afroamericans and africans to the executive comtmittee of the asa  the asa should use its good offices to sponsor black scholars for fellowships increasing shares of money especially in the fields of history and archaeology should go to black scholars and preference  should be given to black scholars until a better balance of whiteblack  scholars in the field is achieved since the asa has power to influence the direction of funds in african studies this influence should be used to direct funds to black scholars and black institutions  special effort should be made to include blacks in the program planning of the asa representation should come directly from the  black caucus  every effort should be made to appoint blacks as fellows of the asa moreover the asa should recruit in black universities for  students who are interested in african studies  the african heritage association should aid these black universities by providing them with program ideas for black studies as well  as consultants materials and lecturers  black universities should encourage their scholars to participate  in the black caucus of the asa  the association should encourage black institutions to convene  conferences for the study and evaluation of materials submitted to them  on black studies  predominately black colleges should be encouraged to assume leadership positions and feeder positions for elementary and secondary schools with respect to the dissemination of materials and the teaching of african studies black scholars at these colleges should be encouraged to lend or give their materials to public schools and to play a more direct role in the structuring of african programs for public schools  it was decided that our immediate objective should be the formation of committees and subcommittees to facilitate as rapid progress as possible in our getting started these committees are to embody our main objectives for the association which include publication education and communication generally under publication it was decided that of vital importance would be the starting of a newsletter in order to get ourselves moving fast to inform others interested in the field and to keep up on the rapidly changing scene in black studies tied to the newsletter would be the drawing up of a register of black scholars in the field it was also recommended that we start a black studies journal sponsored by ahsa as soon as possible to be published by a strong commercial publisher to be decided upon later the educational function was discussed in terms of the need for the following  for black people to have control over our own history its interpretation etc to challenge the arrogance of white scholars to define our history for us  to set up a clearing house of information in black studies aiding in our evaluations of programs literature etc and to open up opportunities for black scholars who present scholarly papers at seminars symposiums etcall facilitating intelligence and communication among black africanists  also the need was expressed for setting up a selected list of black consultants in the field to guard against selfcontrol exploitation in the field that would be detrimental to black studies and black scholars in this field other objectives include the need to reach african countries directly through embassies to facilitate greater communication and interaction between africans and afroamericans a meeting was planned between the executive committee of african heritage studies association and asa for october  in montreal canada the purpose of this meeting was to define the future relationship between ahsa and asa this meeting carefully planned far in advance never took place other events ruled it off the agenda these events forced the members of african heritage studies association to move ahead of their own schedule and become the official spokesman for the black intellectuals in montreal canada during the th annual conference of asa part of the confusion at montreal was due to the fact that the main aims and objectives of ahsa had not been made known to any appreciable number of the attending black intellectuals who could have explained these objectives to the students had these objectives been known the revolt against the domination of the conference by white scholars might still have occurred but it is my opinion that this revolt would have been more orderly and constructive for the record the main aims and objectives of the african heritage studies association are stated here education  reconstruction of african history and cultural studies along afrocentric lines while effecting an intellectual union among black scholars the world over  acting as a clearing house of information in the establishment and evaluation of a more realistic african or black studies program  presenting papers at seminars and symposiums where any aspect of the life and culture of the african peoples are discussed  relating interpreting and disseminating african materials to elementary and secondary schools colleges and universities international  to reach african countries directly through embassies in order to facilitate greater communication and interaction between africans and africans in the americas  to assume leadership in the orientation of african students in the u s and orientation of afroamericans in africa establish contacts  to form a committee to monitor american foreign policy towards africa to strengthen and support congressman charles diggs mich as chairman of the house subcommittee on african affairs domestic  to inform all other black associations and organizations of the existing responsibilities in the area of black studies  to solicit their influence and affluence in the promotion of black studies and in the execution of ahsa programs and projects  to arouse social consciousness and awareness of these groups 
toussaint louverture black liberator
by lawrence p crouchett
oussaint louverture was described by alphonsede beauchamp as one of the most remarkable men in an age rich in remarkable men this was the same age when the names of such men as george washington thomas jefferson benjamin franklin william pitt talleyrand and napoleon bonaparte were on the lips of all western men this black haitian slave led the first successful black revolution in the western hemisphere his military and political genius saved the united states from possible french and british invasionat a time when she was militarily weak  by lawrence p crouchett and opened the way for the u s to later purchase the louisiana territory  france had successfully colonized and exploited the lands of saint domingue toussaints homeland in the west indies and had developed it into the largest producer of cotton cocoa indigo coffee tobacco and sugar cane in the western hemisphere at one time the colony imported and exported twothirds of all frances commerce by  the eve of the black insurrection this colony alone supplied the sugar coffee and cotton to half of europe and was second to great britain in receiving the exported products of the united states toussaint and his warriors success delayed alleged british and french plans to invade the united states via the louisiana territory the british had long sought to retake her lost  colonies and napoleon aspired to build a global empire instead of expressing their gratitude americans of that era saw these blacks victory as a threat to their continued enslavement of blacks in the southern united states now they lived in dread of another toussaint louverture rising among their slaves to them the success of the haitian black revolutionists could serve as a catalyst to inspire and encourage more slave insurrections in the slave states many of the democratic gains made in the french revolution began to spread to the inhabitants of saint domingue white colonists and mulattoeswhose only common bond was propertybecame allies and began to make new demands on the local colonial government the french assembly further antagonized the white colonists by passing legislation granting additional civil_rights to the mulattoes placing them on a more equal basis with the whites who feared these democratic tendencies might spread to the colonys black slaves soon the whites and their allies of property began to agitate for the colonys independence from france the french governor of saint domingue and his ruling party became restless over this agitation during the summer of  the loss of the colony could retard napoleons plans to build a great colonial empire greater than his european rivalsgreat britain and spain to put down the growing agitation they took a cue from techniques used by the french third estates in obtaining concessions from the king the governor and his followers decided to stage a mock slave insurrection through this they honed to frighten the white colonists in particular into realizing their dependency upon the mother country france and their inability to put down any slave rebellion or even to con tinue subjecting the blacks to slavery without outside help being well respected by both planters and fellow slaves toussaint was approachedby representatives of the governmentto lead a mock rebellion for his role in the socalled rebellion he was guaranteed his freedom but not until the colonial government forces had defeated him and his fellow insurrectionists further all undeserved whipping of slaves was to cease and all slaves were to be granted an additional free day a week for their participation it was emphasized that collective emancipation was not part of the bargain the black slaves were to begin their revolt by prearranged signals from the french colonial officials both sides agreed on the night the revolt was to begin and toussaint agreed to lead this mock rebellion on the night of august   the revolt began as planned but within a few hours of makebelieve the blacks saw an opportunity to settle old scores with their cruel masters and their mulatto cohorts the white colonists were shocked but the french officials were doubly shocked when more than  blacks launched a real insurrection against the white colonists toussaint however hesitated in joining the real revolt he knew of the many abortive attempts made in the past and he was convinced that a real revolt would be futile so he remained on his masters farm for more than a month in october after seeing that his family was safely across the frontier into the spanish colony he joined the revolution within months he rose from doctor of sanitation to general of the armies toussaints father was the son of an african chieftain of the arada tribe who was captured near dahomey west africa and sold into slavery he was sent to saint domingue where he was purchased by jesuit priests who taught him to read and write the father and his family were converted to catholicism and remained so throughout the revolution toussaint was born around  always of short stature  and physically thin he was assigned to guarding cattle and serving as a stable boy during these assignments his father taught him to read and write as well as to reflect upon his servile conditions these lonely assignments allowed him time to read and digest caesars commentaries and roman historyfrom which he learned most of his political and military techniques his effective leadership for the blacks freedom resuited from repeated readings of abbe raynals history of the indies in this book toussaint first read raynals warning to european nations that   your slaves will break the yoke that weighs upon them the negroes only lack a leader    during the black revolt france convinced spain to retrocede louisiana to her hoping to use the territory to break saint domingues dependency upon the united states wars with great britain and later the united states had made france realize her dependency upon u s commerce for the colonys survival conversely the united states not only acknowledged saint domingues commercial value but also its military value to both the british and french the colony could be used as a stepping stone to the u s mainland too the new england states exported over  percent of their products to saint domingue and from which they imported most of their rum and molasses on the eve of the black rebellion the united states and saint domingue had not only become commercially but also militarily interdependent the united states certainly had a stake in the outcome of this black revolution its occurrence postponed napoleons plan to occupy the louisiana territory thus saving this country by may  toussaint and his armies had joined with the french colonial armies against the  white colonists seizing this as an opportunity the french directory pleaded with toussaint to join them in an invasion of louisiana his suspicion of the french and determination to complete the war for the blacks freedom caused him to recognize this diversionary tactic by the french instead he secretly negotiated a treaty with the u s and great britain in exchange for special naval and commercial help from his new allies he assured them he would not send an expedition against their possessions it was this refusal to join the french at this time that allowed the united states time to negotiate the purchase of louisiana thus denying france a foothold on the u s mainland this treaty also assured u s much needed trade relations with saint domingue failing to defeat toussaint and his brave black warriors napoleon gave up his plans for louisiana and offered to sell it to the united states for  unintentionally toussaint louverture aided the u s in acquiring the louisiana territory which doubled the countrys territorial areamoving the western boundary from the mississippi river to the rocky mountains the u s conversely contributed to the success of this first black revolution by continuing commercial trade with the blacks throughout their insurrection knowing that slavery would be restored if they failed in their revolt the blackswithout the leadership of toussaint who had been tricked by the french general charles leclerc captured and sent to france for imprisonment continued their rebellion until success came in october  when the colony declared its independence from france to emphasize their complete break with the french and memories of their enslavement the blacks renamed the colony haiti the original indian name for the island haiti became the second republic in the new world the u s having become the first in  it also has the distinction of being the only country in the western hemisphere to credit its independence based upon the revolution of black african slaves ironically the united states after having contributed to the independence of haiti withheld official recognition of it as an independent country until  after she too became involved in a civil war over the same issue the enslavement of black people 
study in black brown and beige
by leslie b rout jr
youre like me youve probably read gilberto freyre or j ir  frank tannenbaum or watched a couple of cbs reports j ii  paged through holiday or some comparable journal per ap s y°u ve talked to a brazilian or two if youve done any  w  of these things you know already that no racial problems exist in brazil maybe the brazilian you talked to was more discreet he would then have informed you that there is less racial discrimination in brazil than any place else in the world as the story is usually told unlike the anglosaxons who set up shop at jamestown or plymouth rock the portuguese gentlemen who migrated to the new world had significantly fewer qualms about nighttime integration the result was that in addition to the obvious black slaves and white masters there appeared an increasing myriad of colored persons who were part of both but not really of either  accordingly and this is in keeping with the legend the brazilians adopted the converse of the formula adopted by the anglosaxons where the english settled any measure of negro blood made you a negro in brazil any discernible quantity of white blood made you at least a pardo mulatto ultimately it was probably very much a question of what one could get those higher up in the pecking order to believe  sfc   sfc in todays united states of america where racial troubles can no longer be swept under the carpet the brazilian legend exercises a peculiar influence for afroamericans such as this writer brazil beckons as a kind of tropical shangrila as a friend once put it man after i make my pile here then im splitting for coffeeland when i can enjoy it others wonder how a nation which maintained slavery until may  where illiterates possibly outnumber literates and where political democracy can hardly be said to have taken giant strides could do what the gringo goliath could not satisfy the hopes and aspirations of its nonwhite citizens this story really begins the second time i saw walt disneys saludo amigo there was jose carioca and lots of samba and seemingly a country where the living was easy rather than hectic then there was black orpheus lots of samba and a plenitude of carnival more important orpheus although a lowly bondes streetcar driver seemed to possess a peculiar kind of personal security in the land of the anglosaxon without identification signs as big as life senator brooke of massachusetts andor congressman william dawson of illinois are like george washington jones of birmingham alabama niggers to be  kept in their place afroamericans in the land of uncle sam are acutely aware of their dependence upon whitey lock stock and credit card orpheus was black like me and so poor he could hardly have afforded a free lunch yet his view of himself as a functioning member of the brazilian body politic gave him a kind of quiet support black yankees cannot achieve cadillac or no cadillac education or no education orpheus felt he belonged afroamericans do not believe they do in june  the paul winter sextet of which i was a member won the intercollegiate jazz festival held at georgetown university as fortune would have it somebody in washington dc noticed that the six members of the group were split evenupthree blacks and three whites could you have dreamed of a better combination to send on a governmentsponsored tour of latin american colleges and universities a sevenmonth tour was dropped into our laps secretly i resolved that if brazil resembled the land of orpheus jose carioca tannenbaum and gilberto freyre it must eventually open its arms to a new immigrant me  la arriving in porto alegre may  the first thing i tended to notice was that brancos in brazil found nothing strange about fraternizing with negroes one saw pretos and pardos frequently but as my portuguese was limited to such terms as macanudo and the usual unprintable terminology you always seem to learn first it was nearly impossible to communicate with them exceedingly noticeable on the campuses of the universities and in the theaters was the absence of negroes at sextet concerts whites i questioned assured me that although the concerts were free most afrobrazilians were of the lower economic classes and rarely attended affairs where middle and upper class senhores predominated previous experiences in south america had convinced me that some kind of class system would be found everywhere the explanations given were logical but in my opinion insufficient somehow or another i had to meet a few pretos and get their side of the story jazz musicians meet their counterparts wherever they seem to go in the world and with the music as a medium friendships are forged through cepu a black tenor saxophone player i met in a rio nightclub i finally met some pretos who spoke english speaking directly to the gentlemen both of whom were musicians i remarked that none of the black members of the sextet had encountered any incidences of discrimination in brazil one of the brazilians smiled and said things are not as they seem they are more subtle here    this was to be inkling number one you might say in this regard probably the most interesting character i would meet was a young negro from omaha nebraska named bill waters waters had decided to take one year off go to brazil and see whether he wanted to move there permanently when i met him his stay in rio had exceeded ten months he stated that while he liked brazil it had not been the racial nirvana hed hoped to find indeed he was amazed at the ease with which the black members of the sextet moved among rios social elite he later confided in me that he felt certain that the prestige of the department of state opened doors otherwise hermetically sealed at the time i was enjoying myself to such a degree that waters reservations seemed sour grapes the whole issue reemerged about three months later when bill stopped in chicago on his way to omaha having just returned to the usa i threw a small party and invited waters afterwards he remarked you know les i saw more integration here tonight than i saw in twelve months in brazil what he really meant was miscegenation and secretly i had to admit that while everywhere in brazil one sees pardos  had seen precious little intermingling on a social level admittedly it was the pretos you saw pushing the brooms but the witness of my own adventures as a musical diplomat in sambaland were 
afroamericans and early panafricanism
by clarence g contee
ie of the very important strands of the many threads that go to weave the whole cloth of african nationalism is called panafricanism the history of panafricanism before  is largely the story of the dedicated and unselfish efforts made by new world negroes especially those of the united states to them panafricanism meant the protest of oppressive and exploitative conditions of negroes all over the world they saw a need for unity among these brothers and kin as a tactic for pressure to get these conditions changed they believed that even though black africa was being conquered selfdetermination and independence would inevitably return to the people there it was believed very deeply that equal treatment of negroes with whites was related to these pur by clarence g contee poses of panafricanism the first official use of the term panafrican grew out of the panafrican conference of  which was held in london and attended by thirtytwo delegatesmainly new world negroes among those who attended was a young harvard phd graduate web du bois it has been generally conceded that the panafrican conference of  was the brain child of henry sylvesterwilliams a young negro from trinidad living at that time in london it was he who did most of the work to convene the conclave but the sentiment for black unity for the protest of the depressing conditions of negro life everywhere and the hope for a strong and powerful african state or empire run by negroes were not new in  t thomas fortune a negro editorpublisher of the new york age a negro weekly made a speech at the congress on africa held in atlanta georgia at the gammon theological seminary his speech called for the nationalization and the unification of africa under black rule the bible predicted it he concluded he claimed in  that it was he who gave the idea for the panafrican meeting to henry sylvesterwilliams who was visiting the united states in the late s one thing is clear williams received the support of booker t washington who knew t thomas fortune there was a haitian diplomat benito sylvain who also claimed that he had thought of the idea of calling together leading negroes of the world at the turn of the century difficult years although the origin of the pan african conference is in doubt the same is not true of the motives for the meeting the late s were a particularly difficult set of years for blacks everywhere the cult of white supremacy was constructing its temples in the united states with federal and state laws european nations were busy bringing by force western civilization and culture to the backward and inferior blacks in africa a natural calamity added to the woes of the black british west indians as the negroes were receiving the new ways they were losing their freedom their land and their resources therefore there was a general need almost a compulsion for negroes to look to themselves and their liberal white friends for support and to protest the blatant abuses of the premises that all men were created equal and entitled to selfdetermination and some control over their own destinies but the methods of protest and unity were traditional most of the early black and white protestors were moderates who believed in peaceful and gradual change through the accepted methods revolution was not the vehicle for these individuals from  to  there was no real panafrican movement despite the pronounced aims of the panafrican conference of  to establish one but the idea of the rise of panafricanism as a movement for unified pressure by the black world and for eventual self determination for africans especially those in africa the homeland remained very much alive the leadership shifted more than ever into the hands of negroes in the united states the hope was there that a strong and effective panafrican movement could be developed booker t washington remembered the panafrican conference and in  called for another meeting it was at this juncture that fortune claimed he was the originator of the idea for the  assembly in  at tuskegee alabama a meeting was held but it was a typical booker t washington gathering very few sentiments of african nationalism and few words of protest emerged his meeting was dominated by white missionaries who accepted the accommodation philosophy the only visible effort made by the followers of du bois was the shortlived panafrican department in  of the niagara movement yet africans and du bois wrote of their hope for a second and more vibrantly sustained panafrican movement restructuring map when world war i began du bois an afroamerican leader and the anticipated successor to the throne of the deceased booker t washington took the lead in trying to use the territorial changes of the war and the selfdetermination principle as opportunities to promote african nationalism and the restructuring of the african map into large african states he won the support of the naacp an organization he helped found and for which he worked as editor of its organ the crisis with the financial and psychological support of the naacp he pushed his campaign into the significant revival of the movement at the panafrican congress in paris during the peace conference he aimed to exert pressure on the decisionmakers in paris to grant some steps toward selfdetermination for africans in africa the meeting attended by fiftyseven moderate blacks and whites most of whom were afro americans from the united states once more advocated traditional means of social change for blacks everywhere there were some africans present such as blaise diagne black senegalese french deputy and the liberian delegation to the peace conference but the accomplishments of du bois and the other delegates were few although du bois reported and wrote that he had helped set up the machinery the permanent mandates commission of the league of nationsfor the internalization of the former german colonies in africa many negroes in the united states including du bois had wanted the german colonies turned over to africans for selfrule the most important achievement was the publicity du bois received for the panafrican congress of  under the circumstances it was a triumph just to hold it illusion of greatness to the afroamericans in the united states the panafrican congress had the illusion of greatness it was great for a commencement what was needed next was an effective internationally united black voice of protest as a watchdog to see to it that progress toward selfdetermination in africa particularly in the mandated areas was absolute and continuous the leadership of panafricanism concentrated more than ever in the hands and works of du bois who rose steadily as the major negro leader in the world black community after his return from europe du bois spoke on the panafrican congress of  in washington he drew an appreciative overflow crowd miss nannie h burroughs a wellknown washington educator and a spectator was dubious about the personality of du bois to lead such a movement she said so to james weldon johnson the first afroamerican secretary of the naacp but the spingarn medal a coveted award prestigigiously given to a negro for achievement and service to the negro community was awarded du bois in  the award was made by a committee of the naacp du bois was at the peak of his career vengeful competition just as du bois was given the spingarn medal for his moderate conception of panafricanism there burst into the limelight for five years  another concept a much more militant one to offer consistent bitter and vengeful competition the challenge to du bois and the naacp came from an unexpected source the universal negro improvement association led by marcus mosiah negro digest february  garvey a black british west indian from jamaica who advocated the use of force their central approaches to pan africanism focused on a backto africa movement an allnegro owned and operated steam ship line worldwide black unity and an african empire all of these were to be under the direct control of marcus garvey and the unia his mass followings produced meetings of  at one time in the madison square garden and large crowds at his liberty hall meeting place in harlem his annual conventions in harlem were considered by some to be world black parliaments garvey thus had an organization and panafrican meetings in direct confrontation with the naacp and the panafrican congress of du bois but their competition over a moderate or a militant approach served to emphasize the fact that panafricanism was based mainly in new york and elsewhere in the new world one hesitates to speculate about the possibilities of african redemption had du bois and garvey cooperated garvey spurred the evidence indicates that the rise of garvey spurred du bois and the other moderate advocates of panafricanism and african nationalism to hold a much larger and more widely attended panafrican congress of  which was the best and most productive held during the years when the panafrican congresses were led by web du bois sessions at london brussels and paris produced an appeal to the league of nations and a constitution a manifesto which was an answer to the declaration of the rights of the negro peoples of the world of the unia the hope was that the panafrican congress movement would finally create a permanent pressure group of blacks and liberal whites the concrete achievements of the panafrican congress of  were easier to see but the continuity of the panafrican congress movement was not too easy to discern there was no extended high plateau for panafricanism during the s the peak was quickly reached and quickly passed there were many reasons for this unfortunate course of both movements despite the evident success of the panafrican congress of  the national officers of the naacp refused to donate more financial aid to the panafrican congresses du bois had to use his own limited resources this was a serious blow but even more significant was the continued confusion about the du bois and the garvey movements many people could see no fundamental differences in the programs of the two men the unia and the leader marcus garvey suffered from business mismanagement and legal tangles garvey was jailed in  for mail  fraud and then deported in  because he was an undesirable alien most important of the reasons for the rapid decline of both movements was the lack of interest on the part of new world negroes in the redemption of africa most negroes did not want to go back to africa or worry too greatly over african conditions things were bad enough at home the next two panafrican congresses in  held in london  and lisbon and  in new york reflected the decline the fact that the last panafrican congress under the guidance of du bois was held in new york was furtherproof that afroamericans were in command some africans attended this assembly the assumption of black african leadership began in  and not in  as has been generally thought in london a colony of africans and afroamericans joined at the outbreak of the italoabyssinian war of  the italian conquest of the symbol of black freedom in east africa ethiopia revived the feelings of negroes for united action to protest the hypocrisy of the european powers who stood by passively during the conquest all over the black world  sentiments erupted for blacks to do something to help haile selassie the emperor of ethiopia when he entered into exile in london he was met at the station on his arrival by a representative of a panafrican organization jomo kenyatta who later became the first president of kenya they and their white liberal friends continued to meet and to protest european invasions thus a continuity was provided from the panafrican activities in london during the italianethiopian conflict down to the manchester meeting of the panafrican congress in  m at the manchester meeting there was no longer any doubt that african nationalists from africa were in charge of the panafrican movement which had formerly been largely the work of new world negroes especially those in the united states like du bois and garvey even though he attended the manchester congress du bois knew that he had become the svm w bol and was no longer the leader  leadership shifts  at the manchester england meeting in october  it was  immediately evident that the shift of leadership from the new world blacks to black africans had definitely occurred the africans were ii much more numerous and active than at any other meeting among the wellknown africans to attend i were dr kwame nkrumah americaneducated first black prime  minister in black africa in the j gold coast later ghana and  jomo kenyatta  for the first time militancy was much in evidence demands for   autonomy and for independence were unequivocal there was even i talk of the use of violence as a last resort to obtain equality selfgovernment and independence resolutions were adopted in support of the oneman one vote principle during the next two years nkrumahs dream of a united states of africa became the dream of many africans the first panafrican meetings on african soil came in  four previous events symbolized the continued domination of panafricanism by africans the first event was the independence of india in  africans drew much inspiration from this transition it marked the beginning of the afroasian solidarity for liberation and for third world aims the second was the egyptian revolution of gamal abdal nasser in  this marked the beginning of a more militant arab and moslem nationalism the third was the bandung indonesia conference in  where asians and some african observers condemned colonialism imperialism and racial discrimination afroasian leadership and solidarity were strengthened ghana and nkrumah finally in  ghana gained its independence under the militant leadership of nkrumah who took it upon himself to lead the panafrican movement under his urgings and his direction two meetings were held in accra the capital of ghana in  in april all of the independent states of africa except south africa met and committed themselves to the liberation of the rest of africa and to remain neutral in the cold war in december instead of the states meeting the leaders of liberation movements and african political parties came to receive advice and to exchange tactics about the ultimate objectives of an africa completely free of colonialism exploitation and racial discrimination and an africa eventually united as one political area eleven years later the dream of a united states of africa remains just that while there are areas still in colonial hands how long it will take before these two aims are attained is anybodys guess 
the myth of benevolent spanish slave law
by gwendolyn midlo hall
he accepted publica tions in the field of comparative slavery in the americas have je part ej from the assumption that spanish slave law was unusually protective towards the slaves stanley elkins herbert klein louis hartz all cite frank tannenbaums slave and citizen as the foundation upon which their research and conclusions are based the foundation is very shaky indeed the spanish slave code of  is cited extensively by these writers you can find this code printed in books but as the great cuban historian and jurist fernando ortiz pointed out back in  when he ridiculed sir harry f johnson for making not a few comments about this unpromulgated code this code was never so much as promulgated much less enforced anywhere in or around the spanish caribbean when the code was first sent to the colonies the planters and merchants from cuba puerto rico venezuela and louisiana which then belonged to spain got together in a meeting and sent the code back to madrid saying that if such a law were published the slaves would rise up in rebellion madrid took it back and never tried to promulgate it again in the spanish caribbean if tannenbaum had read the very sources he cites fernando ortiz and jose antonio saco he would have learned this elementary fact apparently he didnt and no one else has bothered to check him out lo these many years what other legal evidence does he offer the siete partidos of rey alfonso el sabio alfonso the wise he was wise all right he ruled during the th century in toledo spain toledo had been  one of the great intellectual centers of the moors at the time when the rest of europe was going through what even western historians call the dark ages alfonso the wise set up a translation center where arabic and hebrew scholarly works were translated into latin thereafter they were distributed throughout europe and pawned off as original works much of western philosophy theology science medicine mathematics aesthetics optics architecture agriculture irrigation law and government literary forms and techniques musicology including the rhythmic notation system this system is called the franconian system after the german monk who copies it from the arabswell you name it they plagiarized it a moorish chronicler living in those times wrote do not give arabic manuscripts to the christians because they will translate them into latin and claim them as their own this king should be known as king alfonso the plagiarizer but to get back to our subject tannenbaum claims that the protectiveness of medieval iberian slave law was carried over from roman slave law now there are historians in this country arnold sio for example who have pointed out that roman slave law was extremely harsh it hasnt occurred to anyone yet that the major influence upon the siete partidas might be islamic islamic codes were protective of slaves in any case the siete partidas never was applied to america i have thoroughly searched and a few other historians have thoroughly searched spanish slave law before the  code spanish slave law deals almost exclusively with security measures it deals with requiring slaves to have written passes when they leave their masters property forbidding them to have arms to own or ride horses it deals with brutal punishments for runaway slaves including ham stringing cutting off noses and ears castration it deals with control of emancipated slaves or free africans forbidding them from living in indian villages forcing them to live in separate villages where they can be supervised made to pay tribute and forced to present themselves upon the labor market it deals with barring them from skilled trades from schools from intermarriage and conscripting them for military service there were even some attempts in th century mexico to reenslave the entire free black population there are some early measures encouraging religious education and encouraging marriage among the slaves but even these measures they explain are to hold the slaves to the estates with family ties and to encourage submission to their masters through religious education what is really rare in spanish slave law before the  code is concrete measures regulating work hours requiring masters to provide food clothing and medical attention requiring masters to provide for old or sick slaves unable to work measures restricting the type or amount of punishment a master can inflict upon a slave and making the master criminally responsible for the serious injury or death of his slave as a result of punishment or measures guaranteeing trial in the civil courts for slaves accused of serious crimes in fact in the realm of concrete protective measures spanish slave law is vastly inferior to french slave law and even to british slave law the concrete protective measures of the spanish slave code of  were consciously copied from the french code noir which dates all the way back to  many of the paragraphs of the spanish code of  appear to be direct translations of the code noir and if this in itself is not convincing there is a document dating from  instructing the framers of the spanish slave codes to copy the french code noir the nowfamous spanish slave code of it has been quoted so extensivelv lately that it has be  come probably the most famous unpromulgated law in history claims in its preamble that it is a codification of existing spanish slave law in the americas tannenbaum accented this statement   without investigating whether or not it was true and concluded that spanish law in the americas had always been protective of the slaves so here is an entire theory based upon a code that was never promulgated in the spanish caribbean it apparently was promulgated where there werent many slaves anyway and claiming falsely that it was a codification of existing spanish slave law in the americas what other legal evidence does tannenbaum cite this pious statement from the king dating from  and directed to the captain general of cuba that after privately calling the masters of these slaves you say to them in my name that they must not for whatever motive rigorously tighten the wage they receive from their slaves for having been tried in other places it has proved inconvenient harming the souls of these people which is a matter for grave scruples that for their own consciences sake the master must avoid    and at the same time i command you that if at any time    these masters mistreat them the slaves you will apply the necessary remedy it is not just to consent to or permit any excess in this matter for their slavery is a sufficient sorrow without at the  same time suffering the distempered rigour of their masters   tannenbaum picked up this piece of a law from the cuban historian saco now while saco opposed the slave trade he defended slavery itself to the bitter end the full text of this law and some other relevant documents have since been published in a collection of documents which throw new light upon this pious statement and illustrates the dangers of relying upon secondary sources on so controversial a subject as slavery his majestys attention had been called to a persistent problem in his kingdom of the indies it seems some masters were forcing their slaves into theft and prostitution some of the slave women were wandering around the port cities in the nude soliciting customers and creating quite a scandal the masters were demanding that their street slaves bring back each day a much larger sum of money than they could possibly secure through legitimate means punishing them severely if they didnt bring back the amount of money the masters were demanding the king instead of fixing a maximum amount a master could demand of his street slave as his advisors had apparently recommended contented himself with exhortation this pious but impotent statement is quoted over and over again by these highly qualified historians to prove how mild slavery was in latin america by the way dont think that i street slaves no longer exist our cities are teeming with them they are called junkies their masters  are the organized crime syndicates which often own everyone in local government who counts they addict their street slaves to hard narcotics monopolize the supply and control the prices then the syndicate collects every penny the  junkies can beg borrow steal and prostitute themselves for the junkies also sell as much dope as rthey can to support their own habits and create new customers for the syndicate they devote  about  hours a day to their various occupations gilberto freyre estimates the average working life  of a brazilian street slave at seven  years i would make about the same estimate of life expectancy for the street slaves of detroit the content hasnt changed only tithe form i hope you dont think r this is an irrelevant comment i believe the past teaches us about the present and the present teaches rus about the past at least thats how it works with me ill give you some of my conclusions about the role of slave law based upon comparative research i have quite a bit of evidence to back me up which i cant possibly present here but i am presenting it in my dissertation the colonial authorities were there to look out after the interests of the mother country the slave system was a tremendous source of wealth for the mother country and colonial officials were there to see to it that nothing jeopardized the continued prosperity of the colony and the stability of the slave system slave law was concerned with preserving order in the colony maintaining and developing its wealth and continuing the dependency of the colony upon the mother country the main concern of slave law including its protective aspects was social control in the broadest sense those measures which tend towards protecting the slaves cannot be understood as indications of the disinterested humanitarianism of the colonizing powers they stemmed from fear of the slaves their potential threat to public order to the prosperity or even the continued existence of the colony these concerns often came into conflict with the plantation owners drive for immediate profit the masters did not consider the long range impact of their activities upon the colony the problem was especially acute among absentee owners and among colonists whose orientation was to make as much money as soon as possible and then return to the metropolis in other words the colonial authorities were afraid that the masters looking to their immediate interests alone might abuse neglect and exasperate their slaves to the point of provoking rebellion and the loss of the colony to the mother country as the continued existence of the slave trade was increasingly called into question the mother country was also concerned that the work force might die out and could not be replaced this latter concern is reflected in reform laws tending towards encouraging procreation and protecting pregnant and nursing slaves and newborn slave children far from being unusually protective towards the slaves the spanish system was the only one i have studied in any depth which actually operated a flourishing slave plantation system without any legal controls to speak of because spain was weak during the th century it could not impose its will upon the cuban planters and practically no controls were exercised upon the plantations civil government in the cuban countryside was predatory here is a description from a th century travel account of the capitanes de partido or petty judges who being without salaries like so many vultures prey upon the unprotected within their jurisdiction nor are the rich without the pale of their power and those who have not influence with the heads of the island government are sometimes largely fleeced by them on most frivolous pretexts this  traveller describes one of these petty judges whose chief boast was the sums he could collect in fines from his neighbors while riding through the country with sword and pistols his slouched hat coattee that had crawled up on his shoulders and pantaloons struggling to escape from their straps his face unshaven and his whole person covered with dust he might readily have been taken for a prowling thief has anybody ever seen a rural sheriff in the south or the vice squad in detroit those of us who know what law and government  does to the unprotected will not make these silly mistakes when we become historians plantation slavery in th century cuba was lawless to the point of jeopardizing its own continued existence instead of legal protections which might have sought to prevent the system from transcending limits conducive to its own survival the system got completely out of hand and the government authorities resorted to overkill to maintain order the great cuban historian fernando ortiz writing about midth century cuba said uprisings among the plantation slaves became so frequent and the means of repressing them so horrible that very soon the masters began to realize that the intervention of the authorities was more costly than the rebellions themselves thus in  the captaingeneral of cuba had to issue an instruction   against the abuses committed by circuit judges who were entering plantations in revolt accompanied by large bodies of armed men killing animals and negroes and ruining the owners this system of rule culminated in wholesale destruction of the slave and free black population during   and  when the conspiracy of the ladder was repressed over  people were summarily tried by a military tribunal which extracted confessions and implication of others under torture over  people were executed many more died under the lash hundreds were exiled and sentenced to long terms at hard labor in africa the elite of the free black population was wiped out its leading intellectuals executed the entire free black population was substantially reduced but aside from these official proceedings the slave population was decimated government investigators reported a drastic increase in suicide among slaves during these years the official census shows that the slave population was reduced from  in  to  in  export of sugar fell to almost nothing the captaingeneral of cuba officially denied british protests against cruel procedures used against english subjects during these trials in a letter to the queen he said  far from having made use of terror or afflictive means to clarify the facts or proceeding with rigor in the imposition of penalties each and every trial is resplendent with the spirit of leniency of moderation and justice which presided in them the queen replies    continue submitting data about the success of the trial of several english subjects accused of complicity in the last conspiracy so that the government of her majesty can answer with authentic data and information the reclamations directed by the british minister concerning this matter this is the style of spanish slave law it is so busy protesting its humaneness that any critical historian should immediately suspect that it might be just the opposite spanish slave law was abstract selfrighteous and totally ineffective in rendering protection to the plantation slaves even to the point of jeopardizing the continued existence of slavery itself but the texts of spanish slave law were weaved into a myth of the mildness of spanish slavery justifying its continued existence and used as an argument against the abolition of slavery if you want to know what slavery was really like in th century cuba you should read the autobiography of esteban montejo a cuban slave it has just been translated and published in english montejo was sold away from his parents when a small child in those days he said blacks were sold like pigs and they sold me at once children were separated from their mothers and raised in a barracks so their mothers could go right back to work without having to care for them montejo was born during the last decades of the  slave system when the african slave trade had actually stopped the masters were interested in slave breeding and forced tall slaves to mate the child of two tall slaves sold for  pesos montejo describes subhuman living and working conditions brutal punishments and widespread homosexuality because of the shortage of women on the estates montejo didnt believe homosexual practices came from africa because the old africans frowned upon them after the abolition of slavery in cuba the spanish historian rafael maria de labra said one has to admire gentlemen the nerve by which the slave interests propagated the belief that the slaves of the antilles lived happily and contented no one mentioned dungeons stocks and irons nor the awful mortality rate among slaves it is this same proslavery propaganda which accepted uncritically has attained the status of fact in the academic world in the united states  
the origins of racism
by don howie
riting near the end of fascist hegemony in europe the great hannah arendt declared  the historical truth of the matter is that racethinking with its roots deep in the th century emerged during the th century simultaneously in all western countries racism has been the powerful ideology of imperialistic policies since the turn of the century it certainly has absorbed and revived all the old patterns of race opinions which however by themselves hardly would have been able to create or  to degenerate into racism as weltanschauung or ideology for the idea of race does not belong in the history of ideas and not until the end of the last century were dignity and importance accorded it as though it had been one of the major spiritual contributions of the western world in  given the poverty of historical research and the prevailing europhilia that may have been an entirely acceptable viewpoint however today we know that it is grossly inaccurate actually racism in all its devilish forms emerged long before the genocidal commerce in red men and black men enveloping euroamerican life from time immemorial the historical truth is simply that the roots of racism are inseparable from the evolution of western civilization itself men have always been conscious of race the whole concept of race did not originate with the african slave trade as many have pontificated rather raceopinions are as old and traditional as the races themselves nothing could be more incorrect and intellectually arrogant than the assertion that the  idea of race does not belong in the history of ideas and not until the end of the last century were dignity and importance accorded it    as more recent scholarship has demonstrated the idea of race is deeply embedded in western culture and consequently is eminently worthy of inclusion in the history of ideas as well as the history of political economy here i am not using race in an abstract biologistic sense but sociohistorically apparently miss arendt arbitrarily has delimited race to a purely physioethnological meaning on its face such an ahistorical delimitation has neither intellectually nor socially redeeming value race as a category of human existence has a meaning in those social situations where men of different groups take cognizance of their respective racial andor cultural differences defining ex plaining and acting upon them in terms of their world views now racism in the broad sense is an appropriate and descriptive concept for the way in which each group affirms its physical andor cultural superiority over another group racism in this sense is as ancient as the concept of race itself however racism in its ideological sense refers to racethinking which rationalizes sanctions and affirms a particular social system racism as ideology then is preeminently a politicalsociological phenomenon that is not to say that it does not have residual manifestations dimensions or ramifications eg psychological racism as ideology therefore is defined as that peculiar worldview which rationalizes the bestiality of a social system by propounding the physical andor cultural superiority of the dominant race and the inferiority of the oppressed race this dynamic conception reduces racism to its material foundations and its rationalistic functions ie activating spreading and institutionalizing both manifest and latent forms of preexisting race consciousness or racial differentiations this grasping of racism as a social fact resulting from the dynamic interaction between fundamentally antagonistic irreconcilable social forces illuminates the critical distinction between race consciousness re the cultural system and racism re the social or institutional system ie between consciousness and ideology racism then is the ideological doctrine that asserts the genetic andor cultural inferiority of an oppressed people in order to justify their social plight ie how and why they have been subjugated this does not at all imply that political economy causes racism on the contrary ecopolitical and military facts activate and institutionalize already existing race consciousness doubtless racism in its generic sense did not originate with the african slave trade for sure racism functioned ideologically however negligiblyin some social systems before europeans raped and pillaged the continent yet we should not allow this to distort and eradicate in our minds the remembrance of the altogether vicious historical development of racism as ideology in the wild west nor should we allow this to validate the spurious equation of the various forms of racism before the african slave trade with the hellish legacy of the coming of the beast the incontrovertible fact remains racism as the pervasive ideology of expansionistic capitalism remains the enduring essence of the western heritage racism inheres in the evolution of capitalist civilization enough said about the promised lands of life liberty and the pursuit of property concerning the necessary antecedent conditions for racism as ideology to emerge it has been maintained that the most important necessary condition antecedent for racism is the presence in sufficient numbers of two or more groups that look different enough so that at least some of their members can be readily classifiable in addition to their physical differences these groups also have to be culturally different    and in a position of institutionalized inequality for the idea of inherent racial differences to take root emphasis mine it seems that only when group differences in race overlap at least partly with dissimilarities in status and culture are these two sets of differences held to be casually related to another  but the idea of inherent racial differences may establish itself without the existence of institutionalized inequality ie oppression provided that it is embedded in the worldview of a social system thus there are only two necessary and sufficient conditions for racism as such what is confused above is the politicalsociological function of racism with its necessary conditions antecedent racism can and usually does exist prior to the oppression relationship euphemistically such racism has been called ethnocentrism or xenophobia  though oppression or institutionalized inequality is an essential condition for racism as ideology it is not a necessary condition antecedent for racism as race consciousness or ethnocentrism miss arendt correctly sees that historically racism as ideology absorbed and revived all the old patterns of race opinions however such race opinions were not inherently impotent either to create or to degenerate into an ideology their apparent impotence is directly attributable to the lack of a relationship of oppression between the conflicting groups and is therefore a social fact rather than mere ideation traditionally the conventional wisdom has relegated racism to a physiological statement this biologistic posture explains in part the inhibition to define preth century racethinking as racism since it lacked a scientistic front but it is not really critical whether biology or culture or a combination of the two is viewed as the base of the racist perspective what is important is whether that base is naturalistically or genetically conceived the essential elements of racism as ideology have been philosophically elaborated by professor george d kelsey as  ontology  philosophy of history and  military plan professor kelsey  admits that only the first two elements are necessary and sufficient for racism as such to exist ie an oppressed people can be racist even though it lacks political power this analytical view conforms to the critical distinction between racism as race consciousness and racism as ideology only those who would maintain the status quo can be ideologically racist since racism as ideology in principle affirms the existing pattern of social arrangements political power therefore is necessary for racism to function ideologically naturally racism as ideology in the wild west has been inseparable from a politicaleconomicmilitary plan ie white power it may be theoretically possible to equate the racism of an oppressed people with that of the oppressors but such a sophistic academic equation would be historically and sociologically relatively insignificant the unquestionable historical truth of the matter is that racism as ideology has been exclusively possessed by whites in the modern world racism as ideology in the modern world evolved from the inception of the slave trade in africans dating from the middle of the th century according to basil davidson throughout the years that followed it it was to be the searing brand of this trade that it would consider its victims not  as servants or domestic slaves who deserved respect in spite of their servile condition but as chattel slaves commodities that could and should be sold at will until the enlightenment the orthodox justification of the slave trade was couched in a theologistic worldview initially the slave traders as well as those involved in and benefitting from their free enterprise rationalized their gross crimes in terms of making the world safe for christianity when whites first met africans they instinctively assumed that they were dealing a blow to infidelity in general as well as procuring new souls for the church to wins their concept of heathenism was firmly rooted in the white idea of savagery ie the traditional european view of nonwhites but given the genocidal oppression of the african slave trade the concept of heathenism inevitably acquired ideological significance more important the white idea of heathenism masked a more totalistic ideology racism apparently heathenism was now obsolete to the white definition of africans as livestock it was readily translatable into forthright and militant white racism it was argued that black people were the natural predestined and ordained as it were by god himself slaves of whitesuperior civilization the critical theological distinction between heathen and redeemed was therefore thoroughly racializable prefiguring the imminent devilview in the beginning the europeans image of himself as christian visavis heathens camouflaged a plethora of racial differentiations christian meant whitesuperior civilizedhuman the traditional concept of slavery in western culture also was racialized in order to buttress the racist folklore and mythology slavery had always been more than an economic institution in western culture it had long represented the ultimate limit of dehumanization of treating and regarding man as a thing  embedded in western culture then was a vocabulary experience and temperament of slavery which was readily applied to the enslaved africans concepts of heathenism and slavery were enmeshed and interlocked in the same traditional worldview but with the rise of the slave trade they acquired radically new social and institutional content racialization psycholinguistically whites were predisposed to look upon africans as inferior men by their concept of blackness which was pervaded by a sinister diabolical signification the concept of blackness was loaded with intense meaning long before they found that some men were black englishmen found in the idea of blackness a way of expressing some of their most ingrained values    white and black connoted purity and filthiness virginity and sin virtue and baseness beauty and ugliness beneficence and evil god and the devil it followed from the european concept of blackness that racial theories would attempt to explain the deviation of africans from the white paradigms europeans were endowed by their culture with an antiblack consciousness that they perceived africans as black ie as perverse negations of themselves is an interesting commentary on the perpetuity of cultural selectivity blackness nonbeing for whites was juxtaposed against whiteness being and as a result race consciousness was transformed into racist ideology whereas the color of africans was their most distinctive arresting and immediate characteristic for whites the concept of blackness was easily converted from a psycholinguistic category into a politicaleconomic fact in the european psyche africa represented the land of blackness though the cult of ethiopism ie the medieval idea that ethiopia or africa was a terrestrial paradise inhabited by convertible noble savages intrigued many africans were never regarded as noble savages in any sense comparable to the romantic idolization of the american indians the color bar and literally so was all too insurmountable the image of africa as the dark con tinent flowed naturally from the cluster of cultural perceptions myths and symbols which comprised the european worldview a critical aspect of the european racist ideology was the view that the enslavement of africans was justifiable because the move from primitivetribal forms of slavery to christianwhite slavery represented an advance on the hierarchial ontological ladder ie the great chain of being  this distorted perception of what african forms of slavery were all about was directly caused by the white projectionimposition of its perverse slavocratic institution upon alien societies such a crude misunderstanding of african slavery reflects the mythical element in western civilizationan element which is inextricably imbricated in the politicaleconomicmilitary facts of white domination the ideological origins of racism have been obscured by liberal historiography in their reconstruction of the preslave trade european view of africans some historians have minimized its racist consciousness because there is some evidence that not every european regarded africans as degenerate heathens these historians conclude that the white view was not racist and therefore that white racism did not exist prior to the slave trade with the advent of the slave trade the white image of africans is said to have undergone a fundamental transformation insofar as europeans supposed no inherent racial inferiority in africans they are said to have exhibited a presumably innocuous cultural chauvinism in their attempt to minimize the vitality and importance of racism in preslave trade europe these historians have indulged in historical hyperbole obscuring the extent to which whites were thoroughgoing racists as well as the historical transformation of racism as consciousness into racism as ideology racism as ideology far from being an attitudinal irrationality in mans ethnicity or essentially a problem of personality development developed as a consequence of the need for a more rationalistic indeed naturalistic explanation of the capitalist political economy of which slavery was an indispensable institution until the enlightenment the orthodox theory of the varieties of mankind was a theological monogenesis it was not until the latter part of the th century that someone dared to seriously doubt the unity of the human race some thinkers however anticipating later theories of polygenesis staunchly denied that africans and american indians were of the same species as christianwhite men for instance in  the bold bruno declared that it was unthinkable that whites and africans could have the same ancestry  but monogenesis was so firmly and clearly established that such speculative deviations carried little if any weight the church responding with all deliberate speed quashed these heterodox doctrines however the temporary suppression of polygenetic conjecture did not extinguish it as a very viable and acceptable theory of the racialized dichotomy between oppressor and oppressed polygenesis was to gain new expression in the th century in the thought of thomas jefferson and voltaire  eventually the religious doctrine of the unity of man was subverted by the identity of christianity and whiteness in contradistinction to heathenness and blackness  if the religious ideology lingered on as the primary rationalization of the political economy of slavery through the s toward the end of the th century it was less politically and intellectually compelling the progressive secularization of antiblack sentiments and theories having occurred given its worldview europe was predisposed upon contact with noneuropeans to transform raceconsciousness into racist ideology that pernicious predisposition was part and parcel of the european identityselfconsciousness it served a dual purpose metapsychologically it sustained whites image of themselves the mirror that can never be me and politically it rationalized their barbarous treatment of africans they knew that they were whitechristian civilized only because nonwhite peoples could not by definitionin principle be the retarded european consciousness could define itself only in terms of the other the noneuropean white could not be whiteness without blackness the african presence then vivified  vitalized  politicized  mythicized what may have been prior to that racial oppression an abstract other if racism as ideology has been the major spiritual bequeathment of the western experience it is because race consciousness and racism are rooted in western culture having been detonated by the politicaleconomic facts of the  th century

erhaps it was because the neighbors were so used to loud cursing and crying that they did not turn  away from their supper when mrs i sneed let go with a loud cry and  dashed out her door and down the  sidewalk hurdling like a black  missile with mr sneed right behind her in strong pursuit once rthey were moving down the side walk a stunned and silent awe  greeted them at the corner of the i street she stopped for a moment and raised her fist defiantly then took off again with startled people making way for her as she ran wildly jones funeral cortege with mr ebenezer jones driving hearse slammed on its collective  mournful brakes and had its ears pierced with mrs sneeds defiance there goes that crazy lady someone said they ought to put her awayor something meanwhile mr sneed was still behind her having made up little or no distance a small not unattractive black man with slightly greying hair he was breathing hard and his face glistened with perspiration it embarrassed him to be out chasing his wife so he ran like a husband embarrassed to be out chasing his wife people on the block took bets as to how long she would run or whether mr sneed would ever catch her naw man he wont catch that woman a little squat man said thiss been going on for months and never seed him catch up to her yet the little squat man leaned back against the traffic meter and took a long swallow of pepsi cola with obvious satisfaction once mr sneed asked his wife honey he asked why you run like that sometime just up and start running willie b she aswered i really dont know i really dont know except sometimes i get the feeling something or other is after me but where you running to woman when this happens after having crossed lake shore drive her body a matadors cape against a traffic of white faces she rested near the lake i cant explain it willie b no moren you can explain why you run after me i run after you because i dont want you to get hurt but honey she said smiling aint nothing you can do about that is there well lookahere im a man he insisted dont lets talk honey she asked her hands reaching down to rest upon his the running has made me tired there are days when lake michigan moves like an ocean it lashes against the stone ramparts out beyond the shore white peaks punctuate punctuate she couldnt tell him if she wanted to why she had to come down to the water periodically there were just these times when she had to run and it was the only place to run she couldnt tell willie b why she ran if he didnt know she couldnt tell him it made no sense to hurt  him she loved willie b maybe that was why she ranbecause she loved him yet there were times when she wanted to kill him kill him because he was helpless because he could not ask the right question the one which would allow her to break the curse her hand lay neutral on his neither hot nor cold neither giving nor receiving a strange numbness started somewhere in his left shoulder when she touched him all the way down to his fingertips he felt a needlelike tingle then nothingnothing that is but a fierceness of tears she tried to hide by turning her face from him sitting next to her with home behind them a house in which they had lived together for twenty years he thought for a moment that he understood what she could not say he stretched his legs cleared his throat his eyes set deep in their sockets preparatory to speaking youre a fool willie b she hissed youre a fool  a  his eyes dropped and watched a gull hover above the water then skim along the surface dipping its face into the splashings he said i was going to say something but what can i you think im a fool a cool breeze started to blow between them we should go before you catch cold you want to know why i know why woman he cracked and was immediately sorry it didnt do no good for them to hurt each other i believe you do willie she said thoughtfully and thats the shame of it why you say that because aint nothing you can do about it but the blue and white car pulled up about forty yards behind them and a policeman got out and came down toward them when he was about six feet away he stopped and took out his pad and pencil he had a nervous grin on his face whats your name silence whats your name silence honey willie b said you get up and leave here right now you get up and leave here what am i goin get up and leave for willie b she demanded what am i goin leave for i aint got nowhere to go behind them an old white woman with thick blue veins in her legs was calling to her dog you naughty dog she cried oh officer officer the redfaced policeman turned sideways his right hand lingering on his revolver and gave the white woman an irritated growl officer i just wanted you to know it seems that my dog has urinated on your automobile its all right lady he said in tt u a rather flat voice which still did not conceal his nervousness he thought shit leave these black bastards alone thats what ill do go along lady its all right but try to curb that dog lady im sorry officer but if the dog cant run free here then its all right lady he repeated his right hand relaxed and was putting the pad into his back pocket man my name is willie b sneed he said getting up the tone of his voice had changed and the quickness of his movements frightened the policeman what dyou want to know for some people said a man was chasing a woman down here the policeman answered now there was defiance in his voice are you the two two what some people blocking traffic rested on his gun bob steele bob steele some white people it doesnt matter what color they were they said you were blocking traffic it matters man willie b said turning to his wife are you gon leave or not i aint goin nowhere man she said softly almost affectionately you came down here to hurt us man willie b said to the policeman i cant let you do that just come down the road and hurt people  look the policeman said taking one small step backwards im answering a complaint that there was a man chasing a woman thats all wow willie b worked his right foot hard against the ground his face twisted in thought he seemed to be searching for the right words man you owe us an apology without even thinking the policeman laughed almost involuntarily what did you say i got to have it man the policemans hands opened almost in appeal as he looked down at the woman who was still sitting on the ground how bad you got to have it nigger he yelled the pad and pencil landing near willie b the policemans legs spread wide he licked the comer of his mouth his right arm waving slowly out from his side his hand bent toward his gun bad enough willie said calmly i dont have time to apologize to no black son of a bitch like you two white people a man and woman came and stood next to the policemans car im outnumbered willie b thought these damn white people are going to waste us he wondered if mrs sneed was afraid i aint got time to be scared he told himself but can i reach him before he gets it out and pulls the trigger just a piece of him just a hand on him i dont care about nothing else he could already feel what seemed like a heavy weight in his chest he could feel all his strength dissolving his legs growing weak and the faint taste of something metallic in his mouth he heard himself say i got to get to him 
black communities
 all black studies programs should be relevant to the black community near the school and should in turn be supported by the black community  the association ahsa should act as a liaison between black communities and funding agencies  ahsa should compile a list of black scholars who need financial support for their community projects or their academic research  the association will edit a newsletter or a journal through which its activities should be known the confrontation at montreal cannot be honestly seen out of context with other events that helped to set it in motion for years the african studies association has been a white organization with token black representation that had little or no influence on the major decision affecting the organization the african studies association is not just a professional association its leaders perform other functions that directly or indirectly affect the lives and livelihood of africans and afroamerican scholars and students its annual meeting which brings together government officials journalists publishers foundation representatives businessmen scholars students and members of voluntary associations serves as a point of contact and a market place where jobs research funds ideas and information are exposed and exchanged its members are scholars whose research not only determines or influences at the very least the image of africa in america but also conditions the kind and scope of much of the written documentation available about the continent research completed by its members has provided background material for united states foreign policy decisions in africa for these reasons we deemed the asa annual meeting the proper forum for our demands in the absence of the president of ahsa dr nicholas d u onyewu of nassau community college and dr chike onwuachi of fisk university represented ahsa in all negotiations with asa the african peoples attending this conference demanded that the study of african life be undertaken from a panafricanist perspective this perspective defines that all black people are african people and reject the division of african peoples by geographical locations based on colonialist spheres of influence this demand joined the issue and offended a large number of the white scholars attending the conference they resented the projection of african people as a world people with a common cause and a common destiny more than anything else they resented the afroamericans being linked with the africans in africa the demands of the blacks attending this conference had exposed the neocolonialism that a large number of these socalled scholars had been practicing for years africa to them was a kind of ethnic plantation over which they reigned and explained to the world most of them even resented africans being considered authorities on africa the confrontation at montreal awakened them from their dreams specifically the african people who made up the black caucus wanted their demands to be the means of changing the ideological and structural bases of the african studies association as negotiations between the black caucus group and the asa board progressed it became clear that the demand for an equal number of black members of the board of twelve would be the most difficult demand for the old guard in asa to live with the asa executive board decided that perhaps they could offer three seats in addition to  the two already held by blacks the asa board was surprised when the two black members dr absolom vilakasi of south africa and dr elliott p skinner of columbia university supported the demands of the black caucus the offer of three additional african members was rejected this prompted the board to convene an assembly of the voting membership of asa to decide the issue probably the most crucial event in the threeday confrontation was the asa voting memberships rejection of the black caucus demands by a vote of  to  in its plenary session on friday afternoon it is of interest that the asa an organization of scholars whose prestige and output depends upon maintaining good relations with africans both in terms of gaining entry into african countries and obtaining reliable information for them would have permitted if for on other than political reasons their voting membership to go on record as having voted against minimal demands of african peoples people have argued in defense of the white asa membership that although a large number of them supported the demands they were affronted by the tactics of disruption and therefore could not in good conscience grant the blacks immediate representation on the board if this assessment is true then it raises a fundamental question of their ability to understand and evaluate societies or events occurring in those societies with which they disagree in principle the black caucus ahsa committee that negotiated with asa board consisted of africans west indians and afroamerican students and professors one of whom had been an asa voting member since its inception moreover the majority of the african visitors invited by the asa and the canadian african studies committee to attend the conference supported the substance of the black caucus demands the caucus concerns over the white domination of scholarly output on africa had been expressed by africans at two earlier international conferences of africanists at dakar indication of african support was initially voiced by gabriel darboussier a nationalist leader in francophone africa since the s and currently senegalese ambassador to germany darboussier was slated to deliver the keynote address for the opening session at which time the first statement of black demands were presented robert gardiner director of the united nations economic commission for africa actively participated in the caucus meetings and supported its demands by friday noon when the black caucus met with the invited african guests to clarify our position in french and in english they presented a written declaration of support which had been signed by most of the leading african participants leon damas of french guyana one of the three original negritude poets along with aime cesaire and leopold sedar senghor read the declaration of solidarity cited below we the undersigned participating in a joint annual meeting of the african studies association and the committee on african studies in canada in our capacity of guests of the latter in face of the incidents which confront the afroamerican participants and the asa usa note that the africanist congress held in dakar in december  strongly criticized the orientation of african studies in two resolutions adopted at the th and th committees we strongly reiterate the view that african studies as conceived within the context of colonialism and imperialist domination of the african continent have served exclusively to reinforce an ideology which serves their domination in the interest of foreign capital and to exploit the african continent k the question of the procedure tactics and ultimate objective of the black caucus was a pivotal issue in the eyes of the asa white membership any challenge to their authority that was not supported by the black asa voting members had no legitimacy however they misinterpreted an expression by some black africanists of nonsupport of tactics to also mean nonsupport of substantive issues what is the present status of negotiations between the black caucus and the african studies association in response to the compromise position proposed by the white radical caucus and approved by the asa membership the black caucus has decided that it will send  delegates who will represent the caucus and the ahsa on the  man committee provided that six blacks be appointed as interim members of the asa board of directors the radical caucus compromise proposal envisions the appointment of an ad hoc committee of  comprised of  whites and  blacks whose purpose would be to formulate plans for the total restructuring of asa our conditional acceptance reflects our suspicions about the compromise agreement these suspicions are based on two factors  the lack of guarantees of the compromise plan and some confusion about the selection of the blacks that will serve on the ad hoc committee and  the past experiences many of the members of the caucus have had with negotiations of this type in order to make our position in the matter clear the following letter was given to professor l gray cowan before we left montreal recognizing that the sentiment of the general membership of the asa annual meeting was in favor of the principle of equal representation on the assumption that the present asa board of directors will continue to function the ahsa executive committee has reached the following conclusion the ahsa demands equal representation be given to it on the present constituent board and contingent on that will submit a list of  names to serve on the constitutional committee the report of the committee headed by dr james l gibbs of stanford was distributed too late to have any effect on the conference this was a report from a committee on afroamerican issues appointed after the conference in los angeles this report answers some of the questions that were bothering black students and scholars at montreal it was of course too little too latebut at least it was a gesture in the confrontation at montreal the old order of the african studies association was challenged without compromise the existence of this organization is now contingent on whether it can meet this challenge creatively and respectfully first an attempt should be made to understand the genesis of the african and afroamerican concern for their history and their long fight to make it an acceptable study in schools and universities long before the recent discovery of africa by the academic community black americans were showing an interest in african history most of the courses in african history and lecture discussions were held in churches and community centers to the best of my knowledge these were the first courses in african history held in this country the challenge and confrontation that started at los angeles in october  and erupted into a dramatic climax in montreal in october  was a long time in the making in the time span between the conference in los angeles and the one at montreal what started out as a black caucus became the african heritage studies association this association intends to examine every aspect and approach to the history and culture of african people in this country and throughout the world further its members intend to project their influence into every organization that relates to africa and the people of african descent we will decide who is and is not an authority on our life and history and we will question black scholars as well as white ones we deplore the fact that so many people mainly white are gaining quick reputations as authorities on african people we suspect that this is a new area of academic colonialism and that it is not unrelated to the neocolonialism that is attempting to reenslave africa by controlling the minds of the african people further we suspect that this closely connected group of white authorities are attempting to control or direct the historical information relating to africa in a manner that will make africans believe that they are forever dependent on people of european descent and that the coming of the europeans to africa was in spite of the slave trade and the colonial system a blessing in disguise the intent of the african heritage studies association is to use african history to effect a world union of african people we do not believe that the closely connected group of white authorities on africa are interested in such a union in fact we think the idea frightens them ¦ because this means that they will lose their control over information  about africa they resent the idea of any black person taking it upon himself to question their authority and to examine their credentials that is precisely what the members of the african heritage studies association intends to do first they intend to ask for an entirely new approach to african history this new approach must begin with a new frame of reference n what and who are the african people we make no sharp distinction between the africans in africa and the people of african descent in other parts of the world this at once projects the possibility of a world union of african people first we will call for a new frame of reference in all matters relating to africa we reject the black africa because it presupposes that there is a white africa the term negro africa is offensive to us because there is no such thing as a negro this word grew out of the european slave trade and the colonial system and it fails to relate the people of african descent to land history and culture our original place or origins was africa and no matter where we live on this earth we are an african people our approach to african history and culture everywhere will be in keeping with this definition we intend to use history as a force for our liberation and as a basis of african world unity we depend on an honest and creative approach to history to tell what we have been what we are and what we still must be 
the henry o tanner exhibition
dear editor i was interested to note mention of the henry o tanner exhibition under art notes in the november issue of negro digest but i dont understand the meaning or intent of the comment the exhibit was not scheduled at any black museum i assume that because it was started at white initiative the frederick douglass institute together with the museum of african art would not be regarded as a black museum although its staff is  black it deals exclusively with african and afroamerican art history and culture and  of its attendance is black last year  washington school childrenpredominantly blackvisited its galleries or attended its extension programs it was the frederick douglass institute in the persons of carroll greene jr black and myself white which was responsible for the tanner exhibition the institute sponsored the exhibit raised some  to organize and circulate it persuaded the national collection of fine arts to assist us and have the opening at its great new museum arranged for it to be shown in major established museums in seven other cities under the auspices of the smithsonian institution travelling exhibition service and generated nationwide publicity for it see enclosed articles in the san francisco chronicle the national observer time magazine and in the major art magazines we felt that for tanner to be shown in such great american museums as the cleveland museum of art the detroit institute of art the carnegie institute in pittsburgh and the philadelphia museum would bring to tanner the reputation in professional art circles that he deserves he is not the first artist to whom such recognition has come late it was a large and costly show to organize and administer involving loans from many museums and individuals considerable sums for insurance etc it was not a show that a small new museumas most of the black museums are could properly receive accommodate or provide normal museum security for our own small museum even though it is fairly well established could not properly accommodate it and guarantee the security of the valuable paintingsfor which reason we asked the smithsonian to show it it drew the largest attendance incidentally that they have ever had at the national collection of fine arts enclosed is a copy of the catalogue a great deal of very hard work by a number of peopleboth black and whitewent into the preparation of the exhibition and catalogue and i think the show will prove to have been the most important one ever given to a black artist in america warren m robbins director frederick douglass institute of arts  history 
the november symposium
dear editor sam e anderson in your symposium the measure and meaning of the sixties and what lies ahead for black americans said a hell of a lot that has needed to be said for a long time so did joe goncalves i mean what are black nationalist writers doing writing for the new york times for instance why for the money there are black publications leroi jones ameer baraka illustrated for me the supreme irony of the situation when he wrote a letter to the n y times that was some jive act you pulled changing the title of my essay the piece i know you remember was called nationalism vs pimp art complaining that they had changed the title of his essay from nationalism vs pimp art to to survive the reign of the beasts  that was weak and impotent leroi should have expected that like joe goncalves said the white man is the intermediary he allows us to speak to each brother by way of him we will seek white approval are still being judged by white people we are not only still seeking white publishers but in the ads for black plays and on the jackets of books by black authors we still quote white critics black critics if they are approved or judged good by whites eg clayton riley i think s e anderson captured the essence of the sixties when he said our militant intellectuals our militant activists our militant politicians still have much allegiance to and fear ofwhite america    our present movement is passionately caught up in the moral political and cultural decadence of white america yes the sixties have left us aware of our blackness the sixties have also left us with much confusion for example the sixties produced the soul movement the black muslims who are totally against the manifestations of soul also became prominent during the sixties i sincerely hope that during the seventies our black writers and thinkers will deal with these and other ambiguities in the black movement so that we can get on with the business of going wherever we as a people decide to go roy mjohnson new york n y 
sorry to discomfort you chauncey warringham hildredthlll esq
we know how distasteful it is for you to be reminded that most americans who resemble you are secondclass citizens we know you are the exception after all your parents were professional people who brought you up in a stable middleclass neighborhood you were integrated from elementary school through university and you are the only negro holding down a job like yours in a white firm yes we understand and we sincerely regret embarrassing you with all these demonstrations and freedom songs and sitins and boycotts we are sorry that because you look like us white people tend to lump you together with us however we ask you to endure the painful situation out of charity for those not so fortunate as you we recognize that this might not appeal to you especially but we feel that our concerted efforts to attain genuine freedom of opportunity and movement for all americans now are in the national interest ultimately we believe that a truly free america is an america of unsurpassable strength it is even possible that your children will be the immediate beneficiaries since they have a better education than most and are best qualified to accept the jobs which civil_rights pressures are open ing up so have patience mr chauncey warringham hildredth iii the battle you are watching with such great aloofness sir is really your own
