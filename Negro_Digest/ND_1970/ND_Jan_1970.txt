how to end colonial domination of black america
by joseph hannibal howard iii
is well known that few of the psychologi£ cal and sociological studies of afroamericans have been done by blacks themselves however what is perhaps more significant few of the studies by black scholars have reflected a world view clearly different from their white counterparts this brief essay is an attempt to suggest what the foundations of such a perspective or frame of reference may be our efforts to create a productive and clear frame of reference are impeded by the fact that there is little if any meaningful theoretical work being done in american psychology and indeed in amer « ican social science in general the system maintenance connotations of parsons socalled theory of social action is clearly antitheti cal to the interests of the black community in addition to being needlessly unintelligible it has been nevertheless the only serious attempt to give coherence to an otherwise unrelated aggregate of studies the only unifying themes discernible have been a reification of logical empiricism as method and as frantz fanon has said a unilateral declaration of the normative value of western culture  the minnesota empiricist approach to the universe is both myopic and most importantly for our purposes ahistorical this is to be expected in a country more concerned with social engineering than with human development the study of the socalled negro american which has become so fashionable among white scholars in recent years has suffered because of the narrow definition of psychology and because of the provincial insistence that the study of the black man in the americas can only be undertaken within the national boundaries of the united states consistent with this point of view has been the definition of the afroamerican and other third world peoples as a minority problem this myopia may be a perceptual defense against the fact that the white population is a minority on the planet by approximately four to one even if one excludes the intermixtures to correct this situation we must look beyond the narrow conception of psychology and beyond the boundaries of the black community in america a small but suggestive body of literature supports the enlargement of our view hopefully more thorough analysis and experimentation in the future will confirm our brief and tentative suggestions when a sister or brother fries his hair or bleaches his skin this has traditionally been called selfhatred behavior following the work of kurt lewin  in the current resurgence of black nationalism this is referred to as the oreo phenomenon it is likely that such a person will be referred to as negro rather than black but when the wife of general ngygen cao ky has plastic surgery done on her eyes to make them less slanted as some  asian women do annually it is scarcely noticed in the black community both of these attempts to become more beautiful are of the same order of phenomena for they are both attempts to become more europeanlooking both are manifestations of what my colleagues and i call the colonized mentality there are many similarities in the behavior of third world people which have not been given as much attention as the differences there have also been consistent approaches to the study of minority peoples which invite our reinterpretation undoubtedly nothing has been so thoroughly studied as the intelligence of nonwestern people contained in shueys  survey and other reviews of the literature on afroamericans are hundreds of measurements of black iqs not until klinebergs well known study in  did american psychologists begin to tire of attempting to validate the myth of black mental inferiority what is significant about these numerous ethnocentric and futile efforts is that at the same time these studies were being done the mental abilities of thousands of africans were being meticulously measured in all parts of colonial africa an annotated bibliography by andor  compiled for the south african government is filled like shueys with numerous studies seeking to establish the mental incapacity of africans in both the american and african research the europeans have frequently debated the intellectual ability of blacks as interesting as this debate has been we will decline to review it since none of this activity has changed the history of colonial domination in fact this research has helped to maintain colonialism both here and in africa by asserting the natives inability to determine his own destiny in zimbabwe or southern rhodesia as the europeans call it for example there were in   secondary schools for  europeans and two for  africans as the scholarly debate continued over whether or not the african had a brain the search for the black mans mind has been almost as old a quest in western social science as the search for his soul sec ond in number to the intelligence studies have been a series of personality investigations in both america and africa the oftenquoted psychiatric study by kardiner and ovessey  the mark of oppression and the tat study by karon  the negro personality both found massive amounts of suppressed hostility and low feelings of selfesteem both of these feelings kardiner argued led to fear  which may be manifested as self  abnegation caution and apologetic hehavior kardiner goes on to say that blacks become depressed because of the inability to ? express their anger at the source of their frustration karon also found that blacks make frequent use of denial and fear the direct expres  sion of aggression they often had the idea that some one is making trouble for you  according to kardiner and ovessey blacks  compensate their feelings of inferiority by use of denial humor flashy dressing drinking vituperative gossip disparagement gambling and explosive spending whatever that means they conclude their portrait by saying he tends to live from day to day because of an inability to plan  without commenting upon the rather familiar ring of their findings the assumption inherent in psychoanalytic theory that somehow the fault lies inside the individual should not be missed although kardiner and karons findings are familiar what are not so well known are the findings of de ridder in his the personality  of the urban african in south africa  in a tat type investigation sponsored interestingly enough by shell oil of south africa it was found that a the african personality is characterized by strong feelings of anxiety and insecurity b the african frequently turns to crime in particular he joins the socalled tsotist gangs which feed parasitically off the african ghettoes or townships c the urban african personality is a personality with strong latent aggression and insufficient moderation and control d there is a strong american influence on the slang language of the gangs e there are trends towards exhibitionism a feeling of being discriminated against general suspicion of europeans outspokenness and criticism of urban policy although it is not difficult to imagine that the african in south africa feels discriminated against since he lives on reservations called bantustans must carry a pass at all times and is subject to indefinite arrest it is hard to imagine de ridders surprise at his own findings when he says that these urbanized communities seem to develop a being discriminated against type of comp»ex with the result that their general perception has become so biased than in many instances they apperceive wellmeaning european motives in a totally wrong light  as interesting as the south african study is what is more remarkable are the findings on other colonized people in widely different parts of the world studies by doob  found considerable hostility and resentment to ward europeans among the luo ganada and zulu peoples of africa as well as among jamaicans doob noted that this tendency was particularly pronounced among the more educated natives studies of american indians by havinghurst and neugarten  kluckhohn and leighton  and leighton and kluckhohn  found great discontent and hostility socalled acculturation studies of other indian groups such as the ojibwa hallowell  caudill  the chippewa barnouw  and the wisconsin menowini spindler  consistently show the negative impact of western culture on the personality dynamics of these people as revealed by projective tests for example cheyenne children tended to see the external world as hostile alexander and anderson  furthermore studies of native and foreignborn chinese by abel and hsu  showed that americanborn chinese display a high incidence of adjustment problems and greater anxiety when compared to those born in china one of doobs conclusions was that the less the contact between nonwestern people and europe the better the impact upon the natives an important exception being where the indigenous culture is similar to the invading colonizer one of the most provocative findings in the kardiner and ovessey study was the rorschach analysis done independently by goldfarb he found that  per cent of the blacks studied tended to perceive mutilated human bodies or parts of bodies in the ink blots these findings were the same as those of devos and miner  in a sample of algerians it should also be noted that algerians who lived in the city casbah thus having more contact with the french showed this type of projection with much higher frequency than the portion of the sample living in the countryside similar findings have been noted in the samples of japanese immigrants to america also studied by devos  although there may be deeper levels of interpretation these findings again point to the existence of massive amounts of suppressed rage the findings may also suggest the projection of feelings about the mutilation of the ego under condition of domination how can we account for the universality of these findings in such widely scattered places and among such culturally and racially different people clearly the genetic explanations so favored by racist sectors of the scientific community past and present are ruled out by the wide genetic differences among the samples it is unlikely also that the members of the samples all have the same personality therefore the explanation must lie in the similarity of the social situa tions in which each of the peoples studied find themselves and the devastating impact that those social relations and processes have upon their being this impact produces the colonized mentality which was formerly said to be the selfhatred phenomena in minority groups obviously dominated men hate their oppressors as well as themselves an important question in all this is how the massive amount of hos  tility and resentment is handled by the personality and by the social institutions of the native these responses are perhaps most clearly seen among those who have been more colonized than anyone else those who have physically survived the most brutal system of slavery in the history of manblack people in america we have tended not to look at black history as the history of resistance to colonization because it appeared that slavery was a relationship between individual slaveholders and slaves or landlords and sharecroppers rather than essential social relations between metropolitan white society and colonial black society in which the rapid development of the former society occasioned the veritable destruction of the latter society  colonialism is the aggression at all levels physical and cultural by one society or group of societies  upon another such that the existence of the colonized is subjugated to the survival of the colonizer it is a system as fanon says of organized domination where racism is but the most visible aspect of the systemized oppression of a  people  our former culture once living and open to the future became closed fixed in the colonial status    the social group i militarily and economically subjugated is dehumanized in accordance with a polydimensional method to accomplish this of ii course the colonized must be removed from history not just from the historical records published in metropolitan europe but from the process of history itself this removal from history as albert memmi likes to say is the most serious blow suffered by the colonized    the result is the destruction of the natives own systems of reference and he attempts because nothing else is left to immitate the oppressor and thereby to deracialize himself i                     j the united states j i of i america i my country tis of thee i bitter land of bigotry i of thee i weep i anon i this is the deeper meaning of selfhatred selfdoubt as clark  and frazier  have often noted blacks express their feelings of inferiority by over identification with the white society and the rejection or perhaps more acurately the negation of themselves the overdriven quest for status ambivalence about personal identity the creation of social and religious myths supermasculinity or the swaggering bravado i like to call the pimp syndrome all of these are attempts to deal with the severe ego destruction undergone by colonized man these compensations are of course by no means confined to the american black man for example the popular press recently noted that general ky changed his appearance in order to win over more of his own people gone is the dashing captain midnight look the tailored black flying suit violet scarf pearl handled  to maostyled suits often these various ego compensations are unsuccessful and the result may be severe aberrations of the personality such as schizophrenia note in light of the previous remarks the productions of the following psychotics studied by myers and yochelson  r e is a yearold who had an acute schizophrenic reaction after being inducted into the army i am not black or white but i am red  i am john j anthonys son i am  white looks at his hands no black black used to be white tried to bleach myself burning my skin with a flame thrower in tokyo j w was hospitalized when he presistently reported dreams to the police in which he saw colored women having white babies with wings he maintained that he was born in germany and that he had no negro blood in him  he claimed people had put camphor and asafetida in his blood and caused him to turn black a patient whom i tested diagnosed as a severe neurotic gave the following response to the blank white card number  on the thematic appreciation test after some hestitation she said this is a special white board and it has special powers and if you touch it you can become the same color as the board and its meant for people who dont like the color they are if you touch it it not only changes your skin color but also your eye color and hair color so if youre puerto rican or a negro or a chinaman you can touch this board and be a blond blueeyed caucasian there is often continuity between socalled normal and pathological cases one is able to see perhaps more clearly in the extreme cases the tendencies latent in more organized personalities for example note this comment by a schizophrenic black male in speaking about his peers in the hospital he said some of their mothers must have been direct descendants of an uncivilized section of darkest africa  weaver  in studying normal black children recorded how these children recollected having first discovered that they were negroes child  i can remember when i was real small how children would be drawn away from me by their mothers and told that i was a black african cannibal and that black was evil child  a small child came over and called me a nigger having lived in an allnegro town all my life i had never been called a nigger like that before i thought something terrible had happened to me of course i knew that i was another color but i was proud of our people until that time these comments by children remind us of the terrible impact which the school as an institution makes upon black children grier and cobbs  are very correct when they say that the school evaluates the entire being of the black child when he enters and not just his competence to a black child all intellectual activity is thus alien to him the severest impact is upon the black male for it

an introduction to the poetry of aime cesaire
by judith gleason
upon a time this world was entirely tropical things took root thirsting downwards into the soil those ancient trees surged upwards into the lifegiving light this intense double verticality ceased in certain areas as slowly the cold came on ages later the ice receded and that cool customer known as western man began to expand his dominion over the things of this world those parts which had remained climactically more or less the same were stunned one morning by a cry from the beach les blancs debarquent the whites are landing so the french poet arthur rimbaud heard it and turned away from the dances in which he had been somewhat guiltily engaged hating himself for the mauvais sang inherited from his blueeyed gallic ancestors he  nevertheless then made poetically the decision which would eventually lead to his abandoning of the spurious magic of poetry for trade  one might imagine that negritude was born that moment on the beach sometime during the early summer of  when the boy  from charleville spent his season in hell at least he foresaw the process it was his metier the whites are landing the cry is echoed in aime cesaires poetic pageant commemorating the rebel who led his country to consciousnessofitself because the  whites really did land the blacks whether africanborn or stranded on islands in the caribbean or crowded into city slumsmust thrust down their roots and strive again for the sun this process for which cesaire takes poetic responsibility seems historically inevitable now but when in  at the age of  cesaire left paris for his native martinique the poem he wrote about this decision made cultural history cesaires location on that island is what distinguishes his poetry from that of his predecessors among the french symbolists and surrealists from that of his contemporaries of african origin his geographical positiona moral position a rhetorical stanceis the first metaphorical premise of his poetic work the island is the eye of a storm of imagesrocks swamps bays caverns bluffs shingles corals tides breakers foams ships wrecks wrack heats winds stars migrating birds trees flowers insects especially fireflies reptiles birds of prey predatory fishstagnations disasters and profusions whose tropical turbulence is recorded seismographically within the volcanic core of the self and thrown out again to be reflected sidereally on the brink of beingin the transcendental world of dawn nostalgia and wild surmise in soleil serpent for example a poem from his first collection les armes miraculeuses  the lie islandwith its subjective variant oeil eye and its transcendental counterpart soleil sunis king morpheme in the sightsound sequences of the key first second and final lines soleil serpent serpent oeil fascinant mon oeil the motive is repeated at gradually increasing intervals along this first line to erupt as dlles at the break in line twoas an awkward extra syllable in the last line of the poem that rarest essence wrested by poetry from despair is contained in the word bresil again placed at the cesura but this time as the crest of a perfect alexandrine the position of the morpheme lie strives for symmetry for in this poem the mood is basically optimistican affirmation in present participles of the perpetuality of the poetic process of transformation each thing is caught in the process of becoming something else now in a later poem the movement of lie and its variants would define an irregular jerky curve the locus of metaphors being imitated typographically and reinforced by staccato rhythms short parallel constructions and explosive sounds note that the poet in soleil serpent is characteristically thunderstruck but he survives voraciously in tiptop form if cesaire is an island poet leopold sedar senghor a cofounder of the negritude movement in literature is just as emphatically a part of the main interrupted only superficially by periods of french residence senghors connections with the continent of africa are as unbroken as the cadences of his verse which is to say that europeanized as senghor is he can revive the old ties easily in celebrating an aristocratic african heritage of dignified labor and rhythmical repose senghors stophes gradually uncover strata of feeling and historyhis negritudebeneath the sands and clays of the luminous countryside where he grew up where he now rulesas president of the republic of senegal but cesaires island is a volcanic surge of rock pitted with vegetation incessantly licked away by wind and sea his return is an ironic affirmation of that original sundering of man from nature which his family knew alltoohistorically as kidnapping and enslavement cesaires is the turbulent poetry of the spiritually dislocated of the damned his images strike through the net only in surrealist dreams can he reveal the unbroken sonorities of the sky with the passing of time on the island the famous return has become a refusal to abandon an intractable impoverished place where for  years he has maintained the ironic power voted him as deputy and mayor of a department entirely governed by the french independence having touched africa is one storm that has seemingly passed his island by and cesaire is bitter about this feeling that his nottoocourageous countrymen have sold their birthright for a mess of potage there is something of the henri christophe about him but unlike that tyrant of haitis history the hero of cesaires recent play the poets citadel is built of words not stones and his exactions confined to the aggressiveness of language cesaires is the black_power of the imagination to a younger generation of african poets like tchikaya utamsi it is cesaire rather than senghor who is negritudes true chief of state cesaire is similarly regarded by those who care for surrealist poetry his is a late vigorous manifestation of the freedoms and aspirations of revolutionary art early recognized by andre breton as la route royale cesaires poetry has continued to blast its way through the stultifying thickness of things long after the movement itself has become a forgotten bore a surrealist prophet of the strong breed cesaire is mosaic in his ability to perform real miracles with language because grounded in the historical sufferings of a chosen people his is an angry authentic vision of the promised land but his visionary landscapes would lack their fierce precision had not nature itself tried his descriptive powers to the breaking point which is again to say that the relation between his images and his environment the ecology of his poetry cannot be ignored open almost any book of good caribbean writing the fever had left him weak but it had also heightened his consciousness of the new environment into which he had moved with the morning mists vanishing it was as though a veil had been torn away from the face of a primeval landscape the swamp carpeted with weeds buffalo grass water lilies and saffron spread out in wide and flat infinities beyond the public road this burnt brick road with its verging grass had been built up high with a deep ditch on either side and it twisted like a red snake    it was the dry season and the earth had been grilled a parched brown by the sun the few clumps of blacksage ants bush and wild coffee which had survived the heat looked like leprous scars    hector turned around and looked out on the reefs behind the village coconut palms  grew thickly there and their fronds interlocked and formed a huge canopy above the massed undergrowth the wind has pressed against their slender trunks so insistently that many of them were bent like old mens backs birds were flying from the foreshore towards the rice fields behind the reefs pairs of curlews and spurwings and screaming parakeets cranes flapping their bleached wings lazily and above them all the wild ducks and red herons this is an environment so saturated with the energy of growth that it seems to sap the narrative strength of the fictionwriter diverting him into descriptive passages and thence into the grander conceptions of philosophy while his characters languish in their backyardspart caricature part cosmic force yet scenes such as these redolent of myriad species generate images as luminousand numerousas the fireflies these are lightning conductors by which the passions of the caribbean poet are naturally grounded when breton talks about the movement of revolt which corresponds to a friction of leaves in a forest or about the sudden aboresences of his desires his projected landscape is annihilated by its own generality and without the vehicle the tenor cannot hold in cesaires caribbean poetry all the species are invoked by name and his passion exfoliates in catalogues from the groin of the sacred mapou tree the fragile fruit of liberty depends orchids push up their gentle heads of tortured souls cassia trees convey nostalgia baobabs the clumsy strength of those who have been spiritually dwarfed bamboos rise along the road of childhood reminiscence the ceiba manifests the knotty struggle of man with his destiny the hibiscus is the sudden burst of a visionary eyeball everything on that island is emblematic each tree occasions an explosion of the imagination this forest of innocence harbours the tree of life there is nothing exotic about such a landscape when you live in it it is inescapable rather than the source of escape set in motion by cesaires angry will it becomes an intentional landscape his rocks project from the deluge like crinkly black heads under the relentless eye of the sun his towns ships shores and swamplands deteriorate his sharks and scorpions destroy his flowers exude a venomous sweetness according to an unremitting retaliatory law this is no paradise it is a punishment which will continue until the moral order has been set right as for the sweeter the grander potentialities of existence derived from the primary images these are synthetic products of the poets imagination his monsters they inhabit the brief glorious lies wherein we stretch our cramped limbs before they herd us down to the hold again but the birth of such convulsive beauty becomes progressively more difficult the title of cesaires latest collection ferrements presses itself syntactically the mature cesaire is sometimes far closer to stephane mallarme than to rimbaud in nous savoir for example the delicate balances the intricacies of sound and syntax defy 
shackles or irons reflects a spiritual as well as a political condition those triumphant seasons of the rarest essences in which the poet once rejoiced are either attributed to others like eluard or various freedomfighters or they are stillborn this psychological difficulty extranslation the temporal suspension of the infinitive in the title is reinforced by the ambiguity of the conjunction in the colloquial first phrase the typography reiterates the suspension a removal bitterly accentuated by the historical past tense of the verb in the fifth line yet borne along by subtle varia tions on the closed vowel sound w the fragmentary music rights itself condenses itself into two short stanzas in the first of these some impossible conditions are removed by negation to allow for the flowering of the superb image in the last it is an image of an inexpressible essence bound by a free activity of the spirit which is itself contained and accorded only a concessive potentiality to ward off disaster was the cahier which first revealed this island prometheus of tongue unbound and it is this poem for which cesaire will be remembered a masterpiece of cultural relevance every bit as important as the wasteland its remarkable virtuosity will ensure its eloquence long after the struggle for human dignity has ceased to be viewed in racial terms it is part of the poets alchemy to turn anyone who reads the cahier into a blackman with 
the cahier dun retour au pays natal  is in many ways the obverse of that little lyric nous savoir  narrow at the apexa single impulse projected over sixtysix pagesthe cahier is the entire black african world broad at its base here it is not a question of unheard melodies but rather of what kind of talk various poetic styles are here recognized as excrescences of various forms of selfdeception the cahier dramatizes a young poets search for moral integrity and its appropriate style it is the blackmans special history at once theres a contradiction such an identification is at odds with the poets purpose but the poet must always be at odds with himself in such matters for the poetic image if successful is like a short circuit the connection is transsubjective and immediate with the path of greater resistance shunted off in cesaires recent play henri christophe sums up the argument if theres one thing which irritates me every bit as much as the propaganda of the slavers its to hear our philan thropists clamor in the best spirit without doubt that all men are men and there are neither whites nor blacks    who will ever be convinced that all men i say all without privilege without particular exoneration have known deportation the slave trade slavery the collective depreciation to the bestial the total outrage the vast insult that all have receivedlaid on the body the face the allnegating spit we alone madam you understand me we alone the negroes at the bottom of the pit then thats how  understand it at the extreme bottom of the pit thats where we cry from there we aspire to the air to the light to the sun some have claimed that christ was a blackman more likely job was the first section is a series of prose poemssomewhat in the manner of pierre charles baudelaires crepuscules these passages are of varying lengths sometimes a long paragraph sometimes a couple of lines that dont quite have the energy to form a complete sentence each passage is introduced by the short phraseau bout du petit matinwhich means in its own elusive way something long dawned and short of noon these little prose poems convey stultification of life on martiniquesometimes by cancerous descriptions of its landscape sometimes by catalogues of the miseries of its inhabitants sometimes by boyhood reminiscences the hovel unpeeling its roof to the wind the bed they all slept in with its paws of kerosene cansironic cradle of his island race these remembered scenes are interrupted by the notion that has been plaguing the poet all along he must save his conscience by leaving paris partir leave but what would he do there exactly what he really wants to do become a sorcerer of words and island images i would say river i would say tornado  i would roll like frenetic blood on the slow current of the eye of words etc and behold he is there finding death where he had expected marvels he was on the wrong track but with the resilience of youth he recovers himself confidently breaking forth in a whitmanesque poem of identification not only with his own island but with all the antilles with everywhere that his people have dispersed his imagination then seizes upon the image of toussaint louverture prisoner among the snows of the jural mountains the first afrocaribbean martyr for freedom a hero with whom he now feels entitled to identify and he improvises an ode in black and white a cascade of short phrases like a waterfall there is a tension in cesaires work between the horizontal poetry of fraternal affiliationa series of identifications of happenings of images in the process of transformationand the vertical poetry of reductionattempts to get at the truth by a series of angry stabs through the falsity of things in later poems this tension often produces the effect of a stalemate 
uprooting racism and racists in the united states
by james and grace lee boggs
march  one month before the racist murder of dr martin_luther_king jr the presidents commission on civil disorders headed by illinois governor otto kerner issued its monumental report charging white racism with responsibility for the degraded conditions of blacks in this country since the report appeared white racist hostility towards blacks particularly among white workers has increased not decreased polls indicate that today fewer whites believe that blacks are the victims of discrimination and that in fact a growing number of whites believe blacks are the villains rather than the victims the obvious contradiction of the kerner report is that after diagnosing whites as responsible for racist oppression of blacks the report goes on to make recommendations for the treatment not of whites but of blacks as we pointed out at the time it is like saying that the way to keep white sheriffs policemen ku klux klansmen white citizens councilmen minutemen birchites and other american fascists from lynching any more blacks is to put the blacks to work send them to school and build some new housing developments in the ghetto the victims are the ones who need rehabilitation the villains are not even acknowledged to exist w it is of course no accident that the kerner commission did not tackle the question of white racists first of all the white moderate responsible establishment americans in tom wickers words  who made up the commission are not in the habit of using their power to expose or confront the crimes and barabarism of white racists any more than the white moderate responsible germans of hitlers days were in the habit of exposing or confronting the crimes and barbarism of german racists note for example how little appears in the white moderate responsible american press today about minutemen kkksmen and birchites contrasted to the constant scare headlines about black_panthers and other black militants moreover the kerner commission including as it did such pillars of capitalism as the senior officials of north american rockwell corp litton industries general mills corp bank of america etc could hardly have been expected to undertake the kind of probe of white racism which might have led to its roots in capitalist economics and ideology so from the outset the commission made it clear that its aim was to attack the root causes of racial disorder not the root causes of racism it seems a minor difference but those planning a career in journalism should pay it special attention the one line of attackagainst the root causes of racismleads ultimately as we shall show to a revolution against the system the otheragainst the root causes of racial disorderleaves the door wide open for a counterrevolution against those making a revolution against the system for it should be obvious to anyone not blinded by racism that the root cause of racial disorders in northern cities over the last five years is the revolt against racism if blacks were ready to submit to racism there would be no racial disorder however the revolt against racism today is going off in a variety of directions because of the absence of a clear understanding within the black movement of the roots of racism to break the chains that bind them a people must understand the forces that forged and maintain those chains in the beginning the first thing we have to understand is that racism is not a mental quirk or a psychological flaw on the part of individuals racism is the systematized oppression by one race of people of another in other words the various forms of oppression within every sphere of social relationseconomic exploitation military subjugation political subordination culture devaluation psychological violation sexual degradation verbal abuse etctogether make up a whole of interacting and developing processes which operate so normally and naturally and are so much a part of the existing institutions of the society that the individuals involved are barely conscious of their operation the racist in a culture with racism is therefore normal fanon this kind of systematic oppression of one race of people by another was unknown to mankind in the thousands of years of recorded history before the emergence of capitalism  years ago prior to that time racial prejudice was not unknown for example chinese in the rdcentury bc considered yellowhaired greeneyed people in a distant province as barbarians in ancient egypt the ruling group which at different times was red or yellow or black or white usually regarded the others as inferior t slave oppression had also existed in earlier times but this was usually on the basis of military conquest and the consequences eg the ancient greeks and romans did not develop a theory of racial superiority to rationalize their right to exploit their slaves just as mankind prior to the rise of capitalism had had no previous experience of an economic system which naturally and normally pursues the expansion of material productive forces at the expense of human forces so it had never known a society which naturally and normally pursues the sytematic exploitation and dehumanization of one race of people by another an organic link between capitalism and racism is therefore certainly suggested the parallel between the rise of capitalism and that of racism has been traced by a number of scholars the portuguese who were the first europeans to come into contact with africans at the end of the th and beginning of the th centuries treated them as natural friends and allies they found african customs strange and exotic but they also found much to admire in their social and political organization craftsmanship architecture etc at this point the chief technological advantage enjoyed by the europeans consisted of their navigation skills and firepower both by the way originally derived from the chinese in the next four centuries these two advantages would be used to plunder four continents of their wealth in minerals and people and thereby to increase the technological superiority of europeans by leaps and bounds africa was turned into a hunting ground for slaves to work the land of the west indies and the southern colonies which had been stolen from the indians as the slave trade expanded its enormous profits concentrated capital in europe and america for the expansion of commerce industry and invention while in africa the social fabric was torn apart in the americas the blood and sweat of african slaves produced the sugar tobacco and later cotton to feed the refineries distilleries and textile mills first of western europe and then of the northern united states the more instrumental the slave trade in destroying african culture the more those involved directly and indirectly in the slave traffic tried to convince themselves and others that there had never been any african culture in the first place the more brutal the methods needed to enforce slavery against rebellious blacks the more the brutalizers insisted that

friend of mine took me to hear a jazz musician named sun ra who played space music the music was a little like the sound of ornette coleman but further out outer space music close to the eeee of an electric drill at the center of a harsh trumpet my cold cleared up in five minutes in i the arkestra moved to new york and quickly established itself as the main band of the subunderground providing the energy and directions for what later became stylized forms of new music in fulfilling this mu sicosocial function the arkestra u under the direction of sun ra served as the training grounds for many of the starspharaoh sanders marion brown  who  emerged from the underground jazz movement and directly influenced john coltrane to record t ascension and his later works the nucleus of the arkestra under sun ras guidance has continued to provide the impetus musical directions and possibilities that have helped shape the major playing styles and general musical approaches to their individual instruments    and in john gilmore tenor sax pat patrick baritone sax and marshall allen alto sax the arkestra has the forerun t ners of the styles of the sixties the versatility of the members of the arkestra as very competent multiinstrumentalists has helped expand the range of sounds now being incorporated into the new music and the arkestras stay in new york has been a breath of fresh air and an infusion of a newer and more relevant lifesense and style to the music scene reaching out in its influences to touch all areas of musicjazz classical electronic hardrock and popular    and as evo remarked sun ras group is what happens when astrology meets technology in the st century the musical progression of sun ra has been the building up of the arkestra and its evolution through what is termed the solar mythscience astroinfinity power hieroglyphic  solar nature  immortality solarscience and solarnature phases of astroinfinity music this process has involved a calculated correlation of the arkestras musical growthdimensions with its size and instrumentation from its standard plus memberstructure to an extended piece arkestra that performed a concert of

over  albums the early music of the arkestrajazz by sun ra supersonic sounds jazz in silhouette the futuristic sounds of sun rarecorded in the fifties confronts the then ac r cepted and popular sounds with a vigorous and revitalized concept of music the expansiveness in the voicings and the clean dynamic ensemble work create a fluent snappy bouyancy that is a noticeable departure from the structure

black studies the work to come
by ronald williams 
the most part  try v the argument concern ing the validity of black studies belongs to the past prestigious universities such as harvard yale berkeley and stanford are establishing programs to study the history and culture of black people and since these institutions usually point the way in american education universities with lesser reputations will undoubtedly follow there is no reason to expect a different trend because the subject happens to be black in some colleges black studies programs have produced curricula that are designed to provide students with functional skills to be used in the black community and others are structured along traditional academic lines these programs have been designed by faculty and students working jointly or have been created as a result of student pressure perhaps the only significant  question to be posed at this time is what kind of program an institution will develop and under what circumstances for black studies  is here to stay black studies in the university yale university press  a symposium held at yale university in november   presents the arguments for black studies and raises important questions concerning the direction this academic quest might take  in any discussion of black studies one naturally looks for the speakers to define the study and to suggest those subjects which seem  to fall within its purview several of the speakers have attempted to define what the black mans exclusive domain should be and to sug gest although not always clearly areas in which blacks and whites might be able to cooperate harold cruse is convinced that the  integrationist ethic has prevented blacks from developing their cultural expression the integrationist has been an oppressive mistress she recognized only one culture only one lifestyle and only one  way of viewing the tenuous arrangements that make up our world she demanded that blacks become white in the only way they  could which is to say that they had to see smell taste touch and hear as anglosaxons in order to express and reaffirm a white ethic  by making such uncompromising demands on all foreign or different cultures the anglosaxon view has reigned supreme thereby perpetu ating its economics politics and culture for cruse blacks have only one way out of the integrationist tyranny and that is through  a cultural nationalism which must form the basis of black studies blacks must determine their literary standards develop their theater and raise and discuss questions relevant to the black experience elsewhere cruse has pointed out what happens when editorial boards of magazines and theater groups are integrated with whites he has argued that in integrated groups blacks are not encouraged or permitted to seek those themes and expressions which reflect their unique historical moments frequently blacks are told that to explore and to express their experience in a style and language that are peculiar to their group is separatism and consequently bad on the other hand other nationality groups have developed their own theater and journals to discuss those issues which best define their interest cultural nationalism allows blacks to come to terms with the distinct character of their lives in a way in which only they can but cruse also seems to see blacks and whites eventually collaborating in artistic and intellectual endeavors black studies may make this cooperation possible its social function is not to replace one particularism with another particularism but to counterbalance the historical effects and exaggeration of particularism toward a more racially balanced society a society which would include expectations regarding the democratic creed p  obviously the american society must be transformed in such a way that cultural groups will cooperate from positions of strength regardless of how cooperation comes about which is open to speculation the implication is that the races eventually will work together in matters of culture perhaps the implication is that an american character will be forged out of the experience of the existing cultural mix prior to considering the nuts and bolts of black studies maulana ron karenga wants to change the white cultural view that informs all that is taught it is necessary therefore to alter the frame of reference in which education takes place to redefine terms and to reinterpret many words and experiences karenga views the white culture as esteeming all that is white while negating all that is black the black frame of reference provides a positive structure in which black people study their experiences thus creating values and procedures that are meaningful for them and their lives this frame of reference or positive attitude is further strengthened by redefining words black becomes a positive and beautiful word and white indicates    that which is not really happening    after closely examining cruses and karengas positions one observes a fundamental similarity both men see cultural nationalism a cultural selfdetermination as being central to the study of the history and culture of black people there would no doubt be differences resardine the direction and the particular emphases within the pursuit of these studies since cruse has written more and given his position in more detail we can more easily grasp the particulars of his thinking at this time karengas thinking and stance as to emotionalism inspiration and mythology need further elaboration before one can attempt anv kind of comparison in the political and economic arenas karenga seeks economic reparation from whites and demands that blacks determine their own political destiny his position seems to restrict blacks to making political decisions about blacks for a limited time  while being economically dependent upon whites karengas cultural nationalism does not go beyond political control of the black com  munity and a limited economic independence since whites will continue to determine the significant economic patterns within the black community and although he tells us what political thought and models are not to be used in the black community it is not clear what po  litical model will be used karenga as does cruse seems to see the coming of a kind of cooperation between whites and  blacks karenga encourages whites to create a civilizing movement among themselves i dont see us coexisting until  that power balance is achieved i can say that now but the intensity and quality of the struggle will really determine the relationship youve got to understand that that is why the civilizing orlets change it let me use a euphemismthe humanizing movement is so important if it works the intensity and quality of the struggle will be different than if it falls the makeup of the future depends upon the struggle itself for example me i am reallv only interested in love and study im not really interested in violence and stuff like that but here we are this is a violent world and i cant pretend i dont live in it that should be considered p  for both men the present requires that blacks occupy themselves with themselves and all that concerns them and that whites turn to themselves and to the long neglected task of confronting a pluralistic world and a pluralistic america but why should  expect whites to become humanized perhaps it is that after cultural nationalism has worked its wonder among blacks whites will come to respect their strength and will therefore be willing to cooperate with them yet it seems rather senseless to expect whites to change simply because blacks are the sole interpreters of their culture whites will still direct the important political and economic forces why should whites at this point in time decide to humanize themselves perhaps the answers to these questions may be found in the dialectics created by having two cultural views developing side by side i certainly do not know since these questions are crucial to the positions that implicity expect whites to change they merit serious consideration some black leaders who are organizing the black community seem to require a religious devotion of their followers it is not my intention to judge such organizational efforts the religious cultist has a long tradition within the black community there are few black people who have not been touched in some way by such figures as father divine and prophet jones the religious cult continues to play an important role among the poor and deserves serious study among the more affluent and better educated blacks the mystical leader has very little appeal and without the black middle class being involved i question whether these movements can create a unified black community it does appear that some of these movements are attempting to use faith and commitment as instruments to bring about total acceptance and submission to economic and political positions that are still in need of clarification one finds such arrangements where membership within the group determines ones politics economics and religion within tribal communities and we also read of their disintegration as africans attempt to enter the th century we must also doubt whether anyone who attempts to roll back the clock and refuses to enter the twentieth century will be successful among blacks for more and more blacks are entering colleges and universities and we do not find these young people affiliating with the cultist or strongleader movements perhaps nathan hares injunction deserves our careful attention we need to    stop being just expressiveand stop making everything we do a religion for if any organization excludes the young educated black because of its refusal to be clear about its politics and economic plans then i must seriously question its ultimate efficacy within the black community and i see such an organization as becoming one more cultist groupthat will eventually languish within the very misery that it hoped to overcome gerald a mcworter and nathan hare point to the ills in american education and suggest directions for black studies theirs is a shotgun blast that recounts that evils of white education and only broadly points to the path and work that awaits black studies perhaps that is all that can be expected at this time other voices attempt to place the black experience in a historical perspective the question for martin kilson is whether the afroamerican experience falls within the human experience his answer is yesit does examining history he discovers that blacks have committed crimes against blacks that blacks pursued and profited from black slavery and that blacks continue to exploit other blacks haiti is an example of the latter he takes exception to the notion that the black mans suffering cleansed him of all evil and at the same time endowed him with a special righteousness kilson understands the political motives that inspire some to define black as virtue and white as sin although he sympathizes with the black nationalists and their motives for stating their views in politically expedient terms his intellect rejects their position anyone seriously concerned with the black struggle in america has to relate to kilsons observations he does not permit the world to be seen and manipulated as in a never  produced hollywood western where the good guys wear black hats and the bad guys wear white ones his view of history intro  duces ambiguity which makes it difficult to judge the past nevertheless kilsons historical perspective forces us to grapple with  the past in an effort to understand it hopefully enabling us to better deal with the present kilsons way by far is the most difficult but it may be the only way sixteen papers were read at the yale symposium fifteen papers talked about and around black studies and these  voices were necessary if for no other reason than to place the defense of black studies and the need to rationalize  black studies behind us robert farris thompsons paper the sixteenth one will be remembered for his paper is black studies thompson unveils those artistic threads that connect africa with black america he not only discusses the racial attitude that has  suppressed african art in america but gets on with the job of describing afroamerican art and tracing its history in america in livingston county missouri henry gudgell an afroamerican carved a walking stick that is quite similar to tribal staffs found in west africa the afroamerican potters of south carolina produced distinctive ceramics that combined european and african influences from tidewater georgia to lafayetteville new york thompson shows us what black american artists have done he presents his material in a clear concise and thoroughly exciting manner i have always thought of art history as a dull undertaking something to be endured and seldom enjoyed in thompsons hands art history is enlightening and a pleasure to read the yale symposium was a necessary experience it is now behind us and all of us who are laboring in black studies have the awesome responsibility of setting to work in the end we all know that black studies is the work to come 
black pride some contradictions
by ann cook
have listened with excitement to plans that have been sketched by some very bright and dedicated black minds for an allencompassing   scc black not blackfront communications network the prospects of having a powerful black multimedia that transmits another set of values and the truth of what is happening and what must happen is encouraging after all we can not really expect the man who is the enemy to provide us with the tools that will spell his doom yet to get such a vast project into full operation will take many years in the meantime we need to take stock of our present predicament how far if at all have we moved psychologically and intellectually since the new black awareness began what values do we hold what values should we begin to embrace  many experts black and white are using newspapers and the airwaves to assess the plight of africans in this country and to direct us down the proper path to liberation i do not claim to be an expert mine will be a laymans opinion but then i do believe that it is the layman africans opinion that must be listened to more often by those who would liberate us for this evaluation two areas need comment the first area might be called white values in black face a most blatant and vulgar example of this was beamed to television viewers on like it is on sunday august   on a show featuring black models and black fashions i shall ignore the fact that most of the black models preferred to sell their blackness to white agencies that is another essay what really pained me was the elaborate fashion show of clothing in african prints and styles now i would be the first to admit that there is nothing sacred about most african cloth itself indeed much of what is pawned off to us as african prints has never seen africa but our turn to africa should hopefully be for the richness of its culture an awareness of which can enable us to smooth out the rough spots of what we have stubbornly held on to we would look to the heart of africa for a purge of decadent western values for a new philosophical and spiritual base in short for regeneration but what did these proud american african designers show us directly inspired by africa there was even a west african model making it all very african models slithered past the cameras in african print bikinis they wiggled by in hiphugging african print bellbottoms miraculously held up by the models pelvic bones and if enough western style sex was not marketed with those there were the moslem long dresses and coats that were transparent such irony recall the islamic codes for women caucasians especially the united states variety are noted for their ruthless destruction of the cultures of others whatever parts they can reach and their vulgarization of what remains are we so suicidal that we must destroy ourselves and for what the other examples to be mentioned of white values in black face are not as damnable and will probably sort themselves out in time both have to do with the tendency now to break away from white ac tivities and organize our own modelling the affair after that of the whites in other words it is the tendency to simply counter white activities instead of creating black ones as a response to the winter olympics a few years ago for example a group in new york organized black snow we also have black beauty contests but the format of the competition is haunted to the bone by atlantic citytiered  crowns queenly robes do african queens wear robes and all there are those who would argue that an abrupt departure from the american way would cost us converts perhaps so i will not argue that point here let us just hope that all who organize and partici  pate in the contests whether actively or passively understand the carbon copy nature of most of our black awareness activities as for the african fashions the first and by far the most treacherous of the white values discussed i can not be charitable at all the black designers selling blackness so cheaply must be loudly and roundly condemned the second area that seems to  need attention is one so pervasive that to attempt to localize or isolate examples leads to a certain amount of distortion properly we can label the area antiblackness or the subtle selfhatred of aware africans a not so subtle example of this antiblackness juts out at us from the words and actions of our latest crop of vanguard liberators once again as if history has taught us nothing we have become blackfronts taking money and orders from our great white fathers who amply reward us by giving us all the publicity we think we need as they make us sound tough and affectionately call ourtheir new leader a quintessential american old uncle tom has come back as a city slicker again we are being duped by people who tell us that the antiafricanismand i deliberately say  antiafricanism here and not antiblackness  that runs rampant throughout this world its poisonous fangs pricking even the most well meaning souls this problem of antiafricanism we are told must take a backseat to karl marxs priorities it is far easier to deal in that nebulous world than to turn inward and unite and build ourselves i will dare to go further even though i identify with the other colored peoples of this world since we all share a common exploiter and i know that being the majority of the worlds population we should unite to defeat this man i still have the sneaking suspicion that much of the third world embrace is yet another unconscious desire not to deal with africa itself and with ourselves as we finally must i heard a very passionate denouncement of the united states for its involvement in latin america by an american african when asked his feelings about us involvement in africa his face showed bewilderment what involvement the most fantastic irony that comes out of this new third world thrust is that again we are seeing more and more distinctly african young people walking around wearing indian headbands especially in new york remember the preblack awareness days me im part indian another more subtle antiafrican tendency is becoming apparent in the bush afro we do not mind wearing an afro if we have the kind of hair that can make a bush or if our straightening comb can help us out so again it is good hair afros that is really what afrosheen raveen and all the other complex kits of sprays are all aboutgetting the kinks out admittedly there is grave danger in bringing up the question of hair and skin color when we need more than anything else to become united and are finally moving in that direction and we also rightly fear that emphasizing this color contradiction will lead to a rejection of all but the most jet black and the kinkiest headed as the beauty symbols a reversal there is a clear and present danger that frank discussion of this contradiction can in fact be divisive but we cannot become truly unified until we sift out this problem although i do not subscribe to the belief that slavery and colonialism left us dehumanized far from it i do believe however that in the area of colorconsciousness we have been brutally scarred as i traveled through latin america during the summer of  the enormity of the antiafrican complex was dramatized i saw so many parallels to the selfhatred tendencies we know so well here somehow although intellectually we know better we suppose that language will make us different we assume that those africans in this hemisphere who were enslaved by the french or the dutch or the spanish or the portuguese would have been impressed with a different mentality from ours at least we feel they would certainly not have directly translatable phrases like those that are so much a part of our culture but no matter whether the language of the countries i visited was english french spanish dutch or portuguese there were phrases for good hair and for marrying light to improve the race as well as others we would immediately recognize here i noticed the same phenomenon in the speech of educated africans during my two years in africa your hair is your crowning glory a dear friend always warned me in panama a very prominent black man told me of his heartbreak when the mother of the girl he wanted to marry prohibited the arrangement chiding the girl for not having any ambition he was not a bum he was too dark eurobrazilians like many other  caucasian latin americans who claim to be color blind have intricate gauges to see just how african ones features really are there it is quite all right to have african blood if it does not show the more caucasian the person looks the more readily he will boast to a black foreigner of his negro blood i had one of the most amusing experiences of my life when i visited a prominent brazilian scholar and his wife in their home along with a white american couple in the course of that inevitable discussion about the race problem in this country the brazilian turned to me with his face beaming with pride ann he said im going to tell you something that will surprise you i waited my grandmother was a negro his face and gestures were saying to me now what do you think of that i looked at him warmly and said oh that doesnt surprise me at all it shows in your features he panicked no no no he shouted shaking his head furiously i dont have a single negro feature by now his entire body was in contortions shaking his finger in rhythm with the other movements he assured me not one and of course he had measured his skull and his nose and his lips as so many in the twilight zone do he hurriedly began to pull up his sleeves as he said of course we latinsthe sunyou know we get tanned i never said a word  the house fell absolutely silent in their white embarrassment i laughed like a sonofagun because these countless categories are set to label each african men in the twilight zone put vaseline on their hair and brush it to make it lay down one man in recife whom i would have sworn was just a plain white man told me of the care he has to take with his hair slicking it down the more african the man or boy the shorter the haircut the desire is to try to score plus marks in some category if the hair does not pass the test maybe the skin will or the nose or the skull shape and hopefully always the lips one successful mulatto businessman from surinam lamented african blood is so strong it just seems to come through anyway its stronger than any other blood in his case he pointed out he was only part african yet look at his features he moaned and in belem brazil one hears of a brilliant young female economist whose skin is very black my informant said that the young lady was sorry her hair would not bouffant she is by the way single in that land where marrying light to improve the race is indeed a seriously practiced doctrine this bright economist went shopping for a car and ordered one that was completely white inside and out including sidewalled tires she threw a tantrum when the car arrived not conforming to her specifications for four months she lay in the hospital after she seriously burned her skin trying to bleach herself with a soda solution she now walks around with white powder on her face and a blond wig on but many brazilian african women would not have tried to be beautiful since women as obviously african as that economist would normally have known that they did not stand a chance most would have resigned themselves to being very bright brazilians readily admit that the africans in brazil are by far the most intelligent members of the citizenry but can this young woman who tortured herself so completely to become white simply be dismissed as a mental case is she really exceptional or is it that her manifestations of her antiafricanism are the exception surely we are torturing ourselves here just as hazardously we sing im black and im proud but we are far from convincing to be sure the healthiest african minds i have met in this hemisphere belong to the socalled bush negroes of the interior of surinam some africans in paramaribo the capital city creoles they are called feel the bush negroes would be helped if they were referred to as the bush creoles thus making them a group mixed with that sought after european blood the djukas one of the bush negro tribes in the interior would not have been flattered at all by the offer from bukra slaaf the white mans slave when the djukas saw me in their villages invariably they pointed to my afro and praised it lavishly most of the djukas were without western education until recently because most villages refused to allow missionaries entry relatively isolated they have kept their values pretty free of western influences and unlike the brazilian african who has also retained much of the obvious traits of african culture the bush negro is very strongly attracted to africa and africans i was warmly received everywhere a ghanaian was given a thunderous reception when she visited there mothers tried to give her their babies to take back to africa a gesture not to be taken lightly since children are adored in their society it would have been an honor for the child one mother at stolemaneisland became very attracted to me as i became to her and her child upon my departure she tried to give me her son the child was without a doubt far better off there besides her symbols were a bit mixed up america is not africa i was honored as i was to be often throughout the trip by such warmth but i must sound an ominous note i  must report that cutouts of white models from european and brazilian magazines that flood latin america can now be found on the walls of a new djuka school everywhere else except in the interior of surinam even in urban africa we are having to convince ourselves that thick lips broad noses and kinky hair accompanying that nowacceptable black skin can be beautiful harry belafonte and lena horne have hastily been painted black and afros have been put on their heads the stereotypical aunt jemima still goes the way of the brazilian economist it is even argued and with much validity that african men are embracing the third world concept not only for ideological reasons nor to avoid the concrete task of organizing black people the suggestion is that third worldism provides a wider field for getting to a miss ann type without the caucasianworshipping africans real motive being detected this next and final point in the area of antiafricanisms is admittedly a very ticklish one it has to do with the practice of islam i speak of it very reluctantly because first of all some of the africans in this country whom i admire and respect tremendously are converting to islam second racist historians have through the centuries tried to change the map of africa making north africa an extension 
the sound of soul
by larry neal
garlands till  book the sound of  xt soul is primarily concerned with the sixties she has written an important book anybody seeking cogent information on soul music should check it out more books like this one are neededmore books that go into the music in even greater depths than this one and even with its obvious limitations this is an important book because black music particularly soul music is one of the most outstanding cultural forces operative in todays world and somebody has got to begin to confront the subject with the kind of seriousness attempted by sister garland in order to do this and make it useful to black people it is necessary that those who consider themselves intellectual architects of afroamerica look at the living culture in the most penetrating terms possible this means reaching deep inside of ourselves into concrete experience and shifting memory and giving as much weight to experience as we give to theory particularly the theories laid on us by the euroamerican black music demonstrates that culture is essentially a living reality many of us seem to think that black culture is something outside of ourselves some ancient magical force that we must go through all kinds of changes to obtain when in fact the culture is within allah and ogun are within    sprawling cities of kush the ritual and dahomey shines eternal song we carry these within us they are manifested in the living culture    we are the continuation of black memory our songs are the emanations of that memory our rhythms the force that drives that memory bessie smith sang that

rule b b king has more to tell me about the world that i can use than most poets and intellectuals here he is talking to phyl garland   blues is b b king yes and ive been a crusader for it for  years without this i dont think i could live very longnot that i think im goin to live a long time anyway but i dont think i could live even that long if i had to stop playin or if i couldnt be with the people i love so the people that have helped me so much  i couldnt live i try to give them a message i try hard how many of us are so dedicated to whatever it is that we do how many of us commit ourselves so thoroughly to our work how many of us link our work to the survival of both ourselves and our people sister garlands interview with b b king is one of the most penetrating pieces in the book because it basically concerns the man stripped down to his most human core and we learn so much about our cultural heroes this way in order for the culture to really be a force for liberation we must feel it manifested in our daily lives it must breathe sing or dance to take us to a more profound understanding of the nature of the spiritual truths that we have inherited not dead scriptures but rather living revelations and visions that are thrust upon us daily sometimes they be rough edged and raw with pain therefore given a world in which we could create free of the manipulations of the beast the most positive forces in that world would be black artists and not the dead texts of the world that now rule our lives and shape our visions not the dead texts that now dominate us wearing us down and splitting us apart from each    all of the moral and philosophical visions that are to be imagined can find expression in black art we will write our own scriptures we will seek validation of the truths that we sense must exist in the holiest work of each one of us from spirits like b b king jimmy reed son house james brown smokey robinson moms mabley    an ethnic will be fashioned whose fundamental truths can be denied by no one could this be one of the ultimate goals of third world culture because in the coming technological age art will be one of the few paths open to the humanization of mankind it will come full circle back to the most functional purposes of art art as the civilizer and judge of man the struggles of third world peoples will birth a new moral and artistic philosophy and this new moral and artistic philosophy will govern the uses of the advanced technology for the curve of history is not merely toward the material liberation of man but is also towards his spiritual liberation as well to merely perceive the dynamics of historical change in material terms is to set up the possibility of constructing more novel more insidious forms of human oppression and black art must essentially aim toward the elimination of human oppression both spiritual and material we will write our own scriptures the bible the book of tao the koran l ching book of the dead the dliammapada the upanishads  all contain essential truths about the nature of human existence they contain myths ideas and modes of thought that can be integrated into a newer more profound perception of existence but all of these paths to god have been corrupted and uprooted by the force of change the expanding social universe technology we want the essence of these works not the old forms out of which they come so we must extract out of these dead texts those truths that are of compelling significance and black music points in the direction of what will be of compelling significance it is impossible for these texts to be relevant to this and future generations when the orientations which first created them have ceased to exist as a force on this planet new scriptures are in order new mythologies new constructs black music as the model for the black nation black art must be the reincarnated accumulation of all of the worlds positive moral values all that is useful and that moves toward concrete human liberation we are a new species of man child liberation will come out of honkytonk bars gutbucket blues and the meanest niggers that have ever walked the planet saw bobby blue bland singing uptown he had on a silver dashiki and his process the current soul music explosion illustrates the mass culture of black america is still strong and still dominated by the eternal spirit of the blues god soul music is a compelling force it is highly collective in nature embracing all of black america and as b b king says we must respect it artistic liberation will come out of a reshaping of the familiar gospels blues and cosmic music all of the strands and jive categories of black music will begin crisscrossing and intermeshing together towards something resembling a new form a unity music pharoah sanders leon thomas junior walker roland kirk sun ra the impressions the temptations are already showing the way at the point when the music has finally destroyed its bullshit categories and is in fact a unity music most of us will then know that we are a nation a people with an operational identity and committed to total liberation niggers will then invent new terms to describe their essential history and prehistory all of that untapped energy indicated in black music will be released and turned in the direction of making a world in which love can exist freely and cleanly thats whats happening thats what always has been happening as we move song after song cycle unto cycle we will drag with us the accumulated wonder pain and memory of our prior lives it is time for the niggers the fellahs the kaffirs the coolies  to purify the earth with funkier images listen to soul music listen to the collective will of black people to survive on their own terms love them for the most part they love you straight ahead sister phyl garland next time give yourself more timeor take it next time let more hangout for example what are the social conditions under which the music is created how does the music interact with dance styles life styles beyond making a living what are the artists mostly concerned with why is there so little control of the economics of black music by black people does the mafia really control motown are there many white ar men fucking with the music what do the artists have to say about this does the soul musician see himself as merely a performer whose role is to simply entertain or are they goaded on like b b king and nina simone by a larger social purpose these are just a few of things that black music criticism could explore more work like the sound of soul is badly needed because it is finally the living culture that will show the way by that i mean this if we can not confront and shape the culture that black people have developed here in a merica we will fail to bring about a real spiritual revolution among black people we will be doing the cakewalk and the people will be doing the popcorn thank you sister garland for putting something worthwhile out there

delores was upstairs v irx in the bedroom nurturing her daydream when she heard alber   « mw   ta come in the front door a few minutes earlier she had been sitting on the side of the bed reading again the free ticket from the recreation center her pass to see lonnie and the barons at the openair theater she had rubbed her thumb across the surface of the paper admiring its power to transport her into another world and the anticipation of such terrifying joy had exploded suddenly like cherry bombs inside her she was propelled into the middle of the bed bouncing and laughing aloud kicking her feet in the air as if she were still a little kid then she lay back her madness dispelled allowing herself to slide into the daydream she had been creating since she received the ticket feeding it more of herself each time it enveloped hermore of her longing her need lonnie would fall in love with her he wouldnt care that she was still skinny and almost flatchested at fifteen or that she was a year behind in school somehow even in the dark crowded amphitheater he would see the love in her eyes and he would say how you doing lores over the mike in an offhand supercool way without her even telling him her name and that would be their beginning this time she added that he would invite her up to watch the show from the wings and all her friends would gaze with envy as she strolled down the long aisle the closing of the door downstairs was a distant sound and in tangibly ominous then she remembered that alberta hadnt been wearing her girdle when she went out she hadnt even bothered to put on one of her floppy shirts to hang outside her skirt she had worn a white knit blouse tucked inside a skirt that was stretched into wrinkles by the swell of her stomach incongruous with her slender legs and arms it was as if delores thought she had decided to face their mother and the rest of the world all in one long torturous day this was the moment delores had been dreading during the weeks of late nights that she had watched from bed pretending to be asleep as her sister peeled off her girdle and sighed sliding her hands under and over the bronze roundness before she smoked a last cigarette and went to bed delores heard her mother downstairs ask as if by rote part of a compulsory ritual you look for work today and under albertas sullen yeah she could hear the apprehension even with  steps between them but she knew it wouldnt reach her mother find any no the silence was long delores could imagine her mothers face gentle dark brown heart with soft eyes soft mouth that had tensed at albertas entrance now gone slack with shock then you pregnant again girl the words were spaced with heavy gasps you pregnant again and that boy upstairs aint even hardly two years old yet    delores closed the bedroom door and went over to the open window she leaned on the sill and looked out at the sky above the multiindented glutted garbage cans and the grey dirt yards with occasional haggard patches of halfgreen trying to recapture her daydream but dark summer clouds were growing in the sky and all she could think of was the buckets she should be setting out to catch the rain that would drip through the leaks bringing with it flecks of plaster closing the door didnt shut out what was going on downstairs delores knew from the memory of past crises each a rehearsal for the next the various forms this one would assume before it subsided at this moment alberta would be shifting her weight from one foot to the other looking bored except for the plea behind the veil of her eyes while her mother floundered between pain and fury her mother would threaten to slap alberta windingthough she never would she would remind her of how hard she had worked all the years since she was widowed so that they could make something of themselves and how she had never allowed any man before or after her husband to touch her she would point out how much less marriageable alberta was now she would talk on and on as if the eush of words could erode the growth in her daughters womb on and on until the plea in albertas eyes hardened into a kind of hatred the first slow raindrops struck delores hand and she closed the window she decided to wait until the last minute and then to run for the buckets in the cellar postponing her involvement in the scene downstairs delores understood her mother she had seen her come home from the laundry many nights so tired that the fork would tremble in her hand at dinner she had heard her laughter that was often impure fused with tears of loneliness she remembered how things had been  for all of them before her father died yet she not only understood alberta she sometimes felt that she was albertaa second alberta following three years behind the original toward a trail of transient men chubby unwanted babies and spiritwithering jobs in a search for air like now she wanted to fling out her arms knocking away the torn onceblue shades over windows that wouldnt remain all the way up in summer yet wouldnt seal in winter the leaky ceilings the schoolprison in which she sat daily while her brain hopped from one instruction to another from one book to another leaving her behind in its pursuit of meanings the ragged balls of newspaper that having been read or soaked a childs urine from a floor or hung on the jags of a broken window blocking out the wind and rain now rolled about on the sidewalks she longed to breathe to inhale with her whole body new air to feel the way alberta looked when she danced when alberta danced she was up high where coolness caressed the nostrils she was free eyes tightly closed arms and legs swinging loose hips defying constraintanswering only to the demands of the throbbing music sometimes she would dance with the baby in her arms twirling him
until he was almost out of breath
with giggling but when the beat
ended and she opened her eyes
she would hand the baby to delores
and leave
across the sky the downpour
was approaching and delores ran
for the buckets with a prayer that
it wouldnt rain the next day and
cancel the show
u  u p
the air in the special recreation
department bus was muggy it had
rained all night and part of the day
not stopping until late afternoon
but now the sky was clear and delores
was relieved to be on the bus
with the other kids on her way to
the amphitheater somebody
played a transistor radio and two
couples danced in the aisle disregarding
the drivers orders
delores had expected her best
friend ann to sit with her on the
bus but somehow tommy had
squeezed between them at the door
and taken the seat instead short
too quiet tommy who liked her
his presence disturbed her branded
her for herself and others as
being unworthy of more dynamic
attention she ignored him and
joined in the fun around her while
watching strip who sat with a girl
across the aisle his arm was
curved around the girls shoulder
and his fingers dangled nervously
an inch from the point of her breast
under delores jealousy ran a vicarious
tingling at the possibility
that his hand would brush against
the girl and she giggled excessively
at the jokes being passed around
until she left the bus and was
walking toward her seat delores
had been almost satisfied with her
appearance her dress was a
sleeveless print that had once been
albertas and except for armholes
that were a little too large and
would expose her slip if she raised
her arms it was a good fit but
now she saw that compared to the
other spectators she and her
friends looked bedraggled and
they drew together walking to
their seats in a silent huddle like a
giant dowdy earthworm
in her daydream delores had
seen the amphitheater as a traditional
moviehouse picked up from
its main street location and set
down in the park and the unexpected
treewalls and starred sky
roof dwarfed awed her crickets
chirped a competitive background
to the comedian and the girl gospelsinger
who were the preliminary
acts on the show delores
waited not listening willing her
emotions into a state of suspension
for lonnie
barrage of screams four gold
suits flashing onstage drums lonnie
at the mike why why why
did you go did you leave   
three pairs of arms swing up
back out bodies swayingstep
forward step back turn around
clap turn around clap sweet
sweet guitar its a brand new
worold    lights spinning

of europe and therefore of the civilized world that africans south of the sahara were instrumental in the development and perpetuation of the north african civilizations there can be no doubt yet these same africans in their often small kingdoms south of the sahara when they did accept islam and other aspects of north african culture syncretized it with indigenous religious beliefs as of course they still do my question is why really do we embrace islam as a reaction to christianity because of the religious tenets these i can accept because it can unify africans i seriously question that if we mean to also include africans of africa in this unity drive i wonder if in addition to our choosing islam as a rejection of christianity and for its tenets we are not also accepting it because of its legitimacy by the same token i wonder why we spend so much of our discourse about africa emphasizing the great kingdoms of songhai bornu ghana and mali could it be because these kingdoms were similar in structure and size to european ones and serve as reassurance to us that we had the same thing they had even when as with islam these kingdoms were not the norm my point is that we still cannot deal with black africa with pagan africa from whence most of us came somehow we suspect that what they have taught us so well about black africa is really sound after all these africans did not have a writing system except for the moslems who were not the majority they worshipped fetishes they were organized by and large into small societal bodies it is easier to embrace islam than to begin to look seriously at traditional african religions to find what those concepts are and which ones attract us and are in fact malleable for our situation here again it appears we have been reluctant to look closely at ourselves we are also too lazy often to take close looks i have heard revolutionary music and read revolutionary plays with what was represented as african languages in the text but it was simply mumbojumbo just like hollywood would do it not even one word or pharse was authentic harsh echoes of tarzan and the westerns with the injun talk are reverberating as i conclude by offering some suggestions i will admit that my criticism touches various thrusts of black liberation efforts already one reader of a draft of this has accused me of moving in the direction of advocating antiquity cults i admit that i could not deal with his comments because when i hear the words cult and dialect in the racist way they are usually employed various kinds of bells and buzzers automatically go  off in my head effectively impairing my power of reasoningafrican cults african dialects black_power cults negro dialect or patois as though the standard language form is not also a dialect but aside from that the question of whether or not i want africans here to transfer from africa lock stock and barrel all of its culture f can clearly respond to black africa has cosmological beliefs that are very similar just as the life styles the dress patterns the languages all share a common mold yet in this unity there is diversity in terms of specific rendering of the cultural patterns f am suggesting that we try to get to the essence of african culture the tarppings are not as important and i am suggesting more there is absolutely no substitute for hard organizing we can not escape it f have been convinced of that by my observations of the ascria movement in guyana and of the movements president eusi kwayana a giant of a man various dramatic programs such as the black manifesto on reparations certainly educate us by exposing the contradictions we did not know were there but whatever hard cash we need for psychological reasons must come from us we must be organized to think in terms of relying on ourselves we must think in terms of building and sustaining our own institutions a herculean task for organizers it requires a discipline we momentarily lack and an orientation too  few of us have our leaders are still looking for easy ways out we will hardly get the orientation that is necessary unless we can take that long look at ourselves as has been suggested over and over in this essay in the absence of a powerful media to be our mirror there seems little substitute for travel to get out of this territory is to get a breath of clean air and to put everything into perspective but more we must see that there is a circular link of africans little here gives us even an inkling of that fact the west is aware of the vast potential we have as a people it is for that reason that we have been kept so cleverly fragmented the publicized enmity between american africans and west indian africans and between the western hemisphere africans and the africans of our motherland has certainly been a vast and successful propaganda ploy we have been so demoralized by this trickery that all of us move timidly with each other the african visiting from africa is very cautious when we visit africa or latin america we build a wall with the same caution from all indications the ploy has worked more on us than on any other africans we have no real i idea what affection our brothers and sisters all over feel for us here we are not told in any of the media of the various ways they move to demonstrate their support and affection this news is effectively blotted out to keep us feeling isolated nor do we realize how much small hardworking well organized groups are doing in many countries to strengthen black people and to build solidarity amongst us all assuming that we are the baddest we spend little time in healthy interchange with groups that could teach us so much as we give them insights all africans would readily acknowledge however that in a real sense we here are the baddest since we are to be sure at the vultures beak in many ways we have fortunately protected ourselves from americas hangups in one crucial way we have not and we must immediately purge ourselves when we travel it must be american style with a maximum of material comfort this means that we live in luxury hotels and become tourists since that luxury hotel environment dooms us psychologically and cuts us off in actual fact from all but caucasians or their types but we do have problems there is the problem of heat insects bad water strange food and language barriers to deal with the last obstacle to our nontouristy travel first language is probably wise language is not as much a barrier as we fear if we really want to communicate you will find nothing but goodwill on the part of our brothers who will go to all ends to try to understand us a djuka boy in suriname just could not understand how both of us could look alike and not be able to understand each other he set in to try to teach me djuka he would never have tried so tirelessly with a caucasian even when i have insisted that i just did not understand and was ready to give up there has always been that brave soul in every country who would not let me be so cowardly i am not suggesting that we should deliberately move about without knowing the languages of the countries we plan to visit there should be some knowledge of the languages if it is possible i have not meant to imply that everything will run as smoothly if you do not speak the language as it will if you do in nine weeks in latin america i gathered far more vital information than many of the white researchers i met there who were studying us yet i missed so much that i would have gained had i spoken the language of the people as was indicated above there are times your nerves fail or you become so frustrated that you want to retreat but i have learned far more on what for me have been informal trips and have met far more beautiful people than i ever would have had i lived in big hotels and not ventured out language or no the other problems for the american africans are far more grave than the language barrier  they center around the need for material comfort america has made us so soft that many of us honestly cannot survive outside an american type environment notice how we always come back to this place we honestly do need airconditioning we cannot survive the greedy mosquitoes and other worrisome insects the latest trend is to move about from our airconditioned living rooms and bedrooms to our airconditioned cars to airconditioned offices the new genocide will not be a very expensive operation for the man he will not need to fire a single bullet nor to populate a single camp why he will only need to blow his hot breath on us and watch us as we affected by the heat from his mouth melt and die before his eyes we need comfortable beds we could never sleep on benches as many of the nationbuilders in guyana have accustomed themselves to doing enabling them to sleep anywhere i hasten to say that i am not suggesting that we sleep on benches before i lose all readers forthwith but i have good reason to believe that many students are now not so frightened by the prospect we expect room service and are happiest with european food especially hot dogs and hamburgers therefore perhaps some intermediate stops before leaving this territory will help toughen us for profitable travel abroad i propose trips to the rural south first bypass atlanta and that fabulous ho tel go to the country to little towns like my hometown buena vista georgia someone has suggested getting northerners down to rural areas and having them pick cotton shake peanuts pick peaches etc with our brothers and sisters there it is a good idea it would certainly force us into another physical environment and just as travel abroad will solidify us with our brothers so would close communication with the rural southerner it would probably help some of us to begin for the very first time in our lives to eet the sense of community so pitifully artificial no matter the efforts in northern cities still another obstacle keeps the american africans from traveling abroad modestly and so meeting more local people just as the fashions we ape are those that new york paris and london sell to us by way of madison avenue so are the aspirations and tastes we struggle to acquire those that are made glamorous to us by the powerful multimedia we want when we finally are able to travel to travel executive fashion firstclass all the way because these trappings have been dangled in our faces for so long more than anything in the world we want to experience them we should work hard on ourselves also to extricate ourselves from our feelings of superiority we exist in a country that is highly technical but there is absolutely nothing superior about us nothing it will be difficult not to feel superior at times when a certain amount of adulation and wonderment is being heaped upon you by those who see the united states as the most wonderful place in the universe a portrayal beamed to all the world by u s multimedia and reinforced by those been  tos who have come here to visit or reside and needs to enhance their prestige upon their return to their homes this is why we must work on our ego needs as much as possible before departing many people will simply welcome us because we are their brothersnot cousins as mboya suggestedand because we are involved in a liberation movement this group will be able to detect those unwarranted superior feelings immediately and while they may or may not react directly to them they will nevertheless shift to a white relationship with us but the same will be so when we go to the rural south the same currents will be present this is why the south provides such an excellent dryrun for latin america and africa until now the word revolution has not been used in this essay do we have black pride before we can begin to think that a revolution is near that question must be answered affirmatively the answer can not be affirmative when we have only begun the discussion of values and have no machinery for transmitting them it can not be an affirmative answer when we are spending more time with theatrics than with hard unglamorous organizing it can not be said that we have black pride or that a revolution is near when we are still no matter the elaborate disguises trying to be white to have black pride will mean redefining blackness to redefine blackness necessitates examining what we are and sorting it out deciding what should be retained and strengthened and what should be cast aside redefining blackness necessitates removing the artificial boundaries that now exist amongst all africans by thrashing out the contradictions that created them we would then rip down the artificial boundaries of class complexion agethe latest hangupand territorial limits to see that we do have resources and that these resources do not in any way need to be legitimized by the nonafrican world we need only one stampour own with our solidarity assured we can move as a strong force instead of in our usual role of junior partner flunky and the other recognizable slots joining forces with whatever people we choose 
ann cook author of the article black pridesome contradictions is currently doing formal study and library research for a book project  of a proud poetic ship in irons but the open organic form of the cahier permits the development of these tendencies seriatim here is selfexpression maximized he is himself he is all the potentiality of gifted youth a perfect vehicle for the expression of the confined potentiality of his weary race who are we really we blackmen he now asks and the poem moves forward into a series of jerky dance stepspunctuated by the refrain voum rooh ohin which the poet celebrates his favorite pagan frenzies in a headdress of parakeet feathers a spit in the face of the missionaries for once but is not all this also a lie the phrase bout de petit matin limps forward again slightly truncated it is the morning after the poet is hung over it is the filthy end of the world the end of a hundred years of whiplash what sort of words go with these realities the catalog of exotic transformations is replaced albeit reluctantly by a catalogue of base occupations and indignities no we have never been amazons of the king of dahomey he says never princes of ghanathereby poetically establishing his heritage by renouncing it weve been lackeys shiners of shoes but by we doesnt he still in a sense mean they there follows an individual confrontation the harrowing description of a single black observed in the streetcar along with others in the car the poet has found him comic and ugly such is the extent of his complicity with the white world such is the extent of his cowardice and the old dream of cannibalistic cruelties he cannot resist giving his apocalyptic exoticism another go these are replaced by sarcastic acknowledgments of his newfound humility  reclaim for my face the brilliant praise of expectoration a new movement is again introduced as an extended answer to an abrupt question but what strange pride suddenly illuminates me this is the ecstatic hymn to negritude uttered in the fraternal presence of all the fresh things of nature all beginnings summoned to participate in the recreation of the black self here the poet speaks what are to become his most famous lines litanies of acceptance alternate with supplications for sorcerers powers to transform his island his it plunges into the red flesh of the soil it plunges into the ardent flesh of the sky it bores through the opaque prostration of its upright patience eia for the royal kailcedrat eia for those who have never invented anything for those who have never explored anything for those who have never tamed anything but they abandon themselves possessed to the essence of every thing ignorant of surfaces but possessed by the movement of everything v heedless of taming but playing the game of the world islanders his race by the arts of language into manifestations of pride and beauty suddenly further life and force assail him the expansion of his being has reached mystical proportions and the resources of his language are no longer sufficient to his task he feels the seismic pulse of the island in his embrace he sees prophetically the future of the negro race which he expresses in a cadenza of simple statements beginning with the word debout upright in the hold upright in the cabins upright on the bridge upright in the wind upright in the sun upright in the blooderect and free as his people rise so the poet ascends on the wind to meet new sources of verbal inspiration in the night sky the poem ends vertically debout perpendicular to the beginning the flat face of the island au bout du petit matin cesaire imagines that henri christophe was an incarnation of the yoruba god shango shango has a curious legendary history as a king who angry as ajax once destroyed his entire family by mistake and then hung himself in his apotheosis as the thunder god dispenser of justice his manifestations are sporadic and violent shango wears red and red is the color of those whose heads he mounts whom he rides like horses who by temperamental affinity are his votaries blood horses thunder and a savage spirit have always been linked in cesaires system of correspondences and his most powerful monsters are dipped in red but in la tragedie du roi christophe  for the first time the identification is at least temporarily explicit was it always implied or was it only recently in a dry time that the poet anxious about the strength and efficacity of his vocation became at last completely aware of the full of the shattering ambiguity of the african presence on a caribbean isle must be remembered that the colonized male is very much the target of the colonial system a number of studies have shown that the black male is failed more often and tends to be encouraged out of the school system with much greater frequency than the black female it is little wonder then that the black school children protect what is left of their egos by calling anyone who succeeds academically a sissy so much for descriptions of what is and what has been the only reason for describing what the outlines of a psychology of colonialism may be is to call for the participation of black psychologists to help end the colonial relationship between the black community and white america we must begin to do experiments to find out the best ways of developing black people on their own terms rather than to continue to use the instruments of the colonizer to describe what colonization has done to us we must end the tradition of what one of my colleagues likes to call the victim analysis type of research and begin to do reconnaissance research on every colonizer the history of lynching which is not over would be a useful starting place since it reveals deep fears which have helped to produce the long history of hatred and aggression against  us i might suggest that lynching is an early sample of overkill requiring both a political and psychodynamic approach to understand it the current notions of a psychology of adjustment as psychological health are inappropriate to our struggle as albert memmi says the colonial condition cannot be adjusted to like an iron collar it can only be broken lw thus if there is to be therapy for black people it must be a therapy of struggle if it is the condition of colonized people to be torn from their past then the struggle must involve a poignant sense of history if the colonized culture is closed to the future as the master psychologist of colonialism frantz fanon suggests then we should see this manifested in individuals as fatalism note the theme of powerlessness in another tat fantasy from the patient mentioned earlier card  well this is heaven what heaven really looks like its ruled by six people and these are standing here center detail they are looking down on the world and they rule everybodys life like puppets on a string they can do what they like with people below and the funny thing is that out of all these people not one of them is good they just have a lot of cruel fun with people on the earth i guess they just make life one big joke    this severe fatalism brings out nicely the essence of the colonized world view colonized people do not seriously deal with their own existence we must begin to educate our children without transforming them into white anglosaxons in black skins to borrow a phrase from nathan hare  nobody not even white folks seem to be pursuing that any longer we must end the use of testing designed to contain and control our existence we must take the notion of nation building seriously as a crucial stage in the creation of a new world we must think of black people as a whole because although we think as individuals we are treated as a whole black professionals must undergo a process of decolonization so that we can think as social scientists and not continue to be defined externally as psychologists anthropologists and etcetera finally a wider point of view is needed if we are to learn the bitter lesson of south african blacks who protested in the early s for nationalism and community control and got it in the form of the bantustan reservations where they are now captive perhaps the best warning from nazistyle south africa can come from the words of de ridder a european liberal reflecting upon some of the uppity brothers and sisters in his study the educated african must be given an outlet he has become educated to increase his earning potential and if he cannot do so he will turn either to crime  or become disgruntled frustrated and an agitator the urban african tends towards immature attitudes and an exhibitionistic approach but such functions in no way imply that he will not respond to understanding and tactful handling he has still much to learn especially in the spheres of emotional moderation and control his ideas are rather egotistically biased and education tends to make him feel disproportionately superiorbut he is learning the problem which the european in south africa must face is what to do with those africans whose learning has given them ambitions beyond the industrial colour bar ambitions need outlets if their latent energies are not to be diverted by continual frustration into antisocial activities  perhaps we can begin to see the booming black studies business in light of the south african experience

ear mr barrett we have read with keen interest your recent article the nigerian crisisin negro digest vol xviii no  october  your open confession of your limited knowledge of what happened and is still happening in nigeria casts doubts on the validity of your analysis how then can you advise our black brothers in america on situations you profess to be ignorant of in the first and second paragraphs of your article you seem to understand the intentions of the socalled world powers not only in nigeriabiafra but also in the whole of africa it is significant to note that you have been working with the nigerian government over the past two years consequently no one is surprised at your pronigerian stand it is also interesting to note that you quoted maj gen yakabu gowon as having admitted that all was not well in nigeria before and after the january  coup and the july mutiny of the same year for the benefit of those black americans whom your article might have deceived we offer the following information young army officers from every part of nigeria took part in the january  coup in order to correct the ills of the corrupt government subsequent facts revealed that maj gen aguiyiironsi ibo who later became the head of the federal military government narrowly escaped being killed for the mere fact that most of the coup leaders were lbos and most of those killed in the take over were northerners the suspicion grew that the coup was really an lbo plot to suppress the north and dominate the federation this was the time the british seeds of disunity started growing in nigeria eventually the british succeeded by planning and executing through the northern infantry the mutiny of july  in which  lbo army officers including general ironsi were slain and general gowon assumed the mantle of office this was followed by the organized killing of about  lbo civilians in the fall of  you failed to take this loss of human lives into consideration and concluded that these acts of black mans inhumanity to other black men were the best things to do at that particular time here you should be reminded that general ironsi was slain in ibadan western nigeria where he was supposed to discuss and listen to the grievances of the elders and the chiefs drawn from all over nigeria unlike his predecessors general gowon whom you described as stepping in to quell the mutiny was not only a traitor but a rebel to general ironsis regime general ironsi was not given the time and the cooperation to put nigeria on the right track merely because he happened to be an ibo thus a threat to the british interest in nigeria and neocolonialist opportunists  would like to refer you to randolph churchills article see london times march    churchill traveled to biafra and reported as follows there is scarcely a family that has not suffered loss either in the massacres of  the lighting on the war front the bombing of towns and market places or from starvation which has taken the greatest toll of all during and after these massacres general gowon had little choice but to keep silent since the very soldiers who put him in power were the ones most stained with ibo blood despite all these atrocities the then eastern nigeria military governor now majgen odumegwu ojukwu pleaded for a round table conference in order to determine the future of nigeria and to work out a sort of constitutional arrangement that would eliminate causes of friction and restore confidence and harmony throughout nigeria this led to the aburi conference which you have emphasized as though you were a representative i would like you and your nigerian collaborators to explain to the world these few points  was an agreement reached at aburi  why did nigeria fail to honor such an agreement r  for how long after repeated reminders did the then eastern region now biafra wait patiently for the lagos junta to implement the agreement reached at aburi before declaring independence you have tried to make the world believe that biafra is not united under the learership of his excellency general ojukwu responses to this point have been made clear by willintentioned foreign pressmen who have in the past or recently visited biafra here i refer to time magazine of august   with the heading biafras agony all the points you made were answered in this particular publication many writers who have been to biafra have written and spoken that the biafrans have been fighting with bare hands small quantities of ammunition captured from nigcrans and the little that could be bought from the black market in europe lastly mr barrett people like you have sought in various ways to dismiss our struggle as a tribal conflict people like you have attributed it to the greed of a fictitious powerseeking clique anxious to carve out an empire to rule to dominate and to exploit this is not so our cause is transparently just and no amount of propaganda can detract us from it our struggle is of far greater significance than you seem to imagine it is a total vehement rejection of all those evils that blighted nigeriaevils which were bound to lead to the disintegration of that illfated federation our struggle is a positive commitment to build a healthy dynamic and progressive state which will be a bulwark against neocolonialism and the pride of black men the world over we hope that all people who have conscience will not fail to chastize you for regarding as a trifle the streams of blood biafra has so far shed

what happened to transform the american dream into a potential nightmare the answer to that question will depend of course upon the answerer the runofthecomputer white racist will blame the militants isolating as the root of all the evil those blacks who have said enough and who are ready to back up their decision with fire and funerals the beseiged white liberals ever true to form will also blame the militants begging for moderation characteristically straddling the racial chasm by also admonishing the racists for their extremism the black moderates that everdiminishing breed of successoriented middleclassstraining blacks will follow the white liberals lead as they always do routinely moaning about rampant racism while religiously adjusting to it the black moderates to be sure loathe the black militants more even than the other groups the militants threaten their unsteady perch upon the pedestal of security and stability and so all fingers point accusingly at the militants american society hovers on the edge of catas trophe they would have the world believe because a minority of disaffected blacks will not lie down and play puppy with promises of equality and respect in some vaguely envisioned tomorrow but the militants have another answer to them five centuries of western adventurism and exploitation have brought america to this moment white men fanned out over the earth enslaving and colonizing other men degrading and destroying other cultures at midtwentieth century america holds the legacy of the west and she guards the legacy well the sons of europe still swarm into her gates and america welcomes them with an incomparable gift no matter how diseased or ignorant or debased or criminal the european is presented with the status and privilege and preference to which  white skin entitles him in a racist society no matter how low the european may sink or fall he needs never fear to reach the bottom for america has permanently reserved that place for her nonwhite natives and to those blacks who demand an end to degradation america replies wait it takes time the militants say enough they say we will be free men in this country or else this country will  go down with us hear also their side of the argument it affects you
