the f rst afro american theater by carlton w molette ii ne of the highest y priority items among r those of us who are e concerned with t h e to define our theater for us just as we afro americans must define who we are within the framework of our own cultural heritage we t history theory and criticism of afro american theater is a redefinition of afro american theater within the framework of af ro american culture we must not continue to accept a euro american concept of what theater is what constitutes a good play or a bad play how an audience ought to behave and so on if we do we will never even begin to discover the vast and beautiful and exciting history of our own theater the distortion of afro american theater history has been made possible primarily through the single device of allowing somebody else must also define what the word theater means to us and what good theater is within the context of our own culture for example by euro american standards a play must be done on broadway to be co nsidered worthy of serious critical and historical consideration of course there are a few exceptions to this rule in the form of long run off broadway hits but even the exceptions must be produced in the city of new york to be eligible for consideration as a worthwhile american play there is clear evidence to support the theory that euro americans mean to define afro american theatrical success in their terms as well for example a book was published in under the tite n egro playwrights in the american theatre by doris abramson a white woman the only negro playwrights in the a nerican theater according to the content of miss abram sons book are t h se whose plays have been produced in the city of new york by applying this euro american definition to afro american theater historically important afro american playwrights such as john ross randolph edmonds thomas pawley owen dodson james butcher and ray mciver are excluded simply because their plays had not been performed in new york prior to some have been produ ced since when historians apply euroamerican definitions to afroamerican theater history prior to the confederate rebellion they generally conclude that afroamerican theater did not exist for this reason afro american theater history prior to the confederate rebellion has been almost completely ignored most afro american theater history since then is also ignored and for the same reason but let us take one thing at the time the casual student of afro americantheater might easily conclude that the first afroplays are not lacking in af roamerican culture then this must be a case of using euro american definitions to determine what afroamerican theater is miss abramson implies that the first play by an afro american of any consequence at all was h arlem written by wall ace thu rman in collaboration with wiliam jourdan rapp a white man in apparently then h ae passed the euro american test of what af ro american theater ought to be primarily because a white man re wrote the play when we deal with afro american theater in an afro american cultu ral context we discover that even in new york wasnot the beginning nor was in or a mr brown opened a tea garden in what was by then a thriving community of free afroamericans in new york mr brown had previously been a steward on a ship that sailed between american play was the escape new york and liveroool en a leap to freedom written by william wells brown in even a work of the stature of john hope franklins from slavery to freedom says so but according to landamong the early entertainers at the tea garden was a man named james hewlett whose entertainment consisted of portraying the roles of several diff erent characters miss abramson the escape is not in one p erf ormance within four or really even a play nor is caleb the degenerate written by joseph s cotter in she says that both of these plays are crude and that they are reall y tracts meant for the library or the platform according to the dictionary crude means uncult ured but whose culture is at issue certainly these five yea rs mr brown had built a theater seating three or four hundred people in this theater a group called the af rican company performed one member of the company ira aldridge went on to be t come one of the most renowned actors of th century europe but what of the african company itself playbills of african company after those two performcompany perf ormances indicate ances cannot be accuratev docuthat they must have performed as regularly and definitely charged as much as the other theaters operating in new york at the time still the african company has been labeled by a few white theater historians as a bunch of amateurs whomade no significantmark upon the history of theater short of being picturesque on the other hand most white theater historians ignore them completely an undated african company playbill probably from or lists a performance entitled on the slave m arket it seems reasonable to assume that the perf ormance did not take a stand in favor of the institution of slavery would such an event be of no historical importance a later playbill announced that on june and the african company would present for the second time a play called king shotaway the play was billed as having been about a sjave insurrection on the island of st vincent and based upon the actual experiences ofmrbrownwhowas both playwright and manager of the company is not the production of a play by an afro american in about a slave insurrection a significant mark upon the history of the theater what happened to the african mented at this time however the company had been repeatedly harassed by the new york police department prior to that occasion in other words they had been ttrown in jail what must have been the attitude in the white community in toward an afroamerican theater company performing a play in which slave insurrection is encouraged a play in which the hero is a hero because he leads his black brothers in a violent rebellion against their white oppressors is it any wonder that neither the african company nor mr brown was ever heard from agai n james hewlett who played the role of king shotaway managed to continue his acting career in december of hewlett appeared at the spruce street theater in new york apparently in his one man show in which he played several different characters in one perf ormance and did imitations of the leading white actors of his day february was announced as his last appearance at military garden prior to his departure for london where he was to have appeared at the coburg theater there are apparently no record s at the cobu rg of hewletts appearance there there are however records of hewletts return to new york for perf ormances as late as september of cour e ira aldridge also went to london and to the coburg theater where in october of he launched a career that was to eventually lead to recognition as one of europes leading actors at any rate with the demise of the african company neither hewlett nor aldridge would ever again appear prof essionally in a play written by an afro american playwright for an afro american audience with an afro american acting company managed by an af ro american the closing of the af rican company in opened the door for the euro american theater establishment to saturate afro americans with the idea that the good the true and the beautiful must be determined according to euroamerican standards within a euroamerican cultural context but what if we use afro american culture to derive our own definition of afro american theater then we go back to the oral traditions of africa instead of the literary traditions of europe then we can deal with theater as a total event that may include narrative storytelling storytelling in dialogue form persuasive speeches sermons song dance or instrumental music in any number of conceivable combinations and we can deal with theater as an event that evolves orally rather than a specific set of words fixed for all time upon a page from this cultural context africans arrived in america some slave some free all oppressed from this cultural herit age black slaves held their white captors up to public ridicule among themselves in what has since been perverted into the negro minstrel from this cultu ral heritage also developed the afroamerican preacher the storyteller and the singer of spirituals as implements for the oral transmission of history mythology and ethical standards it is within these events that the roots of afro american theater lie ahead there is a long and difficult struggle to reconstruct these events outside of a euroamerican racist context this job is more difficult than the usual task of historical research it is more difficult for two main reasons first because white historians have conspired whether deliberately or unconsciously to destroy all records of significant cultural achievement within an afro american cultural context by afro americansliberal white historians have managed to convince us that they were helping while recording and loudly applauding only those cultural achievements by afro americans that mimicked euro american culture in addition afro americans were compelled to lie about what they were doing and why they were doing it what kind of punishment would have been in store for a black slave who told a white man who the minstrel was really making fun of or where the spirituals were really talking about going our ancestors were obliged to practice these deceits upon the white man in order to survive only when the afroamerican theater historian is able to break through this double wall around the truth will a thorough history of afro american theater be possible the dilent of blck rcti t er by woodie king jr the american theater isnt really the americantheaterhow america be anything but a black artists dream black theater is a term that says where blacks in this non existent american theater would like to go not where they are no real american form has emerged in this countrys short history in the late twenties when eugene oneill and the provincetown group tried to do new and vital work that one percent that mak e up the theater going audience retreated with shock however in the thirties oneill was joined by clifford odets irwin shaw sidney kingsley maxwell anderson and paul green and the country thought it had finally found an american theater unf ortunately it had not it had only succeeded in producing an ameri can august strindburg via oneill and different forns of russian literature via odets anderson and their contemporaries the crossing of contemporary american ethnic with traditional european theater seemed to be the american way america had taken what seemed to be the best of europe however what seemed to be the best emerged as the cover of a very complicated book in terms of physical structure theaters are still to this day of the proscenium type thats used all over europe these theaters were designed for operas from their inception every new stage design is based on an earlier european design discovered by careful research plays are written tofit into something similar to a box this makes most of the plays identical plays written in the thirties were presented in boxes american plays cannot be restricted by theaters designed for european opera paul green who worked with the stanislavski oriented group theater in the groupsbeginning and whowas an innovator in pioneering black drama in america white desses abrahams bosom n ative son hymn to the rising sun moved to outdoor symphonic fortn he went back to his home in north carolina and again pioneered one of the f ew true american forms in symphonic drama oneill vho experimented with black plasdreamy kid emp ero jones all gods childen got wings moved deeper into his own f amily and emerged as one of the finest american playwrights and the only one to ever win the nobel prize the plays about blacks written by these white men were vi eved by a white audience thats how the were meant to be viewed no attempt to change this pattern occurred until the mid fifties after the demise of the negro theaters in harlem and the f ashionable night out in harlem became unfashionable it was about that time that a series of small community projects discovered that survival meant developing within the community actors who had worked with the white groups were instru mental in developing black community groups in new york it was rose mcclendon frank wilson fred oneal in chicago it was ted ward in cleveland it was charles gilpin the communit naturally meant among black peers gradually the plays changed from revivals of white plays with allblack casts to original dramas written by writers f amiliar with the black life style the plays no longer were written for white acceptance since no white people would see th em in sch ools y m c a s negro digest apr il churches across the country from los angeles watts to new yorks harlem plays tried to communicate to those nearest those next door this was done out of necessity out of a need to survive the audiences were few but they responded more blacks tried their hand at pl aywriting in the thirties and forties the communists tried to use theater in the fifties the politicians tried to use theater in the sixties social worke s tried to use theater theater communicated directly and quickly there was no way easier or cheaper to reach black people then in the late fifties lorraine hansberry s raisin in the sun hit raisin reaffirmed in blacks the necessity for more involvement in black theater as a matter of fact lonne elder iii robert hooks douglas turner ward and ossie davis were all in raisin in the sun until the late fifties no black writer black actor black director or technician had benefited financially from any of the plays about black people which had been presented in years previous it had always been a white producer or white writer who had profited phillip yordans anna lucasta is a case in point marc connellys geen pastures porgy bess in abrahams bosom on down theline are all cases in point the years and marked the beginning of the coffee house theaterin new york the socalled alant garde the outcast theaters cafe cino cafe la mama and the hang outs of the beat generation blacks were accepted in this circle because the circle itself was about freedom the destruction of the system in the early sixties the poverty programs around the country came into existence social workers tried to use theater and young people who had only dreamed of participating in the theater arts now had the opportunity to participate through so called cultural enrichment programs tow ards the midsixties these projects became more serious the message became the medium serious black writers submitted their plays after realizing that the plays wouldn t be done in the mainstream theaters the underground flocked to see productions of these writers the writers received major attention from the same critics who reviewed plays on broadway and off broadway street theater and guerilla theater emerged asforerunners of black theater street theater takes theater directly to the people who canin the street was the first to nake an attempt she discovered almost immediately that for people in the inner city to relate performers had to be multi racial it became impossible for theater in the street to present its repertory in english alone spanish communities insisted that plays presented in their community communicate to them in their language guerilla theater is an attempt at git prop theater it attacks the government in general and the injusti ces of war in particular both forns u sed black people to help solve problems that were not directly related to the immediate needs of black people young blacks dissatisfied with the poverty program structure moved out on their own and set up their own thing this wa s true of the new laf ayette theater this theater had been a part of harlem youth unlimited new laf ayette theaters director robert macbeth had a vision that went beyond the limited idea of har yous federal project macbeth wanted a theater controlled exclusively by black people free to experiment within black culture free to try newforms thesamefreedomthat black americans fought for in all the other areas of their existence this could hardly happen within a federally supported project the new lafayettetheatermoved into its new quarters at the old elk hall in and macbeth started to build what he believes to be a black theater the foundation of this theater must be the community around it the classic function of the theater is to project and illuminate the feelings and concerns of the community which sustains it thus the theater like the church is a community ritual and black the ater cannot emerge until it is free of the european concept until we change our language yea h as we wont be free until we change our music we wont be free until we change our theater until we begin to do the rituals again when we tat doing the rituals again and stop doing plays the new lafayette theater is a theater that can become a black theater when it is no longer supported by foundations when it has to exist because the black people of harlem want it it will be black the new lafayette theatre in its four years came into its own when ed bullins the young black writer from philadelphia via san francisco journeyed to the new lafayette he brought with him a collection of pla ys that were written for black people they are so directed for black ears that whites reading them learn more about black culture than do the blacks to whom the plays are directed however there is little doubt of bullins direction unlike many black writers who exist without benefit of a permanent company bullins writes knowing that his plays will be performed his position is very similar to that of oneill and odets oneill had the provincetown company to test his plays and odets had the group theater odets also had harold clurman and elia kazan as well as some of the finest trained perforners outside of the moscow art theater bullins has the possibilities of a similar playwright company relationship but it is important that we understand the difference between a black eugene oneill and a true black playwright at this time there can be no black theater unless it is a free theater or a cooperative effort by all involved whenever money enters into the picture it is best to treat theater as a business unfortunately most of the black people who are active in theater or those on the sidelines hoping to jump into theater should be treated precisely as one would treat a white boy there is a magic which theater images project in the minds of black writers and black performers they dont see theater as ever having been fair to them and they are absolutely correct an art form that is unfair to white people is twice as unfair to the few black people who try to crack it a play produced by foundation support in a black community and playing to no black people is the same as a play produced by limited partnership off broadway playing to white people in both casesitsthe audience that determines the plays validity to the performer and writer the negro ensemble company is no diff erent than the american place theater is no difj eent than the new lafa yet te theater before a company of performers come together they are individual in their thinking and in their actions one thinks of oneself before he thinks of the collective and since everything about him is the same as the things away from him his thoughts usually remain the way they were when he entered the new surroundings by way of elaboration the last poets and leroi joness spirit house movers are projections of new thoughts and fresh attempts at form because they are not confined by time and space real estate is not important european concepts are not attempted their form of presentation goes back to early american form ie to the minstrel shows blues spirituals even in many cases to moans and screams in leroi joness case he learned the european forms early and therefore learned early how meaningless they are to the expression of the black life style on the other hand the last poets never learned european forns at all they found their form in black music and from black musicians the american black actor doesnt have the proper frame of reference his is a european concept it is basically the same with the black playwright he is less than three qecades out of the eu ropean tradition whether he is with the negro ensemble company the american place theater or the new laf ayette theater his frame of ref f erence and his form will be the same breaking that tradition might be what james brown the mu slims smokey robinson and rev c l franklin are doing theirs might be the real black th eater whatever it must be a bitch being artistic director in a theater where blacks negroes and colored people are all together the audiences that attend plays written and performed by black artists are usually of three types whites who want to be flagellated liberals who either want their fears confirmed or those who want to steal the art and the f ew blacks who go hoping that it will be good because blacks are involved for those who want to get flagellated there are all those horrible get whitey plays that are usually written directly to white people ignor ingblack peoplecompletelythese plays are meaningless no one with any knowledge at all believes whats happening on stage the liberals are in anoth er bag they are not interested at all in the real play the real theater they want the moynihan report confirmed all those reports from the welfare department verified if all this happens then intellectual discussion can be set nothing will happen as a result of these debates one or two black intellectuals who almost al ways are invited and who always start the discussion by stating that they haventseen the play but you know these intellectuals well they all got their jobs because the black nationalists raised a lot of hell and finally the black audience is just happy to see something black on stage they are not excited by reviews they want it real tell it like it is they are only a few and they are mostly students and its usually very difficult f or them to get to the theater this is the audience that black writers try to speak to however theater eco nomics are years ahead of them when it should be equal to them and so it came to pass the day black artists realized they would never be accepted in the main stream of american life it came very early in theater it was and still is the nut that few blacks are able to crack this is due to the direct and immediate image projected leroi jones called it revolutionary theater the plays that will split the heavens for us will be called the destruction of america the heroes will be crazy horse denmark vesey patrice lumum ba but not history not memory not sad sentimental groping for a warmth in our despair it was an art that had to express in beautiful and artistic form the life styles of its participants black participants wanted to create their own othellos their own willy lomans this came too when the country as its artists was and still is going through terrible changes political and social after years blacks can no longer believe anything white people say and are indeed making them face up to their lies nothing short of death could force the blacks to be negroes black theater cannot survive under the present conditions black perf ormers and black technicians cannot invest it with the same rules and regulations that characterize white theater its like telling a child that he is a man as vantile whitfield director of the perforning arts society of los angeles pasla inf ormed us black theater is embryonic black theater is about the destruction of tradition listen to ronald milner playwright and directoof spirit of shango theater in detroit run it down it will be a theater having to do with love of ones self and ones personal national and international family with wariness and hatred of ones personal national and international enemies with ideally points as to how to break their grip and splattertheir power it exists to make way for black thought and black artistic expression ideally it should be in a black community it cannot be directly supported by a foundation but an au ences an ritics by helen armstead johnson ong pressed to the t limit in so many facets of his life the black man of the sixties undergo close scrutiny at the beginning of a decade even more promising than the sixties in an interview with patricia bosworth of the new york times february lonnie elder called attention to the diverse angles of vision among black playwrights black writers have a particular frame of reference they cant avoid the ghetto or the terrible deprivation or the experience of bigotry and racism they are inthe spoke out n many midst of it all and they have to fight ways both because of and in spite of unbearable pressures and restrictions one of the most productive and most exciting manifestations of his outward thrusts has been a reactivated and energized black theater the theatrical ferment of recent years has crystallized into two major forms the theater of the black experience and the theater of revolution the existence of these major forms indicates different angles of vision for black playwrights as well as for their audiences and critics and all three must to get on top of itthere is an awful kind of purity in this kind of experiencele roi jones ed bullins ralph ellison douglas turner ward we all express ourselves differently as artists but we all create from the same basic need we are men and we want to belistened to ed bullins in introducinghis new plays j om the black theatre speaks of a wide range of plays revolutionary plays include we righteous bombersby kingsley b bass jr who is said to be ed bullinssonjiby sonia sanchez and the black bird by marvin x bullins recognizes the existing diversity well enough but he fails to note that in general there has been little emphasis on historical plays using a historical figure in a revolutionary play is not the same as writing a historical play among the plays of the black experience on the other hand are lonne eiders ceremonies in dark old men douglastumer wards day of a bsence ed bullins goin a btfjalo charles gordones no place to be somebody and adri enne kennedys cities inbezique onthe matter of historical plays however loften mitchell certainly one of the most informed men about black theater both historically and currently said this one thing missing though from the current pictureis historical theater it is mitchells view that theater should reflect a peoples history not just current treatments of the angry i hate whitey theme such plays as william branchs a wreathfor udomo and in splen did error truly reflect this history very recently the new york times conducted a suvey among theate people asking them which plays they would like to see revived ruby dee includedthis observation among othersi n splendid error william branchs play produced off broadway in the fifties deals with the historic confrontation between two giant americans frederick douglass and john brown i remember that it was exciting and most relevant to todays racial dilemmas the same thing can be said of course about branchsa medal fo r willieas its recent boston revival proved what is being said here is that the historical play has not yet emerged as a direction to beequated with those of the black experience and revolution the matter of audience is undoubtedly more critical for the playwright of the theater of the black experience because of the diversity of the audiences for such plays in a essay in anger and beyond the negro writer and american literature saunders redding gave seriousattention to the problem and it is a problem of audience after pointing out the historical differences and the causes of those differences between black and white audiences he came to this conclusion that the gulf between the audiences had been closed and that the black writer can now write without being either false to one audience or subservient to the other amplifying this from another angle douglas turner ward says that for a negro playwright committed to examining the contours con texts and depths of his experience from an unfettered unimaginative negro angle of vision the screaming need is for a sufficient audience of other negroes better informed through commonly shared experi ence to readily understand debate confirm or reject the truth or falsity of his creative explorations not necessarily an all black audience to the exclusion of whites but for the playwright certainly his primary audience the first person s of his address potentially the most advanced the most responsive or most critical only through their initial and continuous participation can his intent and purpose be best conceived by others wards day of absence illustrates his point as funny as the images and memories are the bitter truths and ironies are all too apparent black maids waiting on cold street corners f or buses in the morning all converging on the opposite street comers at the same time in the afternoon too tired to clean their own houses when they get home porters sweepin g the streets in front of shops in the early morning or polishing brass on bank doors what actually happens in the play is that blacks mysteriously disappear for a whole day including some of those in positions of power in government who were not known to be black wh at is true is that black people have often wondered what white f olks would do if all the black s disappeared ward has implemented alexander popes powerful line what of t was thought but neer so well expressed the play of course reveals the completely chaotic state of aff airs without black people and it dramatizes a secret wish which no doubt every black person has had at one time or another the play illustrates the way in which a black audience can relate to a black playwright on the basis of commonly shared experience experience which whites necessarily perceive in a different way addressinghimselftothematter of audience too james emanuel critic and an editor of dark symphony says the truths of negro life then should be the staple of writing directed toward negroes specifically and negro writers should tell those truths and to insist that negro writerslimit themselves to work which they think serves negroes alone is to deny the general humanity and universal significance of negroes what is good for a black audience is good for any audience or reader to refute that isto minimize tlie meaning of a black persons life this is not inconsistent with playwright william branchs insistence upon the playwrightsfreedom to choose his audience and to direct himself to any group he wishes to at the time he has the urge to write there are times he says when he has something to say to black people and there are other times when he has something to say to whites this is a matter of emphasis not exclus on alice childress believes that black writers should direct work toward black audiences but she is aware of the fact that black audiences are not always waiting with open arms for every word we have to say many of them listen with a white ear they want playwrights to say just enough but not too much it is not the simplest thing in the world to write for a black audience on the point of just enough there is an excellent illustration in the now defunct black culture weekly december the play being attacked by barbara ann teer is big time buck white at first all is hilariously well with her all of them are definite folk images and character types cats you would find on the corner of any black communityhustlingoffthepoverty program the actors work well together they have a real warm feeling bouncing back and forth im laughing so hard i didnt realize that my head was beginning to ache after awhile sic i started massaging my temples and said to myself where is all this tension coming from these brothers are funny as hell but it soon became pretty obvious that the brothers were depicting the most negative niggerisms we have i mean its no secret we have millions of messed up confused lost directionless brothersfloating around lets be honest thats reality it is also true that we have millions of brothers who are still into an opportunistic solo hustling thing yeah we got em so expose em why not but then after you expose em then wh at you cant just create these nigger figures and leave them hanging out there for no reason other than to say to whitey look how dumb ignorant moneyhungry power crazy ego starved black men are i include whitey because percent of this audience is also white but then what do you expect downtown now im beginning to dig whats really being put down and im getting a little nervous and uncomf ortable its getting worse sic instead of better like three quarters of the evening has gone by and ive had it with all this negative shit niggers doing nothing but fussingfighting and cussing i mean im really feeling embarrassed almost naked you know like stripped damn big time buck white hurry up come on in and save these poor niggers straighten em out after having identified the characters as definite folk images and character types to be found in any black community miss teer then charges the actors with having come all the way from watts just to get on a new york stage make buff oons of black people to really strip them of all their dignity for no apparent reason other than to make money and to show the white playwright obvious contempt for them yet one reads this about big time buck white dick wiiiamswhenwilliamswasfirstapproached about doing the play he was so detennined that it come through ashethoughtitshouldthat he reworked most of the dialogue deleted one character altogether and completely changed the character of buck white ive tried to make him honest and very concerned at one point we almost had to bar tuotti the playwright from the theater it takes a black writer to really know the black experience and communicate it im convinced of it there arent any buts about it to the extent that williams assumes responsibility for the play he must be considered in any discussion of black playwrights and their audiences the substance of what williams and tuotti put together white richard watts of the new york post summed up as sound and fury signifying very little black garette robinson in black culture weekly summed it up this way big time buck white is a funny spoof it is a peak of comedy sitting like a pimple on a base of tragedy the acting and direction are excellent the play itself however falls short in that it has failed to explore in depth the causes that have produced the tragic characters of b a d beautiful alleluia days without this exploration it comes on like amos and andy in the space age a similar thing happened to ed bullins in the wine time the reviewer began by asking is this play really necessary it attempts to reflect what is happening with the grass roots brother and sister telling it like it is but not like it is and like it should be what is needed in our community is a black theater that will produce black plays plays that will create positive images of brothers and sisters plays that move brothers and sisters from spending their lives drinking rotgut and rot mind wine and becoming warriors that have a revolutionary task at hand and a new world to create a denunciation of old stereotypes follows the typical religious sister in everybodys business the wino the sanctified young sister the hustler and the typical negro cop but so what he asks since the play doesnt move from being a reflection of negroes doing their selfdefeating thing obviously telling it like it is over and over is not enough as harold schonberg said recently in attacking concert offerings damn this endless concentration on the familiar the problem we are illuminating here of course is not the validity of the criticism but the fact that it supports alice childresss contention that a black audience does not necessarily assure the black playwright a receptive audience what the black audience really is was the focus of a recent study by thomas johnson of the new york times january he was forced to conclude after scores of interviews with people concerned with black theater and audiences that it was impossible to tell how many black people were regular theater goers the figure is thought to be small compared to white audiences but at the same time far greater than it was before the last decade of black activism johnsonsidentifiable list of black audiences included the following the loose sprinkling of color amid the masses of whites clogging the sidewalks nightly in front of such hits as man of la mancha fiddler on the roof and the comparatively larger groups of blacks that come out to see either black performers or black themes such as hello dolly the even larger and mostly young adult groupsthat frequent off broadway houses supporting the increasingly popular production of the negro ensemble company such as ceremonies in dark old men and the new york shakespeare festivals publictheaters production of hair and no place to be somebody the growing number of evolutionary minded black activists who following the black art concept popularized by leroi jones see the theater as a tool for the creation of social change the audienceparticipants being developed by new concepts in black theater that are creating styles out of the black style of life one of the more advanced of this school is the national black theater workshop of barbara ann teer and the many black people who go to all types of theater thus far we have indicated how much different angles of vision of black playwrights the wide range of audiences and the limitations posed by critics who embrace one or more of the black audiences to say nothing of white ones pose problems of freedom of choice for the playwright of the theater of the black experience much of the current theatrical energy is being spent upon revolutionary theater which is still a developing rather than an established genre in the first place the playwrights regard themselves as obedient to the black aesthetic but what that is is not clear to anyone including those who write about it it is currently mired in rhetori c and confusion partly as a result of this confusion many of the plays are totally undisciplined in written form as well as inproduction some are sketches not plays at all but some of the playwrights do not seem to know this loften mitchell while optimisticabout the growth of the black audience and positively delighted over the numher of young black writers who are actually getting audiences at the same time expresses anxiety that the unworthy plays being staged might vitiate the gains now being made one of the things which leroi jones did foblack theater was to articulate a new kind of anger and to seek to devise a black aesthetic free of traditional western components in an essay written before his writing became lessliterary and more revolutionary jones reacts to the fact that now it has become possible f our writers to come from anyplace young negroes old negroes as simply anonymous writers but writing about specific experiences which are informed by the place where they are by what this place has made them and where they came from he contendsthat whatever the expressions and experiences available the playwights most important obligation is to tell it all exactly like it is in a essay in hone on the revoltltionary theatre jones tries to say what that is and the freedom he once permitted black writers has vanished along with much of his style the revolutionary theatre should force change it should be change the revolutionary theatre must teach them whites thei deaths it must crack their faces open to the mad cries of the poor it must teach them about silence and the truths lodged there it must kill any god anyone names except common sense the revolutionary theatre should flush the fags and murders out of lincolns face one thing which stands apartfrom the rhetoric and confusion is the revolution ary playwrights clearly specified audience he chooses to write for black people in black neighborhoods in new york only weeks ago the cast of leroi jones slave ship walked off the stage of the theater in washington squa re methodist church because the location of the theater was not relevant to the black community the revolutionary playwright cannot assume though that the neighborhood community is a ready made audience bruce e million of detroit writing in black theatre no argues that in order to revolutionize the theater the composition of the theater audiencemust be radically changed and that audience recruitment is the central issue his detroit experience hasled him to some rather startling conclusions unless provision is made for compulsory subsidized theater with compulsory attendance the voluntary theater will remain a useless ornament decoration for the upper two percent that free theater like box office theater will change nothing its like bikinis to eskimos and that street theater is more romantic than good its like saying the culturally deprived should have deprived theater milliam is attacking some very popular notions but the most significant aspect of his attack is the radical position he adopts in response to the difficulties of attracting local black audiences a clear definition of a black audience does not create one and playwrights of the revolutionary theater have to deal with thisf act in the final analysis this examination has illuminated something of the complexities in the relationship between black audiences and black playwrights whether of the theater of the black experience or the theater of revolution despite these complexities the sixties have produced substance excitement and innovation not the least of which is the increasing number of young people even children coming into the theater as patrons and performers their interest in the sixties will become their commitment in the seventies the indispensible and firm basis for sustained growth in black theater on black theater in america he year was a kind of mixed bag for r devotees of black others were goin a buffalo which was too much like last years in the wine time the characters were it theater in new york the same defeated despairing types on the plusside there were more plays by and about black people than ever before including a few memorable ones which showed once again why black theater is really whats happening theatrically in america today among the top plays of the year was ed bullins we righteous bombers an overly long but righteous play dealing with the psychological and physical problems facing a group of black revolutionaries it was one of the most thought provoking productions of the season evoking heated debate in black circles for weeks after its opening this was one of three offerings at the harlem based new lafayette theater where bullins is playwright in residence the who pop up in most of bullins works there was also ritual which was a good idea gone astray i think it was designed to be a shared emotional experience between the performers and the audience but it was too contrived to be effective other top plays were slave ship a powerful and soul stirring work by leroi jones dealing with the horrors of american slavery and the deadening effectsit hashad on black people five on the black hand side a sometimes dragging but very together love comedy about a black family by charlie russell a black quartet four searing comments on black black and black white relations by jones bullins ben caldwell and ron milner and where its at a fast moving musical revue done by ernie mcclintocks afro american studio for acting and speech one of the most significant things about all these plays is that they were all written primarily for black audiences and though all were not revolutionary they dealt with issues and life styles of black people in this racist do minated society this past season also saw the closing of the great white hope after performances the pearl bailey led hello dolly troupe leaving broadway to go on the road and the continuing success of the rock musical h air with blacks in several key roles there was also the opening and closing of such plays as sambo the gingham dog the ofay watchers and buck white that one week fiasco which tried to exploit the presence of muhammad ali in the title role the last three mentioned were all unsuccessful attempts by white writers to deal with black folks on the negative side there was little progress in solving the financial woes of black theater except for we righteous bombers all the top plays opened in white i owned theaters black people have not responded in sufficient numbers to put the theater groups on a more secure financial ba se again i must say that this is partially the fault of black theater people themselves they are still too divided to coordinate their artistic and financial efforts for the maximum benefit of everyone instead of black theater goers being confronted with an at least tactically unified group they are besieged for support by a dozen small theater groups all seeking their allegiance sometimes by downing the character of those they consider their rivals black theater will never flourish this way one can only remember the dictum that necessity is the mother of invention and hope that necessity will eventually force the black theater groups into closer cooperation there were two more interesting developments on the new york theater scene this past year one was the continuing problems of the negro ensemble company nec which had the kind of season where nothing they did left any lasting impressions last year they gave us ceremonies in dark old men which had a long off broadway run after leaving nec but this year one had to check out old playbills to remember that they did man better man a musical by trinidadian playwrighterrol hill t the reckoning which dealt with a confrontation between a slick black pimp and a racist southern governor and the harangues which consists of four short plays by joseph walker their import did not extend much beyond the confines of the theater i nec which has received over one million dollars in ford foundation grants now claims to have run into financial problems announcin e via new york times ad that they are in desperate need of funds to continue their operations at the level of the past two years another new development this past year was the arrival of charles gordone and his widely hailed no place to be somebody white critics were ecstatic about it but many blacks have expressed misgivings about this work which is filled up with self loathing greenwich village negroes going through changes in their relationships with each other and their weirdo white friends playwright gordone who describes himself as par indian part french part irish and partnigger and ho wrote in the new york times that i believe the idea of black theatre is dead is obviously vriting about people he knows well they can still be seen in village hangouts no place is well written and the acting is superb nathan george as johnny williams gave the best acting performance i saw all year nevertheless black people had best beware while laughing at the dialogue and marvelling at the acting no place to be some bod is full of cold contempt for us nows the time to encourage everyone to support black theater with donations and by attending performances of groups such as movement black a dance theater group roger furmans new heritage theater the last poets anywhere you can catch them barbara ann teers national black theater workshop whose members are still concentrating on getting themselves together and whose sunday afternoon get togethers are a harlem highlight the ajass shows which are a must for anyone really interested in black culture since they are the pioneer group the community theatre of the harlem school of the arts the bed stuy playhouse and alonzo and the players two brooklyn groups while we are waiting for them to come together for the benefit of all we must continue to support them peter bailey you speak of the south and blackness r everyone outside of the c el south automatically assumes that south is far behind them but the south is not an arid wasteland things grow year round in the south especially if you take the time to tend to them the way things are supposed to be tended if you speak of black theater and mention the south most everyone outside of the south will laugh at you as if to say that new york is the only place that black theater really exists although if you push some of them they will readily admit that black theaters allegedly exist on the west coast and in chi t own but black theater is here too has been here for a long time it is amazing that in these years of black awareness people have ignored what is perhaps the area where black theater will find its strongest black audiences gilbert moses co founder and former artistic director of fst directed slave ship this summer along with two or three other plays as part of fsts summer program slave ship which played throughout louisiana and mississippi wasper formed in places where the name leroi jones not f assumes that south is to mention ameer baraka has rarely if ever been heard before the production was presented to audiences many of whom were seeing black theater for the first time in their lives the admission was free but who took notice of it no one except of course the black people in greenville mississippi who were ready to revolt after the performance was over and who were only reluctantly persuaded to go home and then there was the entire audience in west point missis sippi which rose to its feet waving fists and singing when we gonna rise up the song which is included at the end of every slave i ship performance and there was also the large gathering of sunday picnickers students and others who witnessed a performance on the lake pontchartrain shores in new orleans the same play that southern university refused to allow in its auditorium all who saw it got the message but the people who were supposed to be in the know said nothing at all about it and if you hadnt been there to see it happen then you would never have known it went down because there was never any coverage of it on the other hand now that the play has opened in a new york theater at a seat everyone is seeing it and talking about it the big diff erence however is that now slaveship is playing to paying audiences in new york and is being reviewed by all of the white critics and it is a pity that no one got a chance to see it when the people of the south saw it for then they would have seen a slaveship that could not possibly be seen in new york or anywhere else they would have seen a slaveship that the audience experienced not as if it were scenes of slavery from negro history but rather a play that the audience readily identified with as scenes from their lives or as one young black in west point said out loud as the slave driver was whipping the slaves i want to see you after the show but thats ju st the way it has always been and will continue to be for a long time to come it is ironic that though gilbert moses did a fine job of directing both versions of slaveship the people who are supposed to be in the know about black theater will remember only his new york work and not the magnificent production that really moved literally thousands of people in the south we need to reach out and link up with each other we need to stop being so cliquish and parochial in our attitudes about what black theater is the real vital black theaters exist where ever our people are during the summer and fall of the black mind jockeys the poets of blkartsouth fs ts writingacting workshop had the opportunity to perf orm from the east coast south carolina and floridato as f ar west assan antonio texas everywhere we went we found ready audiences and in many places we were pleased to find black community theaters developing the witersactors and artists of thesouth just asthose in the north and other sections of the country cannot do it alone we need the strength of all black hands working togetherwe will need more than the spot coverage which is too often all thatwe get we need more of our workpublished by the few black journals that now exist and also more recognition for the publications that we arenow producing therest of the country must begin to recognize that we the south are a force in black theater and we are we are by the simple fact that we are playing to masses of black people we are carrying the message to neople who have seldom seen or heard itbef ore we are speaking to audiencesthateagerly want to know what is going on we believe that the best way to buid a black theater is to work with our own people using as much original material as possible we believe in sparse non complicated sets with the emphasis on getting across the point of the play to the audience we believe that you cannot import theater we have had to learn this the hard way f or ultimately our theater should speak to the black community peopleto people rather than outsidertopeople we must build a black theater ourselves for certainly no one else can do it we will not become theater by rhetoric or by presenting f our or five new black plays a year we will not become theater just by wanting to become theater the writers of blkartsouth have produced some scripts in the last year of which six were produced by the theater these six were written by val ferdinand kush tom dent and sharon stockard if there is to be a black theater then the people must come together and produce it we must write our own scripts and direct our own shows and learn how to do everything else that is necessary to produce this theater we believe in a yea r round theater of actuality as opposed to a theater that exists for f esti vals and negro history week we in the south believe our work is as strong as that in any other black theater but the fact remains it does not matter how strong we are as individual theaters and groups of black artists unless we collect our strength it will amount to nothing the strength of blackness lies in the collective thrusts of diverse black forces if black theaters are to shake off the death grips of trojan horse white funding and the patronage of established and influential white critics we must produce a unified black theater movement and no matter how strong any single black theater is if we do not link up together there will be no black theater for our grandchildren to know i envision that if we want to we can show more brotherhood than we have up until now we can work closer together than we have up until now and we can in the very least communicate to each other what we are doing there is no reason in the world for us not to know of each others existence once we have begun to know and to recognize each other then we can get on with getting together our outlook for the year is to continue our work of developing an indigenous black theater we expect to be able to produce at least eight productions by the winter of the black mind jockeys will continue touring the country reading their work and they are always available for dates for more information call or write the free southern theater n miro st new orleans la our workshops in drama and writing which have proved to be very successful will continue as a permanent part of the theater program we will also include a variety of areas that are not strictly theater but that go hand in hand with our theater such as our black newspaper for the new orleans area the plain truth the development of black artists in our graphics workshop and the expansion of our journal of the black arts nkombo but more important than the work we are doing now is the need for all of us to begin to understand that black theater cannot grow unless we all grow we need each other to survive and thats all the seventies will be about for black people surviving if we survive this decade then we can say that we have done something that we have built something we can have black theater and anything else if we really want it and are willing to work together to erect it support black theater wherever it appears val ferdinand he voices have said that the white man would not care about the condition of watts after the revolt of the white man would tum his back what the hell you burnt it down you bad bad people now reap the rewards of your action and fortwo years it seemed as though the voices of hate were right programs flooded the area to last just long enough to raise hope and then plunged the despairing further into despair rumors ravaged the gullible talented young men were brainwashed destroyed forever there was a young man yes he is still alive but was is the correct word he was talented as a writer employed by a major studio the way to a new future opening up and then the voices of doom hate both black and white began to pull at this target it did not take long we as a people are unfamiliar with some subtleties of the outside world the voices said let the worst of the politicians win let them reach to their lowest level and then perhaps the rest of the nation the world will rise up in indignation and disgust any day a person might walk into the watts writers workshop and hurl his all too familiar challenge hey when you dudes gonna get that building you been talking about you know whiteys giving you a snow job dont you we didot know we could not allow it to be for the summer was coming and no matter what the papers said no matter what property was burned nothing compared to the lives that paid the price of a few days shouting to the world to hear us the man had been caught flat footed he had to hear us he had completely discounted the fire of dignity that pulsates in the guts of man even black men the heel of his boot had pressed so long so hard against the neck of the black man until it had gone to sleep and the man had been taken unaware but it would never happen again the blue and white armoured truck that carries and shields policemen would see to that the four cops to a patrol car the continually circling helicopter the nice new green sedan all these would see to that it seemed that the only things the cry of injustice had done was to awaken the oppressor to a more energetic form of oppression and to the people the fence surrounding them grew higher the guards stronger and more plentiful the voices of hate surer but there were those who did not allow this to make them lose their faith ithe humanity of man those both black and white who saw watts as a battlefield in which the words of man had to become real somehow someway the friendliness in eyes had to be turned into a definite object an act had to appear out of all the smiles and handshakes that would stand as absolute proof some people argued jobs thats the only way others education yet others culture and they were all right a place center workshop whatever you wish to call it where all of these things could be combined it was a natural the watts writers workshop was doing fine why not add a dance class an acting class why not a teacher of english and black history in one year we placed in college three young men who had no idea of the possibility of furthering their education a play big time buck white using one of our members in his first role went from the workshop to off broadway david moody is now in the musical version in san francisco other members have become television writers jeanne taylor has sold a script to tvs room odessa cleveland an actress has signed to tour europe in a tennessee williams play louise meriwether has sold her book and is t receiving offers from the movies mildred walter has sold her book lily of watts charles baireuther a new member has already made a sale of a short story and in a few days the acting class will be presenting new plays it was as though the entertainment industry had suddenly said now just a minute we are one of the foremost industries on the west coast and admit we are percent white it is not right it is not what america is all about and it is up to us to be among the first to change it image film television are a powerful convincer persuader we were a part of the makers of the black image we must help change it the studios came down and offered money but more than that knowledge individuals offered to teach classes it was hard at times the meeting of minds almost impossible but it happened a group called peoples inc came down hey you know there isnt a theater in watts we started to throw them out if we and watts watched and waited you cant get a permit for this was echoed so the council peoples inc and budd went to city hall sometimes we had calm meetings sometimes but the pernlit came and then the estimated figures began to soar if we skimp here no its got to be top shelf all the way needed now industry we called were not begging just open up the door and well do it ourselves new estimate hey man the voices asked yes the voices sounded a little different hey manwhats happening some of the once most vocal didnt know who the hell did they were a young group and the sincerity showed through hal stalmaster bob cohn bruce corwin and david zeitlin met with budd schulberg myself and the watts writers workshop council a film theatre in the workshop a great idea and so the concrete touchable object was born a place in watts for film to be shown no more eight to miletripswell wellwell bull the voices said its summer again here comes whiteys conbut things began to happen material began to arrive men carrying long rolled sheets of paper walked around the building and made figures in notebooks were now skeptical but silent something was happening not a whole world but it was happening the workshop began to overflow with talent looking for outlets and suddenly the industry discovered a new way of reaching talent we would like a goodlooking girl about to a young man of and a child of five can you help me could we help them ha they were almost to hollywood by now but what about the closed unions what about behind the cameras who is going to run the equipment in the watts theater set up training facilities its harder but the way is there and so it is going there are many more people i could name forty one members of the workshop not long ago worked in a picture halls of anger not a big deal to you but sometimes when a brother pa sses you pick up on that new look that new pride hey and you look proud too that is if you helped do it harry dolan whos got his own at cheyney by donald evans h eyney state college is a small school a few miles outside of philadelphia its student body spredomnantlyblak coming largely from the ghetto areas of philadelphia like most colleges today the student body at cheyney state is crying for more voice in school affairs they had been demonstrating for several years prior to my joining the faculty in one of their grievances centered around a need for more programs dealing with the black man and his peculiar situation in this country the administration had ears open so it seems but were slow to act and so the conflict reached a point of confrontation the young blacks against the system it was probably thought that more campus activities would occupy the students time and therefore alleviate some of the tensions whatever the reasons behind it i was hired to begin a drama program on cheyney s campus prior to my return to the school i had graduated f rom the institution in the early sixties the theater program was an annual play put on by an english class or the catch ascatch can drama society in the past they had served up a bill of things like beck et and m edea with an occasional foray into works like the bloodknot done im told in percent white face there were no lighting facilities no scenery and no costumes to give us a crawling start the auditorium doubled as classroom and general meeting room and was tightly scheduled in short we really had to build way in the back of my mind was the idea that cheyney state would become a good place for playwrights to try out new works and a theater devoted to the resurrection of seldom performed works by black playwrights it was already september and we still had not found a strong script to open with contacts with playwrights proved that the writers were being looked at by established companies or readying their plays for new york openings or connected with a group that promised immediate production for whatever they turned out or not interested in seeing the play done by a group of students one writer who had been produced in new york was so soured by the reaction of the critics that he no longer wished to see the work done whatever the reason we were in a bind earlier in the year i had met ronald milner at lincoln where he was writer in residence having had so many of my brothers close the door in my face i was somewhat dubious about approaching ron for permission to do whos got his own however hearing of my dilemma and anxious to find out about the reaction of an audience like cheyney he gave us the go ahead by this time we had already performed two plays in the series an old classic from and a little known work by a major writer rons play was definitely better than the second and asstrong as the first plus it was here now and relatively new it also turned out to be the most rewarding and exciting involvement of the year because it had somethingor rather several things that most of the new plays by black writerslack a definition of these unique qualities comes best through a description of the production from first reading to final performance first reading the first reading of whos got his own was approached with a bit more anxiety than usual i had worked with the performers on two productions already and had agood idea of their abilities i also knew that this play called for real acting there was no model for them to copy and we really had to create characters i wasnt sure that the actors were capable of examining themselves deep enough to find a germ on which to build the angry and frustrated people who lived in the world of the playtheir black ness alone told me that they had the experience but i wasnt certain that they had the skill to turn it into something creative and powerful additional uneasiness resulted from the fact that i knew ron mil ner personally and therefore had an increased desire to do justice to his play like most of the young playwrights i had talked to ron was very much concerned about the kind of production a college group might give whos got his own past experiences had proba bly lefta few negative impressions regarding the quality of work done in some schools my own group be ing new and never having tackled anything with the depth of whos got his own i was a bit tight myself especially since he had said he might get out to see the show the anxieties however did not last long as soon as the kids started reading the script i knew we were going to be okay we sadown around a table and did a dry read through a read through that was anything but drytwo pages into the play and the students had found some bit of the characters that came close to their own experiences the session was constantly interrupted as the students voiced their immediate reactions unlike the first sessions on the plays which preceded whos got his own these interruptions were not of the questioning kind they understood the motivations and nuances of the lines these young actors were commenting on their own lives and the similarity between the feelings of clara and tim and their own the session was becoming a kind of therapeutic talk session we were getting very close to each other comment getting together is extremely important in doing any play the cohesiveness of the company often makes exciting theatre of the most mediocre material and a loose company can make garbage of the best work imaginable one of the problems black groups have is finding a work they can really get together with doing works by non black playwrights do not give the actors the experience of delving deep into their emotional selves to find an element of truth for the black actor such plays are always classical in that they must be approached th r ough technique rather than psychological truth a good bit of the black actors training is therefore left out because he does not often have the chance to student actors margie barnes as clara and marilyn suiter as m ama in cheyney s p roduction of whos got his own by ronald milner go inside himself and use emotions as a basis for a characterization the problem is also presented in many of the works by black playwrights who concentrate so strongly on the argument of the play that they neglect to make the argument come from strong characters in dramatically moving situations to deal with a work that is totally propagandistic does not stretch the actor he must concentrate his efforts on the lines only a good playwright however realizes that a point can be made indelible through characterization one of the out standing qualities of whos got his own is that we react to the play because it presents us with p eople the ideas are one aspect of the total creative activity of the work realizing that he is tim jr a real live character an actor has only to make his equipment give formtothepersonin ordertomake the argument tangible so many of our revolutionary plays are mere harangues they do get the points across but the question is whether or not they give the argument any repeatable form to illustrate the point further one need only to look at big time buck white although this work is not by a black playwright it is perti nent here because it perfectly illustrates the result of a fusion of cultures white playwrights have long since lost their interest in plays of character they have concentrated their efforts on things best called theater pieces in these works the accent is on the how plays have been done in which the two characters are ping pong balls papier mache dolls and boxes none of these things have character the actor then must rally around the idea or the image at best these works have a temporary impact they are temporary because people react to people big time buck white is mid way between the old fashioned people plays and the new see it plays because buck white is more a thing than a character he represents an idea but is without a history as a person our involvement then is totally surf ace we can take home the argument we can even groove to the conception of the role but we do not store big tim among our cast of memorable people of the theater he is an idea not made tangible by character the therapeutic first session of our production of whos got his own was exciting because we had found peop le who turned us on like real life characters they presented us with possibilities rather than answers few black writers present young actors with such indepth characters after the initial reading it was obvious that the actors were committed to the play and would hustle to work out its problems the big problem in act dealt with the characterizations for the churchmen not having a history and not really moving throughout the act there was very little to hold onto surely we knew black ministers and this would help define attitude and rhythm for the characters we also knew however that there is no such thing as a ministe type except for the stereotypical things presented through the mass media were these men who worked the store front church like those in james baldwins amen corner or were we dealing with the sophisticated college trained big edifice minister in the middle class church the lines worked both ways we knew that we couldnt strain the idea of the ministers piety too much for fear of ending up with a docile purlie victorius the fact that the deacons had little to say was not a boon like the minister they required a totally creative approach we had to make a world for them to operate in outside that of the play except that they provided an extension of tim anger they were really extaneous and we felt that the scene would have been tighter with the three characters fused into one the only other choice was to risk the danger of creating three cliches comment one of the great dangers in dealing with black drama is the natural tendency toward the cliche this is somewhat different from creating stereotypical characters in that it is based on the idea that the black actor or director knows all about the character because he has encountered the type before the point of honesty in interpretation lies in the shared experience of the playwright and the actor i director thestereoty pe however assumes that what is seen is truth both premises lead to uninteresting characterizations they do so because neither will result in the depiction of a person the problem is a very minor one in whos got his own but many of the new plays are based solely on this kind of cliche we are presented with a young militant or a mother and that alone is supposed to be enough to define the rest of the relationship the ont positive aspect to this kind of writing is that it gives the director a degree of freedom not experienced when the characters are fully drawn the play can be played differently six million times but without ever approaching a definitive or genuinely moving conception of the work shorter plays often present us with cliches merely because they are short and time does not permit an in depth characterization act ii is by far the most compelling section of whos got h is own it is probably so because it presents us with very definite movement clara tim jrs sister carries the act and the action carries her we begin with a small girl who so we think has been naughty but we end with a full grown woman wrestling with very severe identity problems tim also moves a great deal in this act at the beginning he is a cocky angry and vengef ul man very self assured and seemingly on top of the situation by the end of the scene however he is probably the most confused member of the f amily and as we later find out on his way toward manhood it is only mama who stands still yet there is ample opportunity for growth in this character she has gained new knowledge knowledge which could possibly have shaken all supports from a weaker character it is mama who has the very strong curtain speech which implies that it is her development that we should surely have noted we found it difficult to get to the end of the act with the smoothness we desired because of structural elemen ts in act ii we saw it as being a solo by clara which became a duet by clara and tim and ended in a solo by mama the problem seemed to be that in order for mamas final solo to be effective the theme character had to be introduced and reinforced throughout the act in short mama was far too passive in the early scenes of act ii for her powerful final speech to be the result of gathering power we instead are given two thirds of clara or tim jr what are you saying this was the only section of the play that gave us any line difficulty because of the repetition of lines showing mamas confusion the interplay between clara and tim works beautifully because of milners skill with language the actor does not have to pl ay at being angry or cutting he just has to read the lines the power and passion of the lines in act ii are increased because they perf ectly define character and condition the words are the words of clara and tim the playwright does not become cute and write in literary cliches or try to win the profanity race but instead gives us a scene without a single dishonest or extraneou s word comment there is a great difference between writing language that is ethnically honest and writing dialogue that moves and defines a dramatic situation in attempting to create for the stage the language of black people many of our playwrights have overlooked the fact that all language must be refined c and selected if there is to be any kind of artistic concern present to take a street corner conversation and duplicate it without change on stage would not necessarily result in the creation of an interesting scene it takes the skill of a playwright to organize and refine the language and to support it with meaningful action stage language is a depiction of real conversation but it is not real in that the playwright hones away all of those things which do not communicate but are a part of each persons individual idiosyncracies with the rise of improvisational theater the playwright has lost some of his artistic control language has become less important than the image following this trend many of our revolutionary playwrights have attempted to record the scripts of some of the street comer action interesting for their realism but they are not plays they are transcripts of an action the untouched language of the spontaneous improvisation has an immediate impact but cannot stand up for repeated performances the problem probably has to do with would he look better in a sweater and chinos with a science book under his arm what happened to transform the american dream into a potential nightmare the answer to that question will depend of course upon the answer erthe run of the

black historys earlv advocates by benjamin quarles black history is now coming of age its midwife was carter g woodson a man of impressive scholarship he opened the rich vein of the black past from until his death in his pathbreaking work as author editor and publisher provided the base from which others could operate but woodson himself was indebted spiritually at least to a host of th century black leaders who had sounded a call for a revitalized study of afroamerican history all the present rests on the past said frederick douglass in in addressing a washington d c audience honoring him on his st birthday in james mccune smith like douglass a reformer called for an effort to place on the record a true account which the blacks now bear to this republica concise statement of the facts embodied in their resistance an elevation against odds sufficient to crush any ordinary variety of human species unless this were done wrote smith the grief among future scholars would match that of the ancient savants at the loss of the alexandrian library like other black leaders of the th century douglass and smith did not believe in reading history for historys sake to them the uses of history were of a more practical nature history as they saw it was an instrument it enabled one to understand the present thus suggesting a course of action furthermore to these black leaders of an earlier day a knowledge of history was useful in terms of their hopes for the future to go somewhere they felt was easier if one knew that he had come from somewhere they did not subscribe to the lachrymose concept of afroamerican history as nothing but an unending tale of persecution and suffering moreover they felt that a study of history would help in promoting racial selfrespect history rightfully told would refute the charges that blacks were inferior as never before or since the charge that black americans had no history and that africa had an unstoried past dominated the thinking of white americans of precivil war days aware of negro slavery in the south they tended to think that negro and slavery were synonymous reflecting the cultural arrogance of the western world during the th century they thought of themselves as civilized and of africans as barbarians black leaders rejected these views their protests grew louder with the coming of black weeklies the first of these appearing in followed three years later by the inauguration of the colored convention movement the latter was a coming together generally once a year of negro leaders with racial advancement their aim it was natural that the new colored organizations would come to the defense of africa extolling their old world forebears we claim to be the offspring of a parentage that once for their excellence of attainment in the arts literature and science stood before the world unrivalled so ran one of the resolutions adopted by the colored convention of this refrain of ancient african glory was echoed by any number of black speakers and writers africa was the garden and nursery where learning budded and education sprang orated david nickens at a fourth of july celebration held at the chillicothe ohio african methodist episcopal church in william g allen a journalist and later a college teacher prepared a public lecture entitled the origin and history of the africans according to a reporter who attended his lecture at the old south church in danvers massachusetts in april mr allen commenced with the somewhat startling assertion that africans originated the arts and sciences and gave the first impulse to civilization the reporter was impressed by allens irrefragable proof comparing him favorably with george bancroft greatest of the american historians seeking information on early africa lectureminded amos g beman a clergymanreformer addressed a letter on april to the great dictionary compiler noah webster then but a month from his death the learned lexicographer fired back a preemptory report of the woollyheaded africans who constitute the principal part of the inhabitants of africa there is no history and there can be none that race has remained in barbarism since the first ages of the world undeterred by websters reputation beman drafted a lecture on the origin and history of the african race as a home agent for the american missionary association beman delivered this lecture to black audiences throughout new england other leaders who joined in the movement to reclaim africa included samuel ringgold ward martin r delany and jeremiah b sanderson where is the history of the negro lamented clergyman ward in i think we need not despair he added for we have our glorious fatherland africafar superior to the proud and abuseful anglosaxon which is saying very little in the versatile delany journalist student of medicine and subsequently niger river explorer army major and reconstruction politicianwrote that africa was destined to rise in the majesty of ancient grandeur in a later book delany cited herodotus and diodorus siculus as proof that the world was indebted to early egypt and ethiopia for the propagation of religion philosophy arts science and literature which now illuminate the world in similar vein jeremiah b sanderson assured a stockton california audience that to african blood and mind we owed the sphinx the pyramids the greek alphabet and the popular mythology of greece and rome a fluent speaker with a love of learning sanderson was the foremost black educator in california in the late s organizing schools and teaching black historys early advocates did not ignore the home scene the role of american blacks who had stood out from the crowd few negro newspapers did not at some time or another recount the bittersweet story of phillis wheatley the slave girl who became a poet in writing about her some newspapers reproduced the letter which george washington had addressed to miss phillis from cambridge massachusetts on february others who might be signalled out by the black journals included benjamin banneker the mathematician and surveyor lemuel haynes learned pastor to white churches richard allen key figure in the founding of the african methodist episcopal church denmark vesey slave insurrection plotter and nat turner the most familiar of all to readers black or white historyminded blacks constantly called attention to the contribution that africanamericans had made in americas wars a colored convention held in detroit in took note of the war of in which black men had shown themselves to be valiant soldiers at the battle of new orleans a convention of new york state blacks meeting at albany on august declared that the splendid naval of achievements on lakes erie and champlain in that war were owing mostly to the skill and prowess of colored men black valor in the revolutionary war was a theme dear to afroamerican readers of history hence they hailed william c nells colored patriots of the american revolution published in nell whose father had been a steward on the general gadsden during the war of broke new ground in his book although he did not confine himself to the revolutionary war the book impressed the scholartheologian theodore parker who recommended it highly to historian george bancroft when you publish your next volume wrote parker to bancroft i hope you will send nell a copy negroes get few honors nells book had opened with the story of crispus attucks in the boston massacre the first to dieon the eventful march when the british soldiers fired into the crowd attucks had won a tragic fame that blacks would keep green in memory military companies in cincinnati and new york took the name attucks guards in a group of boston blacks led by nell petitioned the state legislature to appropriate money for a monument to attucks but with no success in boston blacks in protesting the dred scott decision held a crispus attucks day at faneuil hall with the banners and flags decorating the walls the singing groups with stirring airs and the impassioned speakers the affair was memorable crispus attucks day would be observed every subsequent year in boston until after the ratification of the fifteenth amendment in among the admirers of attucks was young john a copeland jr one of the black john brown raiders captured at harpers ferry in october as he sat in the charlestown jail awaiting the hangmans noose copeland thought that he saw a relationship between harpers ferry and the boston massacre at the beginning of the revolution wrote copeland in a letter to a friend the first blood spilt for freedom was that of crispus attucks and in the commencement of the struggle for the freedom of the negro slave the first blood spilt was that of a negro one who had come to try andfree his wife from the cruel hand of her master dangerfield newby black achievers and the black past were the themes of two nineteenth century blacks who were themselves historymakers in former slave william wells brown abolitionist and literary light published the black man his antecedents his genius and his achievements opening with an essay asserting that blacks had been leaders of civilization at certain periods of history brown presented a series of brief biographies these included ira aldridge the greatest shakespearean actor of his day and seven haitians including toussaint louverture a far more ambitious book a twovolume work was produced by george washington williams a manysided man at one time or another a civil war sergeant major ordained minister lawyer journalist politician and diplomat in williams produced his history of the negro race in america a creditable effort encouraged by its success williams in brought out a lengthy book on the black troops in the civil war distressed at the dearth of information on black history williams wrote a letter to the new york globe published in its issue on june proposing that an american negro history society be organized societies with a combination literaryhistorical outlook had existed among blacks since but they were local rather than regional or national the williams proposal was hailed by black emigrationist henry m turner who called it a grand conception a south carolina weekly new era voiced a hearty concurrence it is time that the negro had a literature but a national black history organization would have to await the th century coming in with the association for the study of negro life and history the new century would also bring other changes in africanamerican history notably in the calibre of writers and the widening of the clientele nineteenth century blacks who wrote history were men who as we have seen busied themselves in a variety of fields and occupations they did not profess to be professionally trained historians brown never intended as he said himself that his book should be considered as a history of our people williams had no formal training in the writing of history although from his extensive readt ing and his many contacts he had writes john hope franklin doubtless caught some of the new scientific spirit with the exception of williams and to a lesser extent of nell these early writers of black history did not bother to furnish their sources this tendency to dispense with formal documentation sometimes led them to claim more than the evidence would support moreover these writers lived during a spreadeagle era one given to bombastic and exaggerated language and this general proclivity for overstatement sometimes crept into their style writers of black history in the th century were as to be expected better trained in the discipline they wedded excavation to exhortation many of them devoted their entire careers to history teaching or writing moreover they tended to view black history as something not to be known by blacks alone but by whites also they believed that to the extent to which white people knew little or nothing about the historic role of their black countrymen to that extent they were living in a makebelieve world of the past indeed the blackrelated areas and aspects of american history loom so large and significant that today it is not surprising that many able white scholars have increasingly turned their attention to that rich lode nineteenth century exponents of black history were moved by a need centering largely within the black community the th cen tury practitioners shared this overriding concern but added to it a belief that white people too should be exposed to the liberating effect of black history perhaps a viewpoint that links the old and the new was expressed in a pamphlet a knowledge of history is conducive to racial solidarity written in by charles victor roman a doctor of medicine of philosophy and of law the negro never made any history because if anybody made history he was not a negro wrote roman i am not for preaching ethnic antagonism nor endeavoring to give a racial tinge to the facts of history but i do wish to widen the fields of taught history to include negroes who justly belong there the fight to reclaim african history by john henrik clarke he confrontation and the conflict that i am referring to did r v y not start at montreal for over ten years black scholars inj ii r terested in african studies have questioned white academic domination over this area of study black scholars were the w pioneers in this field and their formal interest and work goes back to the early part of the nineteenth century in an article african studies in the united states that i wrote for the aprilmay issue of africa report i called attention to the serious questions that some afroamericans are asking about the role of white africanists in the new african studies programssome of these questions are why are so many americans now studying about africa why are most of them white americans why are there so few black americans in decision making positions in present day african studies programs in light of the prevailing american attitude toward africa mainly negative before the freedom and independence exploration what is the basis of white americans interest in africa now these questions often asked but never answered motivated the formation of a black caucus at the eleventh annual conference of the african studies association in los angeles california in october the caucus was called by dr p chike onwuachi director of africancaribbean studies center fisk university nashville tennessee among those participating in the formation of the caucus were michael searles and nicholas onyewu federal city college washington d c lenard jeffries columbia university john h clarke associate editor freedomways nell painter san jose college jean douglass of new york city and shelby faye lewis of southern university baton rouge louisiana after several meetings of the caucus and one with the executive board of african studies association the following statement was issued the african studies association is called upon by the black caucus to immediately direct its energies towards rendering itself more relevant and competent to deal with the challenging times and conditions of black people in africa in the united states and in the whole of the black world in moving towards this objective we charge the association with taking the steps necessary to immediately broaden black participation in all phases of the associations operations we note that at present only one black person is holding a policydeciding position in this association dealing with predominately black countries and societies too few of the program chairmen and participants are drawn from black africanists and in general the association reflects the white caste and is identified with a white posture while trusting the academicians in the association we urge that black people be recruited for participation in the african studies association and that representation be drawn from those engaged in fields closely related to african and afroamerican studies with particular emphasis on black youth inside and outside the universities we see the future prospects of a vital and meaningful association linked directly to the significant strengthening of its ties with black africanists we encourage asa members to seek out african and afroamerican scholars to direct the rapidly developing afroamerican studies centers in the united states finally the asa must address itself in a meaningful and educational way to changing american public opinion based on deep racism and ignorance about the black people when the african studies association takes as its subjects the statement of the black caucus was discussed after it was read to the group by michael searles and submitted to the board of african studies association the result was that an ad hoc committee of the asa was created to inquire into the possibility of implementing the demands of the black caucus it was decided that a meeting would be held in new york during the christmas holidays john h clarke was chosen by the group to organize this meeting michael searles of washington d c was chosen to be acting chairman john h clarke chaired the new york meeting in the absence of michael searles who could not attend the following topics were discussed the organizations structure its legal status its formal officers its role as a clearing house for information relating to african studies its functions framework and its goals the financial backing of the association association membership and recruitment of members the permanent location of its secretariat the proposed name of the caucus and the feasibility of publishing dr nicholas onyewu suggested that the caucus consider holding its next meeting at federal city college in washington d c after an official invitation from the president of federal city the meeting was set for june through june the washington meeting ibrought the african heritage studies association into being the main findings and recommendations of this meeting are as follows report of the committee on relations with african studies association and other groups and organizations relationship with the african studies association afroamericans and africans should be given a role in the decijsionmaking process of the african studies association that is africans and afroamericans should be placed on all decisionmaking comimittees of the asa the black caucus of the asa should be consulted about appointments of afroamericans and africans to the executive comtmittee of the asa the asa should use its good offices to sponsor black scholars for fellowships increasing shares of money especially in the fields of history and archaeology should go to black scholars and preference should be given to black scholars until a better balance of whiteblack scholars in the field is achieved since the asa has power to influence the direction of funds in african studies this influence should be used to direct funds to black scholars and black institutions special effort should be made to include blacks in the program planning of the asa representation should come directly from the black caucus every effort should be made to appoint blacks as fellows of the asa moreover the asa should recruit in black universities for students who are interested in african studies the african heritage association should aid these black universities by providing them with program ideas for black studies as well as consultants materials and lecturers black universities should encourage their scholars to participate in the black caucus of the asa the association should encourage black institutions to convene conferences for the study and evaluation of materials submitted to them on black studies predominately black colleges should be encouraged to assume leadership positions and feeder positions for elementary and secondary schools with respect to the dissemination of materials and the teaching of african studies black scholars at these colleges should be encouraged to lend or give their materials to public schools and to play a more direct role in the structuring of african programs for public schools it was decided that our immediate objective should be the formation of committees and subcommittees to facilitate as rapid progress as possible in our getting started these committees are to embody our main objectives for the association which include publication education and communication generally under publication it was decided that of vital importance would be the starting of a newsletter in order to get ourselves moving fast to inform others interested in the field and to keep up on the rapidly changing scene in black studies tied to the newsletter would be the drawing up of a register of black scholars in the field it was also recommended that we start a black studies journal sponsored by ahsa as soon as possible to be published by a strong commercial publisher to be decided upon later the educational function was discussed in terms of the need for the following for black people to have control over our own history its interpretation etc to challenge the arrogance of white scholars to define our history for us to set up a clearing house of information in black studies aiding in our evaluations of programs literature etc and to open up opportunities for black scholars who present scholarly papers at seminars symposiums etcall facilitating intelligence and communication among black africanists also the need was expressed for setting up a selected list of black consultants in the field to guard against selfcontrol exploitation in the field that would be detrimental to black studies and black scholars in this field other objectives include the need to reach african countries directly through embassies to facilitate greater communication and interaction between africans and afroamericans a meeting was planned between the executive committee of african heritage studies association and asa for october in montreal canada the purpose of this meeting was to define the future relationship between ahsa and asa this meeting carefully planned far in advance never took place other events ruled it off the agenda these events forced the members of african heritage studies association to move ahead of their own schedule and become the official spokesman for the black intellectuals in montreal canada during the th annual conference of asa part of the confusion at montreal was due to the fact that the main aims and objectives of ahsa had not been made known to any appreciable number of the attending black intellectuals who could have explained these objectives to the students had these objectives been known the revolt against the domination of the conference by white scholars might still have occurred but it is my opinion that this revolt would have been more orderly and constructive for the record the main aims and objectives of the african heritage studies association are stated here education reconstruction of african history and cultural studies along afrocentric lines while effecting an intellectual union among black scholars the world over acting as a clearing house of information in the establishment and evaluation of a more realistic african or black studies program presenting papers at seminars and symposiums where any aspect of the life and culture of the african peoples are discussed relating interpreting and disseminating african materials to elementary and secondary schools colleges and universities international to reach african countries directly through embassies in order to facilitate greater communication and interaction between africans and africans in the americas to assume leadership in the orientation of african students in the u s and orientation of afroamericans in africa establish contacts to form a committee to monitor american foreign policy towards africa to strengthen and support congressman charles diggs mich as chairman of the house subcommittee on african affairs domestic to inform all other black associations and organizations of the existing responsibilities in the area of black studies to solicit their influence and affluence in the promotion of black studies and in the execution of ahsa programs and projects to arouse social consciousness and awareness of these groups toussaint louverture black liberator by lawrence p crouchett oussaint louverture was described by alphonsede beauchamp as one of the most remarkable men in an age rich in remarkable men this was the same age when the names of such men as george washington thomas jefferson benjamin franklin william pitt talleyrand and napoleon bonaparte were on the lips of all western men this black haitian slave led the first successful black revolution in the western hemisphere his military and political genius saved the united states from possible french and british invasionat a time when she was militarily weak by lawrence p crouchett and opened the way for the u s to later purchase the louisiana territory france had successfully colonized and exploited the lands of saint domingue toussaints homeland in the west indies and had developed it into the largest producer of cotton cocoa indigo coffee tobacco and sugar cane in the western hemisphere at one time the colony imported and exported twothirds of all frances commerce by the eve of the black insurrection this colony alone supplied the sugar coffee and cotton to half of europe and was second to great britain in receiving the exported products of the united states toussaint and his warriors success delayed alleged british and french plans to invade the united states via the louisiana territory the british had long sought to retake her lost colonies and napoleon aspired to build a global empire instead of expressing their gratitude americans of that era saw these blacks victory as a threat to their continued enslavement of blacks in the southern united states now they lived in dread of another toussaint louverture rising among their slaves to them the success of the haitian black revolutionists could serve as a catalyst to inspire and encourage more slave insurrections in the slave states many of the democratic gains made in the french revolution began to spread to the inhabitants of saint domingue white colonists and mulattoeswhose only common bond was propertybecame allies and began to make new demands on the local colonial government the french assembly further antagonized the white colonists by passing legislation granting additional civil_rights to the mulattoes placing them on a more equal basis with the whites who feared these democratic tendencies might spread to the colonys black slaves soon the whites and their allies of property began to agitate for the colonys independence from france the french governor of saint domingue and his ruling party became restless over this agitation during the summer of the loss of the colony could retard napoleons plans to build a great colonial empire greater than his european rivalsgreat britain and spain to put down the growing agitation they took a cue from techniques used by the french third estates in obtaining concessions from the king the governor and his followers decided to stage a mock slave insurrection through this they honed to frighten the white colonists in particular into realizing their dependency upon the mother country france and their inability to put down any slave rebellion or even to con tinue subjecting the blacks to slavery without outside help being well respected by both planters and fellow slaves toussaint was approachedby representatives of the governmentto lead a mock rebellion for his role in the socalled rebellion he was guaranteed his freedom but not until the colonial government forces had defeated him and his fellow insurrectionists further all undeserved whipping of slaves was to cease and all slaves were to be granted an additional free day a week for their participation it was emphasized that collective emancipation was not part of the bargain the black slaves were to begin their revolt by prearranged signals from the french colonial officials both sides agreed on the night the revolt was to begin and toussaint agreed to lead this mock rebellion on the night of august the revolt began as planned but within a few hours of makebelieve the blacks saw an opportunity to settle old scores with their cruel masters and their mulatto cohorts the white colonists were shocked but the french officials were doubly shocked when more than blacks launched a real insurrection against the white colonists toussaint however hesitated in joining the real revolt he knew of the many abortive attempts made in the past and he was convinced that a real revolt would be futile so he remained on his masters farm for more than a month in october after seeing that his family was safely across the frontier into the spanish colony he joined the revolution within months he rose from doctor of sanitation to general of the armies toussaints father was the son of an african chieftain of the arada tribe who was captured near dahomey west africa and sold into slavery he was sent to saint domingue where he was purchased by jesuit priests who taught him to read and write the father and his family were converted to catholicism and remained so throughout the revolution toussaint was born around always of short stature and physically thin he was assigned to guarding cattle and serving as a stable boy during these assignments his father taught him to read and write as well as to reflect upon his servile conditions these lonely assignments allowed him time to read and digest caesars commentaries and roman historyfrom which he learned most of his political and military techniques his effective leadership for the blacks freedom resuited from repeated readings of abbe raynals history of the indies in this book toussaint first read raynals warning to european nations that your slaves will break the yoke that weighs upon them the negroes only lack a leader during the black revolt france convinced spain to retrocede louisiana to her hoping to use the territory to break saint domingues dependency upon the united states wars with great britain and later the united states had made france realize her dependency upon u s commerce for the colonys survival conversely the united states not only acknowledged saint domingues commercial value but also its military value to both the british and french the colony could be used as a stepping stone to the u s mainland too the new england states exported over percent of their products to saint domingue and from which they imported most of their rum and molasses on the eve of the black rebellion the united states and saint domingue had not only become commercially but also militarily interdependent the united states certainly had a stake in the outcome of this black revolution its occurrence postponed napoleons plan to occupy the louisiana territory thus saving this country by may toussaint and his armies had joined with the french colonial armies against the white colonists seizing this as an opportunity the french directory pleaded with toussaint to join them in an invasion of louisiana his suspicion of the french and determination to complete the war for the blacks freedom caused him to recognize this diversionary tactic by the french instead he secretly negotiated a treaty with the u s and great britain in exchange for special naval and commercial help from his new allies he assured them he would not send an expedition against their possessions it was this refusal to join the french at this time that allowed the united states time to negotiate the purchase of louisiana thus denying france a foothold on the u s mainland this treaty also assured u s much needed trade relations with saint domingue failing to defeat toussaint and his brave black warriors napoleon gave up his plans for louisiana and offered to sell it to the united states for unintentionally toussaint louverture aided the u s in acquiring the louisiana territory which doubled the countrys territorial areamoving the western boundary from the mississippi river to the rocky mountains the u s conversely contributed to the success of this first black revolution by continuing commercial trade with the blacks throughout their insurrection knowing that slavery would be restored if they failed in their revolt the blackswithout the leadership of toussaint who had been tricked by the french general charles leclerc captured and sent to france for imprisonment continued their rebellion until success came in october when the colony declared its independence from france to emphasize their complete break with the french and memories of their enslavement the blacks renamed the colony haiti the original indian name for the island haiti became the second republic in the new world the u s having become the first in it also has the distinction of being the only country in the western hemisphere to credit its independence based upon the revolution of black african slaves ironically the united states after having contributed to the independence of haiti withheld official recognition of it as an independent country until after she too became involved in a civil war over the same issue the enslavement of black people study in black brown and beige by leslie b rout jr youre like me youve probably read gilberto freyre or j ir frank tannenbaum or watched a couple of cbs reports j ii paged through holiday or some comparable journal per ap s y u ve talked to a brazilian or two if youve done any w of these things you know already that no racial problems exist in brazil maybe the brazilian you talked to was more discreet he would then have informed you that there is less racial discrimination in brazil than any place else in the world as the story is usually told unlike the anglosaxons who set up shop at jamestown or plymouth rock the portuguese gentlemen who migrated to the new world had significantly fewer qualms about nighttime integration the result was that in addition to the obvious black slaves and white masters there appeared an increasing myriad of colored persons who were part of both but not really of either accordingly and this is in keeping with the legend the brazilians adopted the converse of the formula adopted by the anglosaxons where the english settled any measure of negro blood made you a negro in brazil any discernible quantity of white blood made you at least a pardo mulatto ultimately it was probably very much a question of what one could get those higher up in the pecking order to believe sfc sfc in todays united states of america where racial troubles can no longer be swept under the carpet the brazilian legend exercises a peculiar influence for afroamericans such as this writer brazil beckons as a kind of tropical shangrila as a friend once put it man after i make my pile here then im splitting for coffeeland when i can enjoy it others wonder how a nation which maintained slavery until may where illiterates possibly outnumber literates and where political democracy can hardly be said to have taken giant strides could do what the gringo goliath could not satisfy the hopes and aspirations of its nonwhite citizens this story really begins the second time i saw walt disneys saludo amigo there was jose carioca and lots of samba and seemingly a country where the living was easy rather than hectic then there was black orpheus lots of samba and a plenitude of carnival more important orpheus although a lowly bondes streetcar driver seemed to possess a peculiar kind of personal security in the land of the anglosaxon without identification signs as big as life senator brooke of massachusetts andor congressman william dawson of illinois are like george washington jones of birmingham alabama niggers to be kept in their place afroamericans in the land of uncle sam are acutely aware of their dependence upon whitey lock stock and credit card orpheus was black like me and so poor he could hardly have afforded a free lunch yet his view of himself as a functioning member of the brazilian body politic gave him a kind of quiet support black yankees cannot achieve cadillac or no cadillac education or no education orpheus felt he belonged afroamericans do not believe they do in june the paul winter sextet of which i was a member won the intercollegiate jazz festival held at georgetown university as fortune would have it somebody in washington dc noticed that the six members of the group were split evenupthree blacks and three whites could you have dreamed of a better combination to send on a governmentsponsored tour of latin american colleges and universities a sevenmonth tour was dropped into our laps secretly i resolved that if brazil resembled the land of orpheus jose carioca tannenbaum and gilberto freyre it must eventually open its arms to a new immigrant me la arriving in porto alegre may the first thing i tended to notice was that brancos in brazil found nothing strange about fraternizing with negroes one saw pretos and pardos frequently but as my portuguese was limited to such terms as macanudo and the usual unprintable terminology you always seem to learn first it was nearly impossible to communicate with them exceedingly noticeable on the campuses of the universities and in the theaters was the absence of negroes at sextet concerts whites i questioned assured me that although the concerts were free most afrobrazilians were of the lower economic classes and rarely attended affairs where middle and upper class senhores predominated previous experiences in south america had convinced me that some kind of class system would be found everywhere the explanations given were logical but in my opinion insufficient somehow or another i had to meet a few pretos and get their side of the story jazz musicians meet their counterparts wherever they seem to go in the world and with the music as a medium friendships are forged through cepu a black tenor saxophone player i met in a rio nightclub i finally met some pretos who spoke english speaking directly to the gentlemen both of whom were musicians i remarked that none of the black members of the sextet had encountered any incidences of discrimination in brazil one of the brazilians smiled and said things are not as they seem they are more subtle here this was to be inkling number one you might say in this regard probably the most interesting character i would meet was a young negro from omaha nebraska named bill waters waters had decided to take one year off go to brazil and see whether he wanted to move there permanently when i met him his stay in rio had exceeded ten months he stated that while he liked brazil it had not been the racial nirvana hed hoped to find indeed he was amazed at the ease with which the black members of the sextet moved among rios social elite he later confided in me that he felt certain that the prestige of the department of state opened doors otherwise hermetically sealed at the time i was enjoying myself to such a degree that waters reservations seemed sour grapes the whole issue reemerged about three months later when bill stopped in chicago on his way to omaha having just returned to the usa i threw a small party and invited waters afterwards he remarked you know les i saw more integration here tonight than i saw in twelve months in brazil what he really meant was miscegenation and secretly i had to admit that while everywhere in brazil one sees pardos had seen precious little intermingling on a social level admittedly it was the pretos you saw pushing the brooms but the witness of my own adventures as a musical diplomat in sambaland were afroamericans and early panafricanism by clarence g contee ie of the very important strands of the many threads that go to weave the whole cloth of african nationalism is called panafricanism the history of panafricanism before is largely the story of the dedicated and unselfish efforts made by new world negroes especially those of the united states to them panafricanism meant the protest of oppressive and exploitative conditions of negroes all over the world they saw a need for unity among these brothers and kin as a tactic for pressure to get these conditions changed they believed that even though black africa was being conquered selfdetermination and independence would inevitably return to the people there it was believed very deeply that equal treatment of negroes with whites was related to these pur by clarence g contee poses of panafricanism the first official use of the term panafrican grew out of the panafrican conference of which was held in london and attended by thirtytwo delegatesmainly new world negroes among those who attended was a young harvard phd graduate web du bois it has been generally conceded that the panafrican conference of was the brain child of henry sylvesterwilliams a young negro from trinidad living at that time in london it was he who did most of the work to convene the conclave but the sentiment for black unity for the protest of the depressing conditions of negro life everywhere and the hope for a strong and powerful african state or empire run by negroes were not new in t thomas fortune a negro editorpublisher of the new york age a negro weekly made a speech at the congress on africa held in atlanta georgia at the gammon theological seminary his speech called for the nationalization and the unification of africa under black rule the bible predicted it he concluded he claimed in that it was he who gave the idea for the panafrican meeting to henry sylvesterwilliams who was visiting the united states in the late s one thing is clear williams received the support of booker t washington who knew t thomas fortune there was a haitian diplomat benito sylvain who also claimed that he had thought of the idea of calling together leading negroes of the world at the turn of the century difficult years although the origin of the pan african conference is in doubt the same is not true of the motives for the meeting the late s were a particularly difficult set of years for blacks everywhere the cult of white supremacy was constructing its temples in the united states with federal and state laws european nations were busy bringing by force western civilization and culture to the backward and inferior blacks in africa a natural calamity added to the woes of the black british west indians as the negroes were receiving the new ways they were losing their freedom their land and their resources therefore there was a general need almost a compulsion for negroes to look to themselves and their liberal white friends for support and to protest the blatant abuses of the premises that all men were created equal and entitled to selfdetermination and some control over their own destinies but the methods of protest and unity were traditional most of the early black and white protestors were moderates who believed in peaceful and gradual change through the accepted methods revolution was not the vehicle for these individuals from to there was no real panafrican movement despite the pronounced aims of the panafrican conference of to establish one but the idea of the rise of panafricanism as a movement for unified pressure by the black world and for eventual self determination for africans especially those in africa the homeland remained very much alive the leadership shifted more than ever into the hands of negroes in the united states the hope was there that a strong and effective panafrican movement could be developed booker t washington remembered the panafrican conference and in called for another meeting it was at this juncture that fortune claimed he was the originator of the idea for the assembly in at tuskegee alabama a meeting was held but it was a typical booker t washington gathering very few sentiments of african nationalism and few words of protest emerged his meeting was dominated by white missionaries who accepted the accommodation philosophy the only visible effort made by the followers of du bois was the shortlived panafrican department in of the niagara movement yet africans and du bois wrote of their hope for a second and more vibrantly sustained panafrican movement restructuring map when world war i began du bois an afroamerican leader and the anticipated successor to the throne of the deceased booker t washington took the lead in trying to use the territorial changes of the war and the selfdetermination principle as opportunities to promote african nationalism and the restructuring of the african map into large african states he won the support of the naacp an organization he helped found and for which he worked as editor of its organ the crisis with the financial and psychological support of the naacp he pushed his campaign into the significant revival of the movement at the panafrican congress in paris during the peace conference he aimed to exert pressure on the decisionmakers in paris to grant some steps toward selfdetermination for africans in africa the meeting attended by fiftyseven moderate blacks and whites most of whom were afro americans from the united states once more advocated traditional means of social change for blacks everywhere there were some africans present such as blaise diagne black senegalese french deputy and the liberian delegation to the peace conference but the accomplishments of du bois and the other delegates were few although du bois reported and wrote that he had helped set up the machinery the permanent mandates commission of the league of nationsfor the internalization of the former german colonies in africa many negroes in the united states including du bois had wanted the german colonies turned over to africans for selfrule the most important achievement was the publicity du bois received for the panafrican congress of under the circumstances it was a triumph just to hold it illusion of greatness to the afroamericans in the united states the panafrican congress had the illusion of greatness it was great for a commencement what was needed next was an effective internationally united black voice of protest as a watchdog to see to it that progress toward selfdetermination in africa particularly in the mandated areas was absolute and continuous the leadership of panafricanism concentrated more than ever in the hands and works of du bois who rose steadily as the major negro leader in the world black community after his return from europe du bois spoke on the panafrican congress of in washington he drew an appreciative overflow crowd miss nannie h burroughs a wellknown washington educator and a spectator was dubious about the personality of du bois to lead such a movement she said so to james weldon johnson the first afroamerican secretary of the naacp but the spingarn medal a coveted award prestigigiously given to a negro for achievement and service to the negro community was awarded du bois in the award was made by a committee of the naacp du bois was at the peak of his career vengeful competition just as du bois was given the spingarn medal for his moderate conception of panafricanism there burst into the limelight for five years another concept a much more militant one to offer consistent bitter and vengeful competition the challenge to du bois and the naacp came from an unexpected source the universal negro improvement association led by marcus mosiah negro digest february garvey a black british west indian from jamaica who advocated the use of force their central approaches to pan africanism focused on a backto africa movement an allnegro owned and operated steam ship line worldwide black unity and an african empire all of these were to be under the direct control of marcus garvey and the unia his mass followings produced meetings of at one time in the madison square garden and large crowds at his liberty hall meeting place in harlem his annual conventions in harlem were considered by some to be world black parliaments garvey thus had an organization and panafrican meetings in direct confrontation with the naacp and the panafrican congress of du bois but their competition over a moderate or a militant approach served to emphasize the fact that panafricanism was based mainly in new york and elsewhere in the new world one hesitates to speculate about the possibilities of african redemption had du bois and garvey cooperated garvey spurred the evidence indicates that the rise of garvey spurred du bois and the other moderate advocates of panafricanism and african nationalism to hold a much larger and more widely attended panafrican congress of which was the best and most productive held during the years when the panafrican congresses were led by web du bois sessions at london brussels and paris produced an appeal to the league of nations and a constitution a manifesto which was an answer to the declaration of the rights of the negro peoples of the world of the unia the hope was that the panafrican congress movement would finally create a permanent pressure group of blacks and liberal whites the concrete achievements of the panafrican congress of were easier to see but the continuity of the panafrican congress movement was not too easy to discern there was no extended high plateau for panafricanism during the s the peak was quickly reached and quickly passed there were many reasons for this unfortunate course of both movements despite the evident success of the panafrican congress of the national officers of the naacp refused to donate more financial aid to the panafrican congresses du bois had to use his own limited resources this was a serious blow but even more significant was the continued confusion about the du bois and the garvey movements many people could see no fundamental differences in the programs of the two men the unia and the leader marcus garvey suffered from business mismanagement and legal tangles garvey was jailed in for mail fraud and then deported in because he was an undesirable alien most important of the reasons for the rapid decline of both movements was the lack of interest on the part of new world negroes in the redemption of africa most negroes did not want to go back to africa or worry too greatly over african conditions things were bad enough at home the next two panafrican congresses in held in london and lisbon and in new york reflected the decline the fact that the last panafrican congress under the guidance of du bois was held in new york was furtherproof that afroamericans were in command some africans attended this assembly the assumption of black african leadership began in and not in as has been generally thought in london a colony of africans and afroamericans joined at the outbreak of the italoabyssinian war of the italian conquest of the symbol of black freedom in east africa ethiopia revived the feelings of negroes for united action to protest the hypocrisy of the european powers who stood by passively during the conquest all over the black world sentiments erupted for blacks to do something to help haile selassie the emperor of ethiopia when he entered into exile in london he was met at the station on his arrival by a representative of a panafrican organization jomo kenyatta who later became the first president of kenya they and their white liberal friends continued to meet and to protest european invasions thus a continuity was provided from the panafrican activities in london during the italianethiopian conflict down to the manchester meeting of the panafrican congress in m at the manchester meeting there was no longer any doubt that african nationalists from africa were in charge of the panafrican movement which had formerly been largely the work of new world negroes especially those in the united states like du bois and garvey even though he attended the manchester congress du bois knew that he had become the svm w bol and was no longer the leader leadership shifts at the manchester england meeting in october it was immediately evident that the shift of leadership from the new world blacks to black africans had definitely occurred the africans were ii much more numerous and active than at any other meeting among the wellknown africans to attend i were dr kwame nkrumah americaneducated first black prime minister in black africa in the j gold coast later ghana and jomo kenyatta for the first time militancy was much in evidence demands for autonomy and for independence were unequivocal there was even i talk of the use of violence as a last resort to obtain equality selfgovernment and independence resolutions were adopted in support of the oneman one vote principle during the next two years nkrumahs dream of a united states of africa became the dream of many africans the first panafrican meetings on african soil came in four previous events symbolized the continued domination of panafricanism by africans the first event was the independence of india in africans drew much inspiration from this transition it marked the beginning of the afroasian solidarity for liberation and for third world aims the second was the egyptian revolution of gamal abdal nasser in this marked the beginning of a more militant arab and moslem nationalism the third was the bandung indonesia conference in where asians and some african observers condemned colonialism imperialism and racial discrimination afroasian leadership and solidarity were strengthened ghana and nkrumah finally in ghana gained its independence under the militant leadership of nkrumah who took it upon himself to lead the panafrican movement under his urgings and his direction two meetings were held in accra the capital of ghana in in april all of the independent states of africa except south africa met and committed themselves to the liberation of the rest of africa and to remain neutral in the cold war in december instead of the states meeting the leaders of liberation movements and african political parties came to receive advice and to exchange tactics about the ultimate objectives of an africa completely free of colonialism exploitation and racial discrimination and an africa eventually united as one political area eleven years later the dream of a united states of africa remains just that while there are areas still in colonial hands how long it will take before these two aims are attained is anybodys guess the myth of benevolent spanish slave law by gwendolyn midlo hall he accepted publica tions in the field of comparative slavery in the americas have je part ej from the assumption that spanish slave law was unusually protective towards the slaves stanley elkins herbert klein louis hartz all cite frank tannenbaums slave and citizen as the foundation upon which their research and conclusions are based the foundation is very shaky indeed the spanish slave code of is cited extensively by these writers you can find this code printed in books but as the great cuban historian and jurist fernando ortiz pointed out back in when he ridiculed sir harry f johnson for making not a few comments about this unpromulgated code this code was never so much as promulgated much less enforced anywhere in or around the spanish caribbean when the code was first sent to the colonies the planters and merchants from cuba puerto rico venezuela and louisiana which then belonged to spain got together in a meeting and sent the code back to madrid saying that if such a law were published the slaves would rise up in rebellion madrid took it back and never tried to promulgate it again in the spanish caribbean if tannenbaum had read the very sources he cites fernando ortiz and jose antonio saco he would have learned this elementary fact apparently he didnt and no one else has bothered to check him out lo these many years what other legal evidence does he offer the siete partidos of rey alfonso el sabio alfonso the wise he was wise all right he ruled during the th century in toledo spain toledo had been one of the great intellectual centers of the moors at the time when the rest of europe was going through what even western historians call the dark ages alfonso the wise set up a translation center where arabic and hebrew scholarly works were translated into latin thereafter they were distributed throughout europe and pawned off as original works much of western philosophy theology science medicine mathematics aesthetics optics architecture agriculture irrigation law and government literary forms and techniques musicology including the rhythmic notation system this system is called the franconian system after the german monk who copies it from the arabswell you name it they plagiarized it a moorish chronicler living in those times wrote do not give arabic manuscripts to the christians because they will translate them into latin and claim them as their own this king should be known as king alfonso the plagiarizer but to get back to our subject tannenbaum claims that the protectiveness of medieval iberian slave law was carried over from roman slave law now there are historians in this country arnold sio for example who have pointed out that roman slave law was extremely harsh it hasnt occurred to anyone yet that the major influence upon the siete partidas might be islamic islamic codes were protective of slaves in any case the siete partidas never was applied to america i have thoroughly searched and a few other historians have thoroughly searched spanish slave law before the code spanish slave law deals almost exclusively with security measures it deals with requiring slaves to have written passes when they leave their masters property forbidding them to have arms to own or ride horses it deals with brutal punishments for runaway slaves including ham stringing cutting off noses and ears castration it deals with control of emancipated slaves or free africans forbidding them from living in indian villages forcing them to live in separate villages where they can be supervised made to pay tribute and forced to present themselves upon the labor market it deals with barring them from skilled trades from schools from intermarriage and conscripting them for military service there were even some attempts in th century mexico to reenslave the entire free black population there are some early measures encouraging religious education and encouraging marriage among the slaves but even these measures they explain are to hold the slaves to the estates with family ties and to encourage submission to their masters through religious education what is really rare in spanish slave law before the code is concrete measures regulating work hours requiring masters to provide food clothing and medical attention requiring masters to provide for old or sick slaves unable to work measures restricting the type or amount of punishment a master can inflict upon a slave and making the master criminally responsible for the serious injury or death of his slave as a result of punishment or measures guaranteeing trial in the civil courts for slaves accused of serious crimes in fact in the realm of concrete protective measures spanish slave law is vastly inferior to french slave law and even to british slave law the concrete protective measures of the spanish slave code of were consciously copied from the french code noir which dates all the way back to many of the paragraphs of the spanish code of appear to be direct translations of the code noir and if this in itself is not convincing there is a document dating from instructing the framers of the spanish slave codes to copy the french code noir the nowfamous spanish slave code of it has been quoted so extensivelv lately that it has be come probably the most famous unpromulgated law in history claims in its preamble that it is a codification of existing spanish slave law in the americas tannenbaum accented this statement without investigating whether or not it was true and concluded that spanish law in the americas had always been protective of the slaves so here is an entire theory based upon a code that was never promulgated in the spanish caribbean it apparently was promulgated where there werent many slaves anyway and claiming falsely that it was a codification of existing spanish slave law in the americas what other legal evidence does tannenbaum cite this pious statement from the king dating from and directed to the captain general of cuba that after privately calling the masters of these slaves you say to them in my name that they must not for whatever motive rigorously tighten the wage they receive from their slaves for having been tried in other places it has proved inconvenient harming the souls of these people which is a matter for grave scruples that for their own consciences sake the master must avoid and at the same time i command you that if at any time these masters mistreat them the slaves you will apply the necessary remedy it is not just to consent to or permit any excess in this matter for their slavery is a sufficient sorrow without at the same time suffering the distempered rigour of their masters tannenbaum picked up this piece of a law from the cuban historian saco now while saco opposed the slave trade he defended slavery itself to the bitter end the full text of this law and some other relevant documents have since been published in a collection of documents which throw new light upon this pious statement and illustrates the dangers of relying upon secondary sources on so controversial a subject as slavery his majestys attention had been called to a persistent problem in his kingdom of the indies it seems some masters were forcing their slaves into theft and prostitution some of the slave women were wandering around the port cities in the nude soliciting customers and creating quite a scandal the masters were demanding that their street slaves bring back each day a much larger sum of money than they could possibly secure through legitimate means punishing them severely if they didnt bring back the amount of money the masters were demanding the king instead of fixing a maximum amount a master could demand of his street slave as his advisors had apparently recommended contented himself with exhortation this pious but impotent statement is quoted over and over again by these highly qualified historians to prove how mild slavery was in latin america by the way dont think that i street slaves no longer exist our cities are teeming with them they are called junkies their masters are the organized crime syndicates which often own everyone in local government who counts they addict their street slaves to hard narcotics monopolize the supply and control the prices then the syndicate collects every penny the junkies can beg borrow steal and prostitute themselves for the junkies also sell as much dope as rthey can to support their own habits and create new customers for the syndicate they devote about hours a day to their various occupations gilberto freyre estimates the average working life of a brazilian street slave at seven years i would make about the same estimate of life expectancy for the street slaves of detroit the content hasnt changed only tithe form i hope you dont think r this is an irrelevant comment i believe the past teaches us about the present and the present teaches rus about the past at least thats how it works with me ill give you some of my conclusions about the role of slave law based upon comparative research i have quite a bit of evidence to back me up which i cant possibly present here but i am presenting it in my dissertation the colonial authorities were there to look out after the interests of the mother country the slave system was a tremendous source of wealth for the mother country and colonial officials were there to see to it that nothing jeopardized the continued prosperity of the colony and the stability of the slave system slave law was concerned with preserving order in the colony maintaining and developing its wealth and continuing the dependency of the colony upon the mother country the main concern of slave law including its protective aspects was social control in the broadest sense those measures which tend towards protecting the slaves cannot be understood as indications of the disinterested humanitarianism of the colonizing powers they stemmed from fear of the slaves their potential threat to public order to the prosperity or even the continued existence of the colony these concerns often came into conflict with the plantation owners drive for immediate profit the masters did not consider the long range impact of their activities upon the colony the problem was especially acute among absentee owners and among colonists whose orientation was to make as much money as soon as possible and then return to the metropolis in other words the colonial authorities were afraid that the masters looking to their immediate interests alone might abuse neglect and exasperate their slaves to the point of provoking rebellion and the loss of the colony to the mother country as the continued existence of the slave trade was increasingly called into question the mother country was also concerned that the work force might die out and could not be replaced this latter concern is reflected in reform laws tending towards encouraging procreation and protecting pregnant and nursing slaves and newborn slave children far from being unusually protective towards the slaves the spanish system was the only one i have studied in any depth which actually operated a flourishing slave plantation system without any legal controls to speak of because spain was weak during the th century it could not impose its will upon the cuban planters and practically no controls were exercised upon the plantations civil government in the cuban countryside was predatory here is a description from a th century travel account of the capitanes de partido or petty judges who being without salaries like so many vultures prey upon the unprotected within their jurisdiction nor are the rich without the pale of their power and those who have not influence with the heads of the island government are sometimes largely fleeced by them on most frivolous pretexts this traveller describes one of these petty judges whose chief boast was the sums he could collect in fines from his neighbors while riding through the country with sword and pistols his slouched hat coattee that had crawled up on his shoulders and pantaloons struggling to escape from their straps his face unshaven and his whole person covered with dust he might readily have been taken for a prowling thief has anybody ever seen a rural sheriff in the south or the vice squad in detroit those of us who know what law and government does to the unprotected will not make these silly mistakes when we become historians plantation slavery in th century cuba was lawless to the point of jeopardizing its own continued existence instead of legal protections which might have sought to prevent the system from transcending limits conducive to its own survival the system got completely out of hand and the government authorities resorted to overkill to maintain order the great cuban historian fernando ortiz writing about midth century cuba said uprisings among the plantation slaves became so frequent and the means of repressing them so horrible that very soon the masters began to realize that the intervention of the authorities was more costly than the rebellions themselves thus in the captaingeneral of cuba had to issue an instruction against the abuses committed by circuit judges who were entering plantations in revolt accompanied by large bodies of armed men killing animals and negroes and ruining the owners this system of rule culminated in wholesale destruction of the slave and free black population during and when the conspiracy of the ladder was repressed over people were summarily tried by a military tribunal which extracted confessions and implication of others under torture over people were executed many more died under the lash hundreds were exiled and sentenced to long terms at hard labor in africa the elite of the free black population was wiped out its leading intellectuals executed the entire free black population was substantially reduced but aside from these official proceedings the slave population was decimated government investigators reported a drastic increase in suicide among slaves during these years the official census shows that the slave population was reduced from in to in export of sugar fell to almost nothing the captaingeneral of cuba officially denied british protests against cruel procedures used against english subjects during these trials in a letter to the queen he said far from having made use of terror or afflictive means to clarify the facts or proceeding with rigor in the imposition of penalties each and every trial is resplendent with the spirit of leniency of moderation and justice which presided in them the queen replies continue submitting data about the success of the trial of several english subjects accused of complicity in the last conspiracy so that the government of her majesty can answer with authentic data and information the reclamations directed by the british minister concerning this matter this is the style of spanish slave law it is so busy protesting its humaneness that any critical historian should immediately suspect that it might be just the opposite spanish slave law was abstract selfrighteous and totally ineffective in rendering protection to the plantation slaves even to the point of jeopardizing the continued existence of slavery itself but the texts of spanish slave law were weaved into a myth of the mildness of spanish slavery justifying its continued existence and used as an argument against the abolition of slavery if you want to know what slavery was really like in th century cuba you should read the autobiography of esteban montejo a cuban slave it has just been translated and published in english montejo was sold away from his parents when a small child in those days he said blacks were sold like pigs and they sold me at once children were separated from their mothers and raised in a barracks so their mothers could go right back to work without having to care for them montejo was born during the last decades of the slave system when the african slave trade had actually stopped the masters were interested in slave breeding and forced tall slaves to mate the child of two tall slaves sold for pesos montejo describes subhuman living and working conditions brutal punishments and widespread homosexuality because of the shortage of women on the estates montejo didnt believe homosexual practices came from africa because the old africans frowned upon them after the abolition of slavery in cuba the spanish historian rafael maria de labra said one has to admire gentlemen the nerve by which the slave interests propagated the belief that the slaves of the antilles lived happily and contented no one mentioned dungeons stocks and irons nor the awful mortality rate among slaves it is this same proslavery propaganda which accepted uncritically has attained the status of fact in the academic world in the united states the origins of racism by don howie riting near the end of fascist hegemony in europe the great hannah arendt declared the historical truth of the matter is that racethinking with its roots deep in the th century emerged during the th century simultaneously in all western countries racism has been the powerful ideology of imperialistic policies since the turn of the century it certainly has absorbed and revived all the old patterns of race opinions which however by themselves hardly would have been able to create or to degenerate into racism as weltanschauung or ideology for the idea of race does not belong in the history of ideas and not until the end of the last century were dignity and importance accorded it as though it had been one of the major spiritual contributions of the western world in given the poverty of historical research and the prevailing europhilia that may have been an entirely acceptable viewpoint however today we know that it is grossly inaccurate actually racism in all its devilish forms emerged long before the genocidal commerce in red men and black men enveloping euroamerican life from time immemorial the historical truth is simply that the roots of racism are inseparable from the evolution of western civilization itself men have always been conscious of race the whole concept of race did not originate with the african slave trade as many have pontificated rather raceopinions are as old and traditional as the races themselves nothing could be more incorrect and intellectually arrogant than the assertion that the idea of race does not belong in the history of ideas and not until the end of the last century were dignity and importance accorded it as more recent scholarship has demonstrated the idea of race is deeply embedded in western culture and consequently is eminently worthy of inclusion in the history of ideas as well as the history of political economy here i am not using race in an abstract biologistic sense but sociohistorically apparently miss arendt arbitrarily has delimited race to a purely physioethnological meaning on its face such an ahistorical delimitation has neither intellectually nor socially redeeming value race as a category of human existence has a meaning in those social situations where men of different groups take cognizance of their respective racial andor cultural differences defining ex plaining and acting upon them in terms of their world views now racism in the broad sense is an appropriate and descriptive concept for the way in which each group affirms its physical andor cultural superiority over another group racism in this sense is as ancient as the concept of race itself however racism in its ideological sense refers to racethinking which rationalizes sanctions and affirms a particular social system racism as ideology then is preeminently a politicalsociological phenomenon that is not to say that it does not have residual manifestations dimensions or ramifications eg psychological racism as ideology therefore is defined as that peculiar worldview which rationalizes the bestiality of a social system by propounding the physical andor cultural superiority of the dominant race and the inferiority of the oppressed race this dynamic conception reduces racism to its material foundations and its rationalistic functions ie activating spreading and institutionalizing both manifest and latent forms of preexisting race consciousness or racial differentiations this grasping of racism as a social fact resulting from the dynamic interaction between fundamentally antagonistic irreconcilable social forces illuminates the critical distinction between race consciousness re the cultural system and racism re the social or institutional system ie between consciousness and ideology racism then is the ideological doctrine that asserts the genetic andor cultural inferiority of an oppressed people in order to justify their social plight ie how and why they have been subjugated this does not at all imply that political economy causes racism on the contrary ecopolitical and military facts activate and institutionalize already existing race consciousness doubtless racism in its generic sense did not originate with the african slave trade for sure racism functioned ideologically however negligiblyin some social systems before europeans raped and pillaged the continent yet we should not allow this to distort and eradicate in our minds the remembrance of the altogether vicious historical development of racism as ideology in the wild west nor should we allow this to validate the spurious equation of the various forms of racism before the african slave trade with the hellish legacy of the coming of the beast the incontrovertible fact remains racism as the pervasive ideology of expansionistic capitalism remains the enduring essence of the western heritage racism inheres in the evolution of capitalist civilization enough said about the promised lands of life liberty and the pursuit of property concerning the necessary antecedent conditions for racism as ideology to emerge it has been maintained that the most important necessary condition antecedent for racism is the presence in sufficient numbers of two or more groups that look different enough so that at least some of their members can be readily classifiable in addition to their physical differences these groups also have to be culturally different and in a position of institutionalized inequality for the idea of inherent racial differences to take root emphasis mine it seems that only when group differences in race overlap at least partly with dissimilarities in status and culture are these two sets of differences held to be casually related to another but the idea of inherent racial differences may establish itself without the existence of institutionalized inequality ie oppression provided that it is embedded in the worldview of a social system thus there are only two necessary and sufficient conditions for racism as such what is confused above is the politicalsociological function of racism with its necessary conditions antecedent racism can and usually does exist prior to the oppression relationship euphemistically such racism has been called ethnocentrism or xenophobia though oppression or institutionalized inequality is an essential condition for racism as ideology it is not a necessary condition antecedent for racism as race consciousness or ethnocentrism miss arendt correctly sees that historically racism as ideology absorbed and revived all the old patterns of race opinions however such race opinions were not inherently impotent either to create or to degenerate into an ideology their apparent impotence is directly attributable to the lack of a relationship of oppression between the conflicting groups and is therefore a social fact rather than mere ideation traditionally the conventional wisdom has relegated racism to a physiological statement this biologistic posture explains in part the inhibition to define preth century racethinking as racism since it lacked a scientistic front but it is not really critical whether biology or culture or a combination of the two is viewed as the base of the racist perspective what is important is whether that base is naturalistically or genetically conceived the essential elements of racism as ideology have been philosophically elaborated by professor george d kelsey as ontology philosophy of history and military plan professor kelsey admits that only the first two elements are necessary and sufficient for racism as such to exist ie an oppressed people can be racist even though it lacks political power this analytical view conforms to the critical distinction between racism as race consciousness and racism as ideology only those who would maintain the status quo can be ideologically racist since racism as ideology in principle affirms the existing pattern of social arrangements political power therefore is necessary for racism to function ideologically naturally racism as ideology in the wild west has been inseparable from a politicaleconomicmilitary plan ie white power it may be theoretically possible to equate the racism of an oppressed people with that of the oppressors but such a sophistic academic equation would be historically and sociologically relatively insignificant the unquestionable historical truth of the matter is that racism as ideology has been exclusively possessed by whites in the modern world racism as ideology in the modern world evolved from the inception of the slave trade in africans dating from the middle of the th century according to basil davidson throughout the years that followed it it was to be the searing brand of this trade that it would consider its victims not as servants or domestic slaves who deserved respect in spite of their servile condition but as chattel slaves commodities that could and should be sold at will until the enlightenment the orthodox justification of the slave trade was couched in a theologistic worldview initially the slave traders as well as those involved in and benefitting from their free enterprise rationalized their gross crimes in terms of making the world safe for christianity when whites first met africans they instinctively assumed that they were dealing a blow to infidelity in general as well as procuring new souls for the church to wins their concept of heathenism was firmly rooted in the white idea of savagery ie the traditional european view of nonwhites but given the genocidal oppression of the african slave trade the concept of heathenism inevitably acquired ideological significance more important the white idea of heathenism masked a more totalistic ideology racism apparently heathenism was now obsolete to the white definition of africans as livestock it was readily translatable into forthright and militant white racism it was argued that black people were the natural predestined and ordained as it were by god himself slaves of whitesuperior civilization the critical theological distinction between heathen and redeemed was therefore thoroughly racializable prefiguring the imminent devilview in the beginning the europeans image of himself as christian visavis heathens camouflaged a plethora of racial differentiations christian meant whitesuperior civilizedhuman the traditional concept of slavery in western culture also was racialized in order to buttress the racist folklore and mythology slavery had always been more than an economic institution in western culture it had long represented the ultimate limit of dehumanization of treating and regarding man as a thing embedded in western culture then was a vocabulary experience and temperament of slavery which was readily applied to the enslaved africans concepts of heathenism and slavery were enmeshed and interlocked in the same traditional worldview but with the rise of the slave trade they acquired radically new social and institutional content racialization psycholinguistically whites were predisposed to look upon africans as inferior men by their concept of blackness which was pervaded by a sinister diabolical signification the concept of blackness was loaded with intense meaning long before they found that some men were black englishmen found in the idea of blackness a way of expressing some of their most ingrained values white and black connoted purity and filthiness virginity and sin virtue and baseness beauty and ugliness beneficence and evil god and the devil it followed from the european concept of blackness that racial theories would attempt to explain the deviation of africans from the white paradigms europeans were endowed by their culture with an antiblack consciousness that they perceived africans as black ie as perverse negations of themselves is an interesting commentary on the perpetuity of cultural selectivity blackness nonbeing for whites was juxtaposed against whiteness being and as a result race consciousness was transformed into racist ideology whereas the color of africans was their most distinctive arresting and immediate characteristic for whites the concept of blackness was easily converted from a psycholinguistic category into a politicaleconomic fact in the european psyche africa represented the land of blackness though the cult of ethiopism ie the medieval idea that ethiopia or africa was a terrestrial paradise inhabited by convertible noble savages intrigued many africans were never regarded as noble savages in any sense comparable to the romantic idolization of the american indians the color bar and literally so was all too insurmountable the image of africa as the dark con tinent flowed naturally from the cluster of cultural perceptions myths and symbols which comprised the european worldview a critical aspect of the european racist ideology was the view that the enslavement of africans was justifiable because the move from primitivetribal forms of slavery to christianwhite slavery represented an advance on the hierarchial ontological ladder ie the great chain of being this distorted perception of what african forms of slavery were all about was directly caused by the white projectionimposition of its perverse slavocratic institution upon alien societies such a crude misunderstanding of african slavery reflects the mythical element in western civilizationan element which is inextricably imbricated in the politicaleconomicmilitary facts of white domination the ideological origins of racism have been obscured by liberal historiography in their reconstruction of the preslave trade european view of africans some historians have minimized its racist consciousness because there is some evidence that not every european regarded africans as degenerate heathens these historians conclude that the white view was not racist and therefore that white racism did not exist prior to the slave trade with the advent of the slave trade the white image of africans is said to have undergone a fundamental transformation insofar as europeans supposed no inherent racial inferiority in africans they are said to have exhibited a presumably innocuous cultural chauvinism in their attempt to minimize the vitality and importance of racism in preslave trade europe these historians have indulged in historical hyperbole obscuring the extent to which whites were thoroughgoing racists as well as the historical transformation of racism as consciousness into racism as ideology racism as ideology far from being an attitudinal irrationality in mans ethnicity or essentially a problem of personality development developed as a consequence of the need for a more rationalistic indeed naturalistic explanation of the capitalist political economy of which slavery was an indispensable institution until the enlightenment the orthodox theory of the varieties of mankind was a theological monogenesis it was not until the latter part of the th century that someone dared to seriously doubt the unity of the human race some thinkers however anticipating later theories of polygenesis staunchly denied that africans and american indians were of the same species as christianwhite men for instance in the bold bruno declared that it was unthinkable that whites and africans could have the same ancestry but monogenesis was so firmly and clearly established that such speculative deviations carried little if any weight the church responding with all deliberate speed quashed these heterodox doctrines however the temporary suppression of polygenetic conjecture did not extinguish it as a very viable and acceptable theory of the racialized dichotomy between oppressor and oppressed polygenesis was to gain new expression in the th century in the thought of thomas jefferson and voltaire eventually the religious doctrine of the unity of man was subverted by the identity of christianity and whiteness in contradistinction to heathenness and blackness if the religious ideology lingered on as the primary rationalization of the political economy of slavery through the s toward the end of the th century it was less politically and intellectually compelling the progressive secularization of antiblack sentiments and theories having occurred given its worldview europe was predisposed upon contact with noneuropeans to transform raceconsciousness into racist ideology that pernicious predisposition was part and parcel of the european identityselfconsciousness it served a dual purpose metapsychologically it sustained whites image of themselves the mirror that can never be me and politically it rationalized their barbarous treatment of africans they knew that they were whitechristian civilized only because nonwhite peoples could not by definitionin principle be the retarded european consciousness could define itself only in terms of the other the noneuropean white could not be whiteness without blackness the african presence then vivified vitalized politicized mythicized what may have been prior to that racial oppression an abstract other if racism as ideology has been the major spiritual bequeathment of the western experience it is because race consciousness and racism are rooted in western culture having been detonated

passing him by by e curmie price erhaps it was because the neighbors were so used to loud cursing and crying that they did not turn away from their supper when mrs i sneed let go with a loud cry and dashed out her door and down the sidewalk hurdling like a black missile with mr sneed right behind her in strong pursuit once rthey were moving down the side walk a stunned and silent awe greeted them at the corner of the i street she stopped for a moment and raised her fist defiantly then took off again with startled people making way for her as she ran wildly jones funeral cortege with mr ebenezer jones driving hearse slammed on its collective mournful brakes and had its ears pierced with mrs sneeds defiance there goes that crazy lady someone said they ought to put her awayor something meanwhile mr sneed was still behind her having made up little or no distance a small not unattractive black man with slightly greying hair he was breathing hard and his face glistened with perspiration it embarrassed him to be out chasing his wife so he ran like a husband embarrassed to be out chasing his wife people on the block took bets as to how long she would run or whether mr sneed would ever catch her naw man he wont catch that woman a little squat man said thiss been going on for months and never seed him catch up to her yet the little squat man leaned back against the traffic meter and took a long swallow of pepsi cola with obvious satisfaction once mr sneed asked his wife honey he asked why you run like that sometime just up and start running willie b she aswered i really dont know i really dont know except sometimes i get the feeling something or other is after me but where you running to woman when this happens after having crossed lake shore drive her body a matadors cape against a traffic of white faces she rested near the lake i cant explain it willie b no moren you can explain why you run after me i run after you because i dont want you to get hurt but honey she said smiling aint nothing you can do about that is there well lookahere im a man he insisted dont lets talk honey she asked her hands reaching down to rest upon his the running has made me tired there are days when lake michigan moves like an ocean it lashes against the stone ramparts out beyond the shore white peaks punctuate punctuate she couldnt tell him if she wanted to why she had to come down to the water periodically there were just these times when she had to run and it was the only place to run she couldnt tell willie b why she ran if he didnt know she couldnt tell him it made no sense to hurt him she loved willie b maybe that was why she ranbecause she loved him yet there were times when she wanted to kill him kill him because he was helpless because he could not ask the right question the one which would allow her to break the curse her hand lay neutral on his neither hot nor cold neither giving nor receiving a strange numbness started somewhere in his left shoulder when she touched him all the way down to his fingertips he felt a needlelike tingle then nothingnothing that is but a fierceness of tears she tried to hide by turning her face from him sitting next to her with home behind them a house in which they had lived together for twenty years he thought for a moment that he understood what she could not say he stretched his legs cleared his throat his eyes set deep in their sockets preparatory to speaking youre a fool willie b she hissed youre a fool a his eyes dropped and watched a gull hover above the water then skim along the surface dipping its face into the splashings he said i was going to say something but what can i you think im a fool a cool breeze started to blow between them we should go before you catch cold you want to know why i know why woman he cracked and was immediately sorry it didnt do no good for them to hurt each other i believe you do willie she said thoughtfully and thats the shame of it why you say that because aint nothing you can do about it but the blue and white car pulled up about forty yards behind them and a policeman got out and came down toward them when he was about six feet away he stopped and took out his pad and pencil he had a nervous grin on his face whats your name silence whats your name silence honey willie b said you get up and leave here right now you get up and leave here what am i goin get up and leave for willie b she demanded what am i goin leave for i aint got nowhere to go behind them an old white woman with thick blue veins in her legs was calling to her dog you naughty dog she cried oh officer officer the redfaced policeman turned sideways his right hand lingering on his revolver and gave the white woman an irritated growl officer i just wanted you to know it seems that my dog has urinated on your automobile its all right lady he said in tt u a rather flat voice which still did not conceal his nervousness he thought shit leave these black bastards alone thats what ill do go along lady its all right but try to curb that dog lady im sorry officer but if the dog cant run free here then its all right lady he repeated his right hand relaxed and was putting the pad into his back pocket man my name is willie b sneed he said getting up the tone of his voice had changed and the quickness of his movements frightened the policeman what dyou want to know for some people said a man was chasing a woman down here the policeman answered now there was defiance in his voice are you the two two what some people blocking traffic rested on his gun bob steele bob steele some white people it doesnt matter what color they were they said you were blocking traffic it matters man willie b said turning to his wife are you gon leave or not i aint goin nowhere man she said softly almost affectionately you came down here to hurt us man willie b said to the policeman i cant let you do that just come down the road and hurt people look the policeman said taking one small step backwards im answering a complaint that there was a man chasing a woman thats all wow willie b worked his right foot hard against the ground his face twisted in thought he seemed to be searching for the right words man you owe us an apology without even thinking the policeman laughed almost involuntarily what did you say i got to have it man the policemans hands opened almost in appeal as he looked down at the woman who was still sitting on the ground how bad you got to have it nigger he yelled the pad and pencil landing near willie b the policemans legs spread wide he licked the comer of his mouth his right arm waving slowly out from his side his hand bent toward his gun bad enough willie said calmly i dont have time to apologize to no black son of a bitch like you two white people a man and woman came and stood next to the policemans car im outnumbered willie b thought these damn white people are going to waste us he wondered if mrs sneed was afraid i aint got time to be scared he told himself but can i reach him before he gets it out and pulls the trigger just a piece of him just a hand on him i dont care about nothing else he could already feel what seemed like a heavy weight in his chest he could feel all his strength dissolving his legs growing weak and the faint taste of something metallic in his mouth he heard himself say i got to get to him black communities all black studies programs should be relevant to the black community near the school and should in turn be supported by the black community the association ahsa should act as a liaison between black communities and funding agencies ahsa should compile a list of black scholars who need financial support for their community projects or their academic research the association will edit a newsletter or a journal through which its activities should be known the confrontation at montreal cannot be honestly seen out of context with other events that helped to set it in motion for years the african studies association has been a white organization with token black representation that had little or no influence on the major decision affecting the organization the african studies association is not just a professional association its leaders perform other functions that directly or indirectly affect the lives and livelihood of africans and afroamerican scholars and students its annual meeting which brings together government officials journalists publishers foundation representatives businessmen scholars students and members of voluntary associations serves as a point of contact and a market place where jobs research funds ideas and information are exposed and exchanged its members are scholars whose research not only determines or influences at the very least the image of africa in america but also conditions the kind and scope of much of the written documentation available about the continent research completed by its members has provided background material for united states foreign policy decisions in africa for these reasons we deemed the asa annual meeting the proper forum for our demands in the absence of the president of ahsa dr nicholas d u onyewu of nassau community college and dr chike onwuachi of fisk university represented ahsa in all negotiations with asa the african peoples attending this conference demanded that the study of african life be undertaken from a panafricanist perspective this perspective defines that all black people are african people and reject the division of african peoples by geographical locations based on colonialist spheres of influence this demand joined the issue and offended a large number of the white scholars attending the conference they resented the projection of african people as a world people with a common cause and a common destiny more than anything else they resented the afroamericans being linked with the africans in africa the demands of the blacks attending this conference had exposed the neocolonialism that a large number of these socalled scholars had been practicing for years africa to them was a kind of ethnic plantation over which they reigned and explained to the world most of them even resented africans being considered authorities on africa the confrontation at montreal awakened them from their dreams specifically the african people who made up the black caucus wanted their demands to be the means of changing the ideological and structural bases of the african studies association as negotiations between the black caucus group and the asa board progressed it became clear that the demand for an equal number of black members of the board of twelve would be the most difficult demand for the old guard in asa to live with the asa executive board decided that perhaps they could offer three seats in addition to the two already held by blacks the asa board was surprised when the two black members dr absolom vilakasi of south africa and dr elliott p skinner of columbia university supported the demands of the black caucus the offer of three additional african members was rejected this prompted the board to convene an assembly of the voting membership of asa to decide the issue probably the most crucial event in the threeday confrontation was the asa voting memberships rejection of the black caucus demands by a vote of to in its plenary session on friday afternoon it is of interest that the asa an organization of scholars whose prestige and output depends upon maintaining good relations with africans both in terms of gaining entry into african countries and obtaining reliable information for them would have permitted if for on other than political reasons their voting membership to go on record as having voted against minimal demands of african peoples people have argued in defense of the white asa membership that although a large number of them supported the demands they were affronted by the tactics of disruption and therefore could not in good conscience grant the blacks immediate representation on the board if this assessment is true then it raises a fundamental question of their ability to understand and evaluate societies or events occurring in those societies with which they disagree in principle the black caucus ahsa committee that negotiated with asa board consisted of africans west indians and afroamerican students and professors one of whom had been an asa voting member since its inception moreover the majority of the african visitors invited by the asa and the canadian african studies committee to attend the conference supported the substance of the black caucus demands the caucus concerns over the white domination of scholarly output on africa had been expressed by africans at two earlier international conferences of africanists at dakar indication of african support was initially voiced by gabriel darboussier a nationalist leader in francophone africa since the s and currently senegalese ambassador to germany darboussier was slated to deliver the keynote address for the opening session at which time the first statement of black demands were presented robert gardiner director of the united nations economic commission for africa actively participated in the caucus meetings and supported its demands by friday noon when the black caucus met with the invited african guests to clarify our position in french and in english they presented a written declaration of support which had been signed by most of the leading african participants leon damas of french guyana one of the three original negritude poets along with aime cesaire and leopold sedar senghor read the declaration of solidarity cited below we the undersigned participating in a joint annual meeting of the african studies association and the committee on african studies in canada in our capacity of guests of the latter in face of the incidents which confront the afroamerican participants and the asa usa note that the africanist congress held in dakar in december strongly criticized the orientation of african studies in two resolutions adopted at the th and th committees we strongly reiterate the view that african studies as conceived within the context of colonialism and imperialist domination of the african continent have served exclusively to reinforce an ideology which serves their domination in the interest of foreign capital and to exploit the african continent k the question of the procedure tactics and ultimate objective of the black caucus was a pivotal issue in the eyes of the asa white membership any challenge to their authority that was not supported by the black asa voting members had no legitimacy however they misinterpreted an expression by some black africanists of nonsupport of tactics to also mean nonsupport of substantive issues what is the present status of negotiations between the black caucus and the african studies association in response to the compromise position proposed by the white radical caucus and approved by the asa membership the black caucus has decided that it will send delegates who will represent the caucus and the ahsa on the man committee provided that six blacks be appointed as interim members of the asa board of directors the radical caucus compromise proposal envisions the appointment of an ad hoc committee of comprised of whites and blacks whose purpose would be to formulate plans for the total restructuring of asa our conditional acceptance reflects our suspicions about the compromise agreement these suspicions are based on two factors the lack of guarantees of the compromise plan and some confusion about the selection of the blacks that will serve on the ad hoc committee and the past experiences many of the members of the caucus have had with negotiations of this type in order to make our position in the matter clear the following letter was given to professor l gray cowan before we left montreal recognizing that the sentiment of the general membership of the asa annual meeting was in favor of the principle of equal representation on the assumption that the present asa board of directors will continue to function the ahsa executive committee has reached the following conclusion the ahsa demands equal representation be given to it on the present constituent board and contingent on that will submit a list of names to serve on the constitutional committee the report of the committee headed by dr james l gibbs of stanford was distributed too late to have any effect on the conference this was a report from a committee on afroamerican issues appointed after the conference in los angeles this report answers some of the questions that were bothering black students and scholars at montreal it was of course too little too latebut at least it was a gesture in the confrontation at montreal the old order of the african studies association was challenged without compromise the existence of this organization is now contingent on whether it can meet this challenge creatively and respectfully first an attempt should be made to understand the genesis of the african and afroamerican concern for their history and their long fight to make it an acceptable study in schools and universities long before the recent discovery of africa by the academic community black americans were showing an interest in african history most of the courses in african history and lecture discussions were held in churches and community centers to the best of my knowledge these were the first courses in african history held in this country the challenge and confrontation that started at los angeles in october and erupted into a dramatic climax in montreal in october was a long time in the making in the time span between the conference in los angeles and the one at montreal what started out as a black caucus became the african heritage studies association this association intends to examine every aspect and approach to the history and culture of african people in this country and throughout the world further its members intend to project their influence into every organization that relates to africa and the people of african descent we will decide who is and is not an authority on our life and history and we will question black scholars as well as white ones we deplore the fact that so many people mainly white are gaining quick reputations as authorities on african people we suspect that this is a new area of academic colonialism and that it is not unrelated to the neocolonialism that is attempting to reenslave africa by controlling the minds of the african people further we suspect that this closely connected group of white authorities are attempting to control or direct the historical information relating to africa in a manner that will make africans believe that they are forever dependent on people of european descent and that the coming of the europeans to africa was in spite of the slave trade and the colonial system a blessing in disguise the intent of the african heritage studies association is to use african history to effect a world union of african people we do not believe that the closely connected group of white authorities on africa are interested in such a union in fact we think the idea frightens them because this means that they will lose their control over information about africa they resent the idea of any black person taking it upon himself to question their authority and to examine their credentials that is precisely what the members of the african heritage studies association intends to do first they intend to ask for an entirely new approach to african history this new approach must begin with a new frame of reference n what and who are the african people we make no sharp distinction between the africans in africa and the people of african descent in other parts of the world this at once projects the possibility of a world union of african people first we will call for a new frame of reference in all matters relating to africa we reject the black africa because it presupposes that there is a white africa the term negro africa is offensive to us because there is no such thing as a negro this word grew out of the european slave trade and the colonial system and it fails to relate the people of african descent to land history and culture our original place or origins was africa and no matter where we live on this earth we are an african people our approach to african history and culture everywhere will be in keeping with this definition we intend to use history as a force for our liberation and as a basis of african world unity we depend on an honest and creative approach to history to tell what we have been what we are and what we still must be the henry o tanner exhibition dear editor i was interested to note mention of the henry o tanner exhibition under art notes in the november issue of negro digest but i dont understand the meaning or intent of the comment the exhibit was not scheduled at any black museum i assume that because it was started at white initiative the frederick douglass institute together with the museum of african art would not be regarded as a black museum although its staff is black it deals exclusively with african and afroamerican art history and culture and of its attendance is black last year washington school childrenpredominantly blackvisited its galleries or attended its extension programs it was the frederick douglass institute in the persons of carroll greene jr black and myself white which was responsible for the tanner exhibition the institute sponsored the exhibit raised some to organize and circulate it persuaded the national collection of fine arts to assist us and have the opening at its great new museum arranged for it to be shown in major established museums in seven other cities under the auspices of the smithsonian institution travelling exhibition service and generated nationwide publicity for it see enclosed articles in the san francisco chronicle the national observer time magazine and in the major art magazines we felt that for tanner to be shown in such great american museums as the cleveland museum of art the detroit institute of art the carnegie institute in pittsburgh and the philadelphia museum would bring to tanner the reputation in professional art circles that he deserves he is not the first artist to whom such recognition has come late it was a large and costly show to organize and administer involving loans from many museums and individuals considerable sums for insurance etc it was not a show that a small new museumas most of the black museums are could properly receive accommodate or provide normal museum security for our own small museum even though it is fairly well established could not properly accommodate it and guarantee the security of the valuable paintingsfor which reason we asked the smithsonian to show it it drew the largest attendance incidentally that they have ever had at the national collection of fine arts enclosed is a copy of the catalogue a great deal of very hard work by a number of peopleboth black and whitewent into the preparation of the exhibition and catalogue and i think the show will prove to have been the most important one ever given to a black artist in america warren m robbins director frederick douglass institute of arts history the november symposium dear editor sam e anderson in your symposium the measure and meaning of the sixties and what lies ahead for black americans said a hell of a lot that has needed to be said for a long time so did joe goncalves i mean what are black nationalist writers doing writing for the new york times for instance why for the money there are black publications leroi jones ameer baraka illustrated for me the supreme irony of the situation when he wrote a letter to the n y times that was some jive act you pulled changing the title of my essay the piece i know you remember was called nationalism vs pimp art complaining that they had changed the title of his essay from nationalism vs pimp art to to survive the reign of the beasts that was weak and impotent leroi should have expected that like joe goncalves said the white man is the intermediary he allows us to speak to each brother by way of him we will seek white approval are still being judged by white people we are not only still seeking white publishers but in the ads for black plays and on the jackets of books by black authors we still quote white critics black critics if they are approved or judged good by whites eg clayton riley i think s e anderson captured the essence of the sixties when he said our militant intellectuals our militant activists our militant politicians still have much allegiance to and fear ofwhite america our present movement is passionately caught up in the moral political and cultural decadence of white america yes the sixties have left us aware of our blackness the sixties have also left us with much confusion for example the sixties produced the soul movement the black muslims who are totally against the manifestations of soul also became prominent during the sixties i sincerely hope that during the seventies our black writers and thinkers will deal with these and other ambiguities in the black movement so that we can get on with the business of going wherever we as a people decide to go roy mjohnson new york n y sorry to discomfort you chauncey warringham hildredthlll esq we know how distasteful it is for you to be reminded that most americans who resemble you are secondclass citizens we know you are the exception after all your parents were professional people who brought you up in a stable middleclass neighborhood you were integrated from elementary school through university and you are the only negro holding down a job like yours in a white firm yes we understand and we sincerely regret embarrassing you with all these demonstrations and freedom songs and sitins and boycotts we are sorry that because you look like us white people tend to lump you together with us however we ask you to endure the painful situation out of charity for those not so fortunate as you we recognize that this might not appeal to you especially but we feel that our concerted efforts to attain genuine freedom of opportunity and movement for all americans now are in the national interest ultimately we believe that a truly free america is an america of unsurpassable strength it is even possible that your children will be the immediate beneficiaries since they have a better education than most and are best qualified to accept the jobs which civil_rights pressures are open ing up so have patience mr chauncey warringham hildredth iii the battle you are watching with such great aloofness sir is really your own
how to end colonial domination of black america by joseph hannibal howard iii is well known that few of the psychologi cal and sociological studies of afroamericans have been done by blacks themselves however what is perhaps more significant few of the studies by black scholars have reflected a world view clearly different from their white counterparts this brief essay is an attempt to suggest what the foundations of such a perspective or frame of reference may be our efforts to create a productive and clear frame of reference are impeded by the fact that there is little if any meaningful theoretical work being done in american psychology and indeed in amer ican social science in general the system maintenance connotations of parsons socalled theory of social action is clearly antitheti cal to the interests of the black community in addition to being needlessly unintelligible it has been nevertheless the only serious attempt to give coherence to an otherwise unrelated aggregate of studies the only unifying themes discernible have been a reification of logical empiricism as method and as frantz fanon has said a unilateral declaration of the normative value of western culture the minnesota empiricist approach to the universe is both myopic and most importantly for our purposes ahistorical this is to be expected in a country more concerned with social engineering than with human development the study of the socalled negro american which has become so fashionable among white scholars in recent years has suffered because of the narrow definition of psychology and because of the provincial insistence that the study of the black man in the americas can only be undertaken within the national boundaries of the united states consistent with this point of view has been the definition of the afroamerican and other third world peoples as a minority problem this myopia may be a perceptual defense against the fact that the white population is a minority on the planet by approximately four to one even if one excludes the intermixtures to correct this situation we must look beyond the narrow conception of psychology and beyond the boundaries of the black community in america a small but suggestive body of literature supports the enlargement of our view hopefully more thorough analysis and experimentation in the future will confirm our brief and tentative suggestions when a sister or brother fries his hair or bleaches his skin this has traditionally been called selfhatred behavior following the work of kurt lewin in the current resurgence of black nationalism this is referred to as the oreo phenomenon it is likely that such a person will be referred to as negro rather than black but when the wife of general ngygen cao ky has plastic surgery done on her eyes to make them less slanted as some asian women do annually it is scarcely noticed in the black community both of these attempts to become more beautiful are of the same order of phenomena for they are both attempts to become more europeanlooking both are manifestations of what my colleagues and i call the colonized mentality there are many similarities in the behavior of third world people which have not been given as much attention as the differences there have also been consistent approaches to the study of minority peoples which invite our reinterpretation undoubtedly nothing has been so thoroughly studied as the intelligence of nonwestern people contained in shueys survey and other reviews of the literature on afroamericans are hundreds of measurements of black iqs not until klinebergs well known study in did american psychologists begin to tire of attempting to validate the myth of black mental inferiority what is significant about these numerous ethnocentric and futile efforts is that at the same time these studies were being done the mental abilities of thousands of africans were being meticulously measured in all parts of colonial africa an annotated bibliography by andor compiled for the south african government is filled like shueys with numerous studies seeking to establish the mental incapacity of africans in both the american and african research the europeans have frequently debated the intellectual ability of blacks as interesting as this debate has been we will decline to review it since none of this activity has changed the history of colonial domination in fact this research has helped to maintain colonialism both here and in africa by asserting the natives inability to determine his own destiny in zimbabwe or southern rhodesia as the europeans call it for example there were in secondary schools for europeans and two for africans as the scholarly debate continued over whether or not the african had a brain the search for the black mans mind has been almost as old a quest in western social science as the search for his soul sec ond in number to the intelligence studies have been a series of personality investigations in both america and africa the oftenquoted psychiatric study by kardiner and ovessey the mark of oppression and the tat study by karon the negro personality both found massive amounts of suppressed hostility and low feelings of selfesteem both of these feelings kardiner argued led to fear which may be manifested as self abnegation caution and apologetic hehavior kardiner goes on to say that blacks become depressed because of the inability to express their anger at the source of their frustration karon also found that blacks make frequent use of denial and fear the direct expres sion of aggression they often had the idea that some one is making trouble for you according to kardiner and ovessey blacks compensate their feelings of inferiority by use of denial humor flashy dressing drinking vituperative gossip disparagement gambling and explosive spending whatever that means they conclude their portrait by saying he tends to live from day to day because of an inability to plan without commenting upon the rather familiar ring of their findings the assumption inherent in psychoanalytic theory that somehow the fault lies inside the individual should not be missed although kardiner and karons findings are familiar what are not so well known are the findings of de ridder in his the personality of the urban african in south africa in a tat type investigation sponsored interestingly enough by shell oil of south africa it was found that a the african personality is characterized by strong feelings of anxiety and insecurity b the african frequently turns to crime in particular he joins the socalled tsotist gangs which feed parasitically off the african ghettoes or townships c the urban african personality is a personality with strong latent aggression and insufficient moderation and control d there is a strong american influence on the slang language of the gangs e there are trends towards exhibitionism a feeling of being discriminated against general suspicion of europeans outspokenness and criticism of urban policy although it is not difficult to imagine that the african in south africa feels discriminated against since he lives on reservations called bantustans must carry a pass at all times and is subject to indefinite arrest it is hard to imagine de ridders surprise at his own findings when he says that these urbanized communities seem to develop a being discriminated against type of comp ex with the result that their general perception has become so biased than in many instances they apperceive wellmeaning european motives in a totally wrong light as interesting as the south african study is what is more remarkable are the findings on other colonized people in widely different parts of the world studies by doob found considerable hostility and resentment to ward europeans among the luo ganada and zulu peoples of africa as well as among jamaicans doob noted that this tendency was particularly pronounced among the more educated natives studies of american indians by havinghurst and neugarten kluckhohn and leighton and leighton and kluckhohn found great discontent and hostility socalled acculturation studies of other indian groups such as the ojibwa hallowell caudill the chippewa barnouw and the wisconsin menowini spindler consistently show the negative impact of western culture on the personality dynamics of these people as revealed by projective tests for example cheyenne children tended to see the external world as hostile alexander and anderson furthermore studies of native and foreignborn chinese by abel and hsu showed that americanborn chinese display a high incidence of adjustment problems and greater anxiety when compared to those born in china one of doobs conclusions was that the less the contact between nonwestern people and europe the better the impact upon the natives an important exception being where the indigenous culture is similar to the invading colonizer one of the most provocative findings in the kardiner and ovessey study was the rorschach analysis done independently by goldfarb he found that per cent of the blacks studied tended to perceive mutilated human bodies or parts of bodies in the ink blots these findings were the same as those of devos and miner in a sample of algerians it should also be noted that algerians who lived in the city casbah thus having more contact with the french showed this type of projection with much higher frequency than the portion of the sample living in the countryside similar findings have been noted in the samples of japanese immigrants to america also studied by devos although there may be deeper levels of interpretation these findings again point to the existence of massive amounts of suppressed rage the findings may also suggest the projection of feelings about the mutilation of the ego under condition of domination how can we account for the universality of these findings in such widely scattered places and among such culturally and racially different people clearly the genetic explanations so favored by racist sectors of the scientific community past and present are ruled out by the wide genetic differences among the samples it is unlikely also that the members of the samples all have the same personality therefore the explanation must lie in the similarity of the social situa tions in which each of the peoples studied find themselves and the devastating impact that those social relations and processes have upon their being this impact produces the colonized mentality which was formerly said to be the selfhatred phenomena in minority groups obviously dominated men hate their oppressors as well as themselves an important question in all this is how the massive amount of hos tility and resentment is handled by the personality and by the social institutions of the native these responses are perhaps most clearly seen among those who have been more colonized than anyone else those who have physically survived the most brutal system of slavery in the history of manblack people in america we have tended not to look at black history as the history of resistance to colonization because it appeared that slavery was a relationship between individual slaveholders and slaves or landlords and sharecroppers rather than essential social relations between metropolitan white society and colonial black society in which the rapid development of the former society occasioned the veritable destruction of the latter society colonialism is the aggression at all levels physical and cultural by one society or group of societies upon another such that the existence of the colonized is subjugated to the survival of the colonizer it is a system as fanon says of organized domination where racism is but the most visible aspect of the systemized oppression of a people our former culture once living and open to the future became closed fixed in the colonial status the social group i militarily and economically subjugated is dehumanized in accordance with a polydimensional method to accomplish this of ii course the colonized must be removed from history not just from the historical records published in metropolitan europe but from the process of history itself this removal from history as albert memmi likes to say is the most serious blow suffered by the colonized the result is the destruction of the natives own systems of reference and he attempts because nothing else is left to immitate the oppressor and thereby to deracialize himself i j the united states j i of i america i my country tis of thee i bitter land of bigotry i of thee i weep i anon i this is the deeper meaning of selfhatred selfdoubt as clark and frazier have often noted blacks express their feelings of inferiority by over identification with the white society and the rejection or perhaps more acurately the negation of themselves the overdriven quest for status ambivalence about personal identity the creation of social and religious myths supermasculinity or the swaggering bravado i like to call the pimp syndrome all of these are attempts to deal with the severe ego destruction undergone by colonized man these compensations are of course by no means confined to the american black man for example the popular press recently noted that general ky changed his appearance in order to win over more of his own people gone is the dashing captain midnight look the tailored black flying suit violet scarf pearl handled to maostyled suits often these various ego compensations are unsuccessful and the result may be severe aberrations of the personality such as schizophrenia note in light of the previous remarks the productions of the following psychotics studied by myers and yochelson r e is a yearold who had an acute schizophrenic reaction after being inducted into the army i am not black or white but i am red i am john j anthonys son i am white looks at his hands no black black used to be white tried to bleach myself burning my skin with a flame thrower in tokyo j w was hospitalized when he presistently reported dreams to the police in which he saw colored women having white babies with wings he maintained that he was born in germany and that he had no negro blood in him he claimed people had put camphor and asafetida in his blood and caused him to turn black a patient whom i tested diagnosed as a severe neurotic gave the following response to the blank white card number on the thematic appreciation test after some hestitation she said this is a special white board and it has special powers and if you touch it you can become the same color as the board and its meant for people who dont like the color they are if you touch it it not only changes your skin color but also your eye color and hair color so if youre puerto rican or a negro or a chinaman you can touch this board and be a blond blueeyed caucasian there is often continuity between socalled normal and pathological cases one is able to see perhaps more clearly in the extreme cases the tendencies latent in more organized personalities for example note this comment by a schizophrenic black male in speaking about his peers in the hospital he said some of their mothers must have been direct descendants of an uncivilized section of darkest africa weaver in studying normal black children recorded how these children recollected having first discovered that they were negroes child i can remember when i was real small how children would be drawn away from me by their mothers and told that i was a black african cannibal and that black was evil child a small child came over and called me a nigger having lived in an allnegro town all my life i had never been called a nigger like that before i thought something terrible had happened to me of course i knew that i was another color but i was proud of our people until that time these comments by children remind us of the terrible impact which the school as an institution makes upon black children grier and cobbs are very correct when they say that the school evaluates the entire being of the black child when he enters and not just his competence to a black child all intellectual activity is thus alien to him the severest impact is upon the black male for it notes from a black journal by don l lee is for real yr f nnl l jlj movements thruout yrcommunities are for real the way u dress the way u walk talk and relate to each other and to

heroes an introduction to the poetry of aime cesaire by judith gleason upon a time this world was entirely tropical things took root thirsting downwards into the soil those ancient trees surged upwards into the lifegiving light this intense double verticality ceased in certain areas as slowly the cold came on ages later the ice receded and that cool customer known as western man began to expand his dominion over the things of this world those parts which had remained climactically more or less the same were stunned one morning by a cry from the beach les blancs debarquent the whites are landing so the french poet arthur rimbaud heard it and turned away from the dances in which he had been somewhat guiltily engaged hating himself for the mauvais sang inherited from his blueeyed gallic ancestors he nevertheless then made poetically the decision which would eventually lead to his abandoning of the spurious magic of poetry for trade one might imagine that negritude was born that moment on the beach sometime during the early summer of when the boy from charleville spent his season in hell at least he foresaw the process it was his metier the whites are landing the cry is echoed in aime cesaires poetic pageant commemorating the rebel who led his country to consciousnessofitself because the whites really did land the blacks whether africanborn or stranded on islands in the caribbean or crowded into city slumsmust thrust down their roots and strive again for the sun this process for which cesaire takes poetic responsibility seems historically inevitable now but when in at the age of cesaire left paris for his native martinique the poem he wrote about this decision made cultural history cesaires location on that island is what distinguishes his poetry from that of his predecessors among the french symbolists and surrealists from that of his contemporaries of african origin his geographical positiona moral position a rhetorical stanceis the first metaphorical premise of his poetic work the island is the eye of a storm of imagesrocks swamps bays caverns bluffs shingles corals tides breakers foams ships wrecks wrack heats winds stars migrating birds trees flowers insects especially fireflies reptiles birds of prey predatory fishstagnations disasters and profusions whose tropical turbulence is recorded seismographically within the volcanic core of the self and thrown out again to be reflected sidereally on the brink of beingin the transcendental world of dawn nostalgia and wild surmise in soleil serpent for example a poem from his first collection les armes miraculeuses the lie islandwith its subjective variant oeil eye and its transcendental counterpart soleil sunis king morpheme in the sightsound sequences of the key first second and final lines soleil serpent serpent oeil fascinant mon oeil the motive is repeated at gradually increasing intervals along this first line to erupt as dlles at the break in line twoas an awkward extra syllable in the last line of the poem that rarest essence wrested by poetry from despair is contained in the word bresil again placed at the cesura but this time as the crest of a perfect alexandrine the position of the morpheme lie strives for symmetry for in this poem the mood is basically optimistican affirmation in present participles of the perpetuality of the poetic process of transformation each thing is caught in the process of becoming something else now in a later poem the movement of lie and its variants would define an irregular jerky curve the locus of metaphors being imitated typographically and reinforced by staccato rhythms short parallel constructions and explosive sounds note that the poet in soleil serpent is characteristically thunderstruck but he survives voraciously in tiptop form if cesaire is an island poet leopold sedar senghor a cofounder of the negritude movement in literature is just as emphatically a part of the main interrupted only superficially by periods of french residence senghors connections with the continent of africa are as unbroken as the cadences of his verse which is to say that europeanized as senghor is he can revive the old ties easily in celebrating an aristocratic african heritage of dignified labor and rhythmical repose senghors stophes gradually uncover strata of feeling and historyhis negritudebeneath the sands and clays of the luminous countryside where he grew up where he now rulesas president of the republic of senegal but cesaires island is a volcanic surge of rock pitted with vegetation incessantly licked away by wind and sea his return is an ironic affirmation of that original sundering of man from nature which his family knew alltoohistorically as kidnapping and enslavement cesaires is the turbulent poetry of the spiritually dislocated of the damned his images strike through the net only in surrealist dreams can he reveal the unbroken sonorities of the sky with the passing of time on the island the famous return has become a refusal to abandon an intractable impoverished place where for years he has maintained the ironic power voted him as deputy and mayor of a department entirely governed by the french independence having touched africa is one storm that has seemingly passed his island by and cesaire is bitter about this feeling that his nottoocourageous countrymen have sold their birthright for a mess of potage there is something of the henri christophe about him but unlike that tyrant of haitis history the hero of cesaires recent play the poets citadel is built of words not stones and his exactions confined to the aggressiveness of language cesaires is the black_power of the imagination to a younger generation of african poets like tchikaya utamsi it is cesaire rather than senghor who is negritudes true chief of state cesaire is similarly regarded by those who care for surrealist poetry his is a late vigorous manifestation of the freedoms and aspirations of revolutionary art early recognized by andre breton as la route royale cesaires poetry has continued to blast its way through the stultifying thickness of things long after the movement itself has become a forgotten bore a surrealist prophet of the strong breed cesaire is mosaic in his ability to perform real miracles with language because grounded in the historical sufferings of a chosen people his is an angry authentic vision of the promised land but his visionary landscapes would lack their fierce precision had not nature itself tried his descriptive powers to the breaking point which is again to say that the relation between his images and his environment the ecology of his poetry cannot be ignored open almost any book of good caribbean writing the fever had left him weak but it had also heightened his consciousness of the new environment into which he had moved with the morning mists vanishing it was as though a veil had been torn away from the face of a primeval landscape the swamp carpeted with weeds buffalo grass water lilies and saffron spread out in wide and flat infinities beyond the public road this burnt brick road with its verging grass had been built up high with a deep ditch on either side and it twisted like a red snake it was the dry season and the earth had been grilled a parched brown by the sun the few clumps of blacksage ants bush and wild coffee which had survived the heat looked like leprous scars hector turned around and looked out on the reefs behind the village coconut palms grew thickly there and their fronds interlocked and formed a huge canopy above the massed undergrowth the wind has pressed against their slender trunks so insistently that many of them were bent like old mens backs birds were flying from the foreshore towards the rice fields behind the reefs pairs of curlews and spurwings and screaming parakeets cranes flapping their bleached wings lazily and above them all the wild ducks and red herons this is an environment so saturated with the energy of growth that it seems to sap the narrative strength of the fictionwriter diverting him into descriptive passages and thence into the grander conceptions of philosophy while his characters languish in their backyardspart caricature part cosmic force yet scenes such as these redolent of myriad species generate images as luminousand numerousas the fireflies these are lightning conductors by which the passions of the caribbean poet are naturally grounded when breton talks about the movement of revolt which corresponds to a friction of leaves in a forest or about the sudden aboresences of his desires his projected landscape is annihilated by its own generality and without the vehicle the tenor cannot hold in cesaires caribbean poetry all the species are invoked by name and his passion exfoliates in catalogues from the groin of the sacred mapou tree the fragile fruit of liberty depends orchids push up their gentle heads of tortured souls cassia trees convey nostalgia baobabs the clumsy strength of those who have been spiritually dwarfed bamboos rise along the road of childhood reminiscence the ceiba manifests the knotty struggle of man with his destiny the hibiscus is the sudden burst of a visionary eyeball everything on that island is emblematic each tree occasions an explosion of the imagination this forest of innocence harbours the tree of life there is nothing exotic about such a landscape when you live in it it is inescapable rather than the source of escape set in motion by cesaires angry will it becomes an intentional landscape his rocks project from the deluge like crinkly black heads under the relentless eye of the sun his towns ships shores and swamplands deteriorate his sharks and scorpions destroy his flowers exude a venomous sweetness according to an unremitting retaliatory law this is no paradise it is a punishment which will continue until the moral order has been set right as for the sweeter the grander potentialities of existence derived from the primary images these are synthetic products of the poets imagination his monsters they inhabit the brief glorious lies wherein we stretch our cramped limbs before they herd us down to the hold again but the birth of such convulsive beauty becomes progressively more difficult the title of cesaires latest collection ferrements presses itself syntactically the mature cesaire is sometimes far closer to stephane mallarme than to rimbaud in nous savoir for example the delicate balances the intricacies of sound and syntax defy shackles or irons reflects a spiritual as well as a political condition those triumphant seasons of the rarest essences in which the poet once rejoiced are either attributed to others like eluard or various freedomfighters or they are stillborn this psychological difficulty extranslation the temporal suspension of the infinitive in the title is reinforced by the ambiguity of the conjunction in the colloquial first phrase the typography reiterates the suspension a removal bitterly accentuated by the historical past tense of the verb in the fifth line yet borne along by subtle varia tions on the closed vowel sound w the fragmentary music rights itself condenses itself into two short stanzas in the first of these some impossible conditions are removed by negation to allow for the flowering of the superb image in the last it is an image of an inexpressible essence bound by a free activity of the spirit which is itself contained and accorded only a concessive potentiality to ward off disaster was the cahier which first revealed this island prometheus of tongue unbound and it is this poem for which cesaire will be remembered a masterpiece of cultural relevance every bit as important as the wasteland its remarkable virtuosity will ensure its eloquence long after the struggle for human dignity has ceased to be viewed in racial terms it is part of the poets alchemy to turn anyone who reads the cahier into a blackman with the cahier dun retour au pays natal is in many ways the obverse of that little lyric nous savoir narrow at the apexa single impulse projected over sixtysix pagesthe cahier is the entire black african world broad at its base here it is not a question of unheard melodies but rather of what kind of talk various poetic styles are here recognized as excrescences of various forms of selfdeception the cahier dramatizes a young poets search for moral integrity and its appropriate style it is the blackmans special history at once theres a contradiction such an identification is at odds with the poets purpose but the poet must always be at odds with himself in such matters for the poetic image if successful is like a short circuit the connection is transsubjective and immediate with the path of greater resistance shunted off in cesaires recent play henri christophe sums up the argument if theres one thing which irritates me every bit as much as the propaganda of the slavers its to hear our philan thropists clamor in the best spirit without doubt that all men are men and there are neither whites nor blacks who will ever be convinced that all men i say all without privilege without particular exoneration have known deportation the slave trade slavery the collective depreciation to the bestial the total outrage the vast insult that all have receivedlaid on the body the face the allnegating spit we alone madam you understand me we alone the negroes at the bottom of the pit then thats how understand it at the extreme bottom of the pit thats where we cry from there we aspire to the air to the light to the sun some have claimed that christ was a blackman more likely job was the first section is a series of prose poemssomewhat in the manner of pierre charles baudelaires crepuscules these passages are of varying lengths sometimes a long paragraph sometimes a couple of lines that dont quite have the energy to form a complete sentence each passage is introduced by the short phraseau bout du petit matinwhich means in its own elusive way something long dawned and short of noon these little prose poems convey stultification of life on martiniquesometimes by cancerous descriptions of its landscape sometimes by catalogues of the miseries of its inhabitants sometimes by boyhood reminiscences the hovel unpeeling its roof to the wind the bed they all slept in with its paws of kerosene cansironic cradle of his island race these remembered scenes are interrupted by the notion that has been plaguing the poet all along he must save his conscience by leaving paris partir leave but what would he do there exactly what he really wants to do become a sorcerer of words and island images i would say river i would say tornado i would roll like frenetic blood on the slow current of the eye of words etc and behold he is there finding death where he had expected marvels he was on the wrong track but with the resilience of youth he recovers himself confidently breaking forth in a whitmanesque poem of identification not only with his own island but with all the antilles with everywhere that his people have dispersed his imagination then seizes upon the image of toussaint louverture prisoner among the snows of the jural mountains the first afrocaribbean martyr for freedom a hero with whom he now feels entitled to identify and he improvises an ode in black and white a cascade of short phrases like a waterfall there is a tension in cesaires work between the horizontal poetry of fraternal affiliationa series of identifications of happenings of images in the process of transformationand the vertical poetry of reductionattempts to get at the truth by a series of angry stabs through the falsity of things in later poems this tension often produces the effect of a stalemate uprooting racism and racists in the united states by james and grace lee boggs march one month before the racist murder of dr martin_luther_king jr the presidents commission on civil disorders headed by illinois governor otto kerner issued its monumental report charging white racism with responsibility for the degraded conditions of blacks in this country since the report appeared white racist hostility towards blacks particularly among white workers has increased not decreased polls indicate that today fewer whites believe that blacks are the victims of discrimination and that in fact a growing number of whites believe blacks are the villains rather than the victims the obvious contradiction of the kerner report is that after diagnosing whites as responsible for racist oppression of blacks the report goes on to make recommendations for the treatment not of whites but of blacks as we pointed out at the time it is like saying that the way to keep white sheriffs policemen ku klux klansmen white citizens councilmen minutemen birchites and other american fascists from lynching any more blacks is to put the blacks to work send them to school and build some new housing developments in the ghetto the victims are the ones who need rehabilitation the villains are not even acknowledged to exist w it is of course no accident that the kerner commission did not tackle the question of white racists first of all the white moderate responsible establishment americans in tom wickers words who made up the commission are not in the habit of using their power to expose or confront the crimes and barabarism of white racists any more than the white moderate responsible germans of hitlers days were in the habit of exposing or confronting the crimes and barbarism of german racists note for example how little appears in the white moderate responsible american press today about minutemen kkksmen and birchites contrasted to the constant scare headlines about black_panthers and other black militants moreover the kerner commission including as it did such pillars of capitalism as the senior officials of north american rockwell corp litton industries general mills corp bank of america etc could hardly have been expected to undertake the kind of probe of white racism which might have led to its roots in capitalist economics and ideology so from the outset the commission made it clear that its aim was to attack the root causes of racial disorder not the root causes of racism it seems a minor difference but those planning a career in journalism should pay it special attention the one line of attackagainst the root causes of racismleads ultimately as we shall show to a revolution against the system the otheragainst the root causes of racial disorderleaves the door wide open for a counterrevolution against those making a revolution against the system for it should be obvious to anyone not blinded by racism that the root cause of racial disorders in northern cities over the last five years is the revolt against racism if blacks were ready to submit to racism there would be no racial disorder however the revolt against racism today is going off in a variety of directions because of the absence of a clear understanding within the black movement of the roots of racism to break the chains that bind them a people must understand the forces that forged and maintain those chains in the beginning the first thing we have to understand is that racism is not a mental quirk or a psychological flaw on the part of individuals racism is the systematized oppression by one race of people of another in other words the various forms of oppression within every sphere of social relationseconomic exploitation military subjugation political subordination culture devaluation psychological violation sexual degradation verbal abuse etctogether make up a whole of interacting and developing processes which operate so normally and naturally and are so much a part of the existing institutions of the society that the individuals involved are barely conscious of their operation the racist in a culture with racism is therefore normal fanon this kind of systematic oppression of one race of people by another was unknown to mankind in the thousands of years of recorded history before the emergence of capitalism years ago prior to that time racial prejudice was not unknown for example chinese in the rdcentury bc considered yellowhaired greeneyed people in a distant province as barbarians in ancient egypt the ruling group which at different times was red or yellow or black or white usually regarded the others as inferior t slave oppression had also existed in earlier times but this was usually on the basis of military conquest and the consequences eg the ancient greeks and romans did not develop a theory of racial superiority to rationalize their right to exploit their slaves just as mankind prior to the rise of capitalism had had no previous experience of an economic system which naturally and normally pursues the expansion of material productive forces at the expense of human forces so it had never known a society which naturally and normally pursues the sytematic exploitation and dehumanization of one race of people by another an organic link between capitalism and racism is therefore certainly suggested the parallel between the rise of capitalism and that of racism has been traced by a number of scholars the portuguese who were the first europeans to come into contact with africans at the end of the th and beginning of the th centuries treated them as natural friends and allies they found african customs strange and exotic but they also found much to admire in their social and political organization craftsmanship architecture etc at this point the chief technological advantage enjoyed by the europeans consisted of their navigation skills and firepower both by the way originally derived from the chinese in the next four centuries these two advantages would be used to plunder four continents of their wealth in minerals and people and thereby to increase the technological superiority of europeans by leaps and bounds africa was turned into a hunting ground for slaves to work the land of the west indies and the southern colonies which had been stolen from the indians as the slave trade expanded its enormous profits concentrated capital in europe and america for the expansion of commerce industry and invention while in africa the social fabric was torn apart in the americas the blood and sweat of african slaves produced the sugar tobacco and later cotton to feed the refineries distilleries and textile mills first of western europe and then of the northern united states the more instrumental the slave trade in destroying african culture the more those involved directly and indirectly in the slave traffic tried to convince themselves and others that there had never been any african culture in the first place the more brutal the methods needed to enforce slavery against rebellious blacks the more the brutalizers insisted that space age music by tam fiofori he above poem j hi part of a manifesto used as the sleeve notes for the album supersonic sounds on saturn records by sun ra his arkestra in initiated the primary phases of a universal musical awareness sun ra his arkestra had been investigating for years the arkestra then based in chicago was functioning as a unit dedicated to the complete mastery of the principles of sounds and its natural values as a means for retranslating sun ras cosmicequationpoems into a more assertive and accessible medium the immediate aim of the music was to communicate the beauty truths realities and the creative nature of a better tomorrow this music in its totality sun ra calls astroinfinity music and recently he defined the music as the design of another kind of world that has nothing to do with the reality of what is called today yesterday or even earth tomorrow the arkestra when performing employs multimedia devices with the musicians suitably attired in colorful spacecostumes accented by costumechanges spacehats with antennaelighttips flickering to create a representative platform from which to relate the music enacting the reality of an environmental play staged as a space age theater norman mailer writing for esquire magazine seven years ago informed the magazines readers of a unique experience once years ago in chicago i was coming down with a bad cold by accident a friend of mine took me to hear a jazz musician named sun ra who played space music the music was a little like the sound of ornette coleman but further out outer space music close to the eeee of an electric drill at the center of a harsh trumpet my cold cleared up in five minutes in i the arkestra moved to new york and quickly established itself as the main band of the subunderground providing the energy and directions for what later became stylized forms of new music in fulfilling this mu sicosocial function the arkestra u under the direction of sun ra served as the training grounds for many of the starspharaoh sanders marion brown who emerged from the underground jazz movement and directly influenced john coltrane to record t ascension and his later works the nucleus of the arkestra under sun ras guidance has continued to provide the impetus musical directions and possibilities that have helped shape the major playing styles and general musical approaches to their individual instruments and in john gilmore tenor sax pat patrick baritone sax and marshall allen alto sax the arkestra has the forerun t ners of the styles of the sixties the versatility of the members of the arkestra as very competent multiinstrumentalists has helped expand the range of sounds now being incorporated into the new music and the arkestras stay in new york has been a breath of fresh air and an infusion of a newer and more relevant lifesense and style to the music scene reaching out in its influences to touch all areas of musicjazz classical electronic hardrock and popular and as evo remarked sun ras group is what happens when astrology meets technology in the st century the musical progression of sun ra has been the building up of the arkestra and its evolution through what is termed the solar mythscience astroinfinity power hieroglyphic solar nature immortality solarscience and solarnature phases of astroinfinity music this process has involved a calculated correlation of the arkestras musical growthdimensions with its size and instrumentation from its standard plus memberstructure to an extended

to the past prestigious universities such as harvard yale berkeley and stanford are establishing programs to study the history and culture of black people and since these institutions usually point the way in american education universities with lesser reputations will undoubtedly follow there is no reason to expect a different trend because the subject happens to be black in some colleges black studies programs have produced curricula that are designed to provide students with functional skills to be used in the black community and others are structured along traditional academic lines these programs have been designed by faculty and students working jointly or have been created as a result of student pressure perhaps the only significant question to be posed at this time is what kind of program an institution will develop and under what circumstances for black studies is here to stay black studies in the university yale university press a symposium held at yale university in november presents the arguments for black studies and raises important questions concerning the direction this academic quest might take in any discussion of black studies one naturally looks for the speakers to define the study and to suggest those subjects which seem to fall within its purview several of the speakers have attempted to define what the black mans exclusive domain should be and to sug gest although not always clearly areas in which blacks and whites might be able to cooperate harold cruse is convinced that the integrationist ethic has prevented blacks from developing their cultural expression the integrationist has been an oppressive mistress she recognized only one culture only one lifestyle and only one way of viewing the tenuous arrangements that make up our world she demanded that blacks become white in the only way they could which is to say that they had to see smell taste touch and hear as anglosaxons in order to express and reaffirm a white ethic by making such uncompromising demands on all foreign or different cultures the anglosaxon view has reigned supreme thereby perpetu ating its economics politics and culture for cruse blacks have only one way out of the integrationist tyranny and that is through a cultural nationalism which must form the basis of black studies blacks must determine their literary standards develop their theater and raise and discuss questions relevant to the black experience elsewhere cruse has pointed out what happens when editorial boards of magazines and theater groups are integrated with whites he has argued that in integrated groups blacks are not encouraged or permitted to seek those themes and expressions which reflect their unique historical moments frequently blacks are told that to explore and to express their experience in a style and language that are peculiar to their group is separatism and consequently bad on the other hand other nationality groups have developed their own theater and journals to discuss those issues which best define their interest cultural nationalism allows blacks to come to terms with the distinct character of their lives in a way in which only they can but cruse also seems to see blacks and whites eventually collaborating in artistic and intellectual endeavors black studies may make this cooperation possible its social function is not to replace one particularism with another particularism but to counterbalance the historical effects and exaggeration of particularism toward a more racially balanced society a society which would include expectations regarding the democratic creed p obviously the american society must be transformed in such a way that cultural groups will cooperate from positions of strength regardless of how cooperation comes about which is open to speculation the implication is that the races eventually will work together in matters of culture perhaps the implication is that an american character will be forged out of the experience of the existing cultural mix prior to considering the nuts and bolts of black studies maulana ron karenga wants to change the white cultural view that informs all that is taught it is necessary therefore to alter the frame of reference in which education takes place to redefine terms and to reinterpret many words and experiences karenga views the white culture as esteeming all that is white while negating all that is black the black frame of reference provides a positive structure in which black people study their experiences thus creating values and procedures that are meaningful for them and their lives this frame of reference or positive attitude is further strengthened by redefining words black becomes a positive and beautiful word and white indicates that which is not really happening after closely examining cruses and karengas positions one observes a fundamental similarity both men see cultural nationalism a cultural selfdetermination as being central to the study of the history and culture of black people there would no doubt be differences resardine the direction and the particular emphases within the pursuit of these studies since cruse has written more and given his position in more detail we can more easily grasp the particulars of his thinking at this time karengas thinking and stance as to emotionalism inspiration and mythology need further elaboration before one can attempt anv kind of comparison in the political and economic arenas karenga seeks economic reparation from whites and demands that blacks determine their own political destiny his position seems to restrict blacks to making political decisions about blacks for a limited time while being economically dependent upon whites karengas cultural nationalism does not go beyond political control of the black com munity and a limited economic independence since whites will continue to determine the significant economic patterns within the black community and although he tells us what political thought and models are not to be used in the black community it is not clear what po litical model will be used karenga as does cruse seems to see the coming of a kind of cooperation between whites and blacks karenga encourages whites to create a civilizing movement among themselves i dont see us coexisting until that power balance is achieved i can say that now but the intensity and quality of the struggle will really determine the relationship youve got to understand that that is why the civilizing orlets change it let me use a euphemismthe humanizing movement is so important if it works the intensity and quality of the struggle will be different than if it falls the makeup of the future depends upon the struggle itself for example me i am reallv only interested in love and study im not really interested in violence and stuff like that but here we are this is a violent world and i cant pretend i dont live in it that should be considered p for both men the present requires that blacks occupy themselves with themselves and all that concerns them and that whites turn to themselves and to the long neglected task of confronting a pluralistic world and a pluralistic america but why should expect whites to become humanized perhaps it is that after cultural nationalism has worked its wonder among blacks whites will come to respect their strength and will therefore be willing to cooperate with them yet it seems rather senseless to expect whites to change simply because blacks are the sole interpreters of their culture whites will still direct the important political and economic forces why should whites at this point in time decide to humanize themselves perhaps the answers to these questions may be found in the dialectics created by having two cultural views developing side by side i certainly do not know since these questions are crucial to the positions that implicity expect whites to change they merit serious consideration some black leaders who are organizing the black community seem to require a religious devotion of their followers it is not my intention to judge such organizational efforts the religious cultist has a long tradition within the black community there are few black people who have not been touched in some way by such figures as father divine and prophet jones the religious cult continues to play an important role among the poor and deserves serious study among the more affluent and better educated blacks the mystical leader has very little appeal and without the black middle class being involved i question whether these movements can create a unified black community it does appear that some of these movements are attempting to use faith and commitment as instruments to bring about total acceptance and submission to economic and political positions that are still in need of clarification one finds such arrangements where membership within the group determines ones politics economics and religion within tribal communities and we also read of their disintegration as africans attempt to enter the th century we must also doubt whether anyone who attempts to roll back the clock and refuses to enter the twentieth century will be successful among blacks for more and more blacks are entering colleges and universities and we do not find these young people affiliating with the cultist or strongleader movements perhaps nathan hares injunction deserves our careful attention we need to stop being just expressiveand stop making everything we do a religion for if any organization excludes the young educated black because of its refusal to be clear about its politics and economic plans then i must seriously question its ultimate efficacy within the black community and i see such an organization as becoming one more cultist groupthat will eventually languish within the very misery that it hoped to overcome gerald a mcworter and nathan hare point to the ills in american education and suggest directions for black studies theirs is a shotgun blast that recounts that evils of white education and only broadly points to the path and work that awaits black studies perhaps that is all that can be expected at this time other voices attempt to place the black experience in a historical perspective the question for martin kilson is whether the afroamerican experience falls within the human experience his answer is yesit does examining history he discovers that blacks have committed crimes against blacks that blacks pursued and profited from black slavery and that blacks continue to exploit other blacks haiti is an example of the latter he takes exception to the notion that the black mans suffering cleansed him of all evil and at the same time endowed him with a special righteousness kilson understands the political motives that inspire some to define black as virtue and white as sin although he sympathizes with the black nationalists and their motives for stating their views in politically expedient terms his intellect rejects their position anyone seriously concerned with the black struggle in america has to relate to kilsons observations he does not permit the world to be seen and manipulated as in a never produced hollywood western where the good guys wear black hats and the bad guys wear white ones his view of history intro duces ambiguity which makes it difficult to judge the past nevertheless kilsons historical perspective forces us to grapple with the past in an effort to understand it hopefully enabling us to better deal with the present kilsons way by far is the most difficult but it may be the only way sixteen papers were read at the yale symposium fifteen papers talked about and around black studies and these voices were necessary if for no other reason than to place the defense of black studies and the need to rationalize black studies behind us robert farris thompsons paper the sixteenth one will be remembered for his paper is black studies thompson unveils those artistic threads that connect africa with black america he not only discusses the racial attitude that has suppressed african art in america but gets on with the job of describing afroamerican art and tracing its history in america in livingston county missouri henry gudgell an afroamerican carved a walking stick that is quite similar to tribal staffs found in west africa the afroamerican potters of south carolina produced distinctive ceramics that combined european and african influences from tidewater georgia to lafayetteville new york thompson shows us what black american artists have done he presents his material in a clear concise and thoroughly exciting manner i have always thought of art history as a dull undertaking something to be endured and seldom enjoyed in thompsons hands art history is enlightening and a pleasure to read the yale symposium was a necessary experience it is now behind us and all of us who are laboring in black studies have the awesome responsibility of setting to work in the end we all know that black studies is the work to come black pride some contradictions by ann cook have listened with excitement to plans that have been sketched by some very bright and dedicated black minds for an allencompassing scc black not blackfront communications network the prospects of having a powerful black multimedia that transmits another set of values and the truth of what is happening and what must happen is encouraging after all we can not really expect the man who is the enemy to provide us with the tools that will spell his doom yet to get such a vast project into full operation will take many years in the meantime we need to take stock of our present predicament how far if at all have we moved psychologically and intellectually since the new black awareness began what values do we hold what values should we begin to embrace many experts black and white are using newspapers and the airwaves to assess the plight of africans in this country and to direct us down the proper path to liberation i do not claim to be an expert mine will be a laymans opinion but then i do believe that it is the layman africans opinion that must be listened to more often by those who would liberate us for this evaluation two areas need comment the first area might be called white values in black face a most blatant and vulgar example of this was beamed to television viewers on like it is on sunday august on a show featuring black models and black fashions i shall ignore the fact that most of the black models preferred to sell their blackness to white agencies that is another essay what really pained me was the elaborate fashion show of clothing in african prints and styles now i would be the first to admit that there is nothing sacred about most african cloth itself indeed much of what is pawned off to us as african prints has never seen africa but our turn to africa should hopefully be for the richness of its culture an awareness of which can enable us to smooth out the rough spots of what we have stubbornly held on to we would look to the heart of africa for a purge of decadent western values for a new philosophical and spiritual base in short for regeneration but what did these proud american african designers show us directly inspired by africa there was even a west african model making it all very african models slithered past the cameras in african print bikinis they wiggled by in hiphugging african print bellbottoms miraculously held up by the models pelvic bones and if enough western style sex was not marketed with those there were the moslem long dresses and coats that were transparent such irony recall the islamic codes for women caucasians especially the united states variety are noted for their ruthless destruction of the cultures of others whatever parts they can reach and their vulgarization of what remains are we so suicidal that we must destroy ourselves and for what the other examples to be mentioned of white values in black face are not as damnable and will probably sort themselves out in time both have to do with the tendency now to break away from white ac tivities and organize our own modelling the affair after that of the whites in other words it is the tendency to simply counter white activities instead of creating black ones as a response to the winter olympics a few years ago for example a group in new york organized black snow we also have black beauty contests but the format of the competition is haunted to the bone by atlantic citytiered crowns queenly robes do african queens wear robes and all there are those who would argue that an abrupt departure from the american way would cost us converts perhaps so i will not argue that point here let us just hope that all who organize and partici pate in the contests whether actively or passively understand the carbon copy nature of most of our black awareness activities as for the african fashions the first and by far the most treacherous of the white values discussed i can not be charitable at all the black designers selling blackness so cheaply must be loudly and roundly condemned the second area that seems to need attention is one so pervasive that to attempt to localize or isolate examples leads to a certain amount of distortion properly we can label the area antiblackness or the subtle selfhatred of aware africans a not so subtle example of this antiblackness juts out at us from the words and actions of our latest crop of vanguard liberators once again as if history has taught us nothing we have become blackfronts taking money and orders from our great white fathers who amply reward us by giving us all the publicity we think we need as they make us sound tough and affectionately call ourtheir new leader a quintessential american old uncle tom has come back as a city slicker again we are being duped by people who tell us that the antiafricanismand i deliberately say antiafricanism here and not antiblackness that runs rampant throughout this world its poisonous fangs pricking even the most well meaning souls this problem of antiafricanism we are told must take a backseat to karl marxs priorities it is far easier to deal in that nebulous world than to turn inward and unite and build ourselves i will dare to go further even though i identify with the other colored peoples of this world since we all share a common exploiter and i know that being the majority of the worlds population we should unite to defeat this man i still have the sneaking suspicion that much of the third world embrace is yet another unconscious desire not to deal with africa itself and with ourselves as we finally must i heard a very passionate denouncement of the united states for its involvement in latin america by an american african when asked his feelings about us involvement in africa his face showed bewilderment what involvement the most fantastic irony that comes out of this new third world thrust is that again we are seeing more and more distinctly african young people walking around wearing indian headbands especially in new york remember the preblack awareness days me im part indian another more subtle antiafrican tendency is becoming apparent in the bush afro we do not mind wearing an afro if we have the kind of hair that can make a bush or if our straightening comb can help us out so again it is good hair afros that is really what afrosheen raveen and all the other complex kits of sprays are all aboutgetting the kinks out admittedly there is grave danger in bringing up the question of hair and skin color when we need more than anything else to become united and are finally moving in that direction and we also rightly fear that emphasizing this color contradiction will lead to a rejection of all but the most jet black and the kinkiest headed as the beauty symbols a reversal there is a clear and present danger that frank discussion of this contradiction can in fact be divisive but we cannot become truly unified until we sift out this problem although i do not subscribe to the belief that slavery and colonialism left us dehumanized far from it i do believe however that in the area of colorconsciousness we have been brutally scarred as i traveled through latin america during the summer of the enormity of the antiafrican complex was dramatized i saw so many parallels to the selfhatred tendencies we know so well here somehow although intellectually we know better we suppose that language will make us different we assume that those africans in this hemisphere who were enslaved by the french or the dutch or the spanish or the portuguese would have been impressed with a different mentality from ours at least we feel they would certainly not have directly translatable phrases like those that are so much a part of our culture but no matter whether the language of the countries i visited was english french spanish dutch or portuguese there were phrases for good hair and for marrying light to improve the race as well as others we would immediately recognize here i noticed the same phenomenon in the speech of educated africans during my two years in africa your hair is your crowning glory a dear friend always warned me in panama a very prominent black man told me of his heartbreak when the mother of the girl he wanted to marry prohibited the arrangement chiding the girl for not having any ambition he was not a bum he was too dark eurobrazilians like many other caucasian latin americans who claim to be color blind have intricate gauges to see just how african ones features really are there it is quite all right to have african blood if it does not show the more caucasian the person looks the more readily he will boast to a black foreigner of his negro blood i had one of the most amusing experiences of my life when i visited a prominent brazilian scholar and his wife in their home along with a white american couple in the course of that inevitable discussion about the race problem in this country the brazilian turned to me with his face beaming with pride ann he said im going to tell you something that will surprise you i waited my grandmother was a negro his face and gestures were saying to me now what do you think of that i looked at him warmly and said oh that doesnt surprise me at all it shows in your features he panicked no no no he shouted shaking his head furiously i dont have a single negro feature by now his entire body was in contortions shaking his finger in rhythm with the other movements he assured me not one and of course he had measured his skull and his nose and his lips as so many in the twilight zone do he hurriedly began to pull up his sleeves as he said of course we latinsthe sunyou know we get tanned i never said a word the house fell absolutely silent in their white embarrassment i laughed like a sonofagun because these countless categories are set to label each african men in the twilight zone put vaseline on their hair and brush it to make it lay down one man in recife whom i would have sworn was just a plain white man told me of the care he has to take with his hair slicking it down the more african the man or boy the shorter the haircut the desire is to try to score plus marks in some category if the hair does not pass the test maybe the skin will or the nose or the skull shape and hopefully always the lips one successful mulatto businessman from surinam lamented african blood is so strong it just seems to come through anyway its stronger than any other blood in his case he pointed out he was only part african yet look at his features he moaned and in belem brazil one hears of a brilliant young female economist whose skin is very black my informant said that the young lady was sorry her hair would not bouffant she is by the way single in that land where marrying light to improve the race is indeed a seriously practiced doctrine this bright economist went shopping for a car and ordered one that was completely white inside and out including sidewalled tires she threw a tantrum when the car arrived not conforming to her specifications for four months she lay in the hospital after she seriously burned her skin trying to bleach herself with a soda solution she now walks around with white powder on her face and a blond wig on but many brazilian african women would not have tried to be beautiful since women as obviously african as that economist would normally have known that they did not stand a chance most would have resigned themselves to being very bright brazilians readily admit that the africans in brazil are by far the most intelligent members of the citizenry but can this young woman who tortured herself so completely to become white simply be dismissed as a mental case is she really exceptional or is it that her manifestations of her antiafricanism are the exception surely we are torturing ourselves here just as hazardously we sing im black and im proud but we are far from convincing to be sure the healthiest african minds i have met in this hemisphere belong to the socalled bush negroes of the interior of surinam some africans in paramaribo the capital city creoles they are called feel the bush negroes would be helped if they were referred to as the bush creoles thus making them a group mixed with that sought after european blood the djukas one of the bush negro tribes in the interior would not have been flattered at all by the offer from bukra slaaf the white mans slave when the djukas saw me in their villages invariably they pointed to my afro and praised it lavishly most of the djukas were without western education until recently because most villages refused to allow missionaries entry relatively isolated they have kept their values pretty free of western influences and unlike the brazilian african who has also retained much of the obvious traits of african culture the bush negro is very strongly attracted to africa and africans i was warmly received everywhere a ghanaian was given a thunderous reception when she visited there mothers tried to give her their babies to take back to africa a gesture not to be taken lightly since children are adored in their society it would have been an honor for the child one mother at stolemaneisland became very attracted to me as i became to her and her child upon my departure she tried to give me her son the child was without a doubt far better off there besides her symbols were a bit mixed up america is not africa i was honored as i was to be often throughout the trip by such warmth but i must sound an ominous note i must report that cutouts of white models from european and brazilian magazines that flood latin america can now be found on the walls of a new djuka school everywhere else except in the interior of surinam even in urban africa we are having to convince ourselves that thick lips broad noses and kinky hair accompanying that nowacceptable black skin can be beautiful harry belafonte and lena horne have hastily been painted black and afros have been put on their heads the stereotypical aunt jemima still goes the way of the brazilian economist it is even argued and with much validity that african men are embracing the third world concept not only for ideological reasons nor to avoid the concrete task of organizing black people the suggestion is that third worldism provides a wider field for getting to a miss ann type without the caucasianworshipping africans real motive being detected this next and final point in the area of antiafricanisms is admittedly a very ticklish one it has to do with the practice of islam i speak of it very reluctantly because first of all some of the africans in this country whom i admire and respect tremendously are converting to islam second racist historians have through the centuries tried to change the map of africa making north africa an extension the sound of soul by larry neal garlands till book the sound of xt soul is primarily concerned with the sixties she has written an important book anybody seeking cogent information on soul music should check it out more books like this one are neededmore books that go into the music in even greater depths than this one and even with its obvious limitations this is an important book because black music particularly soul music is one of the most outstanding cultural forces operative in todays world and somebody has got to begin to confront the subject with the kind of seriousness attempted by sister garland in order to do this and make it useful to black people it is necessary that those who consider themselves intellectual architects of afroamerica look at the living culture in the most penetrating terms possible this means reaching deep inside of ourselves into concrete experience and shifting memory and giving as much weight to experience as we give to theory particularly the theories laid on us by the euroamerican black music demonstrates that culture is essentially a living reality many of us seem to think that black culture is something outside of ourselves some ancient magical force that we must go through all kinds of changes to obtain when in fact the culture is within allah and ogun are within sprawling cities of kush the ritual and dahomey shines eternal song we carry these within us they are manifested in the living culture we are the continuation of black memory our songs are the emanations of that memory our rhythms the force that drives that memory bessie smith sang that the meanest folks in the whole wide world lives on black mountain she was singin bout niggers evil and bad but surviving in spite of everything niggerblack black music niggersthe nigger in the music being its dominant force all and everything is in black priests scientist warrior slave cullud negro negro african africanamerican asiatic afroamerican brother but it is nigger energy that will rule b b king has more to tell me about the world that i can use than most poets and intellectuals here he is talking to phyl garland blues is b b king yes and ive been a crusader for it for years without this i dont think i could live very longnot that i think im goin to live a long time anyway but i dont think i could live even that long if i had to stop playin or if i couldnt be with the people i love so the people that have helped me so much i couldnt live i try to give them a message i try hard how many of us are so dedicated to whatever it is that we do how many of us commit ourselves so thoroughly to our work how many of us link our work to the survival of both ourselves and our people sister garlands interview with b b king is one of the most penetrating pieces in the book because it basically concerns the man stripped down to his most human core and we learn so much about our cultural heroes this way in order for the culture to really be a force for liberation we must feel it manifested in our daily lives it must breathe sing or dance to take us to a more profound understanding of the nature of the spiritual truths that we have inherited not dead scriptures but rather living revelations and visions that are thrust upon us daily sometimes they be rough edged and raw with pain therefore given a world in which we could create free of the manipulations of the beast the most positive forces in that world would be black artists and not the dead texts of the world that now rule our lives and shape our visions not the dead texts that now dominate us wearing us down and splitting us apart from each all of the moral and philosophical visions that are to be imagined can find expression in black art we will write our own scriptures we will seek validation of the truths that we sense must exist in the holiest work of each one of us from spirits like b b king jimmy reed son house james brown smokey robinson moms mabley an ethnic will be fashioned whose fundamental truths can be denied by no one could this be one of the ultimate goals of third world culture because in the coming technological age art will be one of the few paths open to the humanization of mankind it will come full circle back to the most functional purposes of art art as the civilizer and judge of man the struggles of third world peoples will birth a new moral and artistic philosophy and this new moral and artistic philosophy will govern the uses of the advanced technology for the curve of history is not merely toward the material liberation of man but is also towards his spiritual liberation as well to merely perceive the dynamics of historical change in material terms is to set up the possibility of constructing more novel more insidious forms of human oppression and black art must essentially aim toward the elimination of human oppression both spiritual and material we will write our own scriptures the bible the book of tao the koran l ching book of the dead the dliammapada the upanishads all contain essential truths about the nature of human existence they contain myths ideas and modes of thought that can be integrated into a newer more profound perception of existence but all of these paths to god have been corrupted and uprooted by the force of change the expanding social universe technology we want the essence of these works not the old forms out of which they come so we must extract out of these dead texts those truths that are of compelling significance and black music points in the direction of what will be of compelling significance it is impossible for these texts to be relevant to this and future generations when the orientations which first created them have ceased to exist as a force on this planet new scriptures are in order new mythologies new constructs black music as the model for the black nation black art must be the reincarnated accumulation of all of the worlds positive moral values all that is useful and that moves toward concrete human liberation we are a new species of man child liberation will come out of honkytonk bars gutbucket blues and the meanest niggers that have ever walked the planet saw bobby blue bland singing uptown he had on a silver dashiki and his process the current soul music explosion illustrates the mass culture of black america is still strong and still dominated by the eternal spirit of the blues god soul music is a compelling force it is highly collective in nature embracing all of black america and as b b king says we must respect it artistic liberation will come out of a reshaping of the familiar gospels blues and cosmic music all of the strands and jive categories of black music will begin crisscrossing and intermeshing together towards something resembling a new form a unity music pharoah sanders leon thomas junior walker roland kirk sun ra the impressions the temptations are already showing the way at the point when the music has finally destroyed its bullshit categories and is in fact a unity music most of us will then know that we are a nation a people with an operational identity and committed to total liberation niggers will then invent new terms to describe their essential history and prehistory all of that untapped energy indicated in black music will be released and turned in the direction of making a world in which love can exist freely and cleanly thats whats happening thats what always has been happening as we move song after song cycle unto cycle we will drag with us the accumulated wonder pain and memory of our prior lives it is time for the niggers the fellahs the kaffirs the coolies to purify the earth with funkier images listen to soul music listen to the collective will of black people to survive on their own terms love them for the most part they love you straight ahead sister phyl garland next time give yourself more timeor take it next time let more hangout for example what are the social conditions under which the music is created how does the music interact with dance styles life styles beyond making a living what are the artists mostly concerned with why is there so little control of the economics of black music by black people does the mafia really control motown are there many white ar men fucking with the music what do the artists have to say about this does the soul musician see himself as merely a performer whose role is to simply entertain or are they goaded on like b b king and nina simone by a larger social purpose these are just a few of things that black music criticism could explore more work like the sound of soul is badly needed because it is finally the living culture that will show the way by that i mean this if we can not confront and shape the culture that black people have developed here in a merica we will fail to bring about a real spiritual revolution among black people we will be doing the cakewalk and the people will be doing the popcorn thank you sister garland for putting something worthwhile out there ream p by eloise greenfield delores was upstairs v irx in the bedroom nurturing her daydream when she heard alber mw ta come in the front door a few minutes earlier she had been sitting on the side of the bed reading again the free ticket from the recreation center her pass to see lonnie and the barons at the openair theater she had rubbed her thumb across the surface of the paper admiring its power to transport her into another world and the anticipation of such terrifying joy had exploded suddenly like cherry bombs inside her she was propelled into the middle of the bed bouncing and laughing aloud kicking her feet in the air as if she were still a little kid then she lay back her madness dispelled allowing herself to slide into the daydream she had been creating since she received the ticket feeding it more of herself each time it enveloped hermore of her longing her need lonnie would fall in love with her he wouldnt care that she was still skinny and almost flatchested at fifteen or that she was a year behind in school somehow even in the dark crowded amphitheater he would see the love in her eyes and he would say how you doing lores over the mike in an offhand supercool way without her even telling him her name and that would be their beginning this time she added that he would invite her up to watch the show from the wings and all her friends would gaze with envy as she strolled down the long aisle the closing of the door downstairs was a distant sound and in tangibly ominous then she remembered that alberta hadnt been wearing her girdle when she went out she hadnt even bothered to put on one of her floppy shirts to hang outside her skirt she had worn a white knit blouse tucked inside a skirt that was stretched into wrinkles by the swell of her stomach incongruous with her slender legs and arms it was as if delores thought she had decided to face their mother and the rest of the world all in one long torturous day this was the moment delores had been dreading during the weeks of late nights that she had watched from bed pretending to be asleep as her sister peeled off her girdle and sighed sliding her hands under and over the bronze roundness before she smoked a last cigarette and went to bed delores heard her mother downstairs ask as if by rote part of a compulsory ritual you look for work today and under albertas sullen yeah she could hear the apprehension even with steps between them but she knew it wouldnt reach her mother find any no the silence was long delores could imagine her mothers face gentle dark brown heart with soft eyes soft mouth that had tensed at albertas entrance now gone slack with shock then you pregnant again girl the words were spaced with heavy gasps you pregnant again and that boy upstairs aint even hardly two years old yet delores closed the bedroom door and went over to the open window she leaned on the sill and looked out at the sky above the multiindented glutted garbage cans and the grey dirt yards with occasional haggard patches of halfgreen trying to recapture her daydream but dark summer clouds were growing in the sky and all she could think of was the buckets she should be setting out to catch the rain that would drip through the leaks bringing with it flecks of plaster closing the door didnt shut out what was going on downstairs delores knew from the memory of past crises each a rehearsal for the next the various forms this one would assume before it subsided at this moment alberta would be shifting her weight from one foot to the other looking bored except for the plea behind the veil of her eyes while her mother floundered between pain and fury her mother would threaten to slap alberta windingthough she never would she would remind her of how hard she had worked all the years since she was widowed so that they could make something of themselves and how she had never allowed any man before or after her husband to touch her she would point out how much less marriageable alberta was now she would talk on and on as if the eush of words could erode the growth in her daughters womb on and on until the plea in albertas eyes hardened into a kind of hatred the first slow raindrops struck delores hand and she closed the window she decided to wait until the last minute and then to run for the buckets in the cellar postponing her involvement in the scene downstairs delores understood her mother she had seen her come home from the laundry many nights so tired that the fork would tremble in her hand at dinner she had heard her laughter that was often impure fused with tears of loneliness she remembered how things had been for all of them before her father died yet she not only understood alberta she sometimes felt that she was albertaa second alberta following three years behind the original toward a trail of transient men chubby unwanted babies and spiritwithering jobs in a search for air like now she wanted to fling out her arms knocking away the torn onceblue shades over windows that wouldnt remain all the way up in summer yet wouldnt seal in winter the leaky ceilings the schoolprison in which she sat daily while her brain hopped from one instruction to another from one book to another leaving her behind in its pursuit of meanings the ragged balls of newspaper that having been read or soaked a childs urine from a floor or hung on the jags of a broken window blocking out the wind and rain now rolled about on the sidewalks she longed to breathe to inhale with her whole body new air to feel the way alberta looked when she danced when alberta danced she was up high where coolness caressed the nostrils she was free eyes tightly closed arms and legs swinging loose hips defying constraintanswering only to the demands of the throbbing music sometimes she would dance with the baby in her arms twirling him until he was almost out of breath with giggling but when the beat ended and she opened her eyes she would hand the baby to delores and leave across the sky the downpour was approaching and delores ran for the buckets with a prayer that it wouldnt rain the next day and cancel the show u u p the air in the special recreation department bus was muggy it had rained all night and part of the day not stopping until late afternoon but now the sky was clear and delores was relieved to be on the bus with the other kids on her way to the amphitheater somebody played a transistor radio and two couples danced in the aisle disregarding the drivers orders delores had expected her best friend ann to sit with her on the bus but somehow tommy had squeezed between them at the door and taken the seat instead short too quiet tommy who liked her his presence disturbed her branded her for herself and others as being unworthy of more dynamic attention she ignored him and joined in the fun around her while watching strip who sat with a girl across the aisle his arm was curved around the girls shoulder and his fingers dangled nervously an inch from the point of her breast under delores jealousy ran a vicarious tingling at the possibility that his hand would brush against the girl and she giggled excessively at the jokes being passed around until she left the bus and was walking toward her seat delores had been almost satisfied with her appearance her dress was a sleeveless print that had once been albertas and except for armholes that were a little too large and would expose her slip if she raised her arms it was a good fit but now she saw that compared to the other spectators she and her friends looked bedraggled and they drew together walking to their seats in a silent huddle like a giant dowdy earthworm in her daydream delores had seen the amphitheater as a traditional moviehouse picked up from its main street location and set down in the park and the unexpected treewalls and starred sky roof dwarfed awed her crickets chirped a competitive background to the comedian and the girl gospelsinger who were the preliminary acts on the show delores waited not listening willing her emotions into a state of suspension for lonnie barrage of screams four gold suits flashing onstage drums lonnie at the mike why why why did you go did you leave three pairs of arms swing up back out bodies swayingstep forward step back turn around clap turn around clap sweet sweet guitar its a brand new worold lights spinning orange blue purple spinning pur pie purple ann singing softly voices whiningsing to me lonnie baby ohhh shit now oh my lord screams exploding hands jackets off flaming green shirts sleeves flowing seats and people shrinking sliding away lonnie singing for her to her oohooh babay babay baabaaa going higheraaaa shrieks from far away coming in wavesaaaahigher stretching stretchingstrange tickleitch in her breasts and throbbing between her thighsaaaay sliding down to its finish endless scream of ecstatic painhers oh lonnie lonnie she stared out the window all the way back to the recreation center she felt a quiet quietsomethingunshatterable in the clamor on the bus she felt insulated somehow made forever invulnerable by what had passed between lonnie and her she walked home with ann chattering at her side they said goodnight at anns house and delores walked on to hers four doors down the tinny sound of water dripping in a recently emptied bucket greeted her as she unlocked the door although it hadnt rained for several hours the dripping would continue throughout the night delores could imagine countless plotting drops of water gathered in a puddle on the roof trickling down between the walls of her house and mrs stones next door and across the first floor ceiling until they found an opening to squeeze through that you lores her mother asked coming from the kitchen her voice sounded as if it were caught in a pocket of her throat her eyes were red and delores rememberedalberta was pregnant again in bed she thought about lonnie and about herself she knew that lonnie hadnt actually sung to her that the dream was just an illusion but the new air she had breathed was real lonnie and the music the trees the stars had all been real and for the first time in her life she had felt the way al berta looked when she danced but she wasnt alberta she was delores for her there must be there had to be other tastes of airand other dreams of europe and therefore of the civilized world that africans south of the sahara were instrumental in the development and perpetuation of the north african civilizations there can be no doubt yet these same africans in their often small kingdoms south of the sahara when they did accept islam and other aspects of north african culture syncretized it with indigenous religious beliefs as of course they still do my question is why really do we embrace islam as a reaction to christianity because of the religious tenets these i can accept because it can unify africans i seriously question that if we mean to also include africans of africa in this unity drive i wonder if in addition to our choosing islam as a rejection of christianity and for its tenets we are not also accepting it because of its legitimacy by the same token i wonder why we spend so much of our discourse about africa emphasizing the great kingdoms of songhai bornu ghana and mali could it be because these kingdoms were similar in structure and size to european ones and serve as reassurance to us that we had the same thing they had even when as with islam these kingdoms were not the norm my point is that we still cannot deal with black africa with pagan africa from whence most of us came somehow we suspect that what they have taught us so well about black africa is really sound after all these africans did not have a writing system except for the moslems who were not the majority they worshipped fetishes they were organized by and large into small societal bodies it is easier to embrace islam than to begin to look seriously at traditional african religions to find what those concepts are and which ones attract us and are in fact malleable for our situation here again it appears we have been reluctant to look closely at ourselves we are also too lazy often to take close looks i have heard revolutionary music and read revolutionary plays with what was represented as african languages in the text but it was simply mumbojumbo just like hollywood would do it not even one word or pharse was authentic harsh echoes of tarzan and the westerns with the injun talk are reverberating as i conclude by offering some suggestions i will admit that my criticism touches various thrusts of black liberation efforts already one reader of a draft of this has accused me of moving in the direction of advocating antiquity cults i admit that i could not deal with his comments because when i hear the words cult and dialect in the racist way they are usually employed various kinds of bells and buzzers automatically go off in my head effectively impairing my power of reasoningafrican cults african dialects black_power cults negro dialect or patois as though the standard language form is not also a dialect but aside from that the question of whether or not i want africans here to transfer from africa lock stock and barrel all of its culture f can clearly respond to black africa has cosmological beliefs that are very similar just as the life styles the dress patterns the languages all share a common mold yet in this unity there is diversity in terms of specific rendering of the cultural patterns f am suggesting that we try to get to the essence of african culture the tarppings are not as important and i am suggesting more there is absolutely no substitute for hard organizing we can not escape it f have been convinced of that by my observations of the ascria movement in guyana and of the movements president eusi kwayana a giant of a man various dramatic programs such as the black manifesto on reparations certainly educate us by exposing the contradictions we did not know were there but whatever hard cash we need for psychological reasons must come from us we must be organized to think in terms of relying on ourselves we must think in terms of building and sustaining our own institutions a herculean task for organizers it requires a discipline we momentarily lack and an orientation too few of us have our leaders are still looking for easy ways out we will hardly get the orientation that is necessary unless we can take that long look at ourselves as has been suggested over and over in this essay in the absence of a powerful media to be our mirror there seems little substitute for travel to get out of this territory is to get a breath of clean air and to put everything into perspective but more we must see that there is a circular link of africans little here gives us even an inkling of that fact the west is aware of the vast potential we have as a people it is for that reason that we have been kept so cleverly fragmented the publicized enmity between american africans and west indian africans and between the western hemisphere africans and the africans of our motherland has certainly been a vast and successful propaganda ploy we have been so demoralized by this trickery that all of us move timidly with each other the african visiting from africa is very cautious when we visit africa or latin america we build a wall with the same caution from all indications the ploy has worked more on us than on any other africans we have no real i idea what affection our brothers and sisters all over feel for us here we are not told in any of the media of the various ways they move to demonstrate their support and affection this news is effectively blotted out to keep us feeling isolated nor do we realize how much small hardworking well organized groups are doing in many countries to strengthen black people and to build solidarity amongst us all assuming that we are the baddest we spend little time in healthy interchange with groups that could teach us so much as we give them insights all africans would readily acknowledge however that in a real sense we here are the baddest since we are to be sure at the vultures beak in many ways we have fortunately protected ourselves from americas hangups in one crucial way we have not and we must immediately purge ourselves when we travel it must be american style with a maximum of material comfort this means that we live in luxury hotels and become tourists since that luxury hotel environment dooms us psychologically and cuts us off in actual fact from all but caucasians or their types but we do have problems there is the problem of heat insects bad water strange food and language barriers to deal with the last obstacle to our nontouristy travel first language is probably wise language is not as much a barrier as we fear if we really want to communicate you will find nothing but goodwill on the part of our brothers who will go to all ends to try to understand us a djuka boy in suriname just could not understand how both of us could look alike and not be able to understand each other he set in to try to teach me djuka he would never have tried so tirelessly with a caucasian even when i have insisted that i just did not understand and was ready to give up there has always been that brave soul in every country who would not let me be so cowardly i am not suggesting that we should deliberately move about without knowing the languages of the countries we plan to visit there should be some knowledge of the languages if it is possible i have not meant to imply that everything will run as smoothly if you do not speak the language as it will if you do in nine weeks in latin america i gathered far more vital information than many of the white researchers i met there who were studying us yet i missed so much that i would have gained had i spoken the language of the people as was indicated above there are times your nerves fail or you become so frustrated that you want to retreat but i have learned far more on what for me have been informal trips and have met far more beautiful people than i ever would have had i lived in big hotels and not ventured out language or no the other problems for the american africans are far more grave than the language barrier they center around the need for material comfort america has made us so soft that many of us honestly cannot survive outside an american type environment notice how we always come back to this place we honestly do need airconditioning we cannot survive the greedy mosquitoes and other worrisome insects the latest trend is to move about from our airconditioned living rooms and bedrooms to our airconditioned cars to airconditioned offices the new genocide will not be a very expensive operation for the man he will not need to fire a single bullet nor to populate a single camp why he will only need to blow his hot breath on us and watch us as we affected by the heat from his mouth melt and die before his eyes we need comfortable beds we could never sleep on benches as many of the nationbuilders in guyana have accustomed themselves to doing enabling them to sleep anywhere i hasten to say that i am not suggesting that we sleep on benches before i lose all readers forthwith but i have good reason to believe that many students are now not so frightened by the prospect we expect room service and are happiest with european food especially hot dogs and hamburgers therefore perhaps some intermediate stops before leaving this territory will help toughen us for profitable travel abroad i propose trips to the rural south first bypass atlanta and that fabulous ho tel go to the country to little towns like my hometown buena vista georgia someone has suggested getting northerners down to rural areas and having them pick cotton shake peanuts pick peaches etc with our brothers and sisters there it is a good idea it would certainly force us into another physical environment and just as travel abroad will solidify us with our brothers so would close communication with the rural southerner it would probably help some of us to begin for the very first time in our lives to eet the sense of community so pitifully artificial no matter the efforts in northern cities still another obstacle keeps the american africans from traveling abroad modestly and so meeting more local people just as the fashions we ape are those that new york paris and london sell to us by way of madison avenue so are the aspirations and tastes we struggle to acquire those that are made glamorous to us by the powerful multimedia we want when we finally are able to travel to travel executive fashion firstclass all the way because these trappings have been dangled in our faces for so long more than anything in the world we want to experience them we should work hard on ourselves also to extricate ourselves from our feelings of superiority we exist in a country that is highly technical but there is absolutely nothing superior about us nothing it will be difficult not to feel superior at times when a certain amount of adulation and wonderment is being heaped upon you by those who see the united states as the most wonderful place in the universe a portrayal beamed to all the world by u s multimedia and reinforced by those been tos who have come here to visit or reside and needs to enhance their prestige upon their return to their homes this is why we must work on our ego needs as much as possible before departing many people will simply welcome us because we are their brothersnot cousins as mboya suggestedand because we are involved in a liberation movement this group will be able to detect those unwarranted superior feelings immediately and while they may or may not react directly to them they will nevertheless shift to a white relationship with us but the same will be so when we go to the rural south the same currents will be present this is why the south provides such an excellent dryrun for latin america and africa until now the word revolution has not been used in this essay do we have black pride before we can begin to think that a revolution is near that question must be answered affirmatively the answer can not be affirmative when we have only begun the discussion of values and have no machinery for transmitting them it can not be an affirmative answer when we are spending more time with theatrics than with hard unglamorous organizing it can not be said that we have black pride or that a revolution is near when we are still no matter the elaborate disguises trying to be white to have black pride will mean redefining blackness to redefine blackness necessitates examining what we are and sorting it out deciding what should be retained and strengthened and what should be cast aside redefining blackness necessitates removing the artificial boundaries that now exist amongst all africans by thrashing out the contradictions that created them we would then rip down the artificial boundaries of class complexion agethe latest hangupand territorial limits to see that we do have resources and that these resources do not in any way need to be legitimized by the nonafrican world we need only one stampour own with our solidarity assured we can move as a strong force instead of in our usual role of junior partner flunky and the other recognizable slots joining forces with whatever people we choose ann cook author of the article black pridesome contradictions is currently doing formal study and library research for a book project of a proud poetic ship in irons but the open organic form of the cahier permits the development of these tendencies seriatim here is selfexpression maximized he is himself he is all the potentiality of gifted youth a perfect vehicle for the expression of the confined potentiality of his weary race who are we really we blackmen he now asks and the poem moves forward into a series of jerky dance stepspunctuated by the refrain voum rooh ohin which the poet celebrates his favorite pagan frenzies in a headdress of parakeet feathers a spit in the face of the missionaries for once but is not all this also a lie the phrase bout de petit matin limps forward again slightly truncated it is the morning after the poet is hung over it is the filthy end of the world the end of a hundred years of whiplash what sort of words go with these realities the catalog of exotic transformations is replaced albeit reluctantly by a catalogue of base occupations and indignities no we have never been amazons of the king of dahomey he says never princes of ghanathereby poetically establishing his heritage by renouncing it weve been lackeys shiners of shoes but by we doesnt he still in a sense mean they there follows an individual confrontation the harrowing description of a single black observed in the streetcar along with others in the car the poet has found him comic and ugly such is the extent of his complicity with the white world such is the extent of his cowardice and the old dream of cannibalistic cruelties he cannot resist giving his apocalyptic exoticism another go these are replaced by sarcastic acknowledgments of his newfound humility reclaim for my face the brilliant praise of expectoration a new movement is again introduced as an extended answer to an abrupt question but what strange pride suddenly illuminates me this is the ecstatic hymn to negritude uttered in the fraternal presence of all the fresh things of nature all beginnings summoned to participate in the recreation of the black self here the poet speaks what are to become his most famous lines litanies of acceptance alternate with supplications for sorcerers powers to transform his island his it plunges into the red flesh of the soil it plunges into the ardent flesh of the sky it bores through the opaque prostration of its upright patience eia for the royal kailcedrat eia for those who have never invented anything for those who have never explored anything for those who have never tamed anything but they abandon themselves possessed to the essence of every thing ignorant of surfaces but possessed by the movement of everything v heedless of taming but playing the game of the world islanders his race by the arts of language into manifestations of pride and beauty suddenly further life and force assail him the expansion of his being has reached mystical proportions and the resources of his language are no longer sufficient to his task he feels the seismic pulse of the island in his embrace he sees prophetically the future of the negro race which he expresses in a cadenza of simple statements beginning with the word debout upright in the hold upright in the cabins upright on the bridge upright in the wind upright in the sun upright in the blooderect and free as his people rise so the poet ascends on the wind to meet new sources of verbal inspiration in the night sky the poem ends vertically debout perpendicular to the beginning the flat face of the island au bout du petit matin cesaire imagines that henri christophe was an incarnation of the yoruba god shango shango has a curious legendary history as a king who angry as ajax once destroyed his entire family by mistake and then hung himself in his apotheosis as the thunder god dispenser of justice his manifestations are sporadic and violent shango wears red and red is the color of those whose heads he mounts whom he rides like horses who by temperamental affinity are his votaries blood horses thunder and a savage spirit have always been linked in cesaires system of correspondences and his most powerful monsters are dipped in red but in la tragedie du roi christophe for the first time the identification is at least temporarily explicit was it always implied or was it only recently in a dry time that the poet anxious about the strength and efficacity of his vocation became at last completely aware of the full of the shattering ambiguity of the african presence on a caribbean isle must be remembered that the colonized male is very much the target of the colonial system a number of studies have shown that the black male is failed more often and tends to be encouraged out of the school system with much greater frequency than the black female it is little wonder then that the black school children protect what is left of their egos by calling anyone who succeeds academically a sissy so much for descriptions of what is and what has been the only reason for describing what the outlines of a psychology of colonialism may be is to call for the participation of black psychologists to help end the colonial relationship between the black community and white america we must begin to do experiments to find out the best ways of developing black people on their own terms rather than to continue to use the instruments of the colonizer to describe what colonization has done to us we must end the tradition of what one of my colleagues likes to call the victim analysis type of research and begin to do reconnaissance research on every colonizer the history of lynching which is not over would be a useful starting place since it reveals deep fears which have helped to produce the long history of hatred and aggression against us i might suggest that lynching is an early sample of overkill requiring both a political and psychodynamic approach to understand it the current notions of a psychology of adjustment as psychological health are inappropriate to our struggle as albert memmi says the colonial condition cannot be adjusted to like an iron collar it can only be broken lw thus if there is to be therapy for black people it must be a therapy of struggle if it is the condition of colonized people to be torn from their past then the struggle must involve a poignant sense of history if the colonized culture is closed to the future as the master psychologist of colonialism frantz fanon suggests then we should see this manifested in individuals as fatalism note the theme of powerlessness in another tat fantasy from the patient mentioned earlier card well this is heaven what heaven really looks like its ruled by six people and these are standing here center detail they are looking down on the world and they rule everybodys life like puppets on a string they can do what they like with people below and the funny thing is that out of all these people not one of them is good they just have a lot of cruel fun with people on the earth i guess they just make life one big joke this severe fatalism brings out nicely the essence of the colonized world view colonized people do not seriously deal with their own existence we must begin to educate our children without transforming them into white anglosaxons in black skins to borrow a phrase from nathan hare nobody not even white folks seem to be pursuing that any longer we must end the use of testing designed to contain and control our existence we must take the notion of nation building seriously as a crucial stage in the creation of a new world we must think of black people as a whole because although we think as individuals we are treated as a whole black professionals must undergo a process of decolonization so that we can think as social scientists and not continue to be defined externally as psychologists anthropologists and etcetera finally a wider point of view is needed if we are to learn the bitter lesson of south african blacks who protested in the early s for nationalism and community control and got it in the form of the bantustan reservations where they are now captive perhaps the best warning from nazistyle south africa can come from the words of de ridder a european liberal reflecting upon some of the uppity brothers and sisters in his study the educated african must be given an outlet he has become educated to increase his earning potential and if he cannot do so he will turn either to crime or become disgruntled frustrated and an agitator the urban african tends towards immature attitudes and an exhibitionistic approach but such functions in no way imply that he will not respond to understanding and tactful handling he has still much to learn especially in the spheres of emotional moderation and control his ideas are rather egotistically biased and education tends to make him feel disproportionately superiorbut he is learning the problem which the european in south africa must face is what to do with those africans whose learning has given them ambitions beyond the industrial colour bar ambitions need outlets if their latent energies are not to be diverted by continual frustration into antisocial activities perhaps we can begin to see the booming black studies business in light of the south african experience by l a egwuonwu ear mr barrett we have read with keen interest your recent article the nigerian crisisin negro digest vol xviii no october your open confession of your limited knowledge of what happened and is still happening in nigeria casts doubts on the validity of your analysis how then can you advise our black brothers in america on situations you profess to be ignorant of in the first and second paragraphs of your article you seem to understand the intentions of the socalled world powers not only in nigeriabiafra but also in the whole of africa it is significant to note that you have been working with the nigerian government over the past two years consequently no one is surprised at your pronigerian stand it is also interesting to note that you quoted maj gen yakabu gowon as having admitted that all was not well in nigeria before and after the january coup and the july mutiny of the same year for the benefit of those black americans whom your article might have deceived we offer the following information young army officers from every part of nigeria took part in the january coup in order to correct the ills of the corrupt government subsequent facts revealed that maj gen aguiyiironsi ibo who later became the head of the federal military government narrowly escaped being killed for the mere fact that most of the coup leaders were lbos and most of those killed in the take over were northerners the suspicion grew that the coup was really an lbo plot to suppress the north and dominate the federation this was the time the british seeds of disunity started growing in nigeria eventually the british succeeded by planning and executing through the northern infantry the mutiny of july in which lbo army officers including general ironsi were slain and general gowon assumed the mantle of office this was followed by the organized killing of about lbo civilians in the fall of you failed to take this loss of human lives into consideration and concluded that these acts of black mans inhumanity to other black men were the best things to do at that particular time here you should be reminded that general ironsi was slain in ibadan western nigeria where he was supposed to discuss and listen to the grievances of the elders and the chiefs drawn from all over nigeria unlike his predecessors general gowon whom you described as stepping in to quell the mutiny was not only a traitor but a rebel to general ironsis regime general ironsi was not given the time and the cooperation to put nigeria on the right track merely because he happened to be an ibo thus a threat to the british interest in nigeria and neocolonialist opportunists would like to refer you to randolph churchills article see london times march churchill traveled to biafra and reported as follows there is scarcely a family that has not suffered loss either in the massacres of the lighting on the war front the bombing of towns and market places or from starvation which has taken the greatest toll of all during and after these massacres general gowon had little choice but to keep silent since the very soldiers who put him in power were the ones most stained with ibo blood despite all these atrocities the then eastern nigeria military governor now majgen odumegwu ojukwu pleaded for a round table conference in order to determine the future of nigeria and to work out a sort of constitutional arrangement that would eliminate causes of friction and restore confidence and harmony throughout nigeria this led to the aburi conference which you have emphasized as though you were a representative i would like you and your nigerian collaborators to explain to the world these few points was an agreement reached at aburi why did nigeria fail to honor such an agreement r for how long after repeated reminders did the then eastern region now biafra wait patiently for the lagos junta to implement the agreement reached at aburi before declaring independence you have tried to make the world believe that biafra is not united under the learership of his excellency general ojukwu responses to this point have been made clear by willintentioned foreign pressmen who have in the past or recently visited biafra here i refer to time magazine of august with the heading biafras agony all the points you made were answered in this particular publication many writers who have been to biafra have written and spoken that the biafrans have been fighting with bare hands small quantities of ammunition captured from nigcrans and the little that could be bought from the black market in europe lastly mr barrett people like you have sought in various ways to dismiss our struggle as a tribal conflict people like you have attributed it to the greed of a fictitious powerseeking clique anxious to carve out an empire to rule to dominate and to exploit this is not so our cause is transparently just and no amount of propaganda can detract us from it our struggle is of far greater significance than you seem to imagine it is a total vehement rejection of all those evils that blighted nigeriaevils which were bound to lead to the disintegration of that illfated federation our struggle is a positive commitment to build a healthy dynamic and progressive state which will be a bulwark against neocolonialism and the pride of black men the world over we hope that all people who have conscience will not fail to chastize you for regarding as a trifle the streams of blood biafra has so far shed would he look better in a sweater and chinos with a science book under his arm what happened to transform the american dream into a potential nightmare the answer to that question will depend of course upon the answerer the runofthecomputer white racist will blame the militants isolating as the root of all the evil those blacks who have said enough and who are ready to back up their decision with fire and funerals the beseiged white liberals ever true to form will also blame the militants begging for moderation characteristically straddling the racial chasm by also admonishing the racists for their extremism the black moderates that everdiminishing breed of successoriented middleclassstraining blacks will follow the white liberals lead as they always do routinely moaning about rampant racism while religiously adjusting to it the black moderates to be sure loathe the black militants more even than the other groups the militants threaten their unsteady perch upon the pedestal of security and stability and so all fingers point accusingly at the militants american society hovers on the edge of catas trophe they would have the world believe because a minority of disaffected blacks will not lie down and play puppy with promises of equality and respect in some vaguely envisioned tomorrow but the militants have another answer to them five centuries of western adventurism and exploitation have brought america to this moment white men fanned out over the earth enslaving and colonizing other men degrading and destroying other cultures at midtwentieth century america holds the legacy of the west and she guards the legacy well the sons of europe still swarm into her gates and america welcomes them with an incomparable gift no matter how diseased or ignorant or debased or criminal the european is presented with the status and privilege and preference to which white skin entitles him in a racist society no matter how low the european may sink or fall he needs never fear to reach the bottom for america has permanently reserved that place for her nonwhite natives and to those blacks who demand an end to degradation america replies wait it takes time the militants say enough they say we will be free men in this country or else this country will go down with us hear also their side of the argument it affects you
a rejoinder to by william j wilson the march issue of negro digest vincent hardj it l wrote a passionate and thoughtprovoking letter to black i r students and faculty in the north which seriously challenged the legitimacy of our creating various programs to effect a more meaningful black experience on predominantly white campuses in hardings own words his letter was written in the spirit of black ecumenical concern as we move towards a new humanity and he encouraged those of us to whom his remarks were directed to respond i am therefore taking this opportunity to react to professor hardings very timely letter since space will not permit an elaborately detailed rejoinder to professor hardings arguments i shall here concentrate on what i take to be the basic points of his statement if i understand his position correctly he maintains that white northern institutions as a result of black student pressure have recently discovered the need to enroll more black students to hire more black faculty and to establish various levels of blkoriented curricula and in attempting to deal with this problem they have begun to exploit black schools in the south by recruiting competent black faculty by entering into serious competition with the southern schools for the best black students and by pirating some afroamerican curriculum which had not been destroyed by integration that such activities are threatening the survival of black institutions because they are not in a position to compete elfectively in terms of the fabulous scholarship and financial aids offered to the best black students and the attractive salary figures assistance for research and other inducements extended to black faculty that black students and faculty of northern institutions are participating fully in this common destruction common in the sense that their activities circumvent the concept of the black university and impede the development of new levels of black solidarity not only by demanding the enrollment of more black students the recruitment of black faculty and the establishment of black studies programs but also by helping to raid black schools to meet their demands that serious questions can be raised about the fruitfulness of such demands and the contradictions they entail eg if only a few institutes in afroamerican studies can live with significant integrity where should they develop and would it not make more sense to bring black students to a blackoriented professor in the south than to take him away from his campus that a program of action to deal with these problems and make it possible for us to serverather than destroyeach other includes a establishing special visiting professorships rather than raiding of black schools b creating a consortium in which one or more black and one or more white schools would pool their funds and jointly participate in the recruitment of black students and thereby provide each student the choice of spending three years at a black institution and a year at a white institution or vice versa c encouraging white institutions to make long term substantial financial investments in the black academic institutions and d organizing institutes to train future teachers of black studies programs at black colleges especially those black schools that have the resources to launch such an institute immediately eg the atlanta university center since i shall have to challenge professor harding on several points of a fundamental nature i should like to begin with a brief statement of the no less important arguments with which i find myself in general accord i agree with professor harding that the frantic search by white college administrators for black faculty if left unchecked will threaten the survival of black schools and that many northern black students and faculty are either consciously or unconsciously contributing to this precarious state of affairs moreover i agree that questions may be raised about the practicality of some northern student demands and the contradictions they entail furthermore i agree that a program of action is needed to correct this unfortunate situation my areas of disaccord are concerned with a number of professor hardings specific criticisms and recommendations and more importantly his tendency to altogether ignore or to treat in a cursory fashion certain very crucial matters pertaining to the black higher education crisis let me begin by amplifying this point as it specifically relates to the recruitment of black students if those of us who are involved in increasing the enrollment of black students on northern white campuses were committed to the view that we should only search for the socalled best black students professor hardings arguments would have an unshakable foundation and we would be forced to seriously reappraise our efforts although professor harding seems to confine his remarks to the elitist segment of the black student population i do not know of any massive recruitment campaign which is designed to enroll hundreds of black students each year that restricts itself in this manner on the contrary in response to or anticipation of black student demands northern colleges have developed a proliferation of programs to enroll high risk black students attempts to discourage such efforts would in the final analysis be catastrophic for the hundreds of thousands of denied black students who were until recently virtually ignored by institutions of higher learning they were the forgotten black students from impoverished backgroundsconcentrated in northern ghettoes they either did not meet the entrance requirements of nearby state colleges or did not have the financial resources to attend opendoor black colleges in the south in fact black students who lived in the south had a greater chance of entering colleges than those living in the north for instance we know that in approximately percent of the black high school graduates in the south enrolled in institutions of higher learning mostly black schools in the north however except in the state of california which has a large number of opendoor junior colleges the situation for black students was critical i would like to focus very briefly on the new england area for here the critical state of black higher education throughout the north is most forcefully exemplified in there were only blacks enrolled in the colleges and universities in new england including junior colleges or percent of the total student population because the few black students attending new england colleges at that time represented largely the managerial and professional segments of the black population one author was led to conclude that as far as the economically and socially depressed main body of american negroes is concerned it would not matter at all if new england colleges and universities closed their doors tomorrow black students demands have helped to produce steppedup recruitment efforts and although the figure is still pitifully low there were more black students enrolled in colleges in the state of massachusetts in than there were in all of new england in and the massachusetts figure is expected to dramatically increase over the next few years for example at the university of massachusetts we expect to have nearly a thousand black students by the fall of most of whom will come from the ghettoes of springfield and boston we are not recruiting students who would ordinarily go to black schools in the south but students who would have difficulty enrolling in any college in fact there are presently several high risk students on our campus who were rejected outright by black schools because they did not meet the conventional entrance requirements the emphasis on increasing the enrollment of black students is certainly not restricted to the state of massachusetts large state universities and colleges in the north are on expansive recruitment campaigns in the ghettoes some enrolling as many as black students a year these programs assist students in getting admitted to college provide financial support needed to attend college and furnish academic assistance needed to stay in college in the past denied black students were measured by the same academic criteria that were applied to other students no recognition was given to the crippling influence of ghetto schools by using such criteria these students were usually rated as academically marginal at best being marginal in these respects however may have nothing to do with their potential or intellect it merely indicates that they do not meet the conventional white middle class standards of admission it is incumbent upon black students and faculty in the north to continue to pressure their respective universities to abandon the system of recruiting only the best students which therefore ultimately leads them to search for students in the south i think it is ludicrous for black students from say northwestern university to go all the way to atlanta georgia searching for black students when there are thousands of black students in the ghettoes of nearby chicago just itching for a chance to enroll in college as northern universities continue to recruit the forgotten black students of the ghetto it is entirely conceivable that in the very near future and unless an equally concerted effort is made in the south an overwhelming majority of black students will be concentrated in these institutions and i would be hard pressed indeed to tell a black faculty member who was recruited expressly to satisfy the needs of these students that he should recognize his true obligation and teach in a black institution as the enrollment figures of northern black students continue to mount their needs cannot be denied however i do not feel that in order to satisfy the needs of increasing numbers of black students in the north black schools in the south should suffer it is for this reason that careful consideration should be given to professor hardings suggestions i shall discuss this matter shortly i was pleased to see professor harding at least acknowledged the fact that many faculty and administrators at predominantly negro colleges have been reluctant to grant that our experience as a people was worthy of serious academic exploration in the final analysis this obstacle has to be overcome if professor hardings suggestions are to be seriously entertained only a few black schools have the orientation which would permit immediate implementation of his proposal we cannot ignore the rigid resistance to change described by nathan hare gwendolyn midlo hall and others who have taught in traditionallyoriented negro colleges it is ironic that these schools provide a good deal of the opposition to the black university concept and the creation of afroamerican curricula it is additionally ironic that the administrators of predominantly negro schools have now been forced to recognize that they have indeed a valuable commodity in their black professor and although they are unable to compete with rich white schools for his services they may now find it necessary to at least give him the same rewards they have traditionally given to their white professor i recognize that professor harding did not address himself specifically to this issue but it comes up time and time again in a critical assessment of his proposed solutions to which i now turn considering our sadly limited resources professor harding states can there be more than a few really excellent programs of institutes of afroamerican studies no doubt may of the premature black studies programs will fail if for no other reasons than a lack of qualified personnel to staff them and a lack of commitment on the part of white administrators to keep them in operation this is a serious problem that demands a thoughtful and creative formula we may quickly dismiss therefore the rhetorical suggestion that it might make more sense to bring black students to a blackoriented professor in the south than to take him away from his campus as the institutions in the north continue to enroll thousands of black students it would be physically impossible considering the limited space and resources of southern black schools and financially unfeasible to ship all of them or even a majority of them to the south only a small percentage of the total number of black students in the north would be able to take advantage of this opportunity this would create a most unfortunate situation for those who are forced to remain moreover unless the receiving southern institutions are blackoriented we would be exposing the already uptight northern black students to the traditionallyoriented negro colleges which as i emphasized above have yet to acknowledge the legitimacy of black studies programs however professor hardings suggestion of visiting professorships for southern black teachers in northern institutions is a feasible temporary solution to this problem i emphasized the word temporary because i am convinced that even with such visiting professorships the demand for black professors far exceeds the available supply and the gap will rapidly widen it cannot be denied however that this suggestion would help to alleviate the pressure on white administrators and lessen their frantic search for permanent black professors as a stopgap solution then the visiting professorship idea should be immediately implemented an arrangement could be made with white institutions to hold a moratorium on the recruitment of permanent black faculty from the south in favor of visiting black professorships with the proviso that these institutions be permitted to hire as permanent faculty those black professors who personally initiate such an appointment i should think that if white administrators were assured of the participation of black faculty in this regard they would be willing to cooperate in this connection professor hardings recommendation that white institutions make long term substantial financial investments in the black institutions can be realistically entertained more specifically our historic experiences in this society should certainly make us aware that when men have to choose between protecting their own interests or preserving the interests of others they almost invariably decide in favor of themselves altruism regardless of how justified rarely plays a major role in important decisions black people in their interactions with whites have painfully found this proposition to be universally true accordingly in order to assure long term commitment white institutions have to be made to recognize that they have a vested interest in financially supporting various endeavors in black institutions for example in return for an agreement to financially support research programs in certain black institutions white institutions might receive the cooperation of black professors in accepting visiting professorships to staff their black the black university in peril before birth by ronald davis ear brother harding the questions and concerns that you raised although heavily weighted with ramifications for both our present and our future have for too long eluded our attention thanks to you they now command our attention i find myself wanting to say how right you areabout everything you said but your comments deserve more than that i feel that we not only have to explain the thinking or lack of it and action which led up to the present state of affairs but that we also have to offer something towards the resolution of our present difficulties and for the realization of our goalthe black university while i do not wish to belabour or lengthen unnecessarily the points i wish to make in this response i can see no way of adequately explaining what has occurred outside of recalling somewhat in detail the rather complex formation of events which preceded the present situation i do hope that you will bear with me near the end of august i was visited by brother bill moore a representative from the monterey peninsula black community which is situated near the santa cruz campus of the university of california bro moore had come to inform me that the community he represented was presently engaged in a struggle to get the university of california which is committed to erecting some twenty colleges on the santa cruz campus to devote the seventh college erected to the teaching of the black experience more specifically they wished the college to be named the college of malcolm_x and be designed to reflect the heritage of the afroamerican people its instructors to be of the black experience degrees up to and including the phd to be awarded in afroamerican studies and a forum room open to the people to be built in the college as a center for the expression of the finest minds and talents of the people of color i was further informed by bro moore that the drive to obtain public support for the proposed college was already underway and that he was presently seeking the support of all bay area student groups my response to the brother had been conditioned by several months of rather intensive thought and action on this and other like subjects much of this is also worth recalling for five years prior to the summer of bro moores visit i had been active in bay area black student circles first at san francisco city college and later at the university of california at berkeley just as it should have been we had protested everything at one time or another oppressive campus rules and regulations meager black faculty discrimination in athletics american involvement in south african apartheid and in rhodesia the vietnam war the draft discrimination in admissions policy and the resulting small number of black students all earned our contempt and verbal condemnation there can be no doubt that all these were outrages before which we had to cry out but once we had cried out we returned to feeling vain and empty we felt there had to be more that we could do but were yet uncertain common landmarks and mutual outcries would soon bring us to the same neck of the woods but at that time we were still trying to define ourselves trying to delimit the scope magnitude and horror of our circumstances and things continued to crumble around usmaking our path difficult to trod the civil_rights movement folded malcolm was murdered and the first long hot summer began to whisk away the people we wanted to save then in sncc was reborn black and many of us found new hope this development was followed by a noticeable concern about reaction and some of us began to see what the other thing was that had to be done creative action began to take the place of reaction two merritt college students bobby seale and huey newton left their campus and organized the black_panther party the black students at san francisco state went into the black community to organize and recruit they had already begun to develop black curriculum a handful of black students from the university of california went into east oakland to work for mark comfort a black radical who was then running for the state assembly we were all acting on the notion that protest alone would not suffice it was clear to us that if we were to survive we would have to come forth with meaningful programs of action we next entered a period in which there was much talk about and general recognition ofwhat the ultimate solution would be but there were and still are many thousands thet we had to reach train and prepare for this inevitability thus the need for black studies loomed large and clear and almost simultaneously we responded to it i should add that at this point early our efforts to develop black studies by and large had not yet gained notoriety or been widely publicized we were still thinking talking writing and organizing however one thing was clear to all concerned if education was to play any part in our survivalit would have to undergo a radical qualitative change we also realized that we would have to take it to some people while enabling others to come and get it thus in nearly every set of demands for black studies there is language which deals with community participation and admissions policies but there were and still are problems that remained unresolved and this gets us almost back to bro moore in june of the black students at the university of california having conceptually developed a program of black studies the previous spring began to cast around for someone to headup the program this effort greatly expanded our awareness of what was going on around the country to begin with we had made a selfdefeating concession to our masters at the university reluctantly we had agreed to try to find someone who by understanding and commitment would be palatable to us and by credentials would be acceptable to the white university this of course is a near irresolvable contradictiona contradiction about which our worse fears and suspicion would later be confirmed but naively and foolishly we tried and in the process an even greater contradiction the real rub came to light again and again everybody and anybody who had even the slightest commitment to what we had in mind was either already committed to some place school or had too many offers to consider another one when this was not the case the person sought was usually grappling with what has emerged as the central issue that we face today ie will we be able to develop one worthwhile black university if we all persist in our efforts to develop little ones all over the country i specifically recall one scholars lament that he had worked for the last several years with the hope of completing his degree and meeting with other scholars at some point of conversion to develop a black university he was now being torn apart by offers many of which were so lucrative that he was greatly distressed by having to reject them but most of all he was distressed by a development which he felt would surely result in the dissolution of his dream of a black university the wholesale development of black studies programs throughout the north it now appears that he was even more right than he thought anyway as we continued in our search for someone to head up black studies at berkeley and found more and more people unavailable became clearer that black students throughout the north were mustering for a stampede in the direction of black studies indeed as i look back it appears that nothing could have stopped this the black student revolts that occurred on the northern white campuses in late and were in the breach long before martin_luther_king jr was murdered in april this is borne out by the unavailability of anyone who could relate to the action of black studies both before and after dr_king was murdered the stampede did not surprise us we knew it was coming we were just in no frame of mind to stop it the events of the time may or may not have contributed to our inability to arrest our energies and change directions but i am rather certain that no single event caused our behavior the overall causes are certainly of a more ancien sic character the basic problem of course was that this was no way to build a black university which was something most of us agreed should be done clearly we were being divided and scattered in as many directions as there are white northern colleges and universities but we made no concerted move to check it instead we all attempted to comer as much of the terribly limited black talent as we could and to outstrip one another in the development of black studies not everyone however was oblivious to what was happening a few people agreed that the most ideal setting for the black university would be some southern negro college with a surrounding metropolitan black community and a rural black community within reach those who favored this model imagined that such a community might indeed become the nucleus from which a black nation could spring i should add that the proponents of this notion were notare not unaware of the various ideological challenges to this concept not the least of these is the bakunian argument that there should be no building of any kind until the present system of oppression is destroyed to which proponents of nationbuilding respond that it is unlikely that this can be done without some base of support which is controlled by the protagonists this is of course a major question for those of us who favor the creation of a black university and ought to be decided as soon as possible but let me go on there have always been persons among us who have argued that no black program of any kind should be placed in white schools the people who make this argument generally believe that we should be setting up schools in the black community and there are really few people who do not agree that this should be done the problem here is that there are obstacles involved which many of us feel we are not presently geared to handle foremost among these is the aggressive recruiting activities being conducted among our people by major colleges and universities all over the west coast whereas we could match the aggression which is still minimal we are in no position to match the lucrative aid and assistance packages that they are handing out and until we have done a sufficient amount of ground work we will not be able to compete with the name and prestige of these institutions no matter how unearned and unjustified these names and their prestige are and this is not a fact to be scoffed at indeed recent efforts to force these same colleges and universities to deal with our needs have been seriously hampered by the lack of participation by many students who refused to get involved because they were afraid that their money would be cut off or that they would lose the opportunity of attending big name schools that they had always aspired to attend we dont like this but the average brother is still more entranced by the notion of attending cal than he is about attending any school that we could get together in the community this is a problem to which i see no solution until we have begun to be more realistic in our assessment of it at berkeley we finally decided that the only way we could even hope to deal with this trend and perhaps reverse the attraction syndrome of which so many students are victims would be to set up some kind of black program that would act as a kind of catch mechanism this is to say that we had no intention at this point of actually institutionalizing any black studies program in a white school instead we hoped simply to have enough of a program to catch the minds and energies of those students who would surely come to berkeley and direct them to where they were really neededthe black community we had no illusion that just getting black students into the black community was going to solve allor anyof the problems there on the contrary we had actually experienced the fallacy of this notion we had always encouraged students to go to the community and to offer service anytime we managed to get a few of them to actually do this invariably the same problem would arise they had no skills or experience that qualified them to deal with the problems they found there they were no different from the white social worker all they did was remind the people that they had problems but in most cases they could offer no solutions they could render no positive service and this turned the people off so we were aware that we not only had to catch people and direct them to the communitywe were also aware that we had to give them something to take there this was our thinking about the catch action and black studies at the time most important of all perhaps was that feature of our thinking on black studies which opposed its institutionalization it was our belief that if such a program was institutionalized it would at the same time be deradicalized and reduced to a purely academic experience and we could see no good coming from an isolated sterile dissection of the black experience we refused to consider any program that would not have arms for action beyond this our concerns centered around what happens to people who get caughtup in institutions we imagined that it would be very easy for concern and enthusiasm to be replaced by indifference and complacency we saw this as a real threat and made all kinds of arguments against it we argued for instance that instructors working in the program should not be tenured this to us was very important because we saw it killing two birds with one stone first of all a number of opportunists who valued the security and prestige of tenure would be discouraged from getting involved from the outset and second we would be able to purge the program from time to time of those influences which proved negative we had not wanted to develop a program with any aspects of permanence we wanted a program that we could pick up at any time intact and sit it down anywhere that we wished and we were sure that we would have to do just that if the program effectively did what we wanted it to do i have bothered to call the occasion of bro moores visit and some of the thinking that preceded it from memory because it sheds a great deal of light on what we were thinking and what was happening on the eve of the great stampede we can see by this rather vividly how sometimes when we begin to move we abort the ideals of our initial intent so how did we respond at that time to the proposed college of malcolm_x watch naturally because of our commitment to the creation of a major black university in the south and our belief that most northern programs should be of the catch type we were predisposed to believing that the proposed college of malcolm_x was a bad idea objections were both primary and secondary the latter centered around what appeared to some of us to be an insidious even if unconscious attempt to legitimize malcolm_x our concern about this was based on an unusual amount of emphasisboth in bro moores verbal explanation of the proposed college and in the literature written for its promotionon the conclusions reached by bro malcolm after his trip to mecca while we did not wish in any way to challenge those conclusions we still found the amount of attention given them disconcerting it was as if the entire bitter experience of malcolms life had been subordinated in importance to the assertion that no one who knew him before and after his trip to mecca could doubt that he had completely abandoned racism separatism and hatred such as this never fails to strike me as being weird and specious i mean it is as if the problem of racism and hatred in america is primarily one of black racism and hatred and we therefore ought to rejoice when a black man abandons racism and hatred kind of reminds you of the common fallacy regarding violence in this country if we black folks werent violent everything would be ok it also occurred to us that any institutionalizing of malcolms name based on such a premise could only serve to reduce the impact of the revolutionary meaning and significance of his life further still our reservations were enhanced by the subtle but unmistakable connection which was being drawn between this proposed undertaking and the philosophy of nonviolence wouldbe patrons were being asked to sign a statement of support which began i wish to show proof in the form of positive action that i support nonviolent projects that will give evidence to the black community that we are interested in them and are willing to accept their ideas on what is best for them it is possible that our comprehension of this statement was awry but it appeared to us to clearly imply that the proposed college was expectedeither through its realization or its functionto contribute to the perpetuation of nonviolence our suspicion of this was greatly increased by bro moores verbal assertion that he believed the college would show goodwill on the part of whites thats fine we thought if others wished to believe this but we remained convinced that any effort to further nonviolence or to show goodwill by exploiting the name of malcolm_x who again and again cautioned us against trickery and taught that nonviolence was suicidal was both insulting and misleading i should like to make it clear that i am not attempting to take on the philosophy of nonviolence here that indeed is the subject of another argument as i stated we had other reservations of a more primary nature to understand these it is necessary not to forget our stated commitment to the creation of a black university in our opinion this was a commitment before which all other considerations having to do with the higher education of blacks should yield in light of this the proposed college of malcolm_x it was thought would affect prematurely the develop institute of the black world basic assumptions the institute of the black world approaches the controversial and highly significant issue of black studies in america with five basic assumptions they affect the character of all that we do and all that we plan to do in the arena of black studies these are the assumptions that black studies is really a field still being bomin spite of all the discussion which seems to take for granted the existence of an agreed upon body of thought this is not to deny the existency of significant and often unappreciated work related to black studies which has already been done but it does deny the fact that there is any clear understanding of the specific ways in which a profound mining of the black experience challenges and transforms the basic educational structures of the nation that the establishing and the defining of the field of black studies stand logically as a task and a challenge for black people in america and elsewhere others may be called upon for assistance but the initiative must be ours that the institute and its sister institutions of the martin_luther_king jr center and the atlanta university complex are in an excellent position to play a central role in defining the field and creating some of the models so urgently required in this task of course we must find ways of combining the thought and activities of those black persons throughout the nation who are working at the black studies task often in scattered and isolated situations that a unified rather than a conventionally understood academic disciplinebound approach to the creation of black studies is not only desirable but absolutely necessary indeed this unified approach is central to the demands of most thoughtful black student and faculty groups across the country that a serious building of this field is the task of years and not a makeshift program for a few persons to do in several weeks or months institute of the black world basic program elements against this background of assumptions the planning staff of the institute of the black world has been working towards tentative models for more than a year benefiting of course from the older hopes and dreams of such predecessors in black studies as w e b du bois charles s johnson ralph bunche and alain locketo mention only a few already it has become apparent to us that several elements must be a part of any creative wellstructured approach to black studies we have understandably sought to include them in our own planning among these elements are serious research in many areas of historical and contemporary black existence which have either been ignored or only superficially explored iethe black church and its theology comparative black urban development in the new world comparative slavery the encouragement of those creative artists who are searching for the meaning of a black aesthetic who are now trying to define and build the basic ground out of which black creativity may flow in the arts encounter among these artists on the one hand and scholars activists and students on the other must be constant in both formal and informal settings continuous research on those contemporary political economic and social policies which now shape the life of the black community in america and which determine its future it is clearly necessary to develop a think tank operation which will bring together the many varieties of black approaches to struggle and existence in america this must be done of course in a nonpolemical unpublicized black setting constant experimentation with the meaning of black studies for the surrounding black community and openness to the possible input from that community into the creation of black studies the twowayness of the experience is essential and must be encouraged the development of new materials forand new approaches tothe teaching of the black experience which must grow out of laboratory situations at every grade level the training of a constantly expanded cadre of persons deeply immersed in the materials methods and spirit of black studies who can help supply the tremendous demands for personnel in a variety of formal and informal teaching environments the creation of consortium models which will make possible the constant interaction of black students and faculty on northem and southern campuses around certain selected foci of black studies this must also expand to the encouragement and development of contacts among black students scholars political leaders and artists from various parts of the world for it is clear that black studies cannot really be developed unless we understand more fully both the unique and the common elements of our experiences in the black diaspora the gathering and consolidation of those library and archival resources which will facilitate the development of black studies as it proceeds towards definition the establishment of a publishing enterprise which will not only make available the results of the experimentation and study of the institute but which will also encourage that increasing number of authors and researchers who wish to present their work from the heart of a black matrix the gathering cataloging and critical analysis of those black studies programs and personnel which have already developed across the nation so that we may begin to gain a fuller sense of direction possibilities and problems this process began with a summerlong seminar in june and will continue with monthly seminars of black studies directors and several larger working conferencesat least through the summer of the institute of the black world sees all of these elements as crucial to the development of creative models for the kinds of black studies programs which will not be palliatives but significant pathways to the redefinition of american education and of the black experience these are therefore the elements which have guided us so far in the establishment of our own institute the communiversity by the staff students and parents a national conference for black teachers was held in chicago in april educators came from all sections of the country and from all levels of educational involvement from wayside rural classrooms to widely acclaimed and distinguished colleges and universities the primary concern of those assembled was to become united around the causes and effects of crises in education and to recognize that the solutions to these problems could and would only come from black educators who recommit and rededicate their lives to these ends a basic structure was put together specific tasks were delegated and the word went forth that the newlyorganized a a a e association of afroamerican educators would begin to deal with and search for all means to educate in the black community qualitatively in atlanta georgia the following year august the guiding principles were clarified to express that in order for a real and lasting educative process to have support and acceptance legitimacy it must have as its base the total involvement and total dictates of each local area or community in order to achieve total involvement with the entire black community participating the madison avenue style of executive management and hierarchal omnipotence had to be ruptured this style of management was the cause of the initiation of the conference the black communiversity evolved from a monthlong concentration on the historical evolution and development of the black manfromafrica through our present situation in america during the month of february in chicago black liberation north many groups and individuals worked in unison to bring culturallyexpressive programs to all segments of the black community the project was a success from out of this endeavor a black congress was formed and from out of this congress a black communiversity came into being classes were scheduled teachers volunteered and black students enrolled at this time over students were involved in the curriculum the question now is that a strong demand has come forth to attempt to broaden the scope of the services that the communiversity offers and to develop a structure that will envision and encompass the totality of the black community thereby unifying all partsas only an educative process can all educationoriented organizations or groups are being called upon to assist in the structuring of a more comprehensive educational system toward this end a weekend conference has been planned for july and in chicago the location will be announced later is our intention to review briefly some alternatives to the v present systems of education that have been setup for us by suggesting a separate and independent system of education for colonized blacks in america i white people have institutions while black people have institutionalized leaders this paper could have been called an alternative to black charismatic i leaders you can kill a black charismatic leader but how do you destroy the white institutions which produce black charismatic leaders an alternative is to build our own institutions institutions are created to perpetuate the system that sets them up therefore if a racist system creates institutions the institutions must reflect racism understanding this one concept makes it very clear that all schools attended by black people are doing exactly what they are supposed to doperpetuate the idea of white superiority and black inferiority even when some blacks are led to believe they have reached europeanization they are rejected because rejection devices for all nonwhites are built into the institutions two of the most important things about institutions are they are selfperpetuating and they never produce an alternative for outsiders today black schools are structured so as to be both reactionary and repressiveto both black teachers and black students our new school system must serve as the instrument for black resistance to white dominance and as this immovable force propel black people toward selfunderstanding and clear directions of goals our new schools must provide us with alternative solutions for arriving at our newly deflned and newlyaccepted goalsfor our students and our teachers are our future it is within our new system of education that our children may receive the assistance and acquire the stability to forge our new lifestyles this system must enable them to recognize respect resurrect and create new and positive images for from out of this will come the rhythmic dynamic and futureoriented base for total and lasting access to power this new system will become established as the fundamental cornerstone upon which all other institutions will be solidly built these new institutions will become our first line of collective defense against white cultural oppression other educational institutions have withdrawn even their semblance of support for black people and we are left to build our own this is a challenge but not an impossible dream when one considers the timeliness of this necessity and when one operates within the confines of a properlychanged frame of reference the basics are already present to begin to build the last two decisive social groups yet intact and caught up together our students and our teachers two strangers in a world unknown and to be explored will create this new system of educationwith and not for the black community therefore we suggest an independent educational systemtotally accountable to the black community and financed supported and controlled by black people the purpose of an alternative system to help black people students parents professionals etc understand what is being done to them and at the same time reveal to them the drama of everyday local national and international events to help black people understand the relationship of the black colony in america to the white metropolitan society in america by studying euroamerican colonialism to help the black professional who is confused and now stands helplessly by as the white colonial worldandthe black resistance movement prepares to destroy him to help black students who are presently struggling without a proper frame of reference to help black parents and their children who shoulder the total weight of victimization and exploitation to help black community organizations which have attempted to stand and serve as a bulwark or retaining wall between the white oppressor and the black oppressed to also help community organizations understand all methods of mobilization to cope with the fundamentals of true and victorious resistance to acquire all of the basics for communal survival and to become fully acquainted with a definitive difference between organization and movement steps to an alternative system of education i local community leaders a identification and communication with local leaders identify communicate and meet with organizational leaders or their representatives at an appointed time and place the purpose of the meeting should center around the possibilities of total community alliance or at least total community cooperativeness and legitimization strengthened by the membership of each individual group all concerned should aim for a unified tactical goal independent system of education which in this case will be the search for an answer to the problem of urban innercity education the head of each organization or his representative should submit an oral synopsis of his organizations activities goals accomplishments and strategies an overview of views and concepts about an alternative system of education should be made with sanction and a cooperative acceptance from as many groups as possible and necessary plans should be made for a citywide conference ii student groups the same or similar procedures as suggested for community organizations should be used contact existing black student organizations in a high schools b universities c other educational institutions iii parents the same procedure should be followed with parents only parents should be organized within a given school district or specific school all however should be invited to attend and participate individually until organized or from any private or parochial parentchild school involvement iv teachers and other professionals teachers should be organized by school districts at the elementary high school or college levelpublic private or parochial other professionals should be organized according to the dictates of their particular field of endeavor and according to how their expertise can best be meshed with the total program malcolm s a community college with a new perspective by charles g hurst jr he deplorable state of public education in the united states t f leads to the conclusion that the future is bleak and unpromis ing for millions of black americans who are being tolda f constantly that education is a ticket to freedom to coin a term familiar to all in the black community education in the united states from kindergarten through college is in a mess from the standpoint of a community that is witness to the many failures of education to do what it claims as its jobnamely educatean insidious hypocrisy is being perpetrated compounded by a callous white public that does not seem to care moreover the black community is becoming painfully aware of the high level of undesirable waste occurring as more and more students emerge illfitted to serve themselves or society the results may be seen through serious erosions in community confidence and a reluctance of the community to participate in educational programs that demean without teaching recently released statistics by the chicago board of education showing that attempts to teach reading are exercises in futility even at the eleventh grade level are carbon copies of those released sporadically by boards of education in all parts of the united states these statistics document the absolute inability of public school systems and programs as presently constituted to meet the urgent needs of a large majority of black children and youth and for that matter the needs of the poor generally black or white the overall verbal level for eleventh grade students in chicago is percentile points below the national norm the reading level for vast numbers of black students in high schools such as crane high school in chicago is points below the average and only slightly better than the zero levelor complete illiteracyat the eleventh and twelfth grades strangely and tragically attempts to pinpoint responsibility for the failures of public schools expose one of the most sophisticated systems of buckpassing in existence the end result is to place the blame on the student or more insidiously to recreate the myth of black inferiority such practices are not only unfair but also destructive as well simply as a matter of selfpreservation this country can no longer afford to permit the managers of education to miseducate or not to educate at all and to escape the consequences of their failures hopefully it is not too late for education to put its own house in order but for this to happen education must be willing to take a new view toward itself the students the community the curriculum and teaching practices to begin with we in education can no longer hold ourselves above reproach for the failures we produce we must be willing to readily admit that our record in urban education is a sad one with little if anything to recommend it or us further we have lived too long on the records of the past and upon the achievement of a few who make it in spite of us not because of us finally we must face squarely the fact that many students get absolutely nothing out of their school experience even many who graduate are unable to read or write at a literate level we are obviously in an educational crisisa crisis more subtle than a hunger crisis or military crisis but a crisis nonetheless the dangerous potentialities of the educational crisis are demonstrated through the antisocial behavior of many of educations rejects and the fatal consequences ensuing from their attempts to survive in a world where the odds are stacked against them anyone seriously interested in analyzing the etiology of the crisis must be well aware of the causes and of what we must do since our country has undergone almost unbelievably swift revolutions in science and technology economic and political affairs and demographic and social structures but despite revolutionary advances that have made travel to the moon a routine miracle education in the united states has adapted to space age demands with lethargic reluctance five specific problems appear to be paramount the demands of a space age and computer paced society for the certifications provided by education the sharp increase in the number of people seeking an education especially black people the unwillingness of the society to meet the costs of mass education the inherent inertia of the educational system the inertia of the society itself and the racism that is so deeply embedded in every aspect of american life to meet challenges to the nation of current crises in domestic as well as foreign affairs education will needmore than moneyideas courage determination and a new will for selfappraisal reinforced by a will for creatively conceived change as matters now stand education has not shown either the ability or the willingness for searching selfcriticism neither has it been able to seize opportunities for innovations that will help teachers achieve more in classrooms filled with distractions and angry students it has failed to infuse the needed knowledge and methods required to meet the current crisis while exhorting everyone to change education has remained stubbornly resistant to innovation and new ideas in a larger sense the crisis of education is the crisis of the greater society and thus it is the urgent concern of all citizens committed to the perservation of our present way of life i firmly believe that the crisis of education in the black community can be overcome a critical selfanalysis is a beginning a reeducation and sensitizing of teachers is a second step a relevance and upgrading of curriculum is a third an effort to truly involve the community in school affairs is a fourth application of some new theories of teaching and learning as suggested by repeated research findings is a fifth and a new responsiveness to conditions and to the people education purports to serve is the last i list here but far from the last in possibilities if education is to provide the answers we need so urgently rather than faulting its critics who are engaged in an exercise of love and faith the managers of education would do better to take stock of educations obvious weaknesses and move to do something about them continuation of programs and techniques that do not work is wrong and a breach of public trust the black people of america deserve the best that education can produce not the worst essentially therefore it is to the thousands of black youths and disenchanted adult poor to which a community college in an urban ghetto must address itself the following statement of philosophy representing the raison detre of malcolm_x college should make it abundantly clear how this can be done limits of space will not permit a full discussion of proposals for each educational level thus the present paper must be limited to a delineation of a relatively new kind of institution the community college that is serving as a reclamation center for the human problems created by callously inefficient public schools yet many of the principles and philosophies are basic to contemporary education at any level malcolm_x college is a concept of the future whose past is rooted in the enslavement of black people so pervasive is the heritage of slavery in this society that we must constantly struggle to keep from unconsciously allowing to develop at this institution situations which serve to enslave and to exploit rather than to develop and actualize human potential the processes by which ideal slaves are made have been described as follows step establish and maintain strict discipline step implant in the bondsmen themselves a consciousness of personal inferiority step awe them with a sense of their masters enormous power step persuade the bondsmen to take an interest in their masters enterprise and to accept his standards of good conduct step impress them with their helplessness to create in them a habit of perfect dependence upon their masters clearly if we do not wish to perpetuate the systematic psychological and social enslavement of black people we must develop articulate and practice counter mechanisms which will serve to liberate ourselves and our students such mechanisms as the following have been instituted at malcolm_x college step discipline follows from a precise understanding of what must be done and why it generates from within the individual and the group and is enforced by each individual in the group step a deliberate effort is made to develop a capacity to master whatever one aspires to learn to succeed in whatever one aspires to do step those in positions of authority endeavor to empower their colleagues and subordinates teaching them how to use power for the good of all step the enterprise is viewed as belonging to the people specifically to those people in the community who voluntarily express an interest in itand hence the standards norms and values permeate from the base to the apex in terms of the kind of institution desired by the students and the community step people are helped to help themselvesto learn from failures rather than seek to avoid them to be honored more for having tried than for having succeeded the educational model to which we subscribe is built upon a different assumption about the nature of potential human ability than is typical of most educational institutions while we recognize variation we know that the ability potential of the average black american is well beyond the normal demand level of the most rigorous academic programs and hence we justify a maximum social effort to develop the abilities of all people concomitantly any failure to achieve high levels of performance constitutes a group social failure rather than an individuals failure we propose to educate our students for three goals freedom individuality and service freedom in a very general sense refers to a freedom from external constraint malcolm_x college is characterized by free access to the resources of the institution the city the world the role of staff and student body is to remove the obstacles which block the path of those seeking the more specific freedom defined as the capability to deal creatively and effectively with ones situation we take the position that in order to achieve positive freedom students must be encouraged to actively and consciously attempt to utilize their personal resources their life style and their experiential background in the classroom the student must become skilled at identifying needs problems and issues which affect the nature and quality of life in his environment and then use them in his research hopefully he will learn to relate his learning to the problems of his community with a view toward ultimately finding solutions to the communitys problems as well as his own individuality cannot genuinely exist without the freedom described above the thrust of this perspective is to resist any simple accounts of what a person really is or intends to become and allows for distinction between ones real self and ones apparent self the real self is in our judgment dynamic and expanding and defies prima facie or merely quantitative assessment individuality presupposes a social context and yet underscores the uniqueness of each person in that context our notion of individuality is characterized by builtin capacities not necessarily apparent for good which are inseparable from the good of the community and ultimately of all mankind service involves being a contributing member of society by bringing ones unique resources to bear upon human problems particularly the problems confronting the black community as with the others this concept recognizes that the truly educated man is also a learned man but more than that he is one in whom learning is combined with an understanding of social injustice and a commitment to correcting it at malcolm_x college we reject the educational process which places didactic instruction at the core and we propose that the time has come for us to control our zeal for imparting knowledge and skills and to concentrate our efforts on developing the individual student by education for individual development i mean a program consciously undertaken to promote such qualities as flexibility creativity openness to new experiences responsibility accountability and commitment education no longer can be a pouring into it must be a means of providing the climate and conditions in which the greatest possible development of potential can take place further we reject organizational structures which tend to be paternalistic administrators and faculty know best students know least we propose organizational structures in which power is shared and the participation of all is guaranteed finally we must emphasize that malcolm_x college is a black institutionone in which the educational services are designed to serve in a unique way the goals of black people as the community becomes more clear about the kind of society it is trying to build we will design our educational programs to promote the black agenda there is emerging a degree of concensus among black people that our educational system has to prepare our young people to play dynamic and constructive parts in the development of a society in which all members share fairly in the good or bad fortune of the group and in which progress is measured in terms of human wellbeing not prestige buildings cars or other material things whether privately or publicly owned in essence we believe that our kind of college with a black oriented curriculum and philosophy is in a unique position to deal both with the ills of our society and with the human consequences of its derelictions as an integral part of the community itself the institution can and must be creatively and flexibly responsive to the communitys needs as well as to those of the individual inhabitants where necessary the college must serve as a catalytic agent to synthesize the varied components of the community into a viable force for liberation never losing sight of the individual the contemporary educational institution must be concerned at all times with massive changes of social and economic conditions which may enhance the communitys potential for successful selfdetermination creative response to educational needs becomes in consequence only one even if the most important of the educational institutions responsibilities leadership where there is a void and unlimited supportive assistance where there is a need represent the basic tenets of a practical philosophy of commitment that views liberation of any oppressed people as the specific charge for all democratic institutions if education can not participate enthusiastically in achieving this aim it does not deserve to exist finally if education does not begin to educate for the kind of humaness implicit in some of the aforegoing paragraphs education will cease to exist a victim of its own inertia by chuck hopkins n october in durham north carolina the black community saw its dream of a relevant black educational institution become a reality with the opening of malcolm_x liberation university in an old warehouse which had been cleaned out and renovated on the th of october over black people from durham and communities around the country gathered in front of the building site to listen to the dedication message of sister betty shabazz widow of brother malcolm_x sister betty charged the participants in the ceremonies and black people around the world with the task of organizing for black unity and building for the black nation with the opening of the university have come several questions concerning the need for such a venture on the part of black people why malcolm_x liberation university why durham north carolina why in in order for us to answer these questions we must understand somewhat the political struggles of black people in durham as well as in other communities around the country in the spring of a concentrated effort was started in durham to organize black people to bring about better living conditions the effort had two basic objectives the involvement of black people in the decisionmaking apparatus of the local oeo office of economic opportunity poverty agency the creation of neighborhood organizations to press for improvement in such areas as the lack of traffic stop signs playground equipment street lights etc in the black community initial organizing efforts proved quite successful neighborhood councils were formed the community action agency granted representation to these groups for a while it seemed as if the democratic process might actually work for black people but the optimism was shortlived for black people ran into a brick wall when they pressed for more substantial changes such as housing repairs street paving and public housing reforms when black people met continuous opposition in their efforts to bring about change the tone of the movement became more and more militant the next two years saw important changes in the thinking of the community people the neighborhood groups pressed for autonomy from the oeo poverty agency tactics for change accelerated rapidly petitions changed to pickets picketing evolved into mass marches mass meetings gave way to protests characterized by violent confrontationsall this in two years the militancy of the community drew the attention of black students at duke university and north carolina central university in addition links between the community and students were formed during a summer intern program in in which black college students from throughout north carolina lived and organized in the neighborhoods this involvement created a new atmosphere of co operation between black college students and neighborhood people during this time black students at duke university underwent some important ideological changes they began to work more in the community and with the black nonacademic employees on campus the students began to think and talk in terms of the critical question of the relevance of the entire educational process to the needs of the black community they concluded that the process as it exists is in fact irrelevant events on campus at this time began to move in rapid succession there were a series of protests and confrontations which culminated in the students seizing the administration building and demanding that a black studies program be established and controlled by black people throughout these confrontations and protests the students found that they had the strong immediate and active support of the organized neighborhood groups it was all of these ingredients and of course the subsequent refusal of duke university to speak to the question of relevant black education which led the students and the community people to take a second look at their efforts a simple truth was realized throughout the movement that those who are oppressed cannot look to those who oppress them to deal in any way with the nature or source of the oppression if black people in durham north carolina wanted a relevant educational institution they would have to build it themselves it was decided that the next logical step was the development of malcolm_x liberation university ideas for the universitys development were obtained in a series of meetings with students faculty and black people from communities throughout north carolina these meetings ended in the late spring of at this point an outline of the university had been developed which served as the base for its continued development during the summer months of a task force of former students headed by brother howard fuller worked with the community people in durham and other black people around the country in order for the university to open in the fall so we can see that the answers to the above questions can be simplified thusly malcolm_x liberation university opened on october in durham because it was an idea whose time had come it had come because of a logical progression of events which had occurred both in the black community and on the campus of duke university the overriding purpose of the university is to provide a framework within which education can become relevant to the needs of black people training at the university therefore is geared toward the analysis of the american system and of all other institutions of colonizing societies which serve the process of black dehumanization beyond this however the university represents an attempt to develop a functional black ideology which will serve as a guideline for black people and will further define and develop a program to build selfreliance it is the feeling of those at the university that if we are in fact serious about black liberation then we must be speaking ultimately of black independence and if we are speaking of black independence then we are speaking basically about these things the control by black people of our goods and services the control by black people of our consciousness the control by black people of the mechanisms of force and violence malcolm_x liberation university then is essentially concerned with the building of black selfreliance in order to help bring about black independence the curriculum of the university is broken into two sections running for approximately to months each the first section broadly defined as the ideological and cultural part includes five basic topics plus physical development and language classes the five topic areas are independent african civilization slavery colonialism neocolonialism independent african world each of the areas is designed to provide the student with a knowledge of the historical social economic and political framework of black existence both in this hemisphere and on the continent the second section of the curriculum is set up to give intensive training in some of the basic skills needed to build selfreliance for black people these skilled areas are food scientists architects medics engineers black expressionists teachers communications technicians there are also community seminars which are offered weekly by students or instructors at the university the student body at malcolm_x liberation university is made up of regular day students and approximately who attend the night seminars these students represent a wide range of geographical areas from massachusetts down the east coast and into mississippi there is also a wide range in their educational backgrounds most of them have had some experience working in the black community organizing neighborhood problem groups or organizing youth groups students with rural backgrounds have worked in such enterprises as coops and simple farming many of the students backgrounds show that they dropped out or were asked to leave their former schools and colleges for political activism because of these varying backgrounds innovative teaching and learning methods are of a necessity at the university the malcolm_x liberation university experience is a young one still there have been and there are still some difficult hurdles to overcome but those who are attending and working with the university are very serious about black liberation this seriousness is reflected in a statement which was made public prior to the official opening by howard fuller the main organizer and present head of the university we view malcolm_x liberation university as an integral part of the black community therefore we will be involved in any activities affecting the community there will be neither guns nor drugs of any kind in the building therefore if this building is invaded by socalled law officers of a federal state or local variety on the pretext of looking for guns and dope it will be just thata pretext we will be about educating black people this building will serve as a base for that education we will not take any invasion of it lightly we will consider any invasion as an act of aggression against our people and we will respond accordingly thus far no response has been necessary but the concept which the above statement embodies is always kept in the minds of the university participants this concept is that in order to build institutions to bring about a better future for black people we must be constantly aware of the present day forces which seek to blunt such efforts we think that malcolm_x liberation university will not be stopped but we recognize the need for the spiritual as well as the physical support of black people wherever we may be center for black education by the center staff th the rape and penetration of the african continent by the europeans resulting in the destruction of african independence the ability of african people to determine establish and control an education that functioned in their behalf was destroyed a dependent relationship between african people and european people has since then been maintained in three areas they control our minds and instill white consciousness they control the ability to provide goods and services agriculture health industry etc they control the mechanisms of force and violence from the local cops to nato one of the results of this dependency has been the growth of the assumption that the only valid and legitimate standards of wellbeing are those of white supremacy white power and white nationalism white consciousness is always equated as human consciousness education is the primary instrument used to instill i consciousness the educational i process that we are forced to un i dergo demands a commitment to white standards and values it insists that we become white of mind if not white of skin and that our commitment be to the assumptions practices and priorities of white supremacy and white nationalism this assumption is usually ex pressed in such phrases as the struggle for equality other examples include equal employment equal housing equal pay equal toilets etc this of course avoids the question of equal to what this catechism of equality only addresses itself to the everchanging specific manifestations of our oppression it avoids the question of independence maintaining that america is my homecontrary to all historical evidence the question for us is whether to be equal or to be free to be dependent or to be independent to be integrated or to be liberated the history of the equal rights mode of struggle shows that this mode of struggle has only resulted in the maintenance of domination and the continuance of dependency as justice roger b taney of the u s supreme court said in the black man has no rights that a white man need respect we are an african people as a people our struggle is one for independence there are three stages in the struggle for independence selfreliance liberation independence selfreliance is the condition of relying on our resources as a people in order to accomplish any number of specific tasks and responsibilities that contribute to our liberation and independence this can mean for example the ability to develop our oil resources in nigeria our minds in a school in washington d c our bauxite in the caribbean our gold in south africa or our water resources in the sahara there are countless specifics in essence it means proceeding to utilize all of the skills that exist among our people selfreliance concretely begins to break the dependence forced upon us by europeans for the last years it begins to consolidate the collective strength of our scattered nation and to focus this strength on the tasks of reclaiming our natural and human resources which will lead to our independence the hand and mind begin to function in a liberated and liberating manner independence is the ability to possess our minds and consciousness the ability of our people to produce the goods and services necessary for the wellbeing of our people and the ability to protect and defend what is ours we have said that the first step in our struggle for independence is to become selfreliant a critical area in this regard is education it is necessary that we begin to assume responsibility for our own education in order that we begin to determine what our interests are and what responsibilities we have to collectively assume we cannot realistically expect the institutions and programs committed to white power to meaningfully commit themselves to the interests and priorities of african people we have the responsibility to begin to establish schools that function in the interests of african people such schools will outline a course of study that will develop the body the mind and scientific and technical skills that will be be used in the interest of african people each member of the school will be expected to fulfill a teaching responsibility within the larger african community establish and encourage standards and values that commit our people to the struggle for african independence in fact the educational process undergone in this school will intensify the neverending conflict of interest between european peoples and african peoples it is not our intention to prove with this school and others that will be established that we are able to provide the credentials necessary to function comfortably within the framework of white america itis not our intention to occupy students minds with passfail or phdistheroadtosuccess delusions we are not charting a route to mainstream america as j j jones has said harvard and other freak factories has ruint more good niggers than bad whiskey this is the task before us to teach the truth of our situation and what we must do a we are an african people our history has been that of an african people and our future will be that of an african people b african people are at war with european people and have been for the last years c the struggle of african people is for an african nation while it is important that a number of battles for selfreliance be waged in the americas by african people we should always politi cally see those battles in relation to the struggle for an independent african continent d we must use our human resources for the development of the physical resources of africa we must use our political resources to advance the independence of africa e in any society education has two functions to carry on the culture and traditions of that society and to provide the skills and training necessary for the development of that society our education must function in this way as an integral part of society in the interest of the total society as opposed to the interest of the individual as a people we are fragmented geographically eg we live in the u s brazil caribbean senegal gambia etc and we are fragmented in terms of our consciousness eg afroamerican afrotrench afrojewish afrogreek etc that is to say we define ourselves and our interests within european frameworks given this fragmentation we find ourselves in an indefensible position as a people at this point in our history we must forge our fragmented people into a strong nation as edward blyden said we need some african power some great center of the race where our physical pecuniary and intellectual strength may be collected we need some spot whence such an influence may go forth in behalf of the race we need to collect the scattered forces of the race and there is no rallying ground more favorable than africa an african nationality is our great need we should not content ourselves with living among other races simply by their permission or their endurance our school therefore begins to extricate our people from the american nation and focus them on the development of an african nation this requires a knowledge of the african past and a commitment to the african future the development of the scientific and technical skills that will be important to the capacity to deal meaningfully with the resources within the african world the development of language skills important in order to communicate within the african world and also in order to broaden the range of available information travel to the african continent in particular and more generally to the various parts of the african world that the educational process not be allowed to be contained within any single physical facility there is a teaching responsibility to be directed towards meeting the educational needs of the community a special concern is given to the ways and means of communicating varying kinds and amounts of information within the african community whether it be from northwest washington to southeast washington or from new york to nairobi or from texas to trinidad physical fitness and training be an important concern we must understand that strength in body is as important as strength in mind and that there is a relationship between the two let us finally repeat that the fundamental task before us is that of building a nation which will be responsive to the needs and interests of all african peoples we must begin now to integrate the vast body of skills that exist among african peoples into the work of nationbuilding we must put our total being into this task with total commitment to the establishment of independence for african people sketch in blub by e had just finished a bottle of white port and koolaid in a dark corner of a hallway and moved out onto the baseball field do it to me one time cody sped the ball toward me my palms

you cmon down heah if you wanna see me blue yelled back at the window the archer captivators were socalled because they usually met at the triangle formed with archer avenues diagonal cut through wentworth avenue the other base of the triangle was formed by a dirt road dearborn street at the dearborn base stood the archer building a huge dirty rusted structure that had stood at least three quarters of a century it wuz four stories and housed anywhere from four to five hundred people the odd shape of the triangle building created long hallways which were seldom lighted by anything other than daylight dashed through the dirty sometimes paneless windows or trickles of light that crawled from overunder the apartment doors the first floor contained two storefront churches one penny candy store one auto supply store one gypsy fortune teller and one herb and sacraments store that doubled as a policy station duck and bunky were standing in front of the building when blue got there followed by we hangeroners what you dudes up to duck pulled a small shiney blue steel revolver from under his shirt check this out nigga as he handed the gun to blue blue carefully checked out the piece as we peeped for the man whered you cop duck spoke with a grip i copped from warshawsky last night did you git any dough blue licked his lips as he asked naw the cash draw wuz clean but sumbody

eighteen times for yo birthday blue suggested duck nodded and looked away for a stick a piece of twobyfour lay in the dusty road behind him he walked over and picked it up i guess thisll do at that moment two young white boys came into view they were heading south on wentworth avenue who dem white boys somebody asked dey aint from duh hood tutti said les gitem when they noticed that we were near them they started to run the railroad embankment made escape difficult if not impossible one of them outdistanced us and made the corner he stood there at the corner watching us quiz and hold his

yo ass wit this stick juicy and cheetah held him while blue started to slam the twobyfour into the seat of the squirming boys pants you dirty black bastards he screamed tuttis fist caught him in the bastards that screamed from his lips blood and spit flew during the whole thing i was sooo happy that these boys had happened along at the right moment almost a miracle i decided that the moment was a good time to vacate the scene while the white boy wuz the brunt of the hostility ment of the black university this made all kinds of sense when we considered such things as our limited resourceshuman materialthe distribution of the black population and the most fertile sitesfor the black university as i have already stated rightly or wrongly many of us agreed that the black universityat least the mother campus would be best situated in the south assuming that there were others who would agree with this again rightly or wrongly we naturally balked at what sounded like a major development outside of the south we could not help but view any such development as being premature we were also concerned about what appeared to us to be a purely academic approach to the many problems of the people of color neither could we overlook the fact that the college would ultimately be controlled by whites as it was to be part of a white university which is controlled by a racist board of regents and a reactionary governor even more disturbing to us was the fact that the college would be at santa cruz which is certainly not an area with any significant number of black people relative to other areas in california and at the time of the proposal there were less than a dozen black students on the santa cruz campus we couldnt buy the college of malcolm_x but unknowingly we were getting ready to stake our lives on another bill of goods i now recall how some of us shivered with fear for the black university when the santa cruz people spoke of setting a national example perhaps some expert on mass psychology can tell us how ironically even those of us who opposed such developments and had perceived some of the dangers would soon come to speak the same language less than three months went by after bro moores visit before the cry of black studies now was raised across the land many of us who had been the opposition found ourselves leading the charge in berkeley after nine months of fruitless negotiations over our catch action we issued an ultimatum in january for several months prior to the ultimatum asian students chicago students and native american students had been engaged in a crash effort to develop their own programs these were nearing completion when the ultimatum was issued when it became clear that we would have to go downand that the other groups would probably have to do the same at some future datewe joined hands and asked for a third world college to house the four programs it might be said that our catch action died a natural death but the memory of the college of malcolm_x and our response to it three months earlier wasis extremely painful constant vigilance constant vigilance now brother harding i must attempt to deal with your letter more directly i too believe that some of our actions have placed us in bad company in trying to assess what might have been our greatest mistake i seem unable to avoid thinking that it was to assume that every white school which had even the smallest number of black students ought to have black studies most white schools will never make a workable adjustment to such programs still more of them simply do not deserve such programs but im getting ahead of myself this is something that i should return to all black students are not interested in black studieslet alone a black university au naturels dashikis and bubas have caused us to become presumptuous traditional motives for going to college are still very much alive the students want in and college is still the gateway when they came in different attire and coiffured differently many of us assumed that they wanted out for the most partwe were wrong but it is true that you can never fool everybody in this case it was mainly the socalled negro teachers who were not fooled they seemed to recognize immediately the difference between a change in style and a change in motive the new black thing was clearly a case involving a change of style and the socalled negro teachers recognized this one might think that they would have immediately called a conference as they so hurriedly have for a thousand other reasons to warn the students that they were dealing with style instead of substance but no for obvious reasons this was not in the cards what did occur instead was that prestohundreds of socalled negro teachers suddenly became black instructors out the window went murrays tuxedo royal crown and straightening combs the buba business had a new market books dealing around black folks were rushed into print course outlines were developed others were borrowed sold or stolen and letters and circulars carried the good tidings of jobs for black instructors the students were told to keep on pushin when schools were not sending out such letters and circulars various other programs were the entire country is now literally crawling with black programs and everyvhere the end result is division and confusion but we face an even greater danger what must be one of the greatest dangers we now faceif not the greatest dangeris the obvious creation of a class of opportunists who are determined to make off black studies what texas millionaires have made off oil in common parlance i would call them hustlers like the story of the ship at sea without fresh water we are fast approaching a situation where there will be black experts everywhere and not a drop of expertise this brother harding is what many of us are presently in league with and it is a league that we must break with very soon if we are ever to have our own on many occasions the central issue in our struggles with white administrators has been that of autonomy and in most cases we have not gotten it although in many cases they have acquiesced in such a manner as to offer the illusion that we have gotten it this is of the utmost importance in assessing fully the danger of the aforementioned problem because we do not have autonomy over the programs we are creating quite often when we discover that we have a dud on our hands which may be the whole program or someone in it we are unable to get rid of itthem this of course is very risky monstermaking and has considerably stiffened the demand for self determination there is yet another unseen danger in trying to operate without the power to purge when necessary quite often we do not really know the people we bring in to teach and administer us if no struggle occurs which calls for a demonstration of their commitment it is safe to assume that we never really know where they are alas in many cases when struggle has occurred more often than not we have discovered that our black and third world instructors were on the other side at best they were for themselves this was graphically illustrated during the strike at berkeley when only six third world faculty and administrators out of approximately seventyfive would agree to go on strike when we asked them to of course there were all kinds of reasons why they couldnt many of which could have been offered by the students who were on the line but then its ok if students get offed they should keep on pushin so that faculty and administrative people can continue to multiply and give credence to the lie but i really didnt wish to get into all this i only meant to say that we have learned that it is extremely dangerous to act as the head of a house when you cant bring people in or put them out when it comes to that point i should like to suggest right here that one simple way of dealing with this problemwhile checking the overall shotgun approach to the development of black studieswould be to rule out from the git go any development of black studies in those institutions where we are unable to gain the autonomy necessary to control them i fear if we fail to do this now we shall all suffer for it later but the total solution of this problem calls for more than one move the other moves i feel represent a partial response to your questions regarding our sense of vocation as is clearly borne out by the problems we face regarding programs and personnel there is an urgent need for us to begin to identify both faculty and students who have a serious long term vocational interest in developing a black university and getting them to work on it immediately if successfully carried out this alone would probably kill twothirds of the nonfunctional black studies programs in the country somehow at some time we have got to make it clear that black studies is not a mere cultural phenomenon which one relates to by parading around in the latest nationalist garb and talking bad sooner or later there just has to be a parting of the ways between those who just want to be in either the thing or the know and those who want to aid in our liberation through education we are simply no good for one another it will also have to be made clear that black studies has not come about to guarantee jivetime boogaloo opportunistic students degrees by padding their grades at present there is an immense amount of outright shuckin and jivin ie students expecting grades of excellent for writing papers which in essence say only ive got my shit together which is doubtful or im doing my thang others expect good grades for simply reaffirming the fact that whitey is doing his thang this is not the way to liberation and i think we should stop letting people believe that it is students who want to play football basketball go to europe become stockbrokers get into the movies become black capitalists or playboy bunnies should be taughtwarned and left alone most certainly they should be identified we have committed some regrettable mistakes because we failed to identify them in the past many of us saw them walking around looking militant and felt compelled to create campus revolts in their behalf this was certainly not the least of our mistakes but let me move on i had hoped that i could deal with the questions that you raised at the end of your letter in the order that you raised them however as i have attempted to respond torather than just answeryour letter a large part of the order has already been preempted but i will at this point attempt to go beyond the body of your letter to those numbered questions that remain you will i hope permit me one exception questions numbered i see no way to proceed without first dealing with these clearly there cannot be more than a few really excellent programs in afroamerican studies in this country the scarcity of our resources leaves no doubt about this take for example what is happening in northern california in the san francisco bay and surrounding area there are some major and minor colleges and universities all of these are presently in the process of developing black andor ethnic studies programs really i can think of only a dozen or so black instructors who may have more than an elementary understanding of what is actually meant by black studies of these i can think of less than half a dozen who have demonstrated or expressed any genuine interest in developing a black university further still if we started to speak of less than to a year in salary i would be afraid to bank on more than three of these on the brighter side if we can call it that the situation is somewhat better with concerned students but this glimmer too is dulled when you consider the task at hand the development of some college programs not to mention the demands being made by local and surrounding high schools given these circumstances not only in california but across the nation it is easy to appreciate the absurdity of trying to develop black studies at random but even if this could be done it would be certain to weaken if not totally dispel any effort to develop one or two major programs anywhere so the question of where such programs should be developed becomes key perhaps for a change we are actually in need of a conference to decide where we should or should not attempt to develop black studies and if such a conference were to be called it should be made clear to all concerned that the purpose of the conference would be to bring together all of those persons who are not only concernedbut who wish to devote their energies to the creation of a black university if this is not done and we bring an amorphous group of people together to discuss black education in general we run the familiar and often catastrophic risk of lapsing into needless oration and generalities this is not to say that we do not need or appreciate the support that we presently haveonly that someone must actually do the work now something is implied here which ought to be dealt with what is implied is that some differentiation is being made between black education in general and the black university in my opinion this is a necessary differentiation it is my understanding that we who wish to work towards the development of a black university are not saying that we wish to dictate or control everything educational that has to do with black people instead we are simply saying that we believe that there should be a black university in other words i do not believe that we are implying that no school other than the black university should attempt to have its curriculum reflect the presence of black people indeed i think we all agree that this should be done i think however that we ought to be saying to our own people that any major program developed should in some way be either directly related to or at least complimentary to the development of the black university otherwise such programs are bound to do a disservice to the black university by contributing to our already disturbing state of diaspora once we have decided where the mother campus of the black university is going to be i can see no difficulty in then determining where other programs should be developed you raised the question of how you our brothers in the south might be of the greatest help to us in the north how much of your energies should be spent in consulting and lecturing in the north at our request when you have so much business to take care of down there i am tempted to answer this question by saying that you should do nothing with respect to the northjust continue to do your thing down there but that would be too blatant an expression of my bias for what you are doing there as opposed to what we have gotten involved with here then too there are some things that you can do for us without adversely affecting what you are doing there first of all you can help all of us by using your influence and ideas with other sincere black educators to help us form some kind of an accrediting association to deal in the area of black or afroamerican studies it seems our only chance of insuring some degree of integrity when so many things are happening i think we could also expect such an association to be able to determine which programs schools in the north are worthy of your attention visits consultation lectures etc and which ones are not the national association of africanamerican educators should facilitate an easy start in this direction all we have to do is relate to it other than this i urge you all to persist in your loyalty to the black students who study with you in the south even in the face of tempting salary offers and the handful of us who have been farmedout as window dressing for the prestigious institutions of the north you have the ball essence and they are simply waiting to steal it after we have tackled you in answer to question no it is my opinion that you should refuse any offers from either us or them until some arrangement regarding the above has been formalized there is presently nothing in white institutions that is worth imitating anything that we could create in them to imitate might just as well be created in the right place to begin with it would make a great deal of sense in my opinion for us to attempt to provide as many serious northern black students as possible with exposure to the blackoriented brothers in the south and the southern black experience in general indeed many of us have already developed a vision of our circumstances that is tunneled because we lack such exposure as is evidenced by the tone of this letter i found your suggestions for action wholly appropriate and in keeping with our needs of these i do not believe that enough can be said for the usefulness of a scheme such as the consortium that you suggested unless some such arrangement is effected we may reasonably expect not only a continuation of the present rape and deprivation of southern black institutions but it appears that we can expect an escalation of this situation whether or not we are able to create such consortiums may be largely determined by our ability or willingness to communicate the sordidness of these circumstances and to move constructively to prevent them still there is the need to be more specific about what to do and where to do it and it is here that i wish to offer some further suggestions it is a fact that we are still in the midst of a general stampede in the direction of black or afroamerican studies it is equally a fact that this approach black studies everywhereanywhere is not conducive to the construction of one really good program anywhere therefore we ought to decide where such programs are really neededcan function and devote our time and energies to these alone the to million people that we are concerned about are spread across the country west coast east coast midwest and south the task as it appears to me is to construct some programs that will bring as many of us together as is possible to insure that at least four major programs directly related to the black universityare developed in the country broken down here is how i see this on the west coast and pacific northwest california has the largest concentration of black people this concentration is primarily in the northern and southern parts of the state within the northern and southern parts of the state the black population is dispersed in such a manner that to speak of an educational endeavor expected to affect all of them is to speak of at least two sites in both the northern and southern parts of the state say two in or around the los angeles area and two in or around the san francisco bay area on the east coast the black population is concentrated primarily in new york new jersey and pennsylvania here any action expected to affect a majority would probably require three sites possibly four because of the unusually large number of people in this case i cannot guess about where these sites should be because of my limited knowledge of the areas involved i merely wish to convey that an expanded effort will be required in this area in the midwest the folks are primarily in illinois michigan and ohio again the action should probably be triple then of course there is the south where more than half the souls still are as i have already related many of us feel that this is where we should attempt to do our main thing the mother campus of the black university other than the fact that you have already made a notable start there which probably exceeds anything that we have done in integrity i am inclined to believe that there are many more reasons for this decision that are rather obvious i am further convinced that the south is the place when i look and see not only beautiful potential sites for the mother campus but so many beautiful sites for extension programs of all kinds now what i am saying here should not be construed to mean that we ought to undertake the establishment of nine universities at least not at this time i am instead suggesting that we attempt to create one university and eight catchvrelated totype actions to support it i mean this is my vision of your consortium ideally constructed we name the sitesthe schools choose the people see that the money is pooled recruit the students and faculty and send the kindling down south as we have seen so many promises swell and fail to gain the crucial burst needed for an overflow of success i fear for the ebbing but yet unborn and contained black university pray to all damballa first that we do not fail this time but there must be something that we can do to lessen the possibility of a failure one thing that we have not done in the past is to be specific enoughboth in terms of our interest and our commitment we can think talk and write about everything but we can only act effectively on one thing at a time nearly everyone among us can recall attending meetings conferences etc where we dealt with so many things we were told so many things to do that we seldom accomplished any one of them in our haste to do them all possibly we can avoid this if we remember that our goal is the black university we canmust and will be concerned about everything else but some of us must work towards the establishment of the black university if it is ever to become a reality it may at this point sound foolishly ambitious but the best possible assurance we could provide to see that our dream is not stillborn would be to find a way to pay a small but devoted group of people to work fulltime towards the development of the black university and the aforementioned supporting actions otherwise the risk of failure that we run is incalculable your commentary regarding finances hardly calls for any response save a resounding amen and an affirmative nod you are certainly correct in assuming that the time has come for the northern white institutions to do something more than attempt to destroy the black institutions of the south there are so many ways in which they might begin or be forced to contribute positively that i could hardly begin to list them but i should not pass one of these many black graduate students across the country are being paid to act as teaching assistants in their respective schools but who really needs these teaching assistants many of whom are already qualified instructors are there not enough white graduate students in white northern schools to teach introductory courses and to grade papers surely these guilty committed and concerned white institutions would not mind paying the salaries or some part of them of those black students who wished to do their assisting in the black institutions of the south where they are really needed this is something that militant black students and black teacher recruiting programs should look into the autonomous black foundation of which you speak is long overdue why did we not think of this at a time less pressing for its need most of us know about foundations who establishes them supports them operates them and keeps them going black professionals the middle class bourgies artists and others whose faith taste style and nerves hope that they will not be offended by the jargonor intimidated will not allow them to do anything else must be urged to get going i such is a common excuse for doing nothing words other black faculty persons have evidently taken a similar point of view how does that way of producing blackness fit into our rhetoric concerning the needs of the community is it really more imitation that we must have now considering our sadly limited resources can there be more than a few really excellent programs or institutes in afroamerican studies in this country is it possible that the recent announcements of the creation of at least two dozen such programs will lead to even more dispersion of our black talents rather than to the consolidation we so badly need for this period if only a few such black research and teaching centers can live with significant integrity where should they be developed indeed where will they find nurture during a period of prolonged struggle to move to an even more directly personal level have any of you considered the possibility that it might make more sense to bring black students to a blackoriented professor in the south than to take him away from his campus in other words have you questioned your own locations seriously in the light of our need to gather ourselves together have you given serious thought to your own sense of vocation the building of the black university whether it be realized in one or a dozen locations demands totally committed teachers organizers and administrators who have moved beyond jiving to real work what about you perhaps you dont know that black students in the south on the negro campuses are also calling for more black faculty where will we find them concrete suggestions for action on the recruiting of black faculty for northern schools if this must be done during these days when the supply of wellequipped blackconscious brothers and sisters is so limited then why not work for the establishment of special visiting professorships rather than outright raiding of black schools under such an arrangement faculty from the south could be invited for one year we could teach one course in our specialty each quarter or semester and be available for many kinds of counselling there would also be freedom from the many ordinary academic pressures of our southern campuses and time as well as secretarial and research assistance could be made available for more research writing and publication at the same time we would not be wrenched away from the southern schools on an indefinite basis in a sense this would be no more than a token presence of course but it represents a temporary measure which might have some mutual benefit while we discuss the questions above and while we seek to increase the supply of brothers and sisters who can do the job on the recruiting of black students there are obviously hundreds of thousands of black students outside of the colleges who ought to be involved in some meaningful experience of higher education since your institutions have obtained funds from many sources for some of this task why not make at least part of that money available in more creative ways for instance a consortium of one or more white and one or more black schools could be created solely for the purposes of recruiting black students through some pooling of funds mostly yours in the north black students could then be approached with this offer here are the funds you need to go through college you can use the money to attend for example morehouse dillard cornell or the university of illinois if you choose a black school we ask only that you agree to spend one of your years on the predominantly white campus strengthening your brothers there if you choose an overwhelmingly white school you will have the privilege of going home for a year in this way black students could take the money from white schools and use it in any way they choose besides under the new conditions now prevailing in both black and white institutions the exchange could not help but be fruitful the issue of finances is a crucial one especially as it relates to the future of black colleges some institutions would obviously serve the cause best if they merged with other schools to create new strengths and expanded facilities but even those which remained need to be enlarged and endowed in ways that black schools have not known up to now why for instance should it not be possible for prestigious northern schools to use their prestige to help obtain special research grants for certain work which can be done well only by black scholars or why should your more affluent northern institutions not be pressed to make other significant financial contributions to the life of these schools they now so blithely seek to rape the united negro college fund might be one general depository others can be found perhaps an autonomous but well funded black educational foundation ought to be established with its single mission the financing of creative ventures in black education this would not exempt the existing white foundations of course it would simply mean that this black institution would be able to give all of its time and energies to the task so far it has been relatively easy to get white institutions to perform certain kinds of moneyproducing acts on behalf of black education on their own campuses perhaps the time has come to press them to use part of their budgets even sections of their endowment funds to help establish such a foundation or otherwise to make longterm substantial investments in the black academic institutions these would of course constitute no more than preliminary steps towards restitution certainly it is no accident that such proposals fit the pattern of what the former colonizing nations must do to be of significant assistance to the areas they crippled finally it is apparent in the current rush to blackness on the part of white institutions that there simply is not the beginning of an adequate supply of persons trained in afroamerican studies it is imperative for usand for youthat we move urgently to fill that gap in ways other than the stripping of the southern black campuses the various institutes and phd programs in this field which have appeared over the past year are obviously meant to meet the need as well as to satisfy you and to keep you off certain backs but i would argue that most of them cannot and will not do the job indeed some of them may die as soon as you stop blowing on the other hand it is only logical that black institutions in the black community if properly funded organized and led could probably do the best job of creating new scholars in the field of afroamerican studies this seems especially likely in those places where traditions libraries and faculties seem at least adequate even now and where students are pressing sometimes reluctant others towards blackness in atlanta that has been our basic assumption and a group of us have moved towards the creation of such an institute for afroamerican studies we think that black students throughout the nation should know this and should ponder its possible meaning for your own presents and futures as some of you know there are in the atlanta university center six negro institutions in various stages of their search for blackness on the faculties are more than persons whose training experience and teaching in the field of afroamerican life and culture are at least significant the slaughter collection of negro literature the georgia state archives and the newly begun martin_luther_king memorial library a documentation center for the movement combine to present unusual library and archival resources on the black experience apart from such tangibles we are also beneficiaries of the spirit of the great pioneering work in black studies done in atlanta by such persons as w e b du bois e franklin frazier rayford logan e s braithwaithe ira dea reid and many others it is against this background of past and present resources that we are now in the process of creating an institute for afroamerican studies under the umbrella of the martin_luther_king jr memorial center research teaching celebration and action are to be the central driving forcesall focused on the life and times of the peoples of african descent i mention the institute here because it will need many things which you can help provide it will need millions of dollars the best staff from every part of the african diaspora students who are ready to take care of business and it must have continuous exposure throughout the black community the schools you attend could help raise funds for this institute for they will need our products both human and informational if they are to be transformed into viable situations some of you will ultimately comprise the staff and student body the plans you now have for the afroamerican studies in white settings must be reexamined and challenged by atlanta in short i am proposing that you help this institute become the major black educational creation of this generation you have a kind of leverage in the white world which must not be dissipated in minor ambiguous victories more importantly you have a power which must not be turned against meaningful black institutions the challenge to help create such an institute to break down the many brittle assumptions of conventional american education to move consistently towards our intellectual roots in the struggle for liberationthis is i think a challenge more appropriate to your power as you ponder these matters i trust you will remember that my questions and proposals are meant to be only some of the ingredients in a dialogue which must take place among us the letter is written in the spirit of black ecumenical concern as we move towards a new humanity the words are my own but the concerns are shared by many other persons on the southern campuses we look forward to appropriate response from the north east and west black studies as an academic discipline by preston wilcox laremont college c f is to be commended for convening a cone ference on the subject jssue biac k studies as an academic discipline considering the amount of ivory tower energy that has been invested in proving that the only way black students can achieve is to deny any association with their own cultural heritageand the historical inequities designed to destroy itthis is an important step in the right direction claremont colleges efforts to explore this subject in a systematic fashion may be the first step in the direction of its own rehumanization this observation is made because of the ease with which a large number of whitecontrolled institutions of higher education have dodged the intellectual issue they did so by setting up separate and sometimes autonomouslycontrolled black studies programs without taking one step to decolonize their core curricula the organized resistance to courses such as swahili is a case in point not only were efforts undertaken to invalidate swahili as worthy of location within an academic curriculum several mainstream scholars challenged its relevance to descendants of africa all this took place in the shadow of freshman orientation courses which function mainly to acclimate students to the campus but not necessarily to education for meaningful survival and liberation but one can not permit himself to be carried away by the opportunity to explore this question recall that the concept of academic discipline as perceived by most scholars does not include authentic blacks as full participantsnor does it seek to define them as equals it is a creation of a white supremacist society one in which scientific colonialism was utilized both to conceal the reality of racism and also to label black scholars as unqualified the criteria by which most white americans have earned their phds has had little to do with white merit it has had more to do with white oppression white scholars have not had to compete with black scholars as students or as codefiners of the social fabric of this society i call this phenomena the satchel paige syndrome satchel paiges very excellence as a baseball pitcher increased the possibility that he would not be admitted to the major leagues until he was thought to be over the hill this reminds me of a white friend who was the florida state champion in the yard dash while in high school he graduated the same year as did bob hayes now of the dallas cowboys bob hayes may not have the trophy in his homesince he was prevented by the white segregationists from competingbut everybody in florida knows who the real champion is a corollary to this analysis is the content and style of the academic format shaped deliberately to include and deepen white control over blacks and to exclude authentic inputs such an academic concept can only be fully understood as being politically and intellectually oppressive colonialistic in action and white supremacist in content the phding process which is similar to that of the making of a priest requires that candidates surrender the right to think for themselves to the doctoral committeesin the same way that a candidate for ordination takes a vow with the pope the political nature of academic disciplines as applied by mainstream scholars raises a further question the socalled apolitical stance of mainstream scholars is in fact a fabrication such a policy merely conceals the politics behind it under a fagade of scientific objectivity to apply the same criteria to black studies as has been applied to white studies is to ensure that black studies will become white studies a new social contract that claremont college has raised this issue to the level of intellectual inquiry is a commendable effort only to the degree that such an inquiry respects certain basic understanding about the issue being engaged a whitecontrolled institutions of higher education have survived as full members of a societv in which it is illegal to be human herewith defined as being a positive relationship with one of minority group status a poor person or one who is different from oneself b whitecontrolled institutions of higher education have survived not as instruments to reshape society but as tools of the same society that has assigned illegal status to the groups mentioned above c the thrust of black studies programs must remain at the level of a movement they must resist institutionalization and any partnership which is not pluralistic humanistic in function and integrally related to the liberation and restoration of all black people more than anything else black studies programs must be viewed as instruments for the development of the black communitythey should not become token instruments for the legitimation of white institutions of higher education d the scientific colonialismdefined by galtung as that process whereby the center of gravity for the acquisition of knowledge about a nation is located outside itself w must be replaced by scientific humanism wherein the center of gravity for the acquisition of knowledge about black people is collected controlled managed and distributed by black people before this issue can be systematically approached then a social contract involving the following points must be made a the powersthatbe in the white controlled institutions must get involved in overcoming the racist practices that benefit them in economic and educational terms to the disadvantage of black and other minority group students recall that most such institutions are organized as though we reside in an egalitarian society when in fact the democracy they espouse is a hypocrisy blacks are not treated as equals by whites because of the essential meaning of being nonblackin style habits behavior etc part of the meaning of being white is to define blacks as being inferior an active manifestation of white superiority stokely carmichael raised this question for whites when he wrote it must be offered that white people who desire change in this country should go where that problem racism is most manifest the problem is not in the black community the whites should go into white communities where whites have created power for the express purpose of denying blacks human dignity and selfdetermination b the black studies institute must be involved systematically in redefining understanding and codifying the black experience to ensure that a body of relevant and transmittable knowledge is developed this effort must involve the development of new definitions of old perspectives an increasing reliance on black selfaccreditation and the planful use of instinctual understandings such as selfconcept functional anger and the like the old perspectives have assigned inhuman status to blacks the efforts of blacks to integrate with whites has led to a new level of white paternalism whites keep the real power blacks become acting colonial relations agents traditional ivory tower intellectualism is in fact a higher form of antiintellectualism it isolates theory from practice separates apprehension from comprehension thought from action and conceals the politics of social control behind a facade of a political intellectuality this new social contact should be characterized by a pluralistic approach to curriculum development and management and institutional governance the white segment of the institution should be involved in getting its house in order while the black segment does likewise the interface between these two should involve a continuing identification of shared curriculum and decisionmaking and opportunities to increase the possibility that a legitimate integrated institution will result a whitecontrolled institution can never achieve the status of authentic integration neither can a predominantly white institution achieve that status such a status can only be achieved within a racist society if the student body is predominantly minority group and the control at the least is multiracial with clear divisions of labor and responsibility significantly the meaning of education and the educational goals of the university system should undergo a process of reordering student orientation should engage students in beginning to learn about that particular contribution they want to make toward the betterment of the society of which they are a part the traditional plan orients students into participantconsumer roles into the system rather than as participantproducers a second order of business is that of enabling students to learn how to think for themselves rather than the way we would like to have them think part and parcel of the process is enabling students to begin to view education as a tool for their own liberation as a political instrument if you will rather than as a means to make it this new social contract will foster a different set of social relationships a an identification of a shared responsibilityblack and whitein defining the role of an educational institution within a democratic society and how to achieve such a society b an identification of those decisions which are the exclusive purview of the participating partners as they relate to the various componentsadmissions course requirements faculty status curriculum content etcof the university system this new social contract will foster a different set of social relationships between the participating partners rather than competing with each other to define and redefine the white and black positions each will be assigned to defining a human position in his own terms rather than competing with and confronting each other they will find themselves competing with and confronting themselves the first rung on the road to meaningful selfeducation whites will not have to feel like patrons blacks will not have to feel patronized importantly white administrators will not have to learn how to make relevant decisions about blacks instead they will be called upon to give up their need to do so blacks in turn will not have to expend decisionmaking energies teaching whites to understand the black experience these energies can be better utilized deepening its implementation the rationale for proposing such a social contract is based on the following a among the many consequences of our racist society is not only its impact on the blackwhite encounter but its impact on how people feel about themselves others and their frames of reference white unity is a factor then of the common negative attitudes toward blacks whites perceive each other positively largely because of their common disdain for black people and not because of a positive identity with whom they are to make a humane decision affecting black people is antiwhite in the view of most white people black unity thus far has derived from common oppression and exploitation and less from a development of positive group selfinterests this pattern is gradually being reversed by the black_power ethos black people are relying less and less on a humane response from whites they are utilizing their skills and resources to increase the degree to which they control and define their own lives b as most institutions of higher education have operated they have systematically overlooked the legitimate concerns of black people the communities in which they reside and their legitimate aspirations black students until very recently were significantly absent on most such campuses as a consequence large numbers of students have been educated not to be able to perceive and deal with black people and their experiences on a humane level not only is there a missing body of knowledge but effective ways and means of collecting interpreting and understanding it have yet to be developed toward a definition before black studies can earn the status of an academic discipline whitecontrolled institutions must recognize their inability to so accredit them black studies should not become a replica of white studiesnor should they be perceived as being a reaction to the failure of institutions of higher education to include such programs as an integral part of their curricula the thrust for black studies programs developed not on white college campuses but at selma birmingham and at the march on washington it was on the civil_rights battlefield that blacks learned that an appeal to the white conscience had to be replaced by an appeal to black consciousness that the alternative to white oppression was not integration but the mounting of black_power that white people could not save black people from exploitation and degradation as long as white people benefited from them in order to fully understand this movement one must understand jim formans black manifesto as an attempt to define a new socioeconomic contract between white donors and black recipients it is based not on white philanthropy but black restitution grants made to black students should be perceived not as white charity but as the return of legal entitlements to a group on whose backs this nation was built the concept of reparations must be fully understood as a prerequisite then to understanding the subject at hand black studies can not be perceived as an academic discipline as long as the program resources are whitecontrolled andor managed james boggs has discussed the subject of black capitalism as being mythical and irrational he has raised the question in order to warn blacks against displacing whites as economic exploiters of blacks as a means to urge them to develop a new set of socioeconomic relationshipsnonexploitative in nature and collectively incomeproducing in operation his point seems to be that racism and capitalism are so deeply intertwined that they shape and are shaped by each other this behavior on college campuses is seen in the pattern of utilizing federal grants and special programs as a way to increase the inventory of black students whites continue to get paid to serve as gatekeepers for the onebyone admission of black students on criteria established by whites and not blacks as forman has put it we have always resisted attempts to make us slaves and now we must resist attempts to make us capitalists the reparations concept based on the articulation of a humanizing socioeconomic contract between white donors and black recipients and the recognition of a need to develop a humanizing socioeconomic network of relationships within the black community are important to understand this externalinternal relationship construct became the basis on which the national association for africanamerican education began to develop an educational paradigm addressed to an understanding of the black condition it began by defining the black educator as follows students parents community leaders clergymen businessmen activists moderates college professors teachers educational administrators and all who are actively involved in the educational liberation and survival of the black people it attempts to avoid exclusion on the basis of social class ideology age occupational role andor organizational affiliates the paradigm under discussion focused attention on education for life rather than education for scholarship it was based on the interrelationships between the phases of psychosocial development and the social systems under which the change and growth take place the family the neighborhood the city the nation and the world threaded throughout the paradigm was a concern with the physical and mental health of black people and a positive association with their own cultural heritage this paradigm was to provide the foundation on which education for black humanism was to be based the concept of academic discipline was to include these considerations as a sine qua non importantly it was to provide the framework on which new and substantive bodies of knowledge about the black condition were to be linked it would require that such issues as selfconcept reparations cooperative and collective economic enterprises psychological and political liberation a reordering of given values be systematically addressed and understood i many black scholars have begun to address these questions from a variety of perspectives and as they would operate within a functional black university james boggs has sketched out some guiding principles as they affect relationships between student and community research and community theory and practice intellectual studies and manual work studies and social change students and teachers and students to one another and subject matter productive or technical skills black culture social change and interdisciplinary relationships as he views it the educational process must restructure blackwhite relationship and i internal relationships among blacks as it operates scientific colonialism vs scientific humanism any serious and studied review of the writings and productions of mainstream scholars will reveal three major shortcomings one is the tendency to define black people as being in need of white accreditation before earning the right to be perceived as humans the white supremacist policies which undergird such efforts are concealed behind a facade of objectivity this tendency is observed as follows a the practice of comparing black and white statistics without taking into account differences in opportunities emanating from the reality of white institutional racism b the concealment of the exploitative nature of the relationships between social class groupings blacks and whites and less chance communities and the larger systems in which they are embedded c the labeling of the same behavior by whites and blacks by the use of different sociological terms d the tendency to treat blacks as equals only as it relates to negative criteria such as crime statistics drug addictions etc e the tendency to view the problems of blacks from the perspective of negative individual and group characteristics rather than perceiving such problems as being one consequence of their treatment within a white racist society thinking black scholars are aware of the fact that a william whytes organization man should have been labeled the white uncle toms b the only effective analogy between white and black families has little to do with the role of the woman it has more to do with the presumption of white male superiority and actual black male genocide the fact of the matter is that white suburban families are matriarchial even though the man is in the home c the residential patterns of this nation have less to do with land use choice and income than they do with discrimination minority group exploitation and the overprotection of the vagina of white women by white men d the ghetto cannot be understood as an orientation ground for becoming middle class its structure approximates that of a plantation or a prison system controlled externally and internally by outsiders the problems of the ghetto are whitegenerated whiteproliferated and whitecontrolled flowing from this recognition should be an understanding of how the judgments of many scholars and those of their students have been systematically screwed up many of us cannot distinguish missionaries from mercenaries clergymen from conmen nuns in habits from prostitutes in habits teachers from wardens students from inmates policeman from the gestapo criminals from philanthropists and pimps from able parents this phenomena has increased the possibility that the perceptions of the student submit him to easy external controland that he too will be educated to use knowledge to manipulate rather than to liberate this phenomena is further characterized by the rhetoric of oppression in the use of words to present the illusion of a democracy that does not exist really means really means real lx means mr really means really means really means school decentralization really means a third shortcoming is the failure to draw upon the natural shrewdness of the black community to define its own problems and aspirations the current proliferation of autobiographies biographies novels position statements and social studies produced by blacks themselves are characterized by a a lesser degree of intellectual fragmentation such writings are marked by a discussion of the impact of white institutional racism an awareness of the political realities and the interrelationship between separate concepts icebergs slims biography of otis tilson a black homosexual describes male castration and homosexuality in one person as it has been seldom understood otis writes my reason for telling my story is not money im telling it for my poor dead papa and myself and the thousands of black men like him in ghetto torture chambers who have and will be niggerized and deballed by the white structure and the thrill kill police he further links the degradation of the black man as it occurs both down south and up south a papa had some importance and a sense of worth down south even though living conditions were subhuman up north poor papa would become a zero unimportant to everyone even to his wife and children b the use of the subject of study both as the sources and interpreters of the data not only has this provided a new source of data but a body of missing knowledge for instance very few libraries have a category white institutional racism most libraries still view the race problem as the negro problem as discrimination as racial and cultural minorities heading home it may appear that i have refused to confront and examine the subject issue black studies as an academic discipline it only appears that way the crucial issue requires a redefinition of the concept such that blacks are perceived as and treated as humans with a common heritage african descendency and victimization by white institutional racism to discuss such an issue in the setting of whitecontrolled institutions requires several prior actions it is these prior actions to which this statement has been addressed a the articulation and implementation of a new coequal and parallel social contractextending from admissions to governance b the replacement of the philanthropic socioeconomic contract between blacks and whites with one which is based on the legal entitlements of black restitution c the development of the technology leading toward the establishment of a cooperative and collective socioeconomic network of relationships among blacks d the replacement of scientific colonialism with scientific humanism e the development of a systematic and transmittable body of knowli edge about the black condition black studies is an academic discipline fully accredited within the black world it is that body of experience and knowledge that blacks i have had to summon in order to learn how to survive within a society j that is stacked against them the white campus then is a means to an end not an end in itself it is a place to learn the mans language as a second language to understand his institutions so as to be able to subvert and humanize them to hone ones mind to apply ones intelligence to an understanding and alleviation of the black condition to internalize a need to participate in ones own liberation to contribute to a sense of black nationhood in the last analysis this nation can not be a human nation until black people and other minorities say and behave as though it is in the same sense any white institution which seeks to evaluate black studies program on white oppressive criteria can never be a great institution until black students so accredit it black studies at this juncture by j frank yates year ago the entire country was being swept with demands by black students for more relevant educational institutions what were those demands about what has been done what remains to be done only after hundreds of black studies programs have actually begun has the real message of that movement made impact many have thoughtindeed hoped that the black studies movement of was simply a fad to be sure there was definitely spontaneous contagion in the movement this is a necessary part of any mass action there are however underlying issues that will either sustain the work of the serious black studies programs or lead to new crises if they fail simply stated a school or educational system justifies its exist i ence in a community by fulfilling two functions first it must impart the skills needed by the people to maintain their physical existence r second it must cultivate and transmit traditions and ideological concepts that meet the peoples psychological and moral needs to perform satisfactorily a school must be able to deal with both issues simultaneously the rebellious black student of was say n ing essentially that his schools black and whitewere adequately fulfilling neither function but es l pecially the second j we should examine that second function closer what really is ideology the concept has various i facets milton pokeach the open and closed mind and t w adorno the authoritarian personality isolate several of the core ideas they stress that ideology represents an institutionalized set of beliefs that one just picks up an organization of opinions attitudes and valuesa way of thinking about man and society other students of social movements emphasize another essential feature applied to this discourse they imply a fundamental relationship between the two functions of a school in the words of daniel bell the end of ideology pp ideology is the conversion of ideas into social levers in essence the ideology running through a society does much to determine how the people perceive themselves the perspective from which they evaluate all issues even the very alternatives they imagine clearly the course of human events is determined largely by just such factors i submit that the creation or development of a new ideology permeating the lives of black people is one of the most important if not the most important issue facing us today if such a black ideology already existed we would not see hundreds of agencies and organizations operating in our communities with all of them getting essentially nowhere if such an ideology already existed it would no longer be necessary to keep in stock a thousand and one powerful black orators to stir the black masses to action if such an ideology already existed it would not be necessary to create crises to solicit black support that soon peters out we are not the first group of people to experience the need for a new ideology the very group we recognize as our nemesis the white americans have experienced such a crisis in fact the resolution of their crisis has had much to do with the creation of ours winthrop jordan white over black chronicles the identity or ideological conflicts felt by the white american people during and shortly after the revolutionary war the american ideology that evolved from that period had at its core the notion that a true american was essentially a slightly modified anglosaxon the definition of american consciously excluded j nonenglish european influences the incorporation of blackness into the recognized concept of americanism was so absurd that the idea was never seriously considered reality and the official ideology of americanism could not and cannot be reconciled consequently white america has had to maintain two ideologies the official ideology incorporates all the ideals expressed in the countrys official documents the real ideology provides the foundations for racial oppression since a societys ideology serves as a basis for the attitudinal and belief systems of its people the duality and inconsistency of the american ideology implied a corresponding duality and inconsistency in the model american white personality all the various notions of cognitive balance can be applied toward understanding the probable result that result has most often been denial and compartmentalization we cannot deny that to some extent black people too have internalized aspects of the dual american ideology this is the crux of the issue dealt with here the situation is more complex than that involving whites in that neither portion of the american ideology has been adequate for black americans there have always been the rudiments of a functional black ideology in our communities however it has had to contend with tremendous odds for its mere survival let alone growth we control few instruments of communication and education the result has been three distinct and often inconsistent constellations of ideas attitudes and beliefs permeating black society small wonder that so many black individuals experience hangups and more important there is little to maintain our programs for change many including harold cruse crisis of the negro intellectual and rebellion or revolution and other cultural nationalists have recognized the ideological need of which speak their proposal that cultural nationalism is necessary to fill the void does not seem adequate the american political economic and cultural apparatus seems far too complex for cultural nationalism to be sufficient the final resolution may however involve some aspects of cultural nationalism it is incumbent upon those seriously committed to black studies to seek out the ideological positions that would be most beneficial to black people black thinkers especially black psychologists must aid in the development and transmission of the new black ideology this is the challenge of black studies at this juncture unless it is met we have simply added another agency to the pile and the next explosion will be just a bit stronger perhaps then we will deal with the gut issues of a black ideology and ultimately a truly american ideology mod modish and militant keeping on top of the scene for some people gameplaying is a fulltime preoccupation not only does it keep them on top of things it also has solid benefits playing the black intellectual game for example actually encourages them to read the books everyone is talking about making it possible for them to rap with authority about important current topics and that is definitely a plus that game neatly ties in with the black militant game which is all the rage just ow and which has merits of its own in attentiongrabbing a brother can come on like gangbusters with a boss fro and a handtailored dashiki set off with a soft silk turtleneck and a big brass pendant and that game dovetails beautifully with the swinger game allowing a brother to make the scene in imported bellbottoms direct from carnaby street and expensive italianmade boots shined to a gloss name the game and some brothers are right on top of it but the black revoultion is not a game nor are the legitimate aims of the black revolution served by assorted poseurs and hustlers playing revolution across the country a small but determined body of black men and women are dedicating their energies and in many cases their livesto the task of liberating black people from the psychological shackles which have rendered them powerless for centuries in whatever they doin education in art in music in literature or in community servicethey are concerned with shattering the old ikons of whiteness and with validating in the minds of black people regenerative black images and black idols and a black perspective on the world these serious men and women know that intensive and unwavering vigilance in the cause of black consciousness is necessary to break for all time the debilitating cycle of hope and despair which has characterized black life on this continent for years their task is monumental and it is not made easier by the diversionary tactics of the gameplayers it is imperative that the black community know the difference between the committed and the comedians

the f rst afro american theater by carlton w molette ii ne of the highest y priority items among r those of us who are e concerned with t h e to define our theater for us just as we afro americans must define who we are within the framework of our own cultural heritage we t history theory and criticism of afro american theater is a redefinition of afro american theater within the framework of af ro american culture we must not continue to accept a euro american concept of what theater is what constitutes a good play or a bad play how an audience ought to behave and so on if we do we will never even begin to discover the vast and beautiful and exciting history of our own theater the distortion of afro american theater history has been made possible primarily through the single device of allowing somebody else must also define what the word theater means to us and what good theater is within the context of our own culture for example by euro american standards a play must be done on broadway to be co nsidered worthy of serious critical and historical consideration of course there are a few exceptions to this rule in the form of long run off broadway hits but even the exceptions must be produced in the city of new york to be eligible for consideration as a worthwhile american play there is clear evidence to support the theory that euro americans mean to define afro american theatrical success in their terms as well for example a book was published in under the tite n egro playwrights in the american theatre by doris abramson a white woman the only negro playwrights in the a nerican theater according to the content of miss abram sons book are t h se whose plays have been produced in the city of new york by applying this euro american definition to afro american theater historically important afro american playwrights such as john ross randolph edmonds thomas pawley owen dodson james butcher and ray mciver are excluded simply because their plays had not been performed in new york prior to some have been produ ced since when historians apply euroamerican definitions to afroamerican theater history prior to the confederate rebellion they generally conclude that afroamerican theater did not exist for this reason afro american theater history prior to the confederate rebellion has been almost completely ignored most afro american theater history since then is also ignored and for the same reason but let us take one thing at the time the casual student of afro americantheater might easily conclude that the first afroplays are not lacking in af roamerican culture then this must be a case of using euro american definitions to determine what afroamerican theater is miss abramson implies that the first play by an afro american of any consequence at all was h arlem written by wall ace thu rman in collaboration with wiliam jourdan rapp a white man in apparently then h ae passed the euro american test of what af ro american theater ought to be primarily because a white man re wrote the play when we deal with afro american theater in an afro american cultu ral context we discover that even in new york wasnot the beginning nor was in or a mr brown opened a tea garden in what was by then a thriving community of free afroamericans in new york mr brown had previously been a steward on a ship that sailed between american play was the escape new york and liveroool en a leap to freedom written by william wells brown in even a work of the stature of john hope franklins from slavery to freedom says so but according to landamong the early entertainers at the tea garden was a man named james hewlett whose entertainment consisted of portraying the roles of several diff erent characters miss abramson the escape is not in one p erf ormance within four or really even a play nor is caleb the degenerate written by joseph s cotter in she says that both of these plays are crude and that they are reall y tracts meant for the library or the platform according to the dictionary crude means uncult ured but whose culture is at issue certainly these five yea rs mr brown had built a theater seating three or four hundred people in this theater a group called the af rican company performed one member of the company ira aldridge went on to be t come one of the most renowned actors of th century europe but what of the african company itself playbills of african company after those two performcompany perf ormances indicate ances cannot be accuratev docuthat they must have performed as regularly and definitely charged as much as the other theaters operating in new york at the time still the african company has been labeled by a few white theater historians as a bunch of amateurs whomade no significantmark upon the history of theater short of being picturesque on the other hand most white theater historians ignore them completely an undated african company playbill probably from or lists a performance entitled on the slave m arket it seems reasonable to assume that the perf ormance did not take a stand in favor of the institution of slavery would such an event be of no historical importance a later playbill announced that on june and the african company would present for the second time a play called king shotaway the play was billed as having been about a sjave insurrection on the island of st vincent and based upon the actual experiences ofmrbrownwhowas both playwright and manager of the company is not the production of a play by an afro american in about a slave insurrection a significant mark upon the history of the theater what happened to the african mented at this time however the company had been repeatedly harassed by the new york police department prior to that occasion in other words they had been ttrown in jail what must have been the attitude in the white community in toward an afroamerican theater company performing a play in which slave insurrection is encouraged a play in which the hero is a hero because he leads his black brothers in a violent rebellion against their white oppressors is it any wonder that neither the african company nor mr brown was ever heard from agai n james hewlett who played the role of king shotaway managed to continue his acting career in december of hewlett appeared at the spruce street theater in new york apparently in his one man show in which he played several different characters in one perf ormance and did imitations of the leading white actors of his day february was announced as his last appearance at military garden prior to his departure for london where he was to have appeared at the coburg theater there are apparently no record s at the cobu rg of hewletts appearance there there are however records of hewletts return to new york for perf ormances as late as september of cour e ira aldridge also went to london and to the coburg theater where in october of he launched a career that was to eventually lead to recognition as one of europes leading actors at any rate with the demise of the african company neither hewlett nor aldridge would ever again appear prof essionally in a play written by an afro american playwright for an afro american audience with an afro american acting company managed by an af ro american the closing of the af rican company in opened the door for the euro american theater establishment to saturate afro americans with the idea that the good the true and the beautiful must be determined according to euroamerican standards within a euroamerican cultural context but what if we use afro american culture to derive our own definition of afro american theater then we go back to the oral traditions of africa instead of the literary traditions of europe then we can deal with theater as a total event that may include narrative storytelling storytelling in dialogue form persuasive speeches sermons song dance or instrumental music in any number of conceivable combinations and we can deal with theater as an event that evolves orally rather than a specific set of words fixed for all time upon a page from this cultural context africans arrived in america some slave some free all oppressed from this cultural herit age black slaves held their white captors up to public ridicule among themselves in what has since been perverted into the negro minstrel from this cultu ral heritage also developed the afroamerican preacher the storyteller and the singer of spirituals as implements for the oral transmission of history mythology and ethical standards it is within these events that the roots of afro american theater lie ahead there is a long and difficult struggle to reconstruct these events outside of a euroamerican racist context this job is more difficult than the usual task of historical research it is more difficult for two main reasons first because white historians have conspired whether deliberately or unconsciously to destroy all records of significant cultural achievement within an afro american cultural context by afro americansliberal white historians have managed to convince us that they were helping while recording and loudly applauding only those cultural achievements by afro americans that mimicked euro american culture in addition afro americans were compelled to lie about what they were doing and why they were doing it what kind of punishment would have been in store for a black slave who told a white man who the minstrel was really making fun of or where the spirituals were really talking about going our ancestors were obliged to practice these deceits upon the white man in order to survive only when the afroamerican theater historian is able to break through this double wall around the truth will a thorough history of afro american theater be possible the dilent of blck rcti t er by woodie king jr the american theater isnt really the americantheaterhow america be anything but a black artists dream black theater is a term that says where blacks in this non existent american theater would like to go not where they are no real american form has emerged in this countrys short history in the late twenties when eugene oneill and the provincetown group tried to do new and vital work that one percent that mak e up the theater going audience retreated with shock however in the thirties oneill was joined by clifford odets irwin shaw sidney kingsley maxwell anderson and paul green and the country thought it had finally found an american theater unf ortunately it had not it had only succeeded in producing an ameri can august strindburg via oneill and different forns of russian literature via odets anderson and their contemporaries the crossing of contemporary american ethnic with traditional european theater seemed to be the american way america had taken what seemed to be the best of europe however what seemed to be the best emerged as the cover of a very complicated book in terms of physical structure theaters are still to this day of the proscenium type thats used all over europe these theaters were designed for operas from their inception every new stage design is based on an earlier european design discovered by careful research plays are written tofit into something similar to a box this makes most of the plays identical plays written in the thirties were presented in boxes american plays cannot be restricted by theaters designed for european opera paul green who worked with the stanislavski oriented group theater in the groupsbeginning and whowas an innovator in pioneering black drama in america white desses abrahams bosom n ative son hymn to the rising sun moved to outdoor symphonic fortn he went back to his home in north carolina and again pioneered one of the f ew true american forms in symphonic drama oneill vho experimented with black plasdreamy kid emp ero jones all gods childen got wings moved deeper into his own f amily and emerged as one of the finest american playwrights and the only one to ever win the nobel prize the plays about blacks written by these white men were vi eved by a white audience thats how the were meant to be viewed no attempt to change this pattern occurred until the mid fifties after the demise of the negro theaters in harlem and the f ashionable night out in harlem became unfashionable it was about that time that a series of small community projects discovered that survival meant developing within the community actors who had worked with the white groups were instru mental in developing black community groups in new york it was rose mcclendon frank wilson fred oneal in chicago it was ted ward in cleveland it was charles gilpin the communit naturally meant among black peers gradually the plays changed from revivals of white plays with allblack casts to original dramas written by writers f amiliar with the black life style the plays no longer were written for white acceptance since no white people would see th em in sch ools y m c a s negro digest apr il churches across the country from los angeles watts to new yorks harlem plays tried to communicate to those nearest those next door this was done out of necessity out of a need to survive the audiences were few but they responded more blacks tried their hand at pl aywriting in the thirties and forties the communists tried to use theater in the fifties the politicians tried to use theater in the sixties social worke s tried to use theater theater communicated directly and quickly there was no way easier or cheaper to reach black people then in the late fifties lorraine hansberry s raisin in the sun hit raisin reaffirmed in blacks the necessity for more involvement in black theater as a matter of fact lonne elder iii robert hooks douglas turner ward and ossie davis were all in raisin in the sun until the late fifties no black writer black actor black director or technician had benefited financially from any of the plays about black people which had been presented in years previous it had always been a white producer or white writer who had profited phillip yordans anna lucasta is a case in point marc connellys geen pastures porgy bess in abrahams bosom on down theline are all cases in point the years and marked the beginning of the coffee house theaterin new york the socalled alant garde the outcast theaters cafe cino cafe la mama and the hang outs of the beat generation blacks were accepted in this circle because the circle itself was about freedom the destruction of the system in the early sixties the poverty programs around the country came into existence social workers tried to use theater and young people who had only dreamed of participating in the theater arts now had the opportunity to participate through so called cultural enrichment programs tow ards the midsixties these projects became more serious the message became the medium serious black writers submitted their plays after realizing that the plays wouldn t be done in the mainstream theaters the underground flocked to see productions of these writers the writers received major attention from the same critics who reviewed plays on broadway and off broadway street theater and guerilla theater emerged asforerunners of black theater street theater takes theater directly to the people who canin the street was the first to nake an attempt she discovered almost immediately that for people in the inner city to relate performers had to be multi racial it became impossible for theater in the street to present its repertory in english alone spanish communities insisted that plays presented in their community communicate to them in their language guerilla theater is an attempt at git prop theater it attacks the government in general and the injusti ces of war in particular both forns u sed black people to help solve problems that were not directly related to the immediate needs of black people young blacks dissatisfied with the poverty program structure moved out on their own and set up their own thing this wa s true of the new laf ayette theater this theater had been a part of harlem youth unlimited new laf ayette theaters director robert macbeth had a vision that went beyond the limited idea of har yous federal project macbeth wanted a theater controlled exclusively by black people free to experiment within black culture free to try newforms thesamefreedomthat black americans fought for in all the other areas of their existence this could hardly happen within a federally supported project the new lafayettetheatermoved into its new quarters at the old elk hall in and macbeth started to build what he believes to be a black theater the foundation of this theater must be the community around it the classic function of the theater is to project and illuminate the feelings and concerns of the community which sustains it thus the theater like the church is a community ritual and black the ater cannot emerge until it is free of the european concept until we change our language yea h as we wont be free until we change our music we wont be free until we change our theater until we begin to do the rituals again when we tat doing the rituals again and stop doing plays the new lafayette theater is a theater that can become a black theater when it is no longer supported by foundations when it has to exist because the black people of harlem want it it will be black the new lafayette theatre in its four years came into its own when ed bullins the young black writer from philadelphia via san francisco journeyed to the new lafayette he brought with him a collection of pla ys that were written for black people they are so directed for black ears that whites reading them learn more about black culture than do the blacks to whom the plays are directed however there is little doubt of bullins direction unlike many black writers who exist without benefit of a permanent company bullins writes knowing that his plays will be performed his position is very similar to that of oneill and odets oneill had the provincetown company to test his plays and odets had the group theater odets also had harold clurman and elia kazan as well as some of the finest trained perforners outside of the moscow art theater bullins has the possibilities of a similar playwright company relationship but it is important that we understand the difference between a black eugene oneill and a true black playwright at this time there can be no black theater unless it is a free theater or a cooperative effort by all involved whenever money enters into the picture it is best to treat theater as a business unfortunately most of the black people who are active in theater or those on the sidelines hoping to jump into theater should be treated precisely as one would treat a white boy there is a magic which theater images project in the minds of black writers and black performers they dont see theater as ever having been fair to them and they are absolutely correct an art form that is unfair to white people is twice as unfair to the few black people who try to crack it a play produced by foundation support in a black community and playing to no black people is the same as a play produced by limited partnership off broadway playing to white people in both casesitsthe audience that determines the plays validity to the performer and writer the negro ensemble company is no diff erent than the american place theater is no difj eent than the new lafa yet te theater before a company of performers come together they are individual in their thinking and in their actions one thinks of oneself before he thinks of the collective and since everything about him is the same as the things away from him his thoughts usually remain the way they were when he entered the new surroundings by way of elaboration the last poets and leroi joness spirit house movers are projections of new thoughts and fresh attempts at form because they are not confined by time and space real estate is not important european concepts are not attempted their form of presentation goes back to early american form ie to the minstrel shows blues spirituals even in many cases to moans and screams in leroi joness case he learned the european forms early and therefore learned early how meaningless they are to the expression of the black life style on the other hand the last poets never learned european forns at all they found their form in black music and from black musicians the american black actor doesnt have the proper frame of reference his is a european concept it is basically the same with the black playwright he is less than three qecades out of the eu ropean tradition whether he is with the negro ensemble company the american place theater or the new laf ayette theater his frame of ref f erence and his form will be the same breaking that tradition might be what james brown the mu slims smokey robinson and rev c l franklin are doing theirs might be the real black th eater whatever it must be a bitch being artistic director in a theater where blacks negroes and colored people are all together the audiences that attend plays written and performed by black artists are usually of three types whites who want to be flagellated liberals who either want their fears confirmed or those who want to steal the art and the f ew blacks who go hoping that it will be good because blacks are involved for those who want to get flagellated there are all those horrible get whitey plays that are usually written directly to white people ignor ingblack peoplecompletelythese plays are meaningless no one with any knowledge at all believes whats happening on stage the liberals are in anoth er bag they are not interested at all in the real play the real theater they want the moynihan report confirmed all those reports from the welfare department verified if all this happens then intellectual discussion can be set nothing will happen as a result of these debates one or two black intellectuals who almost al ways are invited and who always start the discussion by stating that they haventseen the play but you know these intellectuals well they all got their jobs because the black nationalists raised a lot of hell and finally the black audience is just happy to see something black on stage they are not excited by reviews they want it real tell it like it is they are only a few and they are mostly students and its usually very difficult f or them to get to the theater this is the audience that black writers try to speak to however theater eco nomics are years ahead of them when it should be equal to them and so it came to pass the day black artists realized they would never be accepted in the main stream of american life it came very early in theater it was and still is the nut that few blacks are able to crack this is due to the direct and immediate image projected leroi jones called it revolutionary theater the plays that will split the heavens for us will be called the destruction of america the heroes will be crazy horse denmark vesey patrice lumum ba but not history not memory not sad sentimental groping for a warmth in our despair it was an art that had to express in beautiful and artistic form the life styles of its participants black participants wanted to create their own othellos their own willy lomans this came too when the country as its artists was and still is going through terrible changes political and social after years blacks can no longer believe anything white people say and are indeed making them face up to their lies nothing short of death could force the blacks to be negroes black theater cannot survive under the present conditions black perf ormers and black technicians cannot invest it with the same rules and regulations that characterize white theater its like telling a child that he is a man as vantile whitfield director of the perforning arts society of los angeles pasla inf ormed us black theater is embryonic black theater is about the destruction of tradition listen to ronald milner playwright and directoof spirit of shango theater in detroit run it down it will be a theater having to do with love of ones self and ones personal national and international family with wariness and hatred of ones personal national and international enemies with ideally points as to how to break their grip and splattertheir power it exists to make way for black thought and black artistic expression ideally it should be in a black community it cannot be directly supported by a foundation but an au ences an ritics by helen armstead johnson ong pressed to the t limit in so many facets of his life the black man of the sixties undergo close scrutiny at the beginning of a decade even more promising than the sixties in an interview with patricia bosworth of the new york times february lonnie elder called attention to the diverse angles of vision among black playwrights black writers have a particular frame of reference they cant avoid the ghetto or the terrible deprivation or the experience of bigotry and racism they are inthe spoke out n many midst of it all and they have to fight ways both because of and in spite of unbearable pressures and restrictions one of the most productive and most exciting manifestations of his outward thrusts has been a reactivated and energized black theater the theatrical ferment of recent years has crystallized into two major forms the theater of the black experience and the theater of revolution the existence of these major forms indicates different angles of vision for black playwrights as well as for their audiences and critics and all three must to get on top of itthere is an awful kind of purity in this kind of experiencele roi jones ed bullins ralph ellison douglas turner ward we all express ourselves differently as artists but we all create from the same basic need we are men and we want to belistened to ed bullins in introducinghis new plays j om the black theatre speaks of a wide range of plays revolutionary plays include we righteous bombersby kingsley b bass jr who is said to be ed bullinssonjiby sonia sanchez and the black bird by marvin x bullins recognizes the existing diversity well enough but he fails to note that in general there has been little emphasis on historical plays using a historical figure in a revolutionary play is not the same as writing a historical play among the plays of the black experience on the other hand are lonne eiders ceremonies in dark old men douglastumer wards day of a bsence ed bullins goin a btfjalo charles gordones no place to be somebody and adri enne kennedys cities inbezique onthe matter of historical plays however loften mitchell certainly one of the most informed men about black theater both historically and currently said this one thing missing though from the current pictureis historical theater it is mitchells view that theater should reflect a peoples history not just current treatments of the angry i hate whitey theme such plays as william branchs a wreathfor udomo and in splen did error truly reflect this history very recently the new york times conducted a suvey among theate people asking them which plays they would like to see revived ruby dee includedthis observation among othersi n splendid error william branchs play produced off broadway in the fifties deals with the historic confrontation between two giant americans frederick douglass and john brown i remember that it was exciting and most relevant to todays racial dilemmas the same thing can be said of course about branchsa medal fo r willieas its recent boston revival proved what is being said here is that the historical play has not yet emerged as a direction to beequated with those of the black experience and revolution the matter of audience is undoubtedly more critical for the playwright of the theater of the black experience because of the diversity of the audiences for such plays in a essay in anger and beyond the negro writer and american literature saunders redding gave seriousattention to the problem and it is a problem of audience after pointing out the historical differences and the causes of those differences between black and white audiences he came to this conclusion that the gulf between the audiences had been closed and that the black writer can now write without being either false to one audience or subservient to the other amplifying this from another angle douglas turner ward says that for a negro playwright committed to examining the contours con texts and depths of his experience from an unfettered unimaginative negro angle of vision the screaming need is for a sufficient audience of other negroes better informed through commonly shared experi ence to readily understand debate confirm or reject the truth or falsity of his creative explorations not necessarily an all black audience to the exclusion of whites but for the playwright certainly his primary audience the first person s of his address potentially the most advanced the most responsive or most critical only through their initial and continuous participation can his intent and purpose be best conceived by others wards day of absence illustrates his point as funny as the images and memories are the bitter truths and ironies are all too apparent black maids waiting on cold street corners f or buses in the morning all converging on the opposite street comers at the same time in the afternoon too tired to clean their own houses when they get home porters sweepin g the streets in front of shops in the early morning or polishing brass on bank doors what actually happens in the play is that blacks mysteriously disappear for a whole day including some of those in positions of power in government who were not known to be black wh at is true is that black people have often wondered what white f olks would do if all the black s disappeared ward has implemented alexander popes powerful line what of t was thought but neer so well expressed the play of course reveals the completely chaotic state of aff airs without black people and it dramatizes a secret wish which no doubt every black person has had at one time or another the play illustrates the way in which a black audience can relate to a black playwright on the basis of commonly shared experience experience which whites necessarily perceive in a different way addressinghimselftothematter of audience too james emanuel critic and an editor of dark symphony says the truths of negro life then should be the staple of writing directed toward negroes specifically and negro writers should tell those truths and to insist that negro writerslimit themselves to work which they think serves negroes alone is to deny the general humanity and universal significance of negroes what is good for a black audience is good for any audience or reader to refute that isto minimize tlie meaning of a black persons life this is not inconsistent with playwright william branchs insistence upon the playwrightsfreedom to choose his audience and to direct himself to any group he wishes to at the time he has the urge to write there are times he says when he has something to say to black people and there are other times when he has something to say to whites this is a matter of emphasis not exclus on alice childress believes that black writers should direct work toward black audiences but she is aware of the fact that black audiences are not always waiting with open arms for every word we have to say many of them listen with a white ear they want playwrights to say just enough but not too much it is not the simplest thing in the world to write for a black audience on the point of just enough there is an excellent illustration in the now defunct black culture weekly december the play being attacked by barbara ann teer is big time buck white at first all is hilariously well with her all of them are definite folk images and character types cats you would find on the corner of any black communityhustlingoffthepoverty program the actors work well together they have a real warm feeling bouncing back and forth im laughing so hard i didnt realize that my head was beginning to ache after awhile sic i started massaging my temples and said to myself where is all this tension coming from these brothers are funny as hell but it soon became pretty obvious that the brothers were depicting the most negative niggerisms we have i mean its no secret we have millions of messed up confused lost directionless brothersfloating around lets be honest thats reality it is also true that we have millions of brothers who are still into an opportunistic solo hustling thing yeah we got em so expose em why not but then after you expose em then wh at you cant just create these nigger figures and leave them hanging out there for no reason other than to say to whitey look how dumb ignorant moneyhungry power crazy ego starved black men are i include whitey because percent of this audience is also white but then what do you expect downtown now im beginning to dig whats really being put down and im getting a little nervous and uncomf ortable its getting worse sic instead of better like three quarters of the evening has gone by and ive had it with all this negative shit niggers doing nothing but fussingfighting and cussing i mean im really feeling embarrassed almost naked you know like stripped damn big time buck white hurry up come on in and save these poor niggers straighten em out after having identified the characters as definite folk images and character types to be found in any black community miss teer then charges the actors with having come all the way from watts just to get on a new york stage make buff oons of black people to really strip them of all their dignity for no apparent reason other than to make money and to show the white playwright obvious contempt for them yet one reads this about big time buck white dick wiiiamswhenwilliamswasfirstapproached about doing the play he was so detennined that it come through ashethoughtitshouldthat he reworked most of the dialogue deleted one character altogether and completely changed the character of buck white ive tried to make him honest and very concerned at one point we almost had to bar tuotti the playwright from the theater it takes a black writer to really know the black experience and communicate it im convinced of it there arent any buts about it to the extent that williams assumes responsibility for the play he must be considered in any discussion of black playwrights and their audiences the substance of what williams and tuotti put together white richard watts of the new york post summed up as sound and fury signifying very little black garette robinson in black culture weekly summed it up this way big time buck white is a funny spoof it is a peak of comedy sitting like a pimple on a base of tragedy the acting and direction are excellent the play itself however falls short in that it has failed to explore in depth the causes that have produced the tragic characters of b a d beautiful alleluia days without this exploration it comes on like amos and andy in the space age a similar thing happened to ed bullins in the wine time the reviewer began by asking is this play really necessary it attempts to reflect what is happening with the grass roots brother and sister telling it like it is but not like it is and like it should be what is needed in our community is a black theater that will produce black plays plays that will create positive images of brothers and sisters plays that move brothers and sisters from spending their lives drinking rotgut and rot mind wine and becoming warriors that have a revolutionary task at hand and a new world to create a denunciation of old stereotypes follows the typical religious sister in everybodys business the wino the sanctified young sister the hustler and the typical negro cop but so what he asks since the play doesnt move from being a reflection of negroes doing their selfdefeating thing obviously telling it like it is over and over is not enough as harold schonberg said recently in attacking concert offerings damn this endless concentration on the familiar the problem we are illuminating here of course is not the validity of the criticism but the fact that it supports alice childresss contention that a black audience does not necessarily assure the black playwright a receptive audience what the black audience really is was the focus of a recent study by thomas johnson of the new york times january he was forced to conclude after scores of interviews with people concerned with black theater and audiences that it was impossible to tell how many black people were regular theater goers the figure is thought to be small compared to white audiences but at the same time far greater than it was before the last decade of black activism johnsonsidentifiable list of black audiences included the following the loose sprinkling of color amid the masses of whites clogging the sidewalks nightly in front of such hits as man of la mancha fiddler on the roof and the comparatively larger groups of blacks that come out to see either black performers or black themes such as hello dolly the even larger and mostly young adult groupsthat frequent off broadway houses supporting the increasingly popular production of the negro ensemble company such as ceremonies in dark old men and the new york shakespeare festivals publictheaters production of hair and no place to be somebody the growing number of evolutionary minded black activists who following the black art concept popularized by leroi jones see the theater as a tool for the creation of social change the audienceparticipants being developed by new concepts in black theater that are creating styles out of the black style of life one of the more advanced of this school is the national black theater workshop of barbara ann teer and the many black people who go to all types of theater thus far we have indicated how much different angles of vision of black playwrights the wide range of audiences and the limitations posed by critics who embrace one or more of the black audiences to say nothing of white ones pose problems of freedom of choice for the playwright of the theater of the black experience much of the current theatrical energy is being spent upon revolutionary theater which is still a developing rather than an established genre in the first place the playwrights regard themselves as obedient to the black aesthetic but what that is is not clear to anyone including those who write about it it is currently mired in rhetori c and confusion partly as a result of this confusion many of the plays are totally undisciplined in written form as well as inproduction some are sketches not plays at all but some of the playwrights do not seem to know this loften mitchell while optimisticabout the growth of the black audience and positively delighted over the numher of young black writers who are actually getting audiences at the same time expresses anxiety that the unworthy plays being staged might vitiate the gains now being made one of the things which leroi jones did foblack theater was to articulate a new kind of anger and to seek to devise a black aesthetic free of traditional western components in an essay written before his writing became lessliterary and more revolutionary jones reacts to the fact that now it has become possible f our writers to come from anyplace young negroes old negroes as simply anonymous writers but writing about specific experiences which are informed by the place where they are by what this place has made them and where they came from he contendsthat whatever the expressions and experiences available the playwights most important obligation is to tell it all exactly like it is in a essay in hone on the revoltltionary theatre jones tries to say what that is and the freedom he once permitted black writers has vanished along with much of his style the revolutionary theatre should force change it should be change the revolutionary theatre must teach them whites thei deaths it must crack their faces open to the mad cries of the poor it must teach them about silence and the truths lodged there it must kill any god anyone names except common sense the revolutionary theatre should flush the fags and murders out of lincolns face one thing which stands apartfrom the rhetoric and confusion is the revolution ary playwrights clearly specified audience he chooses to write for black people in black neighborhoods in new york only weeks ago the cast of leroi jones slave ship walked off the stage of the theater in washington squa re methodist church because the location of the theater was not relevant to the black community the revolutionary playwright cannot assume though that the neighborhood community is a ready made audience bruce e million of detroit writing in black theatre no argues that in order to revolutionize the theater the composition of the theater audiencemust be radically changed and that audience recruitment is the central issue his detroit experience hasled him to some rather startling conclusions unless provision is made for compulsory subsidized theater with compulsory attendance the voluntary theater will remain a useless ornament decoration for the upper two percent that free theater like box office theater will change nothing its like bikinis to eskimos and that street theater is more romantic than good its like saying the culturally deprived should have deprived theater milliam is attacking some very popular notions but the most significant aspect of his attack is the radical position he adopts in response to the difficulties of attracting local black audiences a clear definition of a black audience does not create one and playwrights of the revolutionary theater have to deal with thisf act in the final analysis this examination has illuminated something of the complexities in the relationship between black audiences and black playwrights whether of the theater of the black experience or the theater of revolution despite these complexities the sixties have produced substance excitement and innovation not the least of which is the increasing number of young people even children coming into the theater as patrons and performers their interest in the sixties will become their commitment in the seventies the indispensible and firm basis for sustained growth in black theater on black theater in america he year was a kind of mixed bag for r devotees of black others were goin a buffalo which was too much like last years in the wine time the characters were it theater in new york the same defeated despairing types on the plusside there were more plays by and about black people than ever before including a few memorable ones which showed once again why black theater is really whats happening theatrically in america today among the top plays of the year was ed bullins we righteous bombers an overly long but righteous play dealing with the psychological and physical problems facing a group of black revolutionaries it was one of the most thought provoking productions of the season evoking heated debate in black circles for weeks after its opening this was one of three offerings at the harlem based new lafayette theater where bullins is playwright in residence the who pop up in most of bullins works there was also ritual which was a good idea gone astray i think it was designed to be a shared emotional experience between the performers and the audience but it was too contrived to be effective other top plays were slave ship a powerful and soul stirring work by leroi jones dealing with the horrors of american slavery and the deadening effectsit hashad on black people five on the black hand side a sometimes dragging but very together love comedy about a black family by charlie russell a black quartet four searing comments on black black and black white relations by jones bullins ben caldwell and ron milner and where its at a fast moving musical revue done by ernie mcclintocks afro american studio for acting and speech one of the most significant things about all these plays is that they were all written primarily for black audiences and though all were not revolutionary they dealt with issues and life styles of black people in this racist do minated society this past season also saw the closing of the great white hope after performances the pearl bailey led hello dolly troupe leaving broadway to go on the road and the continuing success of the rock musical h air with blacks in several key roles there was also the opening and closing of such plays as sambo the gingham dog the ofay watchers and buck white that one week fiasco which tried to exploit the presence of muhammad ali in the title role the last three mentioned were all unsuccessful attempts by white writers to deal with black folks on the negative side there was little progress in solving the financial woes of black theater except for we righteous bombers all the top plays opened in white i owned theaters black people have not responded in sufficient numbers to put the theater groups on a more secure financial ba se again i must say that this is partially the fault of black theater people themselves they are still too divided to coordinate their artistic and financial efforts for the maximum benefit of everyone instead of black theater goers being confronted with an at least tactically unified group they are besieged for support by a dozen small theater groups all seeking their allegiance sometimes by downing the character of those they consider their rivals black theater will never flourish this way one can only remember the dictum that necessity is the mother of invention and hope that necessity will eventually force the black theater groups into closer cooperation there were two more interesting developments on the new york theater scene this past year one was the continuing problems of the negro ensemble company nec which had the kind of season where nothing they did left any lasting impressions last year they gave us ceremonies in dark old men which had a long off broadway run after leaving nec but this year one had to check out old playbills to remember that they did man better man a musical by trinidadian playwrighterrol hill t the reckoning which dealt with a confrontation between a slick black pimp and a racist southern governor and the harangues which consists of four short plays by joseph walker their import did not extend much beyond the confines of the theater i nec which has received over one million dollars in ford foundation grants now claims to have run into financial problems announcin e via new york times ad that they are in desperate need of funds to continue their operations at the level of the past two years another new development this past year was the arrival of charles gordone and his widely hailed no place to be somebody white critics were ecstatic about it but many blacks have expressed misgivings about this work which is filled up with self loathing greenwich village negroes going through changes in their relationships with each other and their weirdo white friends playwright gordone who describes himself as par indian part french part irish and partnigger and ho wrote in the new york times that i believe the idea of black theatre is dead is obviously vriting about people he knows well they can still be seen in village hangouts no place is well written and the acting is superb nathan george as johnny williams gave the best acting performance i saw all year nevertheless black people had best beware while laughing at the dialogue and marvelling at the acting no place to be some bod is full of cold contempt for us nows the time to encourage everyone to support black theater with donations and by attending performances of groups such as movement black a dance theater group roger furmans new heritage theater the last poets anywhere you can catch them barbara ann teers national black theater workshop whose members are still concentrating on getting themselves together and whose sunday afternoon get togethers are a harlem highlight the ajass shows which are a must for anyone really interested in black culture since they are the pioneer group the community theatre of the harlem school of the arts the bed stuy playhouse and alonzo and the players two brooklyn groups while we are waiting for them to come together for the benefit of all we must continue to support them peter bailey you speak of the south and blackness r everyone outside of the c el south automatically assumes that south is far behind them but the south is not an arid wasteland things grow year round in the south especially if you take the time to tend to them the way things are supposed to be tended if you speak of black theater and mention the south most everyone outside of the south will laugh at you as if to say that new york is the only place that black theater really exists although if you push some of them they will readily admit that black theaters allegedly exist on the west coast and in chi t own but black theater is here too has been here for a long time it is amazing that in these years of black awareness people have ignored what is perhaps the area where black theater will find its strongest black audiences gilbert moses co founder and former artistic director of fst directed slave ship this summer along with two or three other plays as part of fsts summer program slave ship which played throughout louisiana and mississippi wasper formed in places where the name leroi jones not f assumes that south is to mention ameer baraka has rarely if ever been heard before the production was presented to audiences many of whom were seeing black theater for the first time in their lives the admission was free but who took notice of it no one except of course the black people in greenville mississippi who were ready to revolt after the performance was over and who were only reluctantly persuaded to go home and then there was the entire audience in west point missis sippi which rose to its feet waving fists and singing when we gonna rise up the song which is included at the end of every slave i ship performance and there was also the large gathering of sunday picnickers students and others who witnessed a performance on the lake pontchartrain shores in new orleans the same play that southern university refused to allow in its auditorium all who saw it got the message but the people who were supposed to be in the know said nothing at all about it and if you hadnt been there to see it happen then you would never have known it went down because there was never any coverage of it on the other hand now that the play has opened in a new york theater at a seat everyone is seeing it and talking about it the big diff erence however is that now slaveship is playing to paying audiences in new york and is being reviewed by all of the white critics and it is a pity that no one got a chance to see it when the people of the south saw it for then they would have seen a slaveship that could not possibly be seen in new york or anywhere else they would have seen a slaveship that the audience experienced not as if it were scenes of slavery from negro history but rather a play that the audience readily identified with as scenes from their lives or as one young black in west point said out loud as the slave driver was whipping the slaves i want to see you after the show but thats ju st the way it has always been and will continue to be for a long time to come it is ironic that though gilbert moses did a fine job of directing both versions of slaveship the people who are supposed to be in the know about black theater will remember only his new york work and not the magnificent production that really moved literally thousands of people in the south we need to reach out and link up with each other we need to stop being so cliquish and parochial in our attitudes about what black theater is the real vital black theaters exist where ever our people are during the summer and fall of the black mind jockeys the poets of blkartsouth fs ts writingacting workshop had the opportunity to perf orm from the east coast south carolina and floridato as f ar west assan antonio texas everywhere we went we found ready audiences and in many places we were pleased to find black community theaters developing the witersactors and artists of thesouth just asthose in the north and other sections of the country cannot do it alone we need the strength of all black hands working togetherwe will need more than the spot coverage which is too often all thatwe get we need more of our workpublished by the few black journals that now exist and also more recognition for the publications that we arenow producing therest of the country must begin to recognize that we the south are a force in black theater and we are we are by the simple fact that we are playing to masses of black people we are carrying the message to neople who have seldom seen or heard itbef ore we are speaking to audiencesthateagerly want to know what is going on we believe that the best way to buid a black theater is to work with our own people using as much original material as possible we believe in sparse non complicated sets with the emphasis on getting across the point of the play to the audience we believe that you cannot import theater we have had to learn this the hard way f or ultimately our theater should speak to the black community peopleto people rather than outsidertopeople we must build a black theater ourselves for certainly no one else can do it we will not become theater by rhetoric or by presenting f our or five new black plays a year we will not become theater just by wanting to become theater the writers of blkartsouth have produced some scripts in the last year of which six were produced by the theater these six were written by val ferdinand kush tom dent and sharon stockard if there is to be a black theater then the people must come together and produce it we must write our own scripts and direct our own shows and learn how to do everything else that is necessary to produce this theater we believe in a yea r round theater of actuality as opposed to a theater that exists for f esti vals and negro history week we in the south believe our work is as strong as that in any other black theater but the fact remains it does not matter how strong we are as individual theaters and groups of black artists unless we collect our strength it will amount to nothing the strength of blackness lies in the collective thrusts of diverse black forces if black theaters are to shake off the death grips of trojan horse white funding and the patronage of established and influential white critics we must produce a unified black theater movement and no matter how strong any single black theater is if we do not link up together there will be no black theater for our grandchildren to know i envision that if we want to we can show more brotherhood than we have up until now we can work closer together than we have up until now and we can in the very least communicate to each other what we are doing there is no reason in the world for us not to know of each others existence once we have begun to know and to recognize each other then we can get on with getting together our outlook for the year is to continue our work of developing an indigenous black theater we expect to be able to produce at least eight productions by the winter of the black mind jockeys will continue touring the country reading their work and they are always available for dates for more information call or write the free southern theater n miro st new orleans la our workshops in drama and writing which have proved to be very successful will continue as a permanent part of the theater program we will also include a variety of areas that are not strictly theater but that go hand in hand with our theater such as our black newspaper for the new orleans area the plain truth the development of black artists in our graphics workshop and the expansion of our journal of the black arts nkombo but more important than the work we are doing now is the need for all of us to begin to understand that black theater cannot grow unless we all grow we need each other to survive and thats all the seventies will be about for black people surviving if we survive this decade then we can say that we have done something that we have built something we can have black theater and anything else if we really want it and are willing to work together to erect it support black theater wherever it appears val ferdinand he voices have said that the white man would not care about the condition of watts after the revolt of the white man would tum his back what the hell you burnt it down you bad bad people now reap the rewards of your action and fortwo years it seemed as though the voices of hate were right programs flooded the area to last just long enough to raise hope and then plunged the despairing further into despair rumors ravaged the gullible talented young men were brainwashed destroyed forever there was a young man yes he is still alive but was is the correct word he was talented as a writer employed by a major studio the way to a new future opening up and then the voices of doom hate both black and white began to pull at this target it did not take long we as a people are unfamiliar with some subtleties of the outside world the voices said let the worst of the politicians win let them reach to their lowest level and then perhaps the rest of the nation the world will rise up in indignation and disgust any day a person might walk into the watts writers workshop and hurl his all too familiar challenge hey when you dudes gonna get that building you been talking about you know whiteys giving you a snow job dont you we didot know we could not allow it to be for the summer was coming and no matter what the papers said no matter what property was burned nothing compared to the lives that paid the price of a few days shouting to the world to hear us the man had been caught flat footed he had to hear us he had completely discounted the fire of dignity that pulsates in the guts of man even black men the heel of his boot had pressed so long so hard against the neck of the black man until it had gone to sleep and the man had been taken unaware but it would never happen again the blue and white armoured truck that carries and shields policemen would see to that the four cops to a patrol car the continually circling helicopter the nice new green sedan all these would see to that it seemed that the only things the cry of injustice had done was to awaken the oppressor to a more energetic form of oppression and to the people the fence surrounding them grew higher the guards stronger and more plentiful the voices of hate surer but there were those who did not allow this to make them lose their faith ithe humanity of man those both black and white who saw watts as a battlefield in which the words of man had to become real somehow someway the friendliness in eyes had to be turned into a definite object an act had to appear out of all the smiles and handshakes that would stand as absolute proof some people argued jobs thats the only way others education yet others culture and they were all right a place center workshop whatever you wish to call it where all of these things could be combined it was a natural the watts writers workshop was doing fine why not add a dance class an acting class why not a teacher of english and black history in one year we placed in college three young men who had no idea of the possibility of furthering their education a play big time buck white using one of our members in his first role went from the workshop to off broadway david moody is now in the musical version in san francisco other members have become television writers jeanne taylor has sold a script to tvs room odessa cleveland an actress has signed to tour europe in a tennessee williams play louise meriwether has sold her book and is t receiving offers from the movies mildred walter has sold her book lily of watts charles baireuther a new member has already made a sale of a short story and in a few days the acting class will be presenting new plays it was as though the entertainment industry had suddenly said now just a minute we are one of the foremost industries on the west coast and admit we are percent white it is not right it is not what america is all about and it is up to us to be among the first to change it image film television are a powerful convincer persuader we were a part of the makers of the black image we must help change it the studios came down and offered money but more than that knowledge individuals offered to teach classes it was hard at times the meeting of minds almost impossible but it happened a group called peoples inc came down hey you know there isnt a theater in watts we started to throw them out if we and watts watched and waited you cant get a permit for this was echoed so the council peoples inc and budd went to city hall sometimes we had calm meetings sometimes but the pernlit came and then the estimated figures began to soar if we skimp here no its got to be top shelf all the way needed now industry we called were not begging just open up the door and well do it ourselves new estimate hey man the voices asked yes the voices sounded a little different hey manwhats happening some of the once most vocal didnt know who the hell did they were a young group and the sincerity showed through hal stalmaster bob cohn bruce corwin and david zeitlin met with budd schulberg myself and the watts writers workshop council a film theatre in the workshop a great idea and so the concrete touchable object was born a place in watts for film to be shown no more eight to miletripswell wellwell bull the voices said its summer again here comes whiteys conbut things began to happen material began to arrive men carrying long rolled sheets of paper walked around the building and made figures in notebooks were now skeptical but silent something was happening not a whole world but it was happening the workshop began to overflow with talent looking for outlets and suddenly the industry discovered a new way of reaching talent we would like a goodlooking girl about to a young man of and a child of five can you help me could we help them ha they were almost to hollywood by now but what about the closed unions what about behind the cameras who is going to run the equipment in the watts theater set up training facilities its harder but the way is there and so it is going there are many more people i could name forty one members of the workshop not long ago worked in a picture halls of anger not a big deal to you but sometimes when a brother pa sses you pick up on that new look that new pride hey and you look proud too that is if you helped do it harry dolan whos got his own at cheyney by donald evans h eyney state college is a small school a few miles outside of philadelphia its student body spredomnantlyblak coming largely from the ghetto areas of philadelphia like most colleges today the student body at cheyney state is crying for more voice in school affairs they had been demonstrating for several years prior to my joining the faculty in one of their grievances centered around a need for more programs dealing with the black man and his peculiar situation in this country the administration had ears open so it seems but were slow to act and so the conflict reached a point of confrontation the young blacks against the system it was probably thought that more campus activities would occupy the students time and therefore alleviate some of the tensions whatever the reasons behind it i was hired to begin a drama program on cheyney s campus prior to my return to the school i had graduated f rom the institution in the early sixties the theater program was an annual play put on by an english class or the catch ascatch can drama society in the past they had served up a bill of things like beck et and m edea with an occasional foray into works like the bloodknot done im told in percent white face there were no lighting facilities no scenery and no costumes to give us a crawling start the auditorium doubled as classroom and general meeting room and was tightly scheduled in short we really had to build way in the back of my mind was the idea that cheyney state would become a good place for playwrights to try out new works and a theater devoted to the resurrection of seldom performed works by black playwrights it was already september and we still had not found a strong script to open with contacts with playwrights proved that the writers were being looked at by established companies or readying their plays for new york openings or connected with a group that promised immediate production for whatever they turned out or not interested in seeing the play done by a group of students one writer who had been produced in new york was so soured by the reaction of the critics that he no longer wished to see the work done whatever the reason we were in a bind earlier in the year i had met ronald milner at lincoln where he was writer in residence having had so many of my brothers close the door in my face i was somewhat dubious about approaching ron for permission to do whos got his own however hearing of my dilemma and anxious to find out about the reaction of an audience like cheyney he gave us the go ahead by this time we had already performed two plays in the series an old classic from and a little known work by a major writer rons play was definitely better than the second and asstrong as the first plus it was here now and relatively new it also turned out to be the most rewarding and exciting involvement of the year because it had somethingor rather several things that most of the new plays by black writerslack a definition of these unique qualities comes best through a description of the production from first reading to final performance first reading the first reading of whos got his own was approached with a bit more anxiety than usual i had worked with the performers on two productions already and had agood idea of their abilities i also knew that this play called for real acting there was no model for them to copy and we really had to create characters i wasnt sure that the actors were capable of examining themselves deep enough to find a germ on which to build the angry and frustrated people who lived in the world of the playtheir black ness alone told me that they had the experience but i wasnt certain that they had the skill to turn it into something creative and powerful additional uneasiness resulted from the fact that i knew ron mil ner personally and therefore had an increased desire to do justice to his play like most of the young playwrights i had talked to ron was very much concerned about the kind of production a college group might give whos got his own past experiences had proba bly lefta few negative impressions regarding the quality of work done in some schools my own group be ing new and never having tackled anything with the depth of whos got his own i was a bit tight myself especially since he had said he might get out to see the show the anxieties however did not last long as soon as the kids started reading the script i knew we were going to be okay we sadown around a table and did a dry read through a read through that was anything but drytwo pages into the play and the students had found some bit of the characters that came close to their own experiences the session was constantly interrupted as the students voiced their immediate reactions unlike the first sessions on the plays which preceded whos got his own these interruptions were not of the questioning kind they understood the motivations and nuances of the lines these young actors were commenting on their own lives and the similarity between the feelings of clara and tim and their own the session was becoming a kind of therapeutic talk session we were getting very close to each other comment getting together is extremely important in doing any play the cohesiveness of the company often makes exciting theatre of the most mediocre material and a loose company can make garbage of the best work imaginable one of the problems black groups have is finding a work they can really get together with doing works by non black playwrights do not give the actors the experience of delving deep into their emotional selves to find an element of truth for the black actor such plays are always classical in that they must be approached th r ough technique rather than psychological truth a good bit of the black actors training is therefore left out because he does not often have the chance to student actors margie barnes as clara and marilyn suiter as m ama in cheyney s p roduction of whos got his own by ronald milner go inside himself and use emotions as a basis for a characterization the problem is also presented in many of the works by black playwrights who concentrate so strongly on the argument of the play that they neglect to make the argument come from strong characters in dramatically moving situations to deal with a work that is totally propagandistic does not stretch the actor he must concentrate his efforts on the lines only a good playwright however realizes that a point can be made indelible through characterization one of the out standing qualities of whos got his own is that we react to the play because it presents us with p eople the ideas are one aspect of the total creative activity of the work realizing that he is tim jr a real live character an actor has only to make his equipment give formtothepersonin ordertomake the argument tangible so many of our revolutionary plays are mere harangues they do get the points across but the question is whether or not they give the argument any repeatable form to illustrate the point further one need only to look at big time buck white although this work is not by a black playwright it is perti nent here because it perfectly illustrates the result of a fusion of cultures white playwrights have long since lost their interest in plays of character they have concentrated their efforts on things best called theater pieces in these works the accent is on the how plays have been done in which the two characters are ping pong balls papier mache dolls and boxes none of these things have character the actor then must rally around the idea or the image at best these works have a temporary impact they are temporary because people react to people big time buck white is mid way between the old fashioned people plays and the new see it plays because buck white is more a thing than a character he represents an idea but is without a history as a person our involvement then is totally surf ace we can take home the argument we can even groove to the conception of the role but we do not store big tim among our cast of memorable people of the theater he is an idea not made tangible by character the therapeutic first session of our production of whos got his own was exciting because we had found peop le who turned us on like real life characters they presented us with possibilities rather than answers few black writers present young actors with such indepth characters after the initial reading it was obvious that the actors were committed to the play and would hustle to work out its problems the big problem in act dealt with the characterizations for the churchmen not having a history and not really moving throughout the act there was very little to hold onto surely we knew black ministers and this would help define attitude and rhythm for the characters we also knew however that there is no such thing as a ministe type except for the stereotypical things presented through the mass media were these men who worked the store front church like those in james baldwins amen corner or were we dealing with the sophisticated college trained big edifice minister in the middle class church the lines worked both ways we knew that we couldnt strain the idea of the ministers piety too much for fear of ending up with a docile purlie victorius the fact that the deacons had little to say was not a boon like the minister they required a totally creative approach we had to make a world for them to operate in outside that of the play except that they provided an extension of tim anger they were really extaneous and we felt that the scene would have been tighter with the three characters fused into one the only other choice was to risk the danger of creating three cliches comment one of the great dangers in dealing with black drama is the natural tendency toward the cliche this is somewhat different from creating stereotypical characters in that it is based on the idea that the black actor or director knows all about the character because he has encountered the type before the point of honesty in interpretation lies in the shared experience of the playwright and the actor i director thestereoty pe however assumes that what is seen is truth both premises lead to uninteresting characterizations they do so because neither will result in the depiction of a person the problem is a very minor one in whos got his own but many of the new plays are based solely on this kind of cliche we are presented with a young militant or a mother and that alone is supposed to be enough to define the rest of the relationship the ont positive aspect to this kind of writing is that it gives the director a degree of freedom not experienced when the characters are fully drawn the play can be played differently six million times but without ever approaching a definitive or genuinely moving conception of the work shorter plays often present us with cliches merely because they are short and time does not permit an in depth characterization act ii is by far the most compelling section of whos got h is own it is probably so because it presents us with very definite movement clara tim jrs sister carries the act and the action carries her we begin with a small girl who so we think has been naughty but we end with a full grown woman wrestling with very severe identity problems tim also moves a great deal in this act at the beginning he is a cocky angry and vengef ul man very self assured and seemingly on top of the situation by the end of the scene however he is probably the most confused member of the f amily and as we later find out on his way toward manhood it is only mama who stands still yet there is ample opportunity for growth in this character she has gained new knowledge knowledge which could possibly have shaken all supports from a weaker character it is mama who has the very strong curtain speech which implies that it is her development that we should surely have noted we found it difficult to get to the end of the act with the smoothness we desired because of structural elemen ts in act ii we saw it as being a solo by clara which became a duet by clara and tim and ended in a solo by mama the problem seemed to be that in order for mamas final solo to be effective the theme character had to be introduced and reinforced throughout the act in short mama was far too passive in the early scenes of act ii for her powerful final speech to be the result of gathering power we instead are given two thirds of clara or tim jr what are you saying this was the only section of the play that gave us any line difficulty because of the repetition of lines showing mamas confusion the interplay between clara and tim works beautifully because of milners skill with language the actor does not have to pl ay at being angry or cutting he just has to read the lines the power and passion of the lines in act ii are increased because they perf ectly define character and condition the words are the words of clara and tim the playwright does not become cute and write in literary cliches or try to win the profanity race but instead gives us a scene without a single dishonest or extraneou s word comment there is a great difference between writing language that is ethnically honest and writing dialogue that moves and defines a dramatic situation in attempting to create for the stage the language of black people many of our playwrights have overlooked the fact that all language must be refined c and selected if there is to be any kind of artistic concern present to take a street corner conversation and duplicate it without change on stage would not necessarily result in the creation of an interesting scene it takes the skill of a playwright to organize and refine the language and to support it with meaningful action stage language is a depiction of real conversation but it is not real in that the playwright hones away all of those things which do not communicate but are a part of each persons individual idiosyncracies with the rise of improvisational theater the playwright has lost some of his artistic control language has become less important than the image following this trend many of our revolutionary playwrights have attempted to record the scripts of some of the street comer action interesting for their realism but they are not plays they are transcripts of an action the untouched language of the spontaneous improvisation has an immediate impact but cannot stand up for repeated performances the problem probably has to do with would he look better in a sweater and chinos with a science book under his arm what happened to transform the american dream into a potential nightmare the answer to that question will depend of course upon the answer erthe run of the

woodson a man of impressive scholarship he opened the rich vein of the black past from until his death in his pathbreaking work as author editor and publisher provided the base from which others could operate but woodson himself was indebted spiritually at least to a host of th century black leaders who had sounded a call for a revitalized study of afroamerican history all the present rests on the past said frederick douglass in in addressing a washington d c audience honoring him on his st birthday in james mccune smith like douglass a reformer called for an effort to place on the record a true account which the blacks now bear to this republica concise statement of the facts embodied in their resistance an elevation against odds sufficient to crush any ordinary variety of human species unless this were done wrote smith the grief among future scholars would match that of the ancient savants at the loss of the alexandrian library like other black leaders of the th century douglass and smith did not believe in reading history for historys sake to them the uses of history were of a more practical nature history as they saw it was an instrument it enabled one to understand the present thus suggesting a course of action furthermore to these black leaders of an earlier day a knowledge of history was useful in terms of their hopes for the future to go somewhere they felt was easier if one knew that he had come from somewhere they did not subscribe to the lachrymose concept of afroamerican history as nothing but an unending tale of persecution and suffering moreover they felt that a study of history would help in promoting racial selfrespect history rightfully told would refute the charges that blacks were inferior as never before or since the charge that black americans had no history and that africa had an unstoried past dominated the thinking of white americans of precivil war days aware of negro slavery in the south they tended to think that negro and slavery were synonymous reflecting the cultural arrogance of the western world during the th century they thought of themselves as civilized and of africans as barbarians black leaders rejected these views their protests grew louder with the coming of black weeklies the first of these appearing in followed three years later by the inauguration of the colored convention movement the latter was a coming together generally once a year of negro leaders with racial advancement their aim it was natural that the new colored organizations would come to the defense of africa extolling their old world forebears we claim to be the offspring of a parentage that once for their excellence of attainment in the arts literature and science stood before the world unrivalled so ran one of the resolutions adopted by the colored convention of this refrain of ancient african glory was echoed by any number of black speakers and writers africa was the garden and nursery where learning budded and education sprang orated david nickens at a fourth of july celebration held at the chillicothe ohio african methodist episcopal church in william g allen a journalist and later a college teacher prepared a public lecture entitled the origin and history of the africans according to a reporter who attended his lecture at the old south church in danvers massachusetts in april mr allen commenced with the somewhat startling assertion that africans originated the arts and sciences and gave the first impulse to civilization the reporter was impressed by allens irrefragable proof comparing him favorably with george bancroft greatest of the american historians seeking information on early africa lectureminded amos g beman a clergymanreformer addressed a letter on april to the great dictionary compiler noah webster then but a month from his death the learned lexicographer fired back a preemptory report of the woollyheaded africans who constitute the principal part of the inhabitants of africa there is no history and there can be none that race has remained in barbarism since the first ages of the world undeterred by websters reputation beman drafted a lecture on the origin and history of the african race as a home agent for the american missionary association beman delivered this lecture to black audiences throughout new england other leaders who joined in the movement to reclaim africa included samuel ringgold ward martin r delany and jeremiah b sanderson where is the history of the negro lamented clergyman ward in i think we need not despair he added for we have our glorious fatherland africafar superior to the proud and abuseful anglosaxon which is saying very little in the versatile delany journalist student of medicine and subsequently niger river explorer army major and reconstruction politicianwrote that africa was destined to rise in the majesty of ancient grandeur in a later book delany cited herodotus and diodorus siculus as proof that the world was indebted to early egypt and ethiopia for the propagation of religion philosophy arts science and literature which now illuminate the world in similar vein jeremiah b sanderson assured a stockton california audience that to african blood and mind we owed the sphinx the pyramids the greek alphabet and the popular mythology of greece and rome a fluent speaker with a love of learning sanderson was the foremost black educator in california in the late s organizing schools and teaching black historys early advocates did not ignore the home scene the role of american blacks who had stood out from the crowd few negro newspapers did not at some time or another recount the bittersweet story of phillis wheatley the slave girl who became a poet in writing about her some newspapers reproduced the letter which george washington had addressed to miss phillis from cambridge massachusetts on february others who might be signalled out by the black journals included benjamin banneker the mathematician and surveyor lemuel haynes learned pastor to white churches richard allen key figure in the founding of the african methodist episcopal church denmark vesey slave insurrection plotter and nat turner the most familiar of all to readers black or white historyminded blacks constantly called attention to the contribution that africanamericans had made in americas wars a colored convention held in detroit in took note of the war of in which black men had shown themselves to be valiant soldiers at the battle of new orleans a convention of new york state blacks meeting at albany on august declared that the splendid naval of achievements on lakes erie and champlain in that war were owing mostly to the skill and prowess of colored men black valor in the revolutionary war was a theme dear to afroamerican readers of history hence they hailed william c nells colored patriots of the american revolution published in nell whose father had been a steward on the general gadsden during the war of broke new ground in his book although he did not confine himself to the revolutionary war the book impressed the scholartheologian theodore parker who recommended it highly to historian george bancroft when you publish your next volume wrote parker to bancroft i hope you will send nell a copy negroes get few honors nells book had opened with the story of crispus attucks in the boston massacre the first to dieon the eventful march when the british soldiers fired into the crowd attucks had won a tragic fame that blacks would keep green in memory military companies in cincinnati and new york took the name attucks guards in a group of boston blacks led by nell petitioned the state legislature to appropriate money for a monument to attucks but with no success in boston blacks in protesting the dred scott decision held a crispus attucks day at faneuil hall with the banners and flags decorating the walls the singing groups with stirring airs and the impassioned speakers the affair was memorable crispus attucks day would be observed every subsequent year in boston until after the ratification of the fifteenth amendment in among the admirers of attucks was young john a copeland jr one of the black john brown raiders captured at harpers ferry in october as he sat in the charlestown jail awaiting the hangmans noose copeland thought that he saw a relationship between harpers ferry and the boston massacre at the beginning of the revolution wrote copeland in a letter to a friend the first blood spilt for freedom was that of crispus attucks and in the commencement of the struggle for the freedom of the negro slave the first blood spilt was that of a negro one who had come to try andfree his wife from the cruel hand of her master dangerfield newby black achievers and the black past were the themes of two nineteenth century blacks who were themselves historymakers in former slave william wells brown abolitionist and literary light published the black man his antecedents his genius and his achievements opening with an essay asserting that blacks had been leaders of civilization at certain periods of history brown presented a series of brief biographies these included ira aldridge the greatest shakespearean actor of his day and seven haitians including toussaint louverture a far more ambitious book a twovolume work was produced by george washington williams a manysided man at one time or another a civil war sergeant major ordained minister lawyer journalist politician and diplomat in williams produced his history of the negro race in america a creditable effort encouraged by its success williams in brought out a lengthy book on the black troops in the civil war distressed at the dearth of information on black history williams wrote a letter to the new york globe published in its issue on june proposing that an american negro history society be organized societies with a combination literaryhistorical outlook had existed among blacks since but they were local rather than regional or national the williams proposal was hailed by black emigrationist henry m turner who called it a grand conception a south carolina weekly new era voiced a hearty concurrence it is time that the negro had a literature but a national black history organization would have to await the th century coming in with the association for the study of negro life and history the new century would also bring other changes in africanamerican history notably in the calibre of writers and the widening of the clientele nineteenth century blacks who wrote history were men who as we have seen busied themselves in a variety of fields and occupations they did not profess to be professionally trained historians brown never intended as he said himself that his book should be considered as a history of our people williams had no formal training in the writing of history although from his extensive readt ing and his many contacts he had writes john hope franklin doubtless caught some of the new scientific spirit with the exception of williams and to a lesser extent of nell these early writers of black history did not bother to furnish their sources this tendency to dispense with formal documentation sometimes led them to claim more than the evidence would support moreover these writers lived during a spreadeagle era one given to bombastic and exaggerated language and this general proclivity for overstatement sometimes crept into their style writers of black history in the th century were as to be expected better trained in the discipline they wedded excavation to exhortation many of them devoted their entire careers to history teaching or writing moreover they tended to view black history as something not to be known by blacks alone but by whites also they believed that to the extent to which white people knew little or nothing about the historic role of their black countrymen to that extent they were living in a makebelieve world of the past indeed the blackrelated areas and aspects of american history loom so large and significant that today it is not surprising that many able white scholars have increasingly turned their attention to that rich lode nineteenth century exponents of black history were moved by a need centering largely within the black community the th cen tury practitioners shared this overriding concern but added to it a belief that white people too should be exposed to the liberating effect of black history perhaps a viewpoint that links the old and the new was expressed in a pamphlet a knowledge of history is conducive to racial solidarity written in by charles victor roman a doctor of medicine of philosophy and of law the negro never made any history because if anybody made history he was not a negro wrote roman i am not for preaching ethnic antagonism nor endeavoring to give a racial tinge to the facts of history but i do wish to widen the fields of taught history to include negroes who justly belong there the fight to reclaim african history by john henrik clarke he confrontation and the conflict that i am referring to did r v y not start at montreal for over ten years black scholars inj ii r terested in african studies have questioned white academic domination over this area of study black scholars were the w pioneers in this field and their formal interest and work goes back to the early part of the nineteenth century in an article african studies in the united states that i wrote for the aprilmay issue of africa report i called attention to the serious questions that some afroamericans are asking about the role of white africanists in the new african studies programssome of these questions are why are so many americans now studying about africa why are most of them white americans why are there so few black americans in decision making positions in present day african studies programs in light of the prevailing american attitude toward africa mainly negative before the freedom and independence exploration what is the basis of white americans interest in africa now these questions often asked but never answered motivated the formation of a black caucus at the eleventh annual conference of the african studies association in los angeles california in october the caucus was called by dr p chike onwuachi director of africancaribbean studies center fisk university nashville tennessee among those participating in the formation of the caucus were michael searles and nicholas onyewu federal city college washington d c lenard jeffries columbia university john h clarke associate editor freedomways nell painter san jose college jean douglass of new york city and shelby faye lewis of southern university baton rouge louisiana after several meetings of the caucus and one with the executive board of african studies association the following statement was issued the african studies association is called upon by the black caucus to immediately direct its energies towards rendering itself more relevant and competent to deal with the challenging times and conditions of black people in africa in the united states and in the whole of the black world in moving towards this objective we charge the association with taking the steps necessary to immediately broaden black participation in all phases of the associations operations we note that at present only one black person is holding a policydeciding position in this association dealing with predominately black countries and societies too few of the program chairmen and participants are drawn from black africanists and in general the association reflects the white caste and is identified with a white posture while trusting the academicians in the association we urge that black people be recruited for participation in the african studies association and that representation be drawn from those engaged in fields closely related to african and afroamerican studies with particular emphasis on black youth inside and outside the universities we see the future prospects of a vital and meaningful association linked directly to the significant strengthening of its ties with black africanists we encourage asa members to seek out african and afroamerican scholars to direct the rapidly developing afroamerican studies centers in the united states finally the asa must address itself in a meaningful and educational way to changing american public opinion based on deep racism and ignorance about the black people when the african studies association takes as its subjects the statement of the black caucus was discussed after it was read to the group by michael searles and submitted to the board of african studies association the result was that an ad hoc committee of the asa was created to inquire into the possibility of implementing the demands of the black caucus it was decided that a meeting would be held in new york during the christmas holidays john h clarke was chosen by the group to organize this meeting michael searles of washington d c was chosen to be acting chairman john h clarke chaired the new york meeting in the absence of michael searles who could not attend the following topics were discussed the organizations structure its legal status its formal officers its role as a clearing house for information relating to african studies its functions framework and its goals the financial backing of the association association membership and recruitment of members the permanent location of its secretariat the proposed name of the caucus and the feasibility of publishing dr nicholas onyewu suggested that the caucus consider holding its next meeting at federal city college in washington d c after an official invitation from the president of federal city the meeting was set for june through june the washington meeting ibrought the african heritage studies association into being the main findings and recommendations of this meeting are as follows report of the committee on relations with african studies association and other groups and organizations relationship with the african studies association afroamericans and africans should be given a role in the decijsionmaking process of the african studies association that is africans and afroamericans should be placed on all decisionmaking comimittees of the asa the black caucus of the asa should be consulted about appointments of afroamericans and africans to the executive comtmittee of the asa the asa should use its good offices to sponsor black scholars for fellowships increasing shares of money especially in the fields of history and archaeology should go to black scholars and preference should be given to black scholars until a better balance of whiteblack scholars in the field is achieved since the asa has power to influence the direction of funds in african studies this influence should be used to direct funds to black scholars and black institutions special effort should be made to include blacks in the program planning of the asa representation should come directly from the black caucus every effort should be made to appoint blacks as fellows of the asa moreover the asa should recruit in black universities for students who are interested in african studies the african heritage association should aid these black universities by providing them with program ideas for black studies as well as consultants materials and lecturers black universities should encourage their scholars to participate in the black caucus of the asa the association should encourage black institutions to convene conferences for the study and evaluation of materials submitted to them on black studies predominately black colleges should be encouraged to assume leadership positions and feeder positions for elementary and secondary schools with respect to the dissemination of materials and the teaching of african studies black scholars at these colleges should be encouraged to lend or give their materials to public schools and to play a more direct role in the structuring of african programs for public schools it was decided that our immediate objective should be the formation of committees and subcommittees to facilitate as rapid progress as possible in our getting started these committees are to embody our main objectives for the association which include publication education and communication generally under publication it was decided that of vital importance would be the starting of a newsletter in order to get ourselves moving fast to inform others interested in the field and to keep up on the rapidly changing scene in black studies tied to the newsletter would be the drawing up of a register of black scholars in the field it was also recommended that we start a black studies journal sponsored by ahsa as soon as possible to be published by a strong commercial publisher to be decided upon later the educational function was discussed in terms of the need for the following for black people to have control over our own history its interpretation etc to challenge the arrogance of white scholars to define our history for us to set up a clearing house of information in black studies aiding in our evaluations of programs literature etc and to open up opportunities for black scholars who present scholarly papers at seminars symposiums etcall facilitating intelligence and communication among black africanists also the need was expressed for setting up a selected list of black consultants in the field to guard against selfcontrol exploitation in the field that would be detrimental to black studies and black scholars in this field other objectives include the need to reach african countries directly through embassies to facilitate greater communication and interaction between africans and afroamericans a meeting was planned between the executive committee of african heritage studies association and asa for october in montreal canada the purpose of this meeting was to define the future relationship between ahsa and asa this meeting carefully planned far in advance never took place other events ruled it off the agenda these events forced the members of african heritage studies association to move ahead of their own schedule and become the official spokesman for the black intellectuals in montreal canada during the th annual conference of asa part of the confusion at montreal was due to the fact that the main aims and objectives of ahsa had not been made known to any appreciable number of the attending black intellectuals who could have explained these objectives to the students had these objectives been known the revolt against the domination of the conference by white scholars might still have occurred but it is my opinion that this revolt would have been more orderly and constructive for the record the main aims and objectives of the african heritage studies association are stated here education reconstruction of african history and cultural studies along afrocentric lines while effecting an intellectual union among black scholars the world over acting as a clearing house of information in the establishment and evaluation of a more realistic african or black studies program presenting papers at seminars and symposiums where any aspect of the life and culture of the african peoples are discussed relating interpreting and disseminating african materials to elementary and secondary schools colleges and universities international to reach african countries directly through embassies in order to facilitate greater communication and interaction between africans and africans in the americas to assume leadership in the orientation of african students in the u s and orientation of afroamericans in africa establish contacts to form a committee to monitor american foreign policy towards africa to strengthen and support congressman charles diggs mich as chairman of the house subcommittee on african affairs domestic to inform all other black associations and organizations of the existing responsibilities in the area of black studies to solicit their influence and affluence in the promotion of black studies and in the execution of ahsa programs and projects to arouse social consciousness and awareness of these groups toussaint louverture black liberator by lawrence p crouchett oussaint louverture was described by alphonsede beauchamp as one of the most remarkable men in an age rich in remarkable men this was the same age when the names of such men as george washington thomas jefferson benjamin franklin william pitt talleyrand and napoleon bonaparte were on the lips of all western men this black haitian slave led the first successful black revolution in the western hemisphere his military and political genius saved the united states from possible french and british invasionat a time when she was militarily weak by lawrence p crouchett and opened the way for the u s to later purchase the louisiana territory france had successfully colonized and exploited the lands of saint domingue toussaints homeland in the west indies and had developed it into the largest producer of cotton cocoa indigo coffee tobacco and sugar cane in the western hemisphere at one time the colony imported and exported twothirds of all frances commerce by the eve of the black insurrection this colony alone supplied the sugar coffee and cotton to half of europe and was second to great britain in receiving the exported products of the united states toussaint and his warriors success delayed alleged british and french plans to invade the united states via the louisiana territory the british had long sought to retake her lost colonies and napoleon aspired to build a global empire instead of expressing their gratitude americans of that era saw these blacks victory as a threat to their continued enslavement of blacks in the southern united states now they lived in dread of another toussaint louverture rising among their slaves to them the success of the haitian black revolutionists could serve as a catalyst to inspire and encourage more slave insurrections in the slave states many of the democratic gains made in the french revolution began to spread to the inhabitants of saint domingue white colonists and mulattoeswhose only common bond was propertybecame allies and began to make new demands on the local colonial government the french assembly further antagonized the white colonists by passing legislation granting additional civil_rights to the mulattoes placing them on a more equal basis with the whites who feared these democratic tendencies might spread to the colonys black slaves soon the whites and their allies of property began to agitate for the colonys independence from france the french governor of saint domingue and his ruling party became restless over this agitation during the summer of the loss of the colony could retard napoleons plans to build a great colonial empire greater than his european rivalsgreat britain and spain to put down the growing agitation they took a cue from techniques used by the french third estates in obtaining concessions from the king the governor and his followers decided to stage a mock slave insurrection through this they honed to frighten the white colonists in particular into realizing their dependency upon the mother country france and their inability to put down any slave rebellion or even to con tinue subjecting the blacks to slavery without outside help being well respected by both planters and fellow slaves toussaint was approachedby representatives of the governmentto lead a mock rebellion for his role in the socalled rebellion he was guaranteed his freedom but not until the colonial government forces had defeated him and his fellow insurrectionists further all undeserved whipping of slaves was to cease and all slaves were to be granted an additional free day a week for their participation it was emphasized that collective emancipation was not part of the bargain the black slaves were to begin their revolt by prearranged signals from the french colonial officials both sides agreed on the night the revolt was to begin and toussaint agreed to lead this mock rebellion on the night of august the revolt began as planned but within a few hours of makebelieve the blacks saw an opportunity to settle old scores with their cruel masters and their mulatto cohorts the white colonists were shocked but the french officials were doubly shocked when more than blacks launched a real insurrection against the white colonists toussaint however hesitated in joining the real revolt he knew of the many abortive attempts made in the past and he was convinced that a real revolt would be futile so he remained on his masters farm for more than a month in october after seeing that his family was safely across the frontier into the spanish colony he joined the revolution within months he rose from doctor of sanitation to general of the armies toussaints father was the son of an african chieftain of the arada tribe who was captured near dahomey west africa and sold into slavery he was sent to saint domingue where he was purchased by jesuit priests who taught him to read and write the father and his family were converted to catholicism and remained so throughout the revolution toussaint was born around always of short stature and physically thin he was assigned to guarding cattle and serving as a stable boy during these assignments his father taught him to read and write as well as to reflect upon his servile conditions these lonely assignments allowed him time to read and digest caesars commentaries and roman historyfrom which he learned most of his political and military techniques his effective leadership for the blacks freedom resuited from repeated readings of abbe raynals history of the indies in this book toussaint first read raynals warning to european nations that your slaves will break the yoke that weighs upon them the negroes only lack a leader during the black revolt france convinced spain to retrocede louisiana to her hoping to use the territory to break saint domingues dependency upon the united states wars with great britain and later the united states had made france realize her dependency upon u s commerce for the colonys survival conversely the united states not only acknowledged saint domingues commercial value but also its military value to both the british and french the colony could be used as a stepping stone to the u s mainland too the new england states exported over percent of their products to saint domingue and from which they imported most of their rum and molasses on the eve of the black rebellion the united states and saint domingue had not only become commercially but also militarily interdependent the united states certainly had a stake in the outcome of this black revolution its occurrence postponed napoleons plan to occupy the louisiana territory thus saving this country by may toussaint and his armies had joined with the french colonial armies against the white colonists seizing this as an opportunity the french directory pleaded with toussaint to join them in an invasion of louisiana his suspicion of the french and determination to complete the war for the blacks freedom caused him to recognize this diversionary tactic by the french instead he secretly negotiated a treaty with the u s and great britain in exchange for special naval and commercial help from his new allies he assured them he would not send an expedition against their possessions it was this refusal to join the french at this time that allowed the united states time to negotiate the purchase of louisiana thus denying france a foothold on the u s mainland this treaty also assured u s much needed trade relations with saint domingue failing to defeat toussaint and his brave black warriors napoleon gave up his plans for louisiana and offered to sell it to the united states for unintentionally toussaint louverture aided the u s in acquiring the louisiana territory which doubled the countrys territorial areamoving the western boundary from the mississippi river to the rocky mountains the u s conversely contributed to the success of this first black revolution by continuing commercial trade with the blacks throughout their insurrection knowing that slavery would be restored if they failed in their revolt the blackswithout the leadership of toussaint who had been tricked by the french general charles leclerc captured and sent to france for imprisonment continued their rebellion until success came in october when the colony declared its independence from france to emphasize their complete break with the french and memories of their enslavement the blacks renamed the colony haiti the original indian name for the island haiti became the second republic in the new world the u s having become the first in it also has the distinction of being the only country in the western hemisphere to credit its independence based upon the revolution of black african slaves ironically the united states after having contributed to the independence of haiti withheld official recognition of it as an independent country until after she too became involved in a civil war over the same issue the enslavement of black people study in black brown and beige by leslie b rout jr youre like me youve probably read gilberto freyre or j ir frank tannenbaum or watched a couple of cbs reports j ii paged through holiday or some comparable journal per ap s y u ve talked to a brazilian or two if youve done any w of these things you know already that no racial problems exist in brazil maybe the brazilian you talked to was more discreet he would then have informed you that there is less racial discrimination in brazil than any place else in the world as the story is usually told unlike the anglosaxons who set up shop at jamestown or plymouth rock the portuguese gentlemen who migrated to the new world had significantly fewer qualms about nighttime integration the result was that in addition to the obvious black slaves and white masters there appeared an increasing myriad of colored persons who were part of both but not really of either accordingly and this is in keeping with the legend the brazilians adopted the converse of the formula adopted by the anglosaxons where the english settled any measure of negro blood made you a negro in brazil any discernible quantity of white blood made you at least a pardo mulatto ultimately it was probably very much a question of what one could get those higher up in the pecking order to believe sfc sfc in todays united states of america where racial troubles can no longer be swept under the carpet the brazilian legend exercises a peculiar influence for afroamericans such as this writer brazil beckons as a kind of tropical shangrila as a friend once put it man after i make my pile here then im splitting for coffeeland when i can enjoy it others wonder how a nation which maintained slavery until may where illiterates possibly outnumber literates and where political democracy can hardly be said to have taken giant strides could do what the gringo goliath could not satisfy the hopes and aspirations of its nonwhite citizens this story really begins the second time i saw walt disneys saludo amigo there was jose carioca and lots of samba and seemingly a country where the living was easy rather than hectic then there was black orpheus lots of samba and a plenitude of carnival more important orpheus although a lowly bondes streetcar driver seemed to possess a peculiar kind of personal security in the land of the anglosaxon without identification signs as big as life senator brooke of massachusetts andor congressman william dawson of illinois are like george washington jones of birmingham alabama niggers to be kept in their place afroamericans in the land of uncle sam are acutely aware of their dependence upon whitey lock stock and credit card orpheus was black like me and so poor he could hardly have afforded a free lunch yet his view of himself as a functioning member of the brazilian body politic gave him a kind of quiet support black yankees cannot achieve cadillac or no cadillac education or no education orpheus felt he belonged afroamericans do not believe they do in june the paul winter sextet of which i was a member won the intercollegiate jazz festival held at georgetown university as fortune would have it somebody in washington dc noticed that the six members of the group were split evenupthree blacks and three whites could you have dreamed of a better combination to send on a governmentsponsored tour of latin american colleges and universities a sevenmonth tour was dropped into our laps secretly i resolved that if brazil resembled the land of orpheus jose carioca tannenbaum and gilberto freyre it must eventually open its arms to a new immigrant me la arriving in porto alegre may the first thing i tended to notice was that brancos in brazil found nothing strange about fraternizing with negroes one saw pretos and pardos frequently but as my portuguese was limited to such terms as macanudo and the usual unprintable terminology you always seem to learn first it was nearly impossible to communicate with them exceedingly noticeable on the campuses of the universities and in the theaters was the absence of negroes at sextet concerts whites i questioned assured me that although the concerts were free most afrobrazilians were of the lower economic classes and rarely attended affairs where middle and upper class senhores predominated previous experiences in south america had convinced me that some kind of class system would be found everywhere the explanations given were logical but in my opinion insufficient somehow or another i had to meet a few pretos and get their side of the story jazz musicians meet their counterparts wherever they seem to go in the world and with the music as a medium friendships are forged through cepu a black tenor saxophone player i met in a rio nightclub i finally met some pretos who spoke english speaking directly to the gentlemen both of whom were musicians i remarked that none of the black members of the sextet had encountered any incidences of discrimination in brazil one of the brazilians smiled and said things are not as they seem they are more subtle here this was to be inkling number one you might say in this regard probably the most interesting character i would meet was a young negro from omaha nebraska named bill waters waters had decided to take one year off go to brazil and see whether he wanted to move there permanently when i met him his stay in rio had exceeded ten months he stated that while he liked brazil it had not been the racial nirvana hed hoped to find indeed he was amazed at the ease with which the black members of the sextet moved among rios social elite he later confided in me that he felt certain that the prestige of the department of state opened doors otherwise hermetically sealed at the time i was enjoying myself to such a degree that waters reservations seemed sour grapes the whole issue reemerged about three months later when bill stopped in chicago on his way to omaha having just returned to the usa i threw a small party and invited waters afterwards he remarked you know les i saw more integration here tonight than i saw in twelve months in brazil what he really meant was miscegenation and secretly i had to admit that while everywhere in brazil one sees pardos had seen precious little intermingling on a social level admittedly it was the pretos you saw pushing the brooms but the witness of my own adventures as a musical diplomat in sambaland were afroamericans and early panafricanism by clarence g contee ie of the very important strands of the many threads that go to weave the whole cloth of african nationalism is called panafricanism the history of panafricanism before is largely the story of the dedicated and unselfish efforts made by new world negroes especially those of the united states to them panafricanism meant the protest of oppressive and exploitative conditions of negroes all over the world they saw a need for unity among these brothers and kin as a tactic for pressure to get these conditions changed they believed that even though black africa was being conquered selfdetermination and independence would inevitably return to the people there it was believed very deeply that equal treatment of negroes with whites was related to these pur by clarence g contee poses of panafricanism the first official use of the term panafrican grew out of the panafrican conference of which was held in london and attended by thirtytwo delegatesmainly new world negroes among those who attended was a young harvard phd graduate web du bois it has been generally conceded that the panafrican conference of was the brain child of henry sylvesterwilliams a young negro from trinidad living at that time in london it was he who did most of the work to convene the conclave but the sentiment for black unity for the protest of the depressing conditions of negro life everywhere and the hope for a strong and powerful african state or empire run by negroes were not new in t thomas fortune a negro editorpublisher of the new york age a negro weekly made a speech at the congress on africa held in atlanta georgia at the gammon theological seminary his speech called for the nationalization and the unification of africa under black rule the bible predicted it he concluded he claimed in that it was he who gave the idea for the panafrican meeting to henry sylvesterwilliams who was visiting the united states in the late s one thing is clear williams received the support of booker t washington who knew t thomas fortune there was a haitian diplomat benito sylvain who also claimed that he had thought of the idea of calling together leading negroes of the world at the turn of the century difficult years although the origin of the pan african conference is in doubt the same is not true of the motives for the meeting the late s were a particularly difficult set of years for blacks everywhere the cult of white supremacy was constructing its temples in the united states with federal and state laws european nations were busy bringing by force western civilization and culture to the backward and inferior blacks in africa a natural calamity added to the woes of the black british west indians as the negroes were receiving the new ways they were losing their freedom their land and their resources therefore there was a general need almost a compulsion for negroes to look to themselves and their liberal white friends for support and to protest the blatant abuses of the premises that all men were created equal and entitled to selfdetermination and some control over their own destinies but the methods of protest and unity were traditional most of the early black and white protestors were moderates who believed in peaceful and gradual change through the accepted methods revolution was not the vehicle for these individuals from to there was no real panafrican movement despite the pronounced aims of the panafrican conference of to establish one but the idea of the rise of panafricanism as a movement for unified pressure by the black world and for eventual self determination for africans especially those in africa the homeland remained very much alive the leadership shifted more than ever into the hands of negroes in the united states the hope was there that a strong and effective panafrican movement could be developed booker t washington remembered the panafrican conference and in called for another meeting it was at this juncture that fortune claimed he was the originator of the idea for the assembly in at tuskegee alabama a meeting was held but it was a typical booker t washington gathering very few sentiments of african nationalism and few words of protest emerged his meeting was dominated by white missionaries who accepted the accommodation philosophy the only visible effort made by the followers of du bois was the shortlived panafrican department in of the niagara movement yet africans and du bois wrote of their hope for a second and more vibrantly sustained panafrican movement restructuring map when world war i began du bois an afroamerican leader and the anticipated successor to the throne of the deceased booker t washington took the lead in trying to use the territorial changes of the war and the selfdetermination principle as opportunities to promote african nationalism and the restructuring of the african map into large african states he won the support of the naacp an organization he helped found and for which he worked as editor of its organ the crisis with the financial and psychological support of the naacp he pushed his campaign into the significant revival of the movement at the panafrican congress in paris during the peace conference he aimed to exert pressure on the decisionmakers in paris to grant some steps toward selfdetermination for africans in africa the meeting attended by fiftyseven moderate blacks and whites most of whom were afro americans from the united states once more advocated traditional means of social change for blacks everywhere there were some africans present such as blaise diagne black senegalese french deputy and the liberian delegation to the peace conference but the accomplishments of du bois and the other delegates were few although du bois reported and wrote that he had helped set up the machinery the permanent mandates commission of the league of nationsfor the internalization of the former german colonies in africa many negroes in the united states including du bois had wanted the german colonies turned over to africans for selfrule the most important achievement was the publicity du bois received for the panafrican congress of under the circumstances it was a triumph just to hold it illusion of greatness to the afroamericans in the united states the panafrican congress had the illusion of greatness it was great for a commencement what was needed next was an effective internationally united black voice of protest as a watchdog to see to it that progress toward selfdetermination in africa particularly in the mandated areas was absolute and continuous the leadership of panafricanism concentrated more than ever in the hands and works of du bois who rose steadily as the major negro leader in the world black community after his return from europe du bois spoke on the panafrican congress of in washington he drew an appreciative overflow crowd miss nannie h burroughs a wellknown washington educator and a spectator was dubious about the personality of du bois to lead such a movement she said so to james weldon johnson the first afroamerican secretary of the naacp but the spingarn medal a coveted award prestigigiously given to a negro for achievement and service to the negro community was awarded du bois in the award was made by a committee of the naacp du bois was at the peak of his career vengeful competition just as du bois was given the spingarn medal for his moderate conception of panafricanism there burst into the limelight for five years another concept a much more militant one to offer consistent bitter and vengeful competition the challenge to du bois and the naacp came from an unexpected source the universal negro improvement association led by marcus mosiah negro digest february garvey a black british west indian from jamaica who advocated the use of force their central approaches to pan africanism focused on a backto africa movement an allnegro owned and operated steam ship line worldwide black unity and an african empire all of these were to be under the direct control of marcus garvey and the unia his mass followings produced meetings of at one time in the madison square garden and large crowds at his liberty hall meeting place in harlem his annual conventions in harlem were considered by some to be world black parliaments garvey thus had an organization and panafrican meetings in direct confrontation with the naacp and the panafrican congress of du bois but their competition over a moderate or a militant approach served to emphasize the fact that panafricanism was based mainly in new york and elsewhere in the new world one hesitates to speculate about the possibilities of african redemption had du bois and garvey cooperated garvey spurred the evidence indicates that the rise of garvey spurred du bois and the other moderate advocates of panafricanism and african nationalism to hold a much larger and more widely attended panafrican congress of which was the best and most productive held during the years when the panafrican congresses were led by web du bois sessions at london brussels and paris produced an appeal to the league of nations and a constitution a manifesto which was an answer to the declaration of the rights of the negro peoples of the world of the unia the hope was that the panafrican congress movement would finally create a permanent pressure group of blacks and liberal whites the concrete achievements of the panafrican congress of were easier to see but the continuity of the panafrican congress movement was not too easy to discern there was no extended high plateau for panafricanism during the s the peak was quickly reached and quickly passed there were many reasons for this unfortunate course of both movements despite the evident success of the panafrican congress of the national officers of the naacp refused to donate more financial aid to the panafrican congresses du bois had to use his own limited resources this was a serious blow but even more significant was the continued confusion about the du bois and the garvey movements many people could see no fundamental differences in the programs of the two men the unia and the leader marcus garvey suffered from business mismanagement and legal tangles garvey was jailed in for mail fraud and then deported in because he was an undesirable alien most important of the reasons for the rapid decline of both movements was the lack of interest on the part of new world negroes in the redemption of africa most negroes did not want to go back to africa or worry too greatly over african conditions things were bad enough at home the next two panafrican congresses in held in london and lisbon and in new york reflected the decline the fact that the last panafrican congress under the guidance of du bois was held in new york was furtherproof that afroamericans were in command some africans attended this assembly the assumption of black african leadership began in and not in as has been generally thought in london a colony of africans and afroamericans joined at the outbreak of the italoabyssinian war of the italian conquest of the symbol of black freedom in east africa ethiopia revived the feelings of negroes for united action to protest the hypocrisy of the european powers who stood by passively during the conquest all over the black world sentiments erupted for blacks to do something to help haile selassie the emperor of ethiopia when he entered into exile in london he was met at the station on his arrival by a representative of a panafrican organization jomo kenyatta who later became the first president of kenya they and their white liberal friends continued to meet and to protest european invasions thus a continuity was provided from the panafrican activities in london during the italianethiopian conflict down to the manchester meeting of the panafrican congress in m at the manchester meeting there was no longer any doubt that african nationalists from africa were in charge of the panafrican movement which had formerly been largely the work of new world negroes especially those in the united states like du bois and garvey even though he attended the manchester congress du bois knew that he had become the svm w bol and was no longer the leader leadership shifts at the manchester england meeting in october it was immediately evident that the shift of leadership from the new world blacks to black africans had definitely occurred the africans were ii much more numerous and active than at any other meeting among the wellknown africans to attend i were dr kwame nkrumah americaneducated first black prime minister in black africa in the j gold coast later ghana and jomo kenyatta for the first time militancy was much in evidence demands for autonomy and for independence were unequivocal there was even i talk of the use of violence as a last resort to obtain equality selfgovernment and independence resolutions were adopted in support of the oneman one vote principle during the next two years nkrumahs dream of a united states of africa became the dream of many africans the first panafrican meetings on african soil came in four previous events symbolized the continued domination of panafricanism by africans the first event was the independence of india in africans drew much inspiration from this transition it marked the beginning of the afroasian solidarity for liberation and for third world aims the second was the egyptian revolution of gamal abdal nasser in this marked the beginning of a more militant arab and moslem nationalism the third was the bandung indonesia conference in where asians and some african observers condemned colonialism imperialism and racial discrimination afroasian leadership and solidarity were strengthened ghana and nkrumah finally in ghana gained its independence under the militant leadership of nkrumah who took it upon himself to lead the panafrican movement under his urgings and his direction two meetings were held in accra the capital of ghana in in april all of the independent states of africa except south africa met and committed themselves to the liberation of the rest of africa and to remain neutral in the cold war in december instead of the states meeting the leaders of liberation movements and african political parties came to receive advice and to exchange tactics about the ultimate objectives of an africa completely free of colonialism exploitation and racial discrimination and an africa eventually united as one political area eleven years later the dream of a united states of africa remains just that while there are areas still in colonial hands how long it will take before these two aims are attained is anybodys guess the myth of benevolent spanish slave law by gwendolyn midlo hall he accepted publica tions in the field of comparative slavery in the americas have je part ej from the assumption that spanish slave law was unusually protective towards the slaves stanley elkins herbert klein louis hartz all cite frank tannenbaums slave and citizen as the foundation upon which their research and conclusions are based the foundation is very shaky indeed the spanish slave code of is cited extensively by these writers you can find this code printed in books but as the great cuban historian and jurist fernando ortiz pointed out back in when he ridiculed sir harry f johnson for making not a few comments about this unpromulgated code this code was never so much as promulgated much less enforced anywhere in or around the spanish caribbean when the code was first sent to the colonies the planters and merchants from cuba puerto rico venezuela and louisiana which then belonged to spain got together in a meeting and sent the code back to madrid saying that if such a law were published the slaves would rise up in rebellion madrid took it back and never tried to promulgate it again in the spanish caribbean if tannenbaum had read the very sources he cites fernando ortiz and jose antonio saco he would have learned this elementary fact apparently he didnt and no one else has bothered to check him out lo these many years what other legal evidence does he offer the siete partidos of rey alfonso el sabio alfonso the wise he was wise all right he ruled during the th century in toledo spain toledo had been one of the great intellectual centers of the moors at the time when the rest of europe was going through what even western historians call the dark ages alfonso the wise set up a translation center where arabic and hebrew scholarly works were translated into latin thereafter they were distributed throughout europe and pawned off as original works much of western philosophy theology science medicine mathematics aesthetics optics architecture agriculture irrigation law and government literary forms and techniques musicology including the rhythmic notation system this system is called the franconian system after the german monk who copies it from the arabswell you name it they plagiarized it a moorish chronicler living in those times wrote do not give arabic manuscripts to the christians because they will translate them into latin and claim them as their own this king should be known as king alfonso the plagiarizer but to get back to our subject tannenbaum claims that the protectiveness of medieval iberian slave law was carried over from roman slave law now there are historians in this country arnold sio for example who have pointed out that roman slave law was extremely harsh it hasnt occurred to anyone yet that the major influence upon the siete partidas might be islamic islamic codes were protective of slaves in any case the siete partidas never was applied to america i have thoroughly searched and a few other historians have thoroughly searched spanish slave law before the code spanish slave law deals almost exclusively with security measures it deals with requiring slaves to have written passes when they leave their masters property forbidding them to have arms to own or ride horses it deals with brutal punishments for runaway slaves including ham stringing cutting off noses and ears castration it deals with control of emancipated slaves or free africans forbidding them from living in indian villages forcing them to live in separate villages where they can be supervised made to pay tribute and forced to present themselves upon the labor market it deals with barring them from skilled trades from schools from intermarriage and conscripting them for military service there were even some attempts in th century mexico to reenslave the entire free black population there are some early measures encouraging religious education and encouraging marriage among the slaves but even these measures they explain are to hold the slaves to the estates with family ties and to encourage submission to their masters through religious education what is really rare in spanish slave law before the code is concrete measures regulating work hours requiring masters to provide food clothing and medical attention requiring masters to provide for old or sick slaves unable to work measures restricting the type or amount of punishment a master can inflict upon a slave and making the master criminally responsible for the serious injury or death of his slave as a result of punishment or measures guaranteeing trial in the civil courts for slaves accused of serious crimes in fact in the realm of concrete protective measures spanish slave law is vastly inferior to french slave law and even to british slave law the concrete protective measures of the spanish slave code of were consciously copied from the french code noir which dates all the way back to many of the paragraphs of the spanish code of appear to be direct translations of the code noir and if this in itself is not convincing there is a document dating from instructing the framers of the spanish slave codes to copy the french code noir the nowfamous spanish slave code of it has been quoted so extensivelv lately that it has be come probably the most famous unpromulgated law in history claims in its preamble that it is a codification of existing spanish slave law in the americas tannenbaum accented this statement without investigating whether or not it was true and concluded that spanish law in the americas had always been protective of the slaves so here is an entire theory based upon a code that was never promulgated in the spanish caribbean it apparently was promulgated where there werent many slaves anyway and claiming falsely that it was a codification of existing spanish slave law in the americas what other legal evidence does tannenbaum cite this pious statement from the king dating from and directed to the captain general of cuba that after privately calling the masters of these slaves you say to them in my name that they must not for whatever motive rigorously tighten the wage they receive from their slaves for having been tried in other places it has proved inconvenient harming the souls of these people which is a matter for grave scruples that for their own consciences sake the master must avoid and at the same time i command you that if at any time these masters mistreat them the slaves you will apply the necessary remedy it is not just to consent to or permit any excess in this matter for their slavery is a sufficient sorrow without at the same time suffering the distempered rigour of their masters tannenbaum picked up this piece of a law from the cuban historian saco now while saco opposed the slave trade he defended slavery itself to the bitter end the full text of this law and some other relevant documents have since been published in a collection of documents which throw new light upon this pious statement and illustrates the dangers of relying upon secondary sources on so controversial a subject as slavery his majestys attention had been called to a persistent problem in his kingdom of the indies it seems some masters were forcing their slaves into theft and prostitution some of the slave women were wandering around the port cities in the nude soliciting customers and creating quite a scandal the masters were demanding that their street slaves bring back each day a much larger sum of money than they could possibly secure through legitimate means punishing them severely if they didnt bring back the amount of money the masters were demanding the king instead of fixing a maximum amount a master could demand of his street slave as his advisors had apparently recommended contented himself with exhortation this pious but impotent statement is quoted over and over again by these highly qualified historians to prove how mild slavery was in latin america by the way dont think that i street slaves no longer exist our cities are teeming with them they are called junkies their masters are the organized crime syndicates which often own everyone in local government who counts they addict their street slaves to hard narcotics monopolize the supply and control the prices then the syndicate collects every penny the junkies can beg borrow steal and prostitute themselves for the junkies also sell as much dope as rthey can to support their own habits and create new customers for the syndicate they devote about hours a day to their various occupations gilberto freyre estimates the average working life of a brazilian street slave at seven years i would make about the same estimate of life expectancy for the street slaves of detroit the content hasnt changed only tithe form i hope you dont think r this is an irrelevant comment i believe the past teaches us about the present and the present teaches rus about the past at least thats how it works with me ill give you some of my conclusions about the role of slave law based upon comparative research i have quite a bit of evidence to back me up which i cant possibly present here but i am presenting it in my dissertation the colonial authorities were there to look out after the interests of the mother country the slave system was a tremendous source of wealth for the mother country and colonial officials were there to see to it that nothing jeopardized the continued prosperity of the colony and the stability of the slave system slave law was concerned with preserving order in the colony maintaining and developing its wealth and continuing the dependency of the colony upon the mother country the main concern of slave law including its protective aspects was social control in the broadest sense those measures which tend towards protecting the slaves cannot be understood as indications of the disinterested humanitarianism of the colonizing powers they stemmed from fear of the slaves their potential threat to public order to the prosperity or even the continued existence of the colony these concerns often came into conflict with the plantation owners drive for immediate profit the masters did not consider the long range impact of their activities upon the colony the problem was especially acute among absentee owners and among colonists whose orientation was to make as much money as soon as possible and then return to the metropolis in other words the colonial authorities were afraid that the masters looking to their immediate interests alone might abuse neglect and exasperate their slaves to the point of provoking rebellion and the loss of the colony to the mother country as the continued existence of the slave trade was increasingly called into question the mother country was also concerned that the work force might die out and could not be replaced this latter concern is reflected in reform laws tending towards encouraging procreation and protecting pregnant and nursing slaves and newborn slave children far from being unusually protective towards the slaves the spanish system was the only one i have studied in any depth which actually operated a flourishing slave plantation system without any legal controls to speak of because spain was weak during the th century it could not impose its will upon the cuban planters and practically no controls were exercised upon the plantations civil government in the cuban countryside was predatory here is a description from a th century travel account of the capitanes de partido or petty judges who being without salaries like so many vultures prey upon the unprotected within their jurisdiction nor are the rich without the pale of their power and those who have not influence with the heads of the island government are sometimes largely fleeced by them on most frivolous pretexts this traveller describes one of these petty judges whose chief boast was the sums he could collect in fines from his neighbors while riding through the country with sword and pistols his slouched hat coattee that had crawled up on his shoulders and pantaloons struggling to escape from their straps his face unshaven and his whole person covered with dust he might readily have been taken for a prowling thief has anybody ever seen a rural sheriff in the south or the vice squad in detroit those of us who know what law and government does to the unprotected will not make these silly mistakes when we become historians plantation slavery in th century cuba was lawless to the point of jeopardizing its own continued existence instead of legal protections which might have sought to prevent the system from transcending limits conducive to its own survival the system got completely out of hand and the government authorities resorted to overkill to maintain order the great cuban historian fernando ortiz writing about midth century cuba said uprisings among the plantation slaves became so frequent and the means of repressing them so horrible that very soon the masters began to realize that the intervention of the authorities was more costly than the rebellions themselves thus in the captaingeneral of cuba had to issue an instruction against the abuses committed by circuit judges who were entering plantations in revolt accompanied by large bodies of armed men killing animals and negroes and ruining the owners this system of rule culminated in wholesale destruction of the slave and free black population during and when the conspiracy of the ladder was repressed over people were summarily tried by a military tribunal which extracted confessions and implication of others under torture over people were executed many more died under the lash hundreds were exiled and sentenced to long terms at hard labor in africa the elite of the free black population was wiped out its leading intellectuals executed the entire free black population was substantially reduced but aside from these official proceedings the slave population was decimated government investigators reported a drastic increase in suicide among slaves during these years the official census shows that the slave population was reduced from in to in export of sugar fell to almost nothing the captaingeneral of cuba officially denied british protests against cruel procedures used against english subjects during these trials in a letter to the queen he said far from having made use of terror or afflictive means to clarify the facts or proceeding with rigor in the imposition of penalties each and every trial is resplendent with the spirit of leniency of moderation and justice which presided in them the queen replies continue submitting data about the success of the trial of several english subjects accused of complicity in the last conspiracy so that the government of her majesty can answer with authentic data and information the reclamations directed by the british minister concerning this matter this is the style of spanish slave law it is so busy protesting its humaneness that any critical historian should immediately suspect that it might be just the opposite spanish slave law was abstract selfrighteous and totally ineffective in rendering protection to the plantation slaves even to the point of jeopardizing the continued existence of slavery itself but the texts of spanish slave law were weaved into a myth of the mildness of spanish slavery justifying its continued existence and used as an argument against the abolition of slavery if you want to know what slavery was really like in th century cuba you should read the autobiography of esteban montejo a cuban slave it has just been translated and published in english montejo was sold away from his parents when a small child in those days he said blacks were sold like pigs and they sold me at once children were separated from their mothers and raised in a barracks so their mothers could go right back to work without having to care for them montejo was born during the last decades of the slave system when the african slave trade had actually stopped the masters were interested in slave breeding and forced tall slaves to mate the child of two tall slaves sold for pesos montejo describes subhuman living and working conditions brutal punishments and widespread homosexuality because of the shortage of women on the estates montejo didnt believe homosexual practices came from africa because the old africans frowned upon them after the abolition of slavery in cuba the spanish historian rafael maria de labra said one has to admire gentlemen the nerve by which the slave interests propagated the belief that the slaves of the antilles lived happily and contented no one mentioned dungeons stocks and irons nor the awful mortality rate among slaves it is this same proslavery propaganda which accepted uncritically has attained the status of fact in the academic world in the united states the origins of racism by don howie riting near the end of fascist hegemony in europe the great hannah arendt declared the historical truth of the matter is that racethinking with its roots deep in the th century emerged during the th century simultaneously in all western countries racism has been the powerful ideology of imperialistic policies since the turn of the century it certainly has absorbed and revived all the old patterns of race opinions which however by themselves hardly would have been able to create or to degenerate into racism as weltanschauung or ideology for the idea of race does not belong in the history of ideas and not until the end of the last century were dignity and importance accorded it as though it had been one of the major spiritual contributions of the western world in given the poverty of historical research and the prevailing europhilia that may have been an entirely acceptable viewpoint however today we know that it is grossly inaccurate actually racism in all its devilish forms emerged long before the genocidal commerce in red men and black men enveloping euroamerican life from time immemorial the historical truth is simply that the roots of racism are inseparable from the evolution of western civilization itself men have always been conscious of race the whole concept of race did not originate with the african slave trade as many have pontificated rather raceopinions are as old and traditional as the races themselves nothing could be more incorrect and intellectually arrogant than the assertion that the idea of race does not belong in the history of ideas and not until the end of the last century were dignity and importance accorded it as more recent scholarship has demonstrated the idea of race is deeply embedded in western culture and consequently is eminently worthy of inclusion in the history of ideas as well as the history of political economy here i am not using race in an abstract biologistic sense but sociohistorically apparently miss arendt arbitrarily has delimited race to a purely physioethnological meaning on its face such an ahistorical delimitation has neither intellectually nor socially redeeming value race as a category of human existence has a meaning in those social situations where men of different groups take cognizance of their respective racial andor cultural differences defining ex plaining and acting upon them in terms of their world views now racism in the broad sense is an appropriate and descriptive concept for the way in which each group affirms its physical andor cultural superiority over another group racism in this sense is as ancient as the concept of race itself however racism in its ideological sense refers to racethinking which rationalizes sanctions and affirms a particular social system racism as ideology then is preeminently a politicalsociological phenomenon that is not to say that it does not have residual manifestations dimensions or ramifications eg psychological racism as ideology therefore is defined as that peculiar worldview which rationalizes the bestiality of a social system by propounding the physical andor cultural superiority of the dominant race and the inferiority of the oppressed race this dynamic conception reduces racism to its material foundations and its rationalistic functions ie activating spreading and institutionalizing both manifest and latent forms of preexisting race consciousness or racial differentiations this grasping of racism as a social fact resulting from the dynamic interaction between fundamentally antagonistic irreconcilable social forces illuminates the critical distinction between race consciousness re the cultural system and racism re the social or institutional system ie between consciousness and ideology racism then is the ideological doctrine that asserts the genetic andor cultural inferiority of an oppressed people in order to justify their social plight ie how and why they have been subjugated this does not at all imply that political economy causes racism on the contrary ecopolitical and military facts activate and institutionalize already existing race consciousness doubtless racism in its generic sense did not originate with the african slave trade for sure racism functioned ideologically however negligiblyin some social systems before europeans raped and pillaged the continent yet we should not allow this to distort and eradicate in our minds the remembrance of the altogether vicious historical development of racism as ideology in the wild west nor should we allow this to validate the spurious equation of the various forms of racism before the african slave trade with the hellish legacy of the coming of the beast the incontrovertible fact remains racism as the pervasive ideology of expansionistic capitalism remains the enduring essence of the western heritage racism inheres in the evolution of capitalist civilization enough said about the promised lands of life liberty and the pursuit of property concerning the necessary antecedent conditions for racism as ideology to emerge it has been maintained that the most important necessary condition antecedent for racism is the presence in sufficient numbers of two or more groups that look different enough so that at least some of their members can be readily classifiable in addition to their physical differences these groups also have to be culturally different and in a position of institutionalized inequality for the idea of inherent racial differences to take root emphasis mine it seems that only when group differences in race overlap at least partly with dissimilarities in status and culture are these two sets of differences held to be casually related to another but the idea of inherent racial differences may establish itself without the existence of institutionalized inequality ie oppression provided that it is embedded in the worldview of a social system thus there are only two necessary and sufficient conditions for racism as such what is confused above is the politicalsociological function of racism with its necessary conditions antecedent racism can and usually does exist prior to the oppression relationship euphemistically such racism has been called ethnocentrism or xenophobia though oppression or institutionalized inequality is an essential condition for racism as ideology it is not a necessary condition antecedent for racism as race consciousness or ethnocentrism miss arendt correctly sees that historically racism as ideology absorbed and revived all the old patterns of race opinions however such race opinions were not inherently impotent either to create or to degenerate into an ideology their apparent impotence is directly attributable to the lack of a relationship of oppression between the conflicting groups and is therefore a social fact rather than mere ideation traditionally the conventional wisdom has relegated racism to a physiological statement this biologistic posture explains in part the inhibition to define preth century racethinking as racism since it lacked a scientistic front but it is not really critical whether biology or culture or a combination of the two is viewed as the base of the racist perspective what is important is whether that base is naturalistically or genetically conceived the essential elements of racism as ideology have been philosophically elaborated by professor george d kelsey as ontology philosophy of history and military plan professor kelsey admits that only the first two elements are necessary and sufficient for racism as such to exist ie an oppressed people can be racist even though it lacks political power this analytical view conforms to the critical distinction between racism as race consciousness and racism as ideology only those who would maintain the status quo can be ideologically racist since racism as ideology in principle affirms the existing pattern of social arrangements political power therefore is necessary for racism to function ideologically naturally racism as ideology in the wild west has been inseparable from a politicaleconomicmilitary plan ie white power it may be theoretically possible to equate the racism of an oppressed people with that of the oppressors but such a sophistic academic equation would be historically and sociologically relatively insignificant the unquestionable historical truth of the matter is that racism as ideology has been exclusively possessed by whites in the modern world racism as ideology in the modern world evolved from the inception of the slave trade in africans dating from the middle of the th century according to basil davidson throughout the years that followed it it was to be the searing brand of this trade that it would consider its victims not as servants or domestic slaves who deserved respect in spite of their servile condition but as chattel slaves commodities that could and should be sold at will until the enlightenment the orthodox justification of the slave trade was couched in a theologistic worldview initially the slave traders as well as those involved in and benefitting from their free enterprise rationalized their gross crimes in terms of making the world safe for christianity when whites first met africans they instinctively assumed that they were dealing a blow to infidelity in general as well as procuring new souls for the church to wins their concept of heathenism was firmly rooted in the white idea of savagery ie the traditional european view of nonwhites but given the genocidal oppression of the african slave trade the concept of heathenism inevitably acquired ideological significance more important the white idea of heathenism masked a more totalistic ideology racism apparently heathenism was now obsolete to the white definition of africans as livestock it was readily translatable into forthright and militant white racism it was argued that black people were the natural predestined and ordained as it were by god himself slaves of whitesuperior civilization the critical theological distinction between heathen and redeemed was therefore thoroughly racializable prefiguring the imminent devilview in the beginning the europeans image of himself as christian visavis heathens camouflaged a plethora of racial differentiations christian meant whitesuperior civilizedhuman the traditional concept of slavery in western culture also was racialized in order to buttress the racist folklore and mythology slavery had always been more than an economic institution in western culture it had long represented the ultimate limit of dehumanization of treating and regarding man as a thing embedded in western culture then was a vocabulary experience and temperament of slavery which was readily applied to the enslaved africans concepts of heathenism and slavery were enmeshed and interlocked in the same traditional worldview but with the rise of the slave trade they acquired radically new social and institutional content racialization psycholinguistically whites were predisposed to look upon africans as inferior men by their concept of blackness which was pervaded by a sinister diabolical signification the concept of blackness was loaded with intense meaning long before they found that some men were black englishmen found in the idea of blackness a way of expressing some of their most ingrained values white and black connoted purity and filthiness virginity and sin virtue and baseness beauty and ugliness beneficence and evil god and the devil it followed from the european concept of blackness that racial theories would attempt to explain the deviation of africans from the white paradigms europeans were endowed by their culture with an antiblack consciousness that they perceived africans as black ie as perverse negations of themselves is an interesting commentary on the perpetuity of cultural selectivity blackness nonbeing for whites was juxtaposed against whiteness being and as a result race consciousness was transformed into racist ideology whereas the color of africans was their most distinctive arresting and immediate characteristic for whites the concept of blackness was easily converted from a psycholinguistic category into a politicaleconomic fact in the european psyche africa represented the land of blackness though the cult of ethiopism ie the medieval idea that ethiopia or africa was a terrestrial paradise inhabited by convertible noble savages intrigued many africans were never regarded as noble savages in any sense comparable to the romantic idolization of the american indians the color bar and literally so was all too insurmountable the image of africa as the dark con tinent flowed naturally from the cluster of cultural perceptions myths and symbols which comprised the european worldview a critical aspect of the european racist ideology was the view that the enslavement of africans was justifiable because the move from primitivetribal forms of slavery to christianwhite slavery represented an advance on the hierarchial ontological ladder ie the great chain of being this distorted perception of what african forms of slavery were all about was directly caused by the white projectionimposition of its perverse slavocratic institution upon alien societies such a crude misunderstanding of african slavery reflects the mythical element in western civilizationan element which is inextricably imbricated in the politicaleconomicmilitary facts of white domination the ideological origins of racism have been obscured by liberal historiography in their reconstruction of the preslave trade european view of africans some historians have minimized its racist consciousness because there is some evidence that not every european regarded africans as degenerate heathens these historians conclude that the white view was not racist and therefore that white racism did not exist prior to the slave trade with the advent of the slave trade the white image of africans is said to have undergone a fundamental transformation insofar as europeans supposed no inherent racial inferiority in africans they are said to have exhibited a presumably innocuous cultural chauvinism in their attempt to minimize the vitality and importance of racism in preslave trade europe these historians have indulged in historical hyperbole obscuring the extent to which whites were thoroughgoing racists as well as the historical transformation of racism as consciousness into racism as ideology racism as ideology far from being an attitudinal irrationality in mans ethnicity or essentially a problem of personality development developed as a consequence of the need for a more rationalistic indeed naturalistic explanation of the capitalist political economy of which slavery was an indispensable institution until the enlightenment the orthodox theory of the varieties of mankind was a theological monogenesis it was not until the latter part of the th century that someone dared to seriously doubt the unity of the human race some thinkers however anticipating later theories of polygenesis staunchly denied that africans and american indians were of the same species as christianwhite men for instance in the bold bruno declared that it was unthinkable that whites and africans could have the same ancestry but monogenesis was so firmly and clearly established that such speculative deviations carried little if any weight the church responding with all deliberate speed quashed these heterodox doctrines however the temporary suppression of polygenetic conjecture did not extinguish it as a very viable and acceptable theory of the racialized dichotomy between oppressor and oppressed polygenesis was to gain new expression in the th century in the thought of thomas jefferson and voltaire eventually the religious doctrine of the unity of man was subverted by the identity of christianity and whiteness in contradistinction to heathenness and blackness if the religious ideology lingered on as the primary rationalization of the political economy of slavery through the s toward the end of the th century it was less politically and intellectually compelling the progressive secularization of antiblack sentiments and theories having occurred given its worldview europe was predisposed upon contact with noneuropeans to transform raceconsciousness into racist ideology that pernicious predisposition was part and parcel of the european identityselfconsciousness it served a dual purpose metapsychologically it sustained whites image of themselves the mirror that can never be me and politically it rationalized their barbarous treatment of africans they knew that they were whitechristian civilized only because nonwhite peoples could not by definitionin principle be the retarded european consciousness could define itself only in terms of the other the noneuropean white could not be whiteness without blackness the african presence then vivified vitalized politicized mythicized what may have been prior to that racial oppression an abstract other if racism as ideology has been the major spiritual bequeathment of the western experience it is because race consciousness and racism are rooted in western culture having been detonated by the politicaleconomic facts of the th century by wanda coleman or a black man he was runty he looked out on noisy new york from his drab

from their supper when mrs i sneed let go with a loud cry and dashed out her door and down the sidewalk hurdling like a black missile with mr sneed right behind her in strong pursuit once rthey were moving down the side walk a stunned and silent awe greeted them at the corner of the i street she stopped for a moment and raised her fist defiantly then took off again with startled people making way for her as she ran wildly jones funeral cortege with mr ebenezer jones driving hearse slammed on its collective mournful brakes and had its ears pierced with mrs sneeds defiance there goes that crazy lady someone said they ought to put her awayor something meanwhile mr sneed was still behind her having made up little or no distance a small not unattractive black man with slightly greying hair he was breathing hard and his face glistened with perspiration it embarrassed him to be out chasing his wife so he ran like a husband embarrassed to be out chasing his wife people on the block took bets as to how long she would run or whether mr sneed would ever catch her naw man he wont catch that woman a little squat man said thiss been going on for months and never seed him catch up to her yet the little squat man leaned back against the traffic meter and took a long swallow of pepsi cola with obvious satisfaction once mr sneed asked his wife honey he asked why you run like that sometime just up and start running willie b she aswered i really dont know i really dont know except sometimes i get the feeling something or other is after me but where you running to woman when this happens after having crossed lake shore drive her body a matadors cape against a traffic of white faces she rested near the lake i cant explain it willie b no moren you can explain why you run after me i run after you because i dont want you to get hurt but honey she said smiling aint nothing you can do about that is there well lookahere im a man he insisted dont lets talk honey she asked her hands reaching down to rest upon his the running has made me tired there are days when lake michigan moves like an ocean it lashes against the stone ramparts out beyond the shore white peaks punctuate punctuate she couldnt tell him if she wanted to why she had to come down to the water periodically there were just these times when she had to run and it was the only place to run she couldnt tell willie b why she ran if he didnt know she couldnt tell him it made no sense to hurt him she loved willie b maybe that was why she ranbecause she loved him yet there were times when she wanted to kill him kill him because he was helpless because he could not ask the right question the one which would allow her to break the curse her hand lay neutral on his neither hot nor cold neither giving nor receiving a strange numbness started somewhere in his left shoulder when she touched him all the way down to his fingertips he felt a needlelike tingle then nothingnothing that is but a fierceness of tears she tried to hide by turning her face from him sitting next to her with home behind them a house in which they had lived together for twenty years he thought for a moment that he understood what she could not say he stretched his legs cleared his throat his eyes set deep in their sockets preparatory to speaking youre a fool willie b she hissed youre a fool a his eyes dropped and watched a gull hover above the water then skim along the surface dipping its face into the splashings he said i was going to say something but what can i you think im a fool a cool breeze started to blow between them we should go before you catch cold you want to know why i know why woman he cracked and was immediately sorry it didnt do no good for them to hurt each other i believe you do willie she said thoughtfully and thats the shame of it why you say that because aint nothing you can do about it but the blue and white car pulled up about forty yards behind them and a policeman got out and came down toward them when he was about six feet away he stopped and took out his pad and pencil he had a nervous grin on his face whats your name silence whats your name silence honey willie b said you get up and leave here right now you get up and leave here what am i goin get up and leave for willie b she demanded what am i goin leave for i aint got nowhere to go behind them an old white woman with thick blue veins in her legs was calling to her dog you naughty dog she cried oh officer officer the redfaced policeman turned sideways his right hand lingering on his revolver and gave the white woman an irritated growl officer i just wanted you to know it seems that my dog has urinated on your automobile its all right lady he said in tt u a rather flat voice which still did not conceal his nervousness he thought shit leave these black bastards alone thats what ill do go along lady its all right but try to curb that dog lady im sorry officer but if the dog cant run free here then its all right lady he repeated his right hand relaxed and was putting the pad into his back pocket man my name is willie b sneed he said getting up the tone of his voice had changed and the quickness of his movements frightened the policeman what dyou want to know for some people said a man was chasing a woman down here the policeman answered now there was defiance in his voice are you the two two what some people blocking traffic rested on his gun bob steele bob steele some white people it doesnt matter what color they were they said you were blocking traffic it matters man willie b said turning to his wife are you gon leave or not i aint goin nowhere man she said softly almost affectionately you came down here to hurt us man willie b said to the policeman i cant let you do that just come down the road and hurt people look the policeman said taking one small step backwards im answering a complaint that there was a man chasing a woman thats all wow willie b worked his right foot hard against the ground his face twisted in thought he seemed to be searching for the right words man you owe us an apology without even thinking the policeman laughed almost involuntarily what did you say i got to have it man the policemans hands opened almost in appeal as he looked down at the woman who was still sitting on the ground how bad you got to have it nigger he yelled the pad and pencil landing near willie b the policemans legs spread wide he licked the comer of his mouth his right arm waving slowly out from his side his hand bent toward his gun bad enough willie said calmly i dont have time to apologize to no black son of a bitch like you two white people a man and woman came and stood next to the policemans car im outnumbered willie b thought these damn white people are going to waste us he wondered if mrs sneed was afraid i aint got time to be scared he told himself but can i reach him before he gets it out and pulls the trigger just a piece of him just a hand on him i dont care about nothing else he could already feel what seemed like a heavy weight in his chest he could feel all his strength dissolving his legs growing weak and the faint taste of something metallic in his mouth he heard himself say i got to get to him black communities all black studies programs should be relevant to the black community near the school and should in turn be supported by the black community the association ahsa should act as a liaison between black communities and funding agencies ahsa should compile a list of black scholars who need financial support for their community projects or their academic research the association will edit a newsletter or a journal through which its activities should be known the confrontation at montreal cannot be honestly seen out of context with other events that helped to set it in motion for years the african studies association has been a white organization with token black representation that had little or no influence on the major decision affecting the organization the african studies association is not just a professional association its leaders perform other functions that directly or indirectly affect the lives and livelihood of africans and afroamerican scholars and students its annual meeting which brings together government officials journalists publishers foundation representatives businessmen scholars students and members of voluntary associations serves as a point of contact and a market place where jobs research funds ideas and information are exposed and exchanged its members are scholars whose research not only determines or influences at the very least the image of africa in america but also conditions the kind and scope of much of the written documentation available about the continent research completed by its members has provided background material for united states foreign policy decisions in africa for these reasons we deemed the asa annual meeting the proper forum for our demands in the absence of the president of ahsa dr nicholas d u onyewu of nassau community college and dr chike onwuachi of fisk university represented ahsa in all negotiations with asa the african peoples attending this conference demanded that the study of african life be undertaken from a panafricanist perspective this perspective defines that all black people are african people and reject the division of african peoples by geographical locations based on colonialist spheres of influence this demand joined the issue and offended a large number of the white scholars attending the conference they resented the projection of african people as a world people with a common cause and a common destiny more than anything else they resented the afroamericans being linked with the africans in africa the demands of the blacks attending this conference had exposed the neocolonialism that a large number of these socalled scholars had been practicing for years africa to them was a kind of ethnic plantation over which they reigned and explained to the world most of them even resented africans being considered authorities on africa the confrontation at montreal awakened them from their dreams specifically the african people who made up the black caucus wanted their demands to be the means of changing the ideological and structural bases of the african studies association as negotiations between the black caucus group and the asa board progressed it became clear that the demand for an equal number of black members of the board of twelve would be the most difficult demand for the old guard in asa to live with the asa executive board decided that perhaps they could offer three seats in addition to the two already held by blacks the asa board was surprised when the two black members dr absolom vilakasi of south africa and dr elliott p skinner of columbia university supported the demands of the black caucus the offer of three additional african members was rejected this prompted the board to convene an assembly of the voting membership of asa to decide the issue probably the most crucial event in the threeday confrontation was the asa voting memberships rejection of the black caucus demands by a vote of to in its plenary session on friday afternoon it is of interest that the asa an organization of scholars whose prestige and output depends upon maintaining good relations with africans both in terms of gaining entry into african countries and obtaining reliable information for them would have permitted if for on other than political reasons their voting membership to go on record as having voted against minimal demands of african peoples people have argued in defense of the white asa membership that although a large number of them supported the demands they were affronted by the tactics of disruption and therefore could not in good conscience grant the blacks immediate representation on the board if this assessment is true then it raises a fundamental question of their ability to understand and evaluate societies or events occurring in those societies with which they disagree in principle the black caucus ahsa committee that negotiated with asa board consisted of africans west indians and afroamerican students and professors one of whom had been an asa voting member since its inception moreover the majority of the african visitors invited by the asa and the canadian african studies committee to attend the conference supported the substance of the black caucus demands the caucus concerns over the white domination of scholarly output on africa had been expressed by africans at two earlier international conferences of africanists at dakar indication of african support was initially voiced by gabriel darboussier a nationalist leader in francophone africa since the s and currently senegalese ambassador to germany darboussier was slated to deliver the keynote address for the opening session at which time the first statement of black demands were presented robert gardiner director of the united nations economic commission for africa actively participated in the caucus meetings and supported its demands by friday noon when the black caucus met with the invited african guests to clarify our position in french and in english they presented a written declaration of support which had been signed by most of the leading african participants leon damas of french guyana one of the three original negritude poets along with aime cesaire and leopold sedar senghor read the declaration of solidarity cited below we the undersigned participating in a joint annual meeting of the african studies association and the committee on african studies in canada in our capacity of guests of the latter in face of the incidents which confront the afroamerican participants and the asa usa note that the africanist congress held in dakar in december strongly criticized the orientation of african studies in two resolutions adopted at the th and th committees we strongly reiterate the view that african studies as conceived within the context of colonialism and imperialist domination of the african continent have served exclusively to reinforce an ideology which serves their domination in the interest of foreign capital and to exploit the african continent k the question of the procedure tactics and ultimate objective of the black caucus was a pivotal issue in the eyes of the asa white membership any challenge to their authority that was not supported by the black asa voting members had no legitimacy however they misinterpreted an expression by some black africanists of nonsupport of tactics to also mean nonsupport of substantive issues what is the present status of negotiations between the black caucus and the african studies association in response to the compromise position proposed by the white radical caucus and approved by the asa membership the black caucus has decided that it will send delegates who will represent the caucus and the ahsa on the man committee provided that six blacks be appointed as interim members of the asa board of directors the radical caucus compromise proposal envisions the appointment of an ad hoc committee of comprised of whites and blacks whose purpose would be to formulate plans for the total restructuring of asa our conditional acceptance reflects our suspicions about the compromise agreement these suspicions are based on two factors the lack of guarantees of the compromise plan and some confusion about the selection of the blacks that will serve on the ad hoc committee and the past experiences many of the members of the caucus have had with negotiations of this type in order to make our position in the matter clear the following letter was given to professor l gray cowan before we left montreal recognizing that the sentiment of the general membership of the asa annual meeting was in favor of the principle of equal representation on the assumption that the present asa board of directors will continue to function the ahsa executive committee has reached the following conclusion the ahsa demands equal representation be given to it on the present constituent board and contingent on that will submit a list of names to serve on the constitutional committee the report of the committee headed by dr james l gibbs of stanford was distributed too late to have any effect on the conference this was a report from a committee on afroamerican issues appointed after the conference in los angeles this report answers some of the questions that were bothering black students and scholars at montreal it was of course too little too latebut at least it was a gesture in the confrontation at montreal the old order of the african studies association was challenged without compromise the existence of this organization is now contingent on whether it can meet this challenge creatively and respectfully first an attempt should be made to understand the genesis of the african and afroamerican concern for their history and their long fight to make it an acceptable study in schools and universities long before the recent discovery of africa by the academic community black americans were showing an interest in african history most of the courses in african history and lecture discussions were held in churches and community centers to the best of my knowledge these were the first courses in african history held in this country the challenge and confrontation that started at los angeles in october and erupted into a dramatic climax in montreal in october was a long time in the making in the time span between the conference in los angeles and the one at montreal what started out as a black caucus became the african heritage studies association this association intends to examine every aspect and approach to the history and culture of african people in this country and throughout the world further its members intend to project their influence into every organization that relates to africa and the people of african descent we will decide who is and is not an authority on our life and history and we will question black scholars as well as white ones we deplore the fact that so many people mainly white are gaining quick reputations as authorities on african people we suspect that this is a new area of academic colonialism and that it is not unrelated to the neocolonialism that is attempting to reenslave africa by controlling the minds of the african people further we suspect that this closely connected group of white authorities are attempting to control or direct the historical information relating to africa in a manner that will make africans believe that they are forever dependent on people of european descent and that the coming of the europeans to africa was in spite of the slave trade and the colonial system a blessing in disguise the intent of the african heritage studies association is to use african history to effect a world union of african people we do not believe that the closely connected group of white authorities on africa are interested in such a union in fact we think the idea frightens them because this means that they will lose their control over information about africa they resent the idea of any black person taking it upon himself to question their authority and to examine their credentials that is precisely what the members of the african heritage studies association intends to do first they intend to ask for an entirely new approach to african history this new approach must begin with a new frame of reference n what and who are the african people we make no sharp distinction between the africans in africa and the people of african descent in other parts of the world this at once projects the possibility of a world union of african people first we will call for a new frame of reference in all matters relating to africa we reject the black africa because it presupposes that there is a white africa the term negro africa is offensive to us because there is no such thing as a negro this word grew out of the european slave trade and the colonial system and it fails to relate the people of african descent to land history and culture our original place or origins was africa and no matter where we live on this earth we are an african people our approach to african history and culture everywhere will be in keeping with this definition we intend to use history as a force for our liberation and as a basis of african world unity we depend on an honest and creative approach to history to tell what we have been what we are and what we still must be the henry o tanner exhibition dear editor i was interested to note mention of the henry o tanner exhibition under art notes in the november issue of negro digest but i dont understand the meaning or intent of the comment the exhibit was not scheduled at any black museum i assume that because it was started at white initiative the frederick douglass institute together with the museum of african art would not be regarded as a black museum although its staff is black it deals exclusively with african and afroamerican art history and culture and of its attendance is black last year washington school childrenpredominantly blackvisited its galleries or attended its extension programs it was the frederick douglass institute in the persons of carroll greene jr black and myself white which was responsible for the tanner exhibition the institute sponsored the exhibit raised some to organize and circulate it persuaded the national collection of fine arts to assist us and have the opening at its great new museum arranged for it to be shown in major established museums in seven other cities under the auspices of the smithsonian institution travelling exhibition service and generated nationwide publicity for it see enclosed articles in the san francisco chronicle the national observer time magazine and in the major art magazines we felt that for tanner to be shown in such great american museums as the cleveland museum of art the detroit institute of art the carnegie institute in pittsburgh and the philadelphia museum would bring to tanner the reputation in professional art circles that he deserves he is not the first artist to whom such recognition has come late it was a large and costly show to organize and administer involving loans from many museums and individuals considerable sums for insurance etc it was not a show that a small new museumas most of the black museums are could properly receive accommodate or provide normal museum security for our own small museum even though it is fairly well established could not properly accommodate it and guarantee the security of the valuable paintingsfor which reason we asked the smithsonian to show it it drew the largest attendance incidentally that they have ever had at the national collection of fine arts enclosed is a copy of the catalogue a great deal of very hard work by a number of peopleboth black and whitewent into the preparation of the exhibition and catalogue and i think the show will prove to have been the most important one ever given to a black artist in america warren m robbins director frederick douglass institute of arts history the november symposium dear editor sam e anderson in your symposium the measure and meaning of the sixties and what lies ahead for black americans said a hell of a lot that has needed to be said for a long time so did joe goncalves i mean what are black nationalist writers doing writing for the new york times for instance why for the money there are black publications leroi jones ameer baraka illustrated for me the supreme irony of the situation when he wrote a letter to the n y times that was some jive act you pulled changing the title of my essay the piece i know you remember was called nationalism vs pimp art complaining that they had changed the title of his essay from nationalism vs pimp art to to survive the reign of the beasts that was weak and impotent leroi should have expected that like joe goncalves said the white man is the intermediary he allows us to speak to each brother by way of him we will seek white approval are still being judged by white people we are not only still seeking white publishers but in the ads for black plays and on the jackets of books by black authors we still quote white critics black critics if they are approved or judged good by whites eg clayton riley i think s e anderson captured the essence of the sixties when he said our militant intellectuals our militant activists our militant politicians still have much allegiance to and fear ofwhite america our present movement is passionately caught up in the moral political and cultural decadence of white america yes the sixties have left us aware of our blackness the sixties have also left us with much confusion for example the sixties produced the soul movement the black muslims who are totally against the manifestations of soul also became prominent during the sixties i sincerely hope that during the seventies our black writers and thinkers will deal with these and other ambiguities in the black movement so that we can get on with the business of going wherever we as a people decide to go roy mjohnson new york n y sorry to discomfort you chauncey warringham hildredthlll esq we know how distasteful it is for you to be reminded that most americans who resemble you are secondclass citizens we know you are the exception after all your parents were professional people who brought you up in a stable middleclass neighborhood you were integrated from elementary school through university and you are the only negro holding down a job like yours in a white firm yes we understand and we sincerely regret embarrassing you with all these demonstrations and freedom songs and sitins and boycotts we are sorry that because you look like us white people tend to lump you together with us however we ask you to endure the painful situation out of charity for those not so fortunate as you we recognize that this might not appeal to you especially but we feel that our concerted efforts to attain genuine freedom of opportunity and movement for all americans now are in the national interest ultimately we believe that a truly free america is an america of unsurpassable strength it is even possible that your children will be the immediate beneficiaries since they have a better education than most and are best qualified to accept the jobs which civil_rights pressures are open ing up so have patience mr chauncey warringham hildredth iii the battle you are watching with such great aloofness sir is really your own how to end colonial domination of black america by joseph hannibal howard iii is well known that few of the psychologi cal and sociological studies of afroamericans have been done by blacks themselves however what is perhaps more significant few of the studies by black scholars have reflected a world view clearly different from their white counterparts this brief essay is an attempt to suggest what the foundations of such a perspective or frame of reference may be our efforts to create a productive and clear frame of reference are impeded by the fact that there is little if any meaningful theoretical work being done in american psychology and indeed in amer ican social science in general the system maintenance connotations of parsons socalled theory of social action is clearly antitheti cal to the interests of the black community in addition to being needlessly unintelligible it has been nevertheless the only serious attempt to give coherence to an otherwise unrelated aggregate of studies the only unifying themes discernible have been a reification of logical empiricism as method and as frantz fanon has said a unilateral declaration of the normative value of western culture the minnesota empiricist approach to the universe is both myopic and most importantly for our purposes ahistorical this is to be expected in a country more concerned with social engineering than with human development the study of the socalled negro american which has become so fashionable among white scholars in recent years has suffered because of the narrow definition of psychology and because of the provincial insistence that the study of the black man in the americas can only be undertaken within the national boundaries of the united states consistent with this point of view has been the definition of the afroamerican and other third world peoples as a minority problem this myopia may be a perceptual defense against the fact that the white population is a minority on the planet by approximately four to one even if one excludes the intermixtures to correct this situation we must look beyond the narrow conception of psychology and beyond the boundaries of the black community in america a small but suggestive body of literature supports the enlargement of our view hopefully more thorough analysis and experimentation in the future will confirm our brief and tentative suggestions when a sister or brother fries his hair or bleaches his skin this has traditionally been called selfhatred behavior following the work of kurt lewin in the current resurgence of black nationalism this is referred to as the oreo phenomenon it is likely that such a person will be referred to as negro rather than black but when the wife of general ngygen cao ky has plastic surgery done on her eyes to make them less slanted as some asian women do annually it is scarcely noticed in the black community both of these attempts to become more beautiful are of the same order of phenomena for they are both attempts to become more europeanlooking both are manifestations of what my colleagues and i call the colonized mentality there are many similarities in the behavior of third world people which have not been given as much attention as the differences there have also been consistent approaches to the study of minority peoples which invite our reinterpretation undoubtedly nothing has been so thoroughly studied as the intelligence of nonwestern people contained in shueys survey and other reviews of the literature on afroamericans are hundreds of measurements of black iqs not until klinebergs well known study in did american psychologists begin to tire of attempting to validate the myth of black mental inferiority what is significant about these numerous ethnocentric and futile efforts is that at the same time these studies were being done the mental abilities of thousands of africans were being meticulously measured in all parts of colonial africa an annotated bibliography by andor compiled for the south african government is filled like shueys with numerous studies seeking to establish the mental incapacity of africans in both the american and african research the europeans have frequently debated the intellectual ability of blacks as interesting as this debate has been we will decline to review it since none of this activity has changed the history of colonial domination in fact this research has helped to maintain colonialism both here and in africa by asserting the natives inability to determine his own destiny in zimbabwe or southern rhodesia as the europeans call it for example there were in secondary schools for europeans and two for africans as the scholarly debate continued over whether or not the african had a brain the search for the black mans mind has been almost as old a quest in western social science as the search for his soul sec ond in number to the intelligence studies have been a series of personality investigations in both america and africa the oftenquoted psychiatric study by kardiner and ovessey the mark of oppression and the tat study by karon the negro personality both found massive amounts of suppressed hostility and low feelings of selfesteem both of these feelings kardiner argued led to fear which may be manifested as self abnegation caution and apologetic hehavior kardiner goes on to say that blacks become depressed because of the inability to express their anger at the source of their frustration karon also found that blacks make frequent use of denial and fear the direct expres sion of aggression they often had the idea that some one is making trouble for you according to kardiner and ovessey blacks compensate their feelings of inferiority by use of denial humor flashy dressing drinking vituperative gossip disparagement gambling and explosive spending whatever that means they conclude their portrait by saying he tends to live from day to day because of an inability to plan without commenting upon the rather familiar ring of their findings the assumption inherent in psychoanalytic theory that somehow the fault lies inside the individual should not be missed although kardiner and karons findings are familiar what are not so well known are the findings of de ridder in his the personality of the urban african in south africa in a tat type investigation sponsored interestingly enough by shell oil of south africa it was found that a the african personality is characterized by strong feelings of anxiety and insecurity b the african frequently turns to crime in particular he joins the socalled tsotist gangs which feed parasitically off the african ghettoes or townships c the urban african personality is a personality with strong latent aggression and insufficient moderation and control d there is a strong american influence on the slang language of the gangs e there are trends towards exhibitionism a feeling of being discriminated against general suspicion of europeans outspokenness and criticism of urban policy although it is not difficult to imagine that the african in south africa feels discriminated against since he lives on reservations called bantustans must carry a pass at all times and is subject to indefinite arrest it is hard to imagine de ridders surprise at his own findings when he says that these urbanized communities seem to develop a being discriminated against type of comp ex with the result that their general perception has become so biased than in many instances they apperceive wellmeaning european motives in a totally wrong light as interesting as the south african study is what is more remarkable are the findings on other colonized people in widely different parts of the world studies by doob found considerable hostility and resentment to ward europeans among the luo ganada and zulu peoples of africa as well as among jamaicans doob noted that this tendency was particularly pronounced among the more educated natives studies of american indians by havinghurst and neugarten kluckhohn and leighton and leighton and kluckhohn found great discontent and hostility socalled acculturation studies of other indian groups such as the ojibwa hallowell caudill the chippewa barnouw and the wisconsin menowini spindler consistently show the negative impact of western culture on the personality dynamics of these people as revealed by projective tests for example cheyenne children tended to see the external world as hostile alexander and anderson furthermore studies of native and foreignborn chinese by abel and hsu showed that americanborn chinese display a high incidence of adjustment problems and greater anxiety when compared to those born in china one of doobs conclusions was that the less the contact between nonwestern people and europe the better the impact upon the natives an important exception being where the indigenous culture is similar to the invading colonizer one of the most provocative findings in the kardiner and ovessey study was the rorschach analysis done independently by goldfarb he found that per cent of the blacks studied tended to perceive mutilated human bodies or parts of bodies in the ink blots these findings were the same as those of devos and miner in a sample of algerians it should also be noted that algerians who lived in the city casbah thus having more contact with the french showed this type of projection with much higher frequency than the portion of the sample living in the countryside similar findings have been noted in the samples of japanese immigrants to america also studied by devos although there may be deeper levels of interpretation these findings again point to the existence of massive amounts of suppressed rage the findings may also suggest the projection of feelings about the mutilation of the ego under condition of domination how can we account for the universality of these findings in such widely scattered places and among such culturally and racially different people clearly the genetic explanations so favored by racist sectors of the scientific community past and present are ruled out by the wide genetic differences among the samples it is unlikely also that the members of the samples all have the same personality therefore the explanation must lie in the similarity of the social situa tions in which each of the peoples studied find themselves and the devastating impact that those social relations and processes have upon their being this impact produces the colonized mentality which was formerly said to be the selfhatred phenomena in minority groups obviously dominated men hate their oppressors as well as themselves an important question in all this is how the massive amount of hos tility and resentment is handled by the personality and by the social institutions of the native these responses are perhaps most clearly seen among those who have been more colonized than anyone else those who have physically survived the most brutal system of slavery in the history of manblack people in america we have tended not to look at black history as the history of resistance to colonization because it appeared that slavery was a relationship between individual slaveholders and slaves or landlords and sharecroppers rather than essential social relations between metropolitan white society and colonial black society in which the rapid development of the former society occasioned the veritable destruction of the latter society colonialism is the aggression at all levels physical and cultural by one society or group of societies upon another such that the existence of the colonized is subjugated to the survival of the colonizer it is a system as fanon says of organized domination where racism is but the most visible aspect of the systemized oppression of a people our former culture once living and open to the future became closed fixed in the colonial status the social group i militarily and economically subjugated is dehumanized in accordance with a polydimensional method to accomplish this of ii course the colonized must be removed from history not just from the historical records published in metropolitan europe but from the process of history itself this removal from history as albert memmi likes to say is the most serious blow suffered by the colonized the result is the destruction of the natives own systems of reference and he attempts because nothing else is left to immitate the oppressor and thereby to deracialize himself i j the united states j i of i america i my country tis of thee i bitter land of bigotry i of thee i weep i anon i this is the deeper meaning of selfhatred selfdoubt as clark and frazier have often noted blacks express their feelings of inferiority by over identification with the white society and the rejection or perhaps more acurately the negation of themselves the overdriven quest for status ambivalence about personal identity the creation of social and religious myths supermasculinity or the swaggering bravado i like to call the pimp syndrome all of these are attempts to deal with the severe ego destruction undergone by colonized man these compensations are of course by no means confined to the american black man for example the popular press recently noted that general ky changed his appearance in order to win over more of his own people gone is the dashing captain midnight look the tailored black flying suit violet scarf pearl handled to maostyled suits often these various ego compensations are unsuccessful and the result may be severe aberrations of the personality such as schizophrenia note in light of the previous remarks the productions of the following psychotics studied by myers and yochelson r e is a yearold who had an acute schizophrenic reaction after being inducted into the army i am not black or white but i am red i am john j anthonys son i am white looks at his hands no black black used to be white tried to bleach myself burning my skin with a flame thrower in tokyo j w was hospitalized when he presistently reported dreams to the police in which he saw colored women having white babies with wings he maintained that he was born in germany and that he had no negro blood in him he claimed people had put camphor and asafetida in his blood and caused him to turn black a patient whom i tested diagnosed as a severe neurotic gave the following response to the blank white card number on the thematic appreciation test after some hestitation she said this is a special white board and it has special powers and if you touch it you can become the same color as the board and its meant for people who dont like the color they are if you touch it it not only changes your skin color but also your eye color and hair color so if youre puerto rican or a negro or a chinaman you can touch this board and be a blond blueeyed caucasian there is often continuity between socalled normal and pathological cases one is able to see perhaps more clearly in the extreme cases the tendencies latent in more organized personalities for example note this comment by a schizophrenic black male in speaking about his peers in the hospital he said some of their mothers must have been direct descendants of an uncivilized section of darkest africa weaver in studying normal black children recorded how these children recollected having first discovered that they were negroes child i can remember when i was real small how children would be drawn away from me by their mothers and told that i was a black african cannibal and that black was evil child a small child came over and called me a nigger having lived in an allnegro town all my life i had never been called a nigger like that before i thought something terrible had happened to me of course i knew that i was another color but i was proud of our people until that time these comments by children remind us of the terrible impact which the school as an institution makes upon black children grier and cobbs are very correct when they say that the school evaluates the entire being of the black child when he enters and not just his competence to a black child all intellectual activity is thus alien to him the severest impact is upon the black male for it notes from a black journal by don l lee is for real yr f nnl l jlj movements thruout yrcommunities are for real the way u dress the way u walk talk and relate to each other and to

heroes an introduction to the poetry of aime cesaire by judith gleason upon a time this world was entirely tropical things took root thirsting downwards into the soil those ancient trees surged upwards into the lifegiving light this intense double verticality ceased in certain areas as slowly the cold came on ages later the ice receded and that cool customer known as western man began to expand his dominion over the things of this world those parts which had remained climactically more or less the same were stunned one morning by a cry from the beach les blancs debarquent the whites are landing so the french poet arthur rimbaud heard it and turned away from the dances in which he had been somewhat guiltily engaged hating himself for the mauvais sang inherited from his blueeyed gallic ancestors he nevertheless then made poetically the decision which would eventually lead to his abandoning of the spurious magic of poetry for trade one might imagine that negritude was born that moment on the beach sometime during the early summer of when the boy from charleville spent his season in hell at least he foresaw the process it was his metier the whites are landing the cry is echoed in aime cesaires poetic pageant commemorating the rebel who led his country to consciousnessofitself because the whites really did land the blacks whether africanborn or stranded on islands in the caribbean or crowded into city slumsmust thrust down their roots and strive again for the sun this process for which cesaire takes poetic responsibility seems historically inevitable now but when in at the age of cesaire left paris for his native martinique the poem he wrote about this decision made cultural history cesaires location on that island is what distinguishes his poetry from that of his predecessors among the french symbolists and surrealists from that of his contemporaries of african origin his geographical positiona moral position a rhetorical stanceis the first metaphorical premise of his poetic work the island is the eye of a storm of imagesrocks swamps bays caverns bluffs shingles corals tides breakers foams ships wrecks wrack heats winds stars migrating birds trees flowers insects especially fireflies reptiles birds of prey predatory fishstagnations disasters and profusions whose tropical turbulence is recorded seismographically within the volcanic core of the self and thrown out again to be reflected sidereally on the brink of beingin the transcendental world of dawn nostalgia and wild surmise in soleil serpent for example a poem from his first collection les armes miraculeuses the lie islandwith its subjective variant oeil eye and its transcendental counterpart soleil sunis king morpheme in the sightsound sequences of the key first second and final lines soleil serpent serpent oeil fascinant mon oeil the motive is repeated at gradually increasing intervals along this first line to erupt as dlles at the break in line twoas an awkward extra syllable in the last line of the poem that rarest essence wrested by poetry from despair is contained in the word bresil again placed at the cesura but this time as the crest of a perfect alexandrine the position of the morpheme lie strives for symmetry for in this poem the mood is basically optimistican affirmation in present participles of the perpetuality of the poetic process of transformation each thing is caught in the process of becoming something else now in a later poem the movement of lie and its variants would define an irregular jerky curve the locus of metaphors being imitated typographically and reinforced by staccato rhythms short parallel constructions and explosive sounds note that the poet in soleil serpent is characteristically thunderstruck but he survives voraciously in tiptop form if cesaire is an island poet leopold sedar senghor a cofounder of the negritude movement in literature is just as emphatically a part of the main interrupted only superficially by periods of french residence senghors connections with the continent of africa are as unbroken as the cadences of his verse which is to say that europeanized as senghor is he can revive the old ties easily in celebrating an aristocratic african heritage of dignified labor and rhythmical repose senghors stophes gradually uncover strata of feeling and historyhis negritudebeneath the sands and clays of the luminous countryside where he grew up where he now rulesas president of the republic of senegal but cesaires island is a volcanic surge of rock pitted with vegetation incessantly licked away by wind and sea his return is an ironic affirmation of that original sundering of man from nature which his family knew alltoohistorically as kidnapping and enslavement cesaires is the turbulent poetry of the spiritually dislocated of the damned his images strike through the net only in surrealist dreams can he reveal the unbroken sonorities of the sky with the passing of time on the island the famous return has become a refusal to abandon an intractable impoverished place where for years he has maintained the ironic power voted him as deputy and mayor of a department entirely governed by the french independence having touched africa is one storm that has seemingly passed his island by and cesaire is bitter about this feeling that his nottoocourageous countrymen have sold their birthright for a mess of potage there is something of the henri christophe about him but unlike that tyrant of haitis history the hero of cesaires recent play the poets citadel is built of words not stones and his exactions confined to the aggressiveness of language cesaires is the black_power of the imagination to a younger generation of african poets like tchikaya utamsi it is cesaire rather than senghor who is negritudes true chief of state cesaire is similarly regarded by those who care for surrealist poetry his is a late vigorous manifestation of the freedoms and aspirations of revolutionary art early recognized by andre breton as la route royale cesaires poetry has continued to blast its way through the stultifying thickness of things long after the movement itself has become a forgotten bore a surrealist prophet of the strong breed cesaire is mosaic in his ability to perform real miracles with language because grounded in the historical sufferings of a chosen people his is an angry authentic vision of the promised land but his visionary landscapes would lack their fierce precision had not nature itself tried his descriptive powers to the breaking point which is again to say that the relation between his images and his environment the ecology of his poetry cannot be ignored open almost any book of good caribbean writing the fever had left him weak but it had also heightened his consciousness of the new environment into which he had moved with the morning mists vanishing it was as though a veil had been torn away from the face of a primeval landscape the swamp carpeted with weeds buffalo grass water lilies and saffron spread out in wide and flat infinities beyond the public road this burnt brick road with its verging grass had been built up high with a deep ditch on either side and it twisted like a red snake it was the dry season and the earth had been grilled a parched brown by the sun the few clumps of blacksage ants bush and wild coffee which had survived the heat looked like leprous scars hector turned around and looked out on the reefs behind the village coconut palms grew thickly there and their fronds interlocked and formed a huge canopy above the massed undergrowth the wind has pressed against their slender trunks so insistently that many of them were bent like old mens backs birds were flying from the foreshore towards the rice fields behind the reefs pairs of curlews and spurwings and screaming parakeets cranes flapping their bleached wings lazily and above them all the wild ducks and red herons this is an environment so saturated with the energy of growth that it seems to sap the narrative strength of the fictionwriter diverting him into descriptive passages and thence into the grander conceptions of philosophy while his characters languish in their backyardspart caricature part cosmic force yet scenes such as these redolent of myriad species generate images as luminousand numerousas the fireflies these are lightning conductors by which the passions of the caribbean poet are naturally grounded when breton talks about the movement of revolt which corresponds to a friction of leaves in a forest or about the sudden aboresences of his desires his projected landscape is annihilated by its own generality and without the vehicle the tenor cannot hold in cesaires caribbean poetry all the species are invoked by name and his passion exfoliates in catalogues from the groin of the sacred mapou tree the fragile fruit of liberty depends orchids push up their gentle heads of tortured souls cassia trees convey nostalgia baobabs the clumsy strength of those who have been spiritually dwarfed bamboos rise along the road of childhood reminiscence the ceiba manifests the knotty struggle of man with his destiny the hibiscus is the sudden burst of a visionary eyeball everything on that island is emblematic each tree occasions an explosion of the imagination this forest of innocence harbours the tree of life there is nothing exotic about such a landscape when you live in it it is inescapable rather than the source of escape set in motion by cesaires angry will it becomes an intentional landscape his rocks project from the deluge like crinkly black heads under the relentless eye of the sun his towns ships shores and swamplands deteriorate his sharks and scorpions destroy his flowers exude a venomous sweetness according to an unremitting retaliatory law this is no paradise it is a punishment which will continue until the moral order has been set right as for the sweeter the grander potentialities of existence derived from the primary images these are synthetic products of the poets imagination his monsters they inhabit the brief glorious lies wherein we stretch our cramped limbs before they herd us down to the hold again but the birth of such convulsive beauty becomes progressively more difficult the title of cesaires latest collection ferrements presses itself syntactically the mature cesaire is sometimes far closer to stephane mallarme than to rimbaud in nous savoir for example the delicate balances the intricacies of sound and syntax defy shackles or irons reflects a spiritual as well as a political condition those triumphant seasons of the rarest essences in which the poet once rejoiced are either attributed to others like eluard or various freedomfighters or they are stillborn this psychological difficulty extranslation the temporal suspension of the infinitive in the title is reinforced by the ambiguity of the conjunction in the colloquial first phrase the typography reiterates the suspension a removal bitterly accentuated by the historical past tense of the verb in the fifth line yet borne along by subtle varia tions on the closed vowel sound w the fragmentary music rights itself condenses itself into two short stanzas in the first of these some impossible conditions are removed by negation to allow for the flowering of the superb image in the last it is an image of an inexpressible essence bound by a free activity of the spirit which is itself contained and accorded only a concessive potentiality to ward off disaster was the cahier which first revealed this island prometheus of tongue unbound and it is this poem for which cesaire will be remembered a masterpiece of cultural relevance every bit as important as the wasteland its remarkable virtuosity will ensure its eloquence long after the struggle for human dignity has ceased to be viewed in racial terms it is part of the poets alchemy to turn anyone who reads the cahier into a blackman with the cahier dun retour au pays natal is in many ways the obverse of that little lyric nous savoir narrow at the apexa single impulse projected over sixtysix pagesthe cahier is the entire black african world broad at its base here it is not a question of unheard melodies but rather of what kind of talk various poetic styles are here recognized as excrescences of various forms of selfdeception the cahier dramatizes a young poets search for moral integrity and its appropriate style it is the blackmans special history at once theres a contradiction such an identification is at odds with the poets purpose but the poet must always be at odds with himself in such matters for the poetic image if successful is like a short circuit the connection is transsubjective and immediate with the path of greater resistance shunted off in cesaires recent play henri christophe sums up the argument if theres one thing which irritates me every bit as much as the propaganda of the slavers its to hear our philan thropists clamor in the best spirit without doubt that all men are men and there are neither whites nor blacks who will ever be convinced that all men i say all without privilege without particular exoneration have known deportation the slave trade slavery the collective depreciation to the bestial the total outrage the vast insult that all have receivedlaid on the body the face the allnegating spit we alone madam you understand me we alone the negroes at the bottom of the pit then thats how understand it at the extreme bottom of the pit thats where we cry from there we aspire to the air to the light to the sun some have claimed that christ was a blackman more likely job was the first section is a series of prose poemssomewhat in the manner of pierre charles baudelaires crepuscules these passages are of varying lengths sometimes a long paragraph sometimes a couple of lines that dont quite have the energy to form a complete sentence each passage is introduced by the short phraseau bout du petit matinwhich means in its own elusive way something long dawned and short of noon these little prose poems convey stultification of life on martiniquesometimes by cancerous descriptions of its landscape sometimes by catalogues of the miseries of its inhabitants sometimes by boyhood reminiscences the hovel unpeeling its roof to the wind the bed they all slept in with its paws of kerosene cansironic cradle of his island race these remembered scenes are interrupted by the notion that has been plaguing the poet all along he must save his conscience by leaving paris partir leave but what would he do there exactly what he really wants to do become a sorcerer of words and island images i would say river i would say tornado i would roll like frenetic blood on the slow current of the eye of words etc and behold he is there finding death where he had expected marvels he was on the wrong track but with the resilience of youth he recovers himself confidently breaking forth in a whitmanesque poem of identification not only with his own island but with all the antilles with everywhere that his people have dispersed his imagination then seizes upon the image of toussaint louverture prisoner among the snows of the jural mountains the first afrocaribbean martyr for freedom a hero with whom he now feels entitled to identify and he improvises an ode in black and white a cascade of short phrases like a waterfall there is a tension in cesaires work between the horizontal poetry of fraternal affiliationa series of identifications of happenings of images in the process of transformationand the vertical poetry of reductionattempts to get at the truth by a series of angry stabs through the falsity of things in later poems this tension often produces the effect of a stalemate uprooting racism and racists in the united states by james and grace lee boggs march one month before the racist murder of dr martin_luther_king jr the presidents commission on civil disorders headed by illinois governor otto kerner issued its monumental report charging white racism with responsibility for the degraded conditions of blacks in this country since the report appeared white racist hostility towards blacks particularly among white workers has increased not decreased polls indicate that today fewer whites believe that blacks are the victims of discrimination and that in fact a growing number of whites believe blacks are the villains rather than the victims the obvious contradiction of the kerner report is that after diagnosing whites as responsible for racist oppression of blacks the report goes on to make recommendations for the treatment not of whites but of blacks as we pointed out at the time it is like saying that the way to keep white sheriffs policemen ku klux klansmen white citizens councilmen minutemen birchites and other american fascists from lynching any more blacks is to put the blacks to work send them to school and build some new housing developments in the ghetto the victims are the ones who need rehabilitation the villains are not even acknowledged to exist w it is of course no accident that the kerner commission did not tackle the question of white racists first of all the white moderate responsible establishment americans in tom wickers words who made up the commission are not in the habit of using their power to expose or confront the crimes and barabarism of white racists any more than the white moderate responsible germans of hitlers days were in the habit of exposing or confronting the crimes and barbarism of german racists note for example how little appears in the white moderate responsible american press today about minutemen kkksmen and birchites contrasted to the constant scare headlines about black_panthers and other black militants moreover the kerner commission including as it did such pillars of capitalism as the senior officials of north american rockwell corp litton industries general mills corp bank of america etc could hardly have been expected to undertake the kind of probe of white racism which might have led to its roots in capitalist economics and ideology so from the outset the commission made it clear that its aim was to attack the root causes of racial disorder not the root causes of racism it seems a minor difference but those planning a career in journalism should pay it special attention the one line of attackagainst the root causes of racismleads ultimately as we shall show to a revolution against the system the otheragainst the root causes of racial disorderleaves the door wide open for a counterrevolution against those making a revolution against the system for it should be obvious to anyone not blinded by racism that the root cause of racial disorders in northern cities over the last five years is the revolt against racism if blacks were ready to submit to racism there would be no racial disorder however the revolt against racism today is going off in a variety of directions because of the absence of a clear understanding within the black movement of the roots of racism to break the chains that bind them a people must understand the forces that forged and maintain those chains in the beginning the first thing we have to understand is that racism is not a mental quirk or a psychological flaw on the part of individuals racism is the systematized oppression by one race of people of another in other words the various forms of oppression within every sphere of social relationseconomic exploitation military subjugation political subordination culture devaluation psychological violation sexual degradation verbal abuse etctogether make up a whole of interacting and developing processes which operate so normally and naturally and are so much a part of the existing institutions of the society that the individuals involved are barely conscious of their operation the racist in a culture with racism is therefore normal fanon this kind of systematic oppression of one race of people by another was unknown to mankind in the thousands of years of recorded history before the emergence of capitalism years ago prior to that time racial prejudice was not unknown for example chinese in the rdcentury bc considered yellowhaired greeneyed people in a distant province as barbarians in ancient egypt the ruling group which at different times was red or yellow or black or white usually regarded the others as inferior t slave oppression had also existed in earlier times but this was usually on the basis of military conquest and the consequences eg the ancient greeks and romans did not develop a theory of racial superiority to rationalize their right to exploit their slaves just as mankind prior to the rise of capitalism had had no previous experience of an economic system which naturally and normally pursues the expansion of material productive forces at the expense of human forces so it had never known a society which naturally and normally pursues the sytematic exploitation and dehumanization of one race of people by another an organic link between capitalism and racism is therefore certainly suggested the parallel between the rise of capitalism and that of racism has been traced by a number of scholars the portuguese who were the first europeans to come into contact with africans at the end of the th and beginning of the th centuries treated them as natural friends and allies they found african customs strange and exotic but they also found much to admire in their social and political organization craftsmanship architecture etc at this point the chief technological advantage enjoyed by the europeans consisted of their navigation skills and firepower both by the way originally derived from the chinese in the next four centuries these two advantages would be used to plunder four continents of their wealth in minerals and people and thereby to increase the technological superiority of europeans by leaps and bounds africa was turned into a hunting ground for slaves to work the land of the west indies and the southern colonies which had been stolen from the indians as the slave trade expanded its enormous profits concentrated capital in europe and america for the expansion of commerce industry and invention while in africa the social fabric was torn apart in the americas the blood and sweat of african slaves produced the sugar tobacco and later cotton to feed the refineries distilleries and textile mills first of western europe and then of the northern united states the more instrumental the slave trade in destroying african culture the more those involved directly and indirectly in the slave traffic tried to convince themselves and others that there had never been any african culture in the first place the more brutal the methods needed to enforce slavery against rebellious blacks the more the brutalizers insisted that space age music by tam fiofori he above poem j hi part of a manifesto used as the sleeve notes for the album supersonic sounds on saturn records by sun ra his arkestra in initiated the primary phases of a universal musical awareness sun ra his arkestra had been investigating for years the arkestra then based in chicago was functioning as a unit dedicated to the complete mastery of the principles of sounds and its natural values as a means for retranslating sun ras cosmicequationpoems into a more assertive and accessible medium the immediate aim of the music was to communicate the beauty truths realities and the creative nature of a better tomorrow this music in its totality sun ra calls astroinfinity music and recently he defined the music as the design of another kind of world that has nothing to do with the reality of what is called today yesterday or even earth tomorrow the arkestra when performing employs multimedia devices with the musicians suitably attired in colorful spacecostumes accented by costumechanges spacehats with antennaelighttips flickering to create a representative platform from which to relate the music enacting the reality of an environmental play staged as a space age theater norman mailer writing for esquire magazine seven years ago informed the magazines readers of a unique experience once years ago in chicago i was coming down with a bad cold by accident a friend of mine took me to hear a jazz musician named sun ra who played space music the music was a little like the sound of ornette coleman but further out outer space music close to the eeee of an electric drill at the center of a harsh trumpet my cold cleared up in five minutes in i the arkestra moved to new york and quickly established itself as the main band of the subunderground providing the energy and directions for what later became stylized forms of new music in fulfilling this mu sicosocial function the arkestra u under the direction of sun ra served as the training grounds for many of the starspharaoh sanders marion brown who emerged from the underground jazz movement and directly influenced john coltrane to record t ascension and his later works the nucleus of the arkestra under sun ras guidance has continued to provide the impetus musical directions and possibilities that have helped shape the major playing styles and general musical approaches to their individual instruments and in john gilmore tenor sax pat patrick baritone sax and marshall allen alto sax the arkestra has the forerun t ners of the styles of the sixties the versatility of the members of the arkestra as very competent multiinstrumentalists has helped expand the range of sounds now being incorporated into the new music and the arkestras stay in new york has been a breath of fresh air and an infusion of a newer and more relevant lifesense and style to the music scene reaching out in its influences to touch all areas of musicjazz classical electronic hardrock and popular and as evo remarked sun ras group is what happens when astrology meets technology in the st century the musical progression of sun ra has been the building up of the arkestra and its evolution through what is termed the solar mythscience astroinfinity power hieroglyphic solar nature immortality solarscience and solarnature phases of

atlantis on saturn records we take a trip to space next stop mars black studies the work to come by ronald williams the most part try v the argument concern ing the validity of black studies belongs to the past prestigious universities such as harvard yale berkeley and stanford are establishing programs to study the history and culture of black people and since these institutions usually point the way in american education universities with lesser reputations will undoubtedly follow there is no reason to expect a different trend because the subject happens to be black in some colleges black studies programs have produced curricula that are designed to provide students with functional skills to be used in the black community and others are structured along traditional academic lines these programs have been designed by faculty and students working jointly or have been created as a result of student pressure perhaps the only significant question to be posed at this time is what kind of program an institution will develop and under what circumstances for black studies is here to stay black studies in the university yale university press a symposium held at yale university in november presents the arguments for black studies and raises important questions concerning the direction this academic quest might take in any discussion of black studies one naturally looks for the speakers to define the study and to suggest those subjects which seem to fall within its purview several of the speakers have attempted to define what the black mans exclusive domain should be and to sug gest although not always clearly areas in which blacks and whites might be able to cooperate harold cruse is convinced that the integrationist ethic has prevented blacks from developing their cultural expression the integrationist has been an oppressive mistress she recognized only one culture only one lifestyle and only one way of viewing the tenuous arrangements that make up our world she demanded that blacks become white in the only way they could which is to say that they had to see smell taste touch and hear as anglosaxons in order to express and reaffirm a white ethic by making such uncompromising demands on all foreign or different cultures the anglosaxon view has reigned supreme thereby perpetu ating its economics politics and culture for cruse blacks have only one way out of the integrationist tyranny and that is through a cultural nationalism which must form the basis of black studies blacks must determine their literary standards develop their theater and raise and discuss questions relevant to the black experience elsewhere cruse has pointed out what happens when editorial boards of magazines and theater groups are integrated with whites he has argued that in integrated groups blacks are not encouraged or permitted to seek those themes and expressions which reflect their unique historical moments frequently blacks are told that to explore and to express their experience in a style and language that are peculiar to their group is separatism and consequently bad on the other hand other nationality groups have developed their own theater and journals to discuss those issues which best define their interest cultural nationalism allows blacks to come to terms with the distinct character of their lives in a way in which only they can but cruse also seems to see blacks and whites eventually collaborating in artistic and intellectual endeavors black studies may make this cooperation possible its social function is not to replace one particularism with another particularism but to counterbalance the historical effects and exaggeration of particularism toward a more racially balanced society a society which would include expectations regarding the democratic creed p obviously the american society must be transformed in such a way that cultural groups will cooperate from positions of strength regardless of how cooperation comes about which is open to speculation the implication is that the races eventually will work together in matters of culture perhaps the implication is that an american character will be forged out of the experience of the existing cultural mix prior to considering the nuts and bolts of black studies maulana ron karenga wants to change the white cultural view that informs all that is taught it is necessary therefore to alter the frame of reference in which education takes place to redefine terms and to reinterpret many words and experiences karenga views the white culture as esteeming all that is white while negating all that is black the black frame of reference provides a positive structure in which black people study their experiences thus creating values and procedures that are meaningful for them and their lives this frame of reference or positive attitude is further strengthened by redefining words black becomes a positive and beautiful word and white indicates that which is not really happening after closely examining cruses and karengas positions one observes a fundamental similarity both men see cultural nationalism a cultural selfdetermination as being central to the study of the history and culture of black people there would no doubt be differences resardine the direction and the particular emphases within the pursuit of these studies since cruse has written more and given his position in more detail we can more easily grasp the particulars of his thinking at this time karengas thinking and stance as to emotionalism inspiration and mythology need further elaboration before one can attempt anv kind of comparison in the political and economic arenas karenga seeks economic reparation from whites and demands that blacks determine their own political destiny his position seems to restrict blacks to making political decisions about blacks for a limited time while being economically dependent upon whites karengas cultural nationalism does not go beyond political control of the black com munity and a limited economic independence since whites will continue to determine the significant economic patterns within the black community and although he tells us what political thought and models are not to be used in the black community it is not clear what po litical model will be used karenga as does cruse seems to see the coming of a kind of cooperation between whites and blacks karenga encourages whites to create a civilizing movement among themselves i dont see us coexisting until that power balance is achieved i can say that now but the intensity and quality of the struggle will really determine the relationship youve got to understand that that is why the civilizing orlets change it let me use a euphemismthe humanizing movement is so important if it works the intensity and quality of the struggle will be different than if it falls the makeup of the future depends upon the struggle itself for example me i am reallv only interested in love and study im not really interested in violence and stuff like that but here we are this is a violent world and i cant pretend i dont live in it that should be considered p for both men the present requires that blacks occupy themselves with themselves and all that concerns them and that whites turn to themselves and to the long neglected task of confronting a pluralistic world and a pluralistic america but why should expect whites to become humanized perhaps it is that after cultural nationalism has worked its wonder among blacks whites will come to respect their strength and will therefore be willing to cooperate with them yet it seems rather senseless to expect whites to change simply because blacks are the sole interpreters of their culture whites will still direct the important political and economic forces why should whites at this point in time decide to humanize themselves perhaps the answers to these questions may be found in the dialectics created by having two cultural views developing side by side i certainly do not know since these questions are crucial to the positions that implicity expect whites to change they merit serious consideration some black leaders who are organizing the black community seem to require a religious devotion of their followers it is not my intention to judge such organizational efforts the religious cultist has a long tradition within the black community there are few black people who have not been touched in some way by such figures as father divine and prophet jones the religious cult continues to play an important role among the poor and deserves serious study among the more affluent and better educated blacks the mystical leader has very little appeal and without the black middle class being involved i question whether these movements can create a unified black community it does appear that some of these movements are attempting to use faith and commitment as instruments to bring about total acceptance and submission to economic and political positions that are still in need of clarification one finds such arrangements where membership within the group determines ones politics economics and religion within tribal communities and we also read of their disintegration as africans attempt to enter the th century we must also doubt whether anyone who attempts to roll back the clock and refuses to enter the twentieth century will be successful among blacks for more and more blacks are entering colleges and universities and we do not find these young people affiliating with the cultist or strongleader movements perhaps nathan hares injunction deserves our careful attention we need to stop being just expressiveand stop making everything we do a religion for if any organization excludes the young educated black because of its refusal to be clear about its politics and economic plans then i must seriously question its ultimate efficacy within the black community and i see such an organization as becoming one more cultist groupthat will eventually languish within the very misery that it hoped to overcome gerald a mcworter and nathan hare point to the ills in american education and suggest directions for black studies theirs is a shotgun blast that recounts that evils of white education and only broadly points to the path and work that awaits black studies perhaps that is all that can be expected at this time other voices attempt to place the black experience in a historical perspective the question for martin kilson is whether the afroamerican experience falls within the human experience his answer is yesit does examining history he discovers that blacks have committed crimes against blacks that blacks pursued and profited from black slavery and that blacks continue to exploit other blacks haiti is an example of the latter he takes exception to the notion that the black mans suffering cleansed him of all evil and at the same time endowed him with a special righteousness kilson understands the political motives that inspire some to define black as virtue and white as sin although he sympathizes with the black nationalists and their motives for stating their views in politically expedient terms his intellect rejects their position anyone seriously concerned with the black struggle in america has to relate to kilsons observations he does not permit the world to be seen and manipulated as in a never produced hollywood western where the good guys wear black hats and the bad guys wear white ones his view of history intro duces ambiguity which makes it difficult to judge the past nevertheless kilsons historical perspective forces us to grapple with the past in an effort to understand it hopefully enabling us to better deal with the present kilsons way by far is the most difficult but it may be the only way sixteen papers were read at the yale symposium fifteen papers talked about and around black studies and these voices were necessary if for no other reason than to place the defense of black studies and the need to rationalize black studies behind us robert farris thompsons paper the sixteenth one will be remembered for his paper is black studies thompson unveils those artistic threads that connect africa with black america he not only discusses the racial attitude that has suppressed african art in america but gets on with the job of describing afroamerican art and tracing its history in america in livingston county missouri henry gudgell an afroamerican carved a walking stick that is quite similar to tribal staffs found in west africa the afroamerican potters of south carolina produced distinctive ceramics that combined european and african influences from tidewater georgia to lafayetteville new york thompson shows us what black american artists have done he presents his material in a clear concise and thoroughly exciting manner i have always thought of art history as a dull undertaking something to be endured and seldom enjoyed in thompsons hands art history is enlightening and a pleasure to read the yale symposium was a necessary experience it is now behind us and all of us who are laboring in black studies have the awesome responsibility of setting to work in the end we all know that black studies is the work to come black pride some contradictions by ann cook have listened with excitement to plans that have been sketched by some very bright and dedicated black minds for an allencompassing scc black not blackfront communications network the prospects of having a powerful black multimedia that transmits another set of values and the truth of what is happening and what must happen is encouraging after all we can not really expect the man who is the enemy to provide us with the tools that will spell his doom yet to get such a vast project into full operation will take many years in the meantime we need to take stock of our present predicament how far if at all have we moved psychologically and intellectually since the new black awareness began what values do we hold what values should we begin to embrace many experts black and white are using newspapers and the airwaves to assess the plight of africans in this country and to direct us down the proper path to liberation i do not claim to be an expert mine will be a laymans opinion but then i do believe that it is the layman africans opinion that must be listened to more often by those who would liberate us for this evaluation two areas need comment the first area might be called white values in black face a most blatant and vulgar example of this was beamed to television viewers on like it is on sunday august on a show featuring black models and black fashions i shall ignore the fact that most of the black models preferred to sell their blackness to white agencies that is another essay what really pained me was the elaborate fashion show of clothing in african prints and styles now i would be the first to admit that there is nothing sacred about most african cloth itself indeed much of what is pawned off to us as african prints has never seen africa but our turn to africa should hopefully be for the richness of its culture an awareness of which can enable us to smooth out the rough spots of what we have stubbornly held on to we would look to the heart of africa for a purge of decadent western values for a new philosophical and spiritual base in short for regeneration but what did these proud american african designers show us directly inspired by africa there was even a west african model making it all very african models slithered past the cameras in african print bikinis they wiggled by in hiphugging african print bellbottoms miraculously held up by the models pelvic bones and if enough western style sex was not marketed with those there were the moslem long dresses and coats that were transparent such irony recall the islamic codes for women caucasians especially the united states variety are noted for their ruthless destruction of the cultures of others whatever parts they can reach and their vulgarization of what remains are we so suicidal that we must destroy ourselves and for what the other examples to be mentioned of white values in black face are not as damnable and will probably sort themselves out in time both have to do with the tendency now to break away from white ac tivities and organize our own modelling the affair after that of the whites in other words it is the tendency to simply counter white activities instead of creating black ones as a response to the winter olympics a few years ago for example a group in new york organized black snow we also have black beauty contests but the format of the competition is haunted to the bone by atlantic citytiered crowns queenly robes do african queens wear robes and all there are those who would argue that an abrupt departure from the american way would cost us converts perhaps so i will not argue that point here let us just hope that all who organize and partici pate in the contests whether actively or passively understand the carbon copy nature of most of our black awareness activities as for the african fashions the first and by far the most treacherous of the white values discussed i can not be charitable at all the black designers selling blackness so cheaply must be loudly and roundly condemned the second area that seems to need attention is one so pervasive that to attempt to localize or isolate examples leads to a certain amount of distortion properly we can label the area antiblackness or the subtle selfhatred of aware africans a not so subtle example of this antiblackness juts out at us from the words and actions of our latest crop of vanguard liberators once again as if history has taught us nothing we have become blackfronts taking money and orders from our great white fathers who amply reward us by giving us all the publicity we think we need as they make us sound tough and affectionately call ourtheir new leader a quintessential american old uncle tom has come back as a city slicker again we are being duped by people who tell us that the antiafricanismand i deliberately say antiafricanism here and not antiblackness that runs rampant throughout this world its poisonous fangs pricking even the most well meaning souls this problem of antiafricanism we are told must take a backseat to karl marxs priorities it is far easier to deal in that nebulous world than to turn inward and unite and build ourselves i will dare to go further even though i identify with the other colored peoples of this world since we all share a common exploiter and i know that being the majority of the worlds population we should unite to defeat this man i still have the sneaking suspicion that much of the third world embrace is yet another unconscious desire not to deal with africa itself and with ourselves as we finally must i heard a very passionate denouncement of the united states for its involvement in latin america by an american african when asked his feelings about us involvement in africa his face showed bewilderment what involvement the most fantastic irony that comes out of this new third world thrust is that again we are seeing more and more distinctly african young people walking around wearing indian headbands especially in new york remember the preblack awareness days me im part indian another more subtle antiafrican tendency is becoming apparent in the bush afro we do not mind wearing an afro if we have the kind of hair that can make a bush or if our straightening comb can help us out so again it is good hair afros that is really what afrosheen raveen and all the other complex kits of sprays are all aboutgetting the kinks out admittedly there is grave danger in bringing up the question of hair and skin color when we need more than anything else to become united and are finally moving in that direction and we also rightly fear that emphasizing this color contradiction will lead to a rejection of all but the most jet black and the kinkiest headed as the beauty symbols a reversal there is a clear and present danger that frank discussion of this contradiction can in fact be divisive but we cannot become truly unified until we sift out this problem although i do not subscribe to the belief that slavery and colonialism left us dehumanized far from it i do believe however that in the area of colorconsciousness we have been brutally scarred as i traveled through latin america during the summer of the enormity of the antiafrican complex was dramatized i saw so many parallels to the selfhatred tendencies we know so well here somehow although intellectually we know better we suppose that language will make us different we assume that those africans in this hemisphere who were enslaved by the french or the dutch or the spanish or the portuguese would have been impressed with a different mentality from ours at least we feel they would certainly not have directly translatable phrases like those that are so much a part of our culture but no matter whether the language of the countries i visited was english french spanish dutch or portuguese there were phrases for good hair and for marrying light to improve the race as well as others we would immediately recognize here i noticed the same phenomenon in the speech of educated africans during my two years in africa your hair is your crowning glory a dear friend always warned me in panama a very prominent black man told me of his heartbreak when the mother of the girl he wanted to marry prohibited the arrangement chiding the girl for not having any ambition he was not a bum he was too dark eurobrazilians like many other caucasian latin americans who claim to be color blind have intricate gauges to see just how african ones features really are there it is quite all right to have african blood if it does not show the more caucasian the person looks the more readily he will boast to a black foreigner of his negro blood i had one of the most amusing experiences of my life when i visited a prominent brazilian scholar and his wife in their home along with a white american couple in the course of that inevitable discussion about the race problem in this country the brazilian turned to me with his face beaming with pride ann he said im going to tell you something that will surprise you i waited my grandmother was a negro his face and gestures were saying to me now what do you think of that i looked at him warmly and said oh that doesnt surprise me at all it shows in your features he panicked no no no he shouted shaking his head furiously i dont have a single negro feature by now his entire body was in contortions shaking his finger in rhythm with the other movements he assured me not one and of course he had measured his skull and his nose and his lips as so many in the twilight zone do he hurriedly began to pull up his sleeves as he said of course we latinsthe sunyou know we get tanned i never said a word the house fell absolutely silent in their white embarrassment i laughed like a sonofagun because these countless categories are set to label each african men in the twilight zone put vaseline on their hair and brush it to make it lay down one man in recife whom i would have sworn was just a plain white man told me of the care he has to take with his hair slicking it down the more african the man or boy the shorter the haircut the desire is to try to score plus marks in some category if the hair does not pass the test maybe the skin will or the nose or the skull shape and hopefully always the lips one successful mulatto businessman from surinam lamented african blood is so strong it just seems to come through anyway its stronger than any other blood in his case he pointed out he was only part african yet look at his features he moaned and in belem brazil one hears of a brilliant young female economist whose skin is very black my informant said that the young lady was sorry her hair would not bouffant she is by the way single in that land where marrying light to improve the race is indeed a seriously practiced doctrine this bright economist went shopping for a car and ordered one that was completely white inside and out including sidewalled tires she threw a tantrum when the car arrived not conforming to her specifications for four months she lay in the hospital after she seriously burned her skin trying to bleach herself with a soda solution she now walks around with white powder on her face and a blond wig on but many brazilian african women would not have tried to be beautiful since women as obviously african as that economist would normally have known that they did not stand a chance most would have resigned themselves to being very bright brazilians readily admit that the africans in brazil are by far the most intelligent members of the citizenry but can this young woman who tortured herself so completely to become white simply be dismissed as a mental case is she really exceptional or is it that her manifestations of her antiafricanism are the exception surely we are torturing ourselves here just as hazardously we sing im black and im proud but we are far from convincing to be sure the healthiest african minds i have met in this hemisphere belong to the socalled bush negroes of the interior of surinam some africans in paramaribo the capital city creoles they are called feel the bush negroes would be helped if they were referred to as the bush creoles thus making them a group mixed with that sought after european blood the djukas one of the bush negro tribes in the interior would not have been flattered at all by the offer from bukra slaaf the white mans slave when the djukas saw me in their villages invariably they pointed to my afro and praised it lavishly most of the djukas were without western education until recently because most villages refused to allow missionaries entry relatively isolated they have kept their values pretty free of western influences and unlike the brazilian african who has also retained much of the obvious traits of african culture the bush negro is very strongly attracted to africa and africans i was warmly received everywhere a ghanaian was given a thunderous reception when she visited there mothers tried to give her their babies to take back to africa a gesture not to be taken lightly since children are adored in their society it would have been an honor for the child one mother at stolemaneisland became very attracted to me as i became to her and her child upon my departure she tried to give me her son the child was without a doubt far better off there besides her symbols were a bit mixed up america is not africa i was honored as i was to be often throughout the trip by such warmth but i must sound an ominous note i must report that cutouts of white models from european and brazilian magazines that flood latin america can now be found on the walls of a new djuka school everywhere else except in the interior of surinam even in urban africa we are having to convince ourselves that thick lips broad noses and kinky hair accompanying that nowacceptable black skin can be beautiful harry belafonte and lena horne have hastily been painted black and afros have been put on their heads the stereotypical aunt jemima still goes the way of the brazilian economist it is even argued and with much validity that african men are embracing the third world concept not only for ideological reasons nor to avoid the concrete task of organizing black people the suggestion is that third worldism provides a wider field for getting to a miss ann type without the caucasianworshipping africans real motive being detected this next and final point in the area of antiafricanisms is admittedly a very ticklish one it has to do with the practice of islam i speak of it very reluctantly because first of all some of the africans in this country whom i admire and respect tremendously are converting to islam second racist historians have through the centuries tried to change the map of africa making north africa an extension the sound of soul by larry neal garlands till book the sound of xt soul is primarily concerned with the sixties she has written an important book anybody seeking cogent information on soul music should check it out more books like this one are neededmore books that go into the music in even greater depths than this one and even with its obvious limitations this is an important book because black music particularly soul music is one of the most outstanding cultural forces operative in todays world and somebody has got to begin to confront the subject with the kind of seriousness attempted by sister garland in order to do this and make it useful to black people it is necessary that those who consider themselves intellectual architects of afroamerica look at the living culture in the most penetrating terms possible this means reaching deep inside of ourselves into concrete experience and shifting memory and giving as much weight to experience as we give to theory particularly the theories laid on us by the euroamerican black music demonstrates that culture is essentially a living reality many of us seem to think that black culture is something outside of ourselves some ancient magical force that we must go through all kinds of changes to obtain when in fact the culture is within allah and ogun are within sprawling cities of kush the ritual and dahomey shines eternal song we carry these within us they are manifested in the living culture we are the continuation of black memory our songs are the emanations of that memory our rhythms the force that drives that memory bessie smith sang that the meanest folks in the whole wide world lives on black mountain she was singin bout niggers evil and bad but surviving in spite of everything niggerblack black music niggersthe nigger in the music being its dominant force all and everything is in black priests scientist warrior slave cullud negro negro african africanamerican asiatic afroamerican brother but it is nigger energy that will rule b b king has more to tell me about the world that i can use than most poets and intellectuals here he is talking to phyl garland blues is b b king yes and ive been a crusader for it for years without this i dont think i could live very longnot that i think im goin to live a long time anyway but i dont think i could live even that long if i had to stop playin or if i couldnt be with the people i love so the people that have helped me so much i couldnt live i try to give them a message i try hard how many of us are so dedicated to whatever it is that we do how many of us commit ourselves so thoroughly to our work how many of us link our work to the survival of both ourselves and our people sister garlands interview with b b king is one of the most penetrating pieces in the book because it basically concerns the man stripped down to his most human core and we learn so much about our cultural heroes this way in order for the culture to really be a force for liberation we must feel it manifested in our daily lives it must breathe sing or dance to take us to a more profound understanding of the nature of the spiritual truths that we have inherited not dead scriptures but rather living revelations and visions that are thrust upon us daily sometimes they be rough edged and raw with pain therefore given a world in which we could create free of the manipulations of the beast the most positive forces in that world would be black artists and not the dead texts of the world that now rule our lives and shape our visions not the dead texts that now dominate us wearing us down and splitting us apart from each all of the moral and philosophical visions that are to be imagined can find expression in black art we will write our own scriptures we will seek validation of the truths that we sense must exist in the holiest work of each one of us from spirits like b b king jimmy reed son house james brown smokey robinson moms mabley an ethnic will be fashioned whose fundamental truths can be denied by no one could this be one of the ultimate goals of third world culture because in the coming technological age art will be one of the few paths open to the humanization of mankind it will come full circle back to the most functional purposes of art art as the civilizer and judge of man the struggles of third world peoples will birth a new moral and artistic philosophy and this new moral and artistic philosophy will govern the uses of the advanced technology for the curve of history is not merely toward the material liberation of man but is also towards his spiritual liberation as well to merely perceive the dynamics of historical change in material terms is to set up the possibility of constructing more novel more insidious forms of human oppression and black art must essentially aim toward the elimination of human oppression both spiritual and material we will write our own scriptures the bible the book of tao the koran l ching book of the dead the dliammapada the upanishads all contain essential truths about the nature of human existence they contain myths ideas and modes of thought that can be integrated into a newer more profound perception of existence but all of these paths to god have been corrupted and uprooted by the force of change the expanding social universe technology we want the essence of these works not the old forms out of which they come so we must extract out of these dead texts those truths that are of compelling significance and black music points in the direction of what will be of compelling significance it is impossible for these texts to be relevant to this and future generations when the orientations which first created them have ceased to exist as a force on this planet new scriptures are in order new mythologies new constructs black music as the model for the black nation black art must be the reincarnated accumulation of all of the worlds positive moral values all that is useful and that moves toward concrete human liberation we are a new species of man child liberation will come out of honkytonk bars gutbucket blues and the meanest niggers that have ever walked the planet saw bobby blue bland singing uptown he had on a silver dashiki and his process the current soul music explosion illustrates the mass culture of black america is still strong and still dominated by the eternal spirit of the blues god soul music is a compelling force it is highly collective in nature embracing all of black america and as b b king says we must respect it artistic liberation will come out of a reshaping of the familiar gospels blues and cosmic music all of the strands and jive categories of black music will begin crisscrossing and intermeshing together towards something resembling a new form a unity music pharoah sanders leon thomas junior walker roland kirk sun ra the impressions the temptations are already showing the way at the point when the music has finally destroyed its bullshit categories and is in fact a unity music most of us will then know that we are a nation a people with an operational identity and committed to total liberation niggers will then invent new terms to describe their essential history and prehistory all of that untapped energy indicated in black music will be released and turned in the direction of making a world in which love can exist freely and cleanly thats whats happening thats what always has been happening as we move song after song cycle unto cycle we will drag with us the accumulated wonder pain and memory of our prior lives it is time for the niggers the fellahs the kaffirs the coolies to purify the earth with funkier images listen to soul music listen to the collective will of black people to survive on their own terms love them for the most part they love you straight ahead sister phyl garland next time give yourself more timeor take it next time let more hangout for example what are the social conditions under which the music is created how does the music interact with dance styles life styles beyond making a living what are the artists mostly concerned with why is there so little control of the economics of black music by black people does the mafia really control motown are there many white ar men fucking with the music what do the artists have to say about this does the soul musician see himself as merely a performer whose role is to simply entertain or are they goaded on like b b king and nina simone by a larger social purpose these are just a few of things that black music criticism could explore more work like the sound of soul is badly needed because it is finally the living culture that will show the way by that i mean this if we can not confront and shape the culture that black people have developed here in a merica we will fail to bring about a real spiritual revolution among black people we will be doing the cakewalk and the people will be doing the popcorn thank you sister garland for putting something worthwhile out there ream p by eloise greenfield delores was upstairs v irx in the bedroom nurturing her daydream when she heard alber mw ta come in the front door a few minutes earlier she had been sitting on the side of the bed reading again the free ticket from the recreation center her pass to see lonnie and the barons at the openair theater she had rubbed her thumb across the surface of the paper admiring its power to transport her into another world and the anticipation of such terrifying joy had exploded suddenly like cherry bombs inside her she was propelled into the middle of the bed bouncing and laughing aloud kicking her feet in the air as if she were still a little kid then she lay back her madness dispelled allowing herself to slide into the daydream she had been creating since she received the ticket feeding it more of herself each time it enveloped hermore of her longing her need lonnie would fall in love with her he wouldnt care that she was still skinny and almost flatchested at fifteen or that she was a year behind in school somehow even in the dark crowded amphitheater he would see the love in her eyes and he would say how you doing lores over the mike in an offhand supercool way without her even telling him her name and that would be their beginning this time she added that he would invite her up to watch the show from the wings and all her friends would gaze with envy as she strolled down the long aisle the closing of the door downstairs was a distant sound and in tangibly ominous then she remembered that alberta hadnt been wearing her girdle when she went out she hadnt even bothered to put on one of her floppy shirts to hang outside her skirt she had worn a white knit blouse tucked inside a skirt that was stretched into wrinkles by the swell of her stomach incongruous with her slender legs and arms it was as if delores thought she had decided to face their mother and the rest of the world all in one long torturous day this was the moment delores had been dreading during the weeks of late nights that she had watched from bed pretending to be asleep as her sister peeled off her girdle and sighed sliding her hands under and over the bronze roundness before she smoked a last cigarette and went to bed delores heard her mother downstairs ask as if by rote part of a compulsory ritual you look for work today and under albertas sullen yeah she could hear the apprehension even with steps between them but she knew it wouldnt reach her mother find any no the silence was long delores could imagine her mothers face gentle dark brown heart with soft eyes soft mouth that had tensed at albertas entrance now gone slack with shock then you pregnant again girl the words were spaced with heavy gasps you pregnant again and that boy upstairs aint even hardly two years old yet delores closed the bedroom door and went over to the open window she leaned on the sill and looked out at the sky above the multiindented glutted garbage cans and the grey dirt yards with occasional haggard patches of halfgreen trying to recapture her daydream but dark summer clouds were growing in the sky and all she could think of was the buckets she should be setting out to catch the rain that would drip through the leaks bringing with it flecks of plaster closing the door didnt shut out what was going on downstairs delores knew from the memory of past crises each a rehearsal for the next the various forms this one would assume before it subsided at this moment alberta would be shifting her weight from one foot to the other looking bored except for the plea behind the veil of her eyes while her mother floundered between pain and fury her mother would threaten to slap alberta windingthough she never would she would remind her of how hard she had worked all the years since she was widowed so that they could make something of themselves and how she had never allowed any man before or after her husband to touch her she would point out how much less marriageable alberta was now she would talk on and on as if the eush of words could erode the growth in her daughters womb on and on until the plea in albertas eyes hardened into a kind of hatred the first slow raindrops struck delores hand and she closed the window she decided to wait until the last minute and then to run for the buckets in the cellar postponing her involvement in the scene downstairs delores understood her mother she had seen her come home from the laundry many nights so tired that the fork would tremble in her hand at dinner she had heard her laughter that was often impure fused with tears of loneliness she remembered how things had been for all of them before her father died yet she not only understood alberta she sometimes felt that she was albertaa second alberta following three years behind the original toward a trail of transient men chubby unwanted babies and spiritwithering jobs in a search for air like now she wanted to fling out her arms knocking away the torn onceblue shades over windows that wouldnt remain all the way up in summer yet wouldnt seal in winter the leaky ceilings the schoolprison in which she sat daily while her brain hopped from one instruction to another from one book to another leaving her behind in its pursuit of meanings the ragged balls of newspaper that having been read or soaked a childs urine from a floor or hung on the jags of a broken window blocking out the wind and rain now rolled about on the sidewalks she longed to breathe to inhale with her whole body new air to feel the way alberta looked when she danced when alberta danced she was up high where coolness caressed the nostrils she was free eyes tightly closed arms and legs swinging loose hips defying constraintanswering only to the demands of the throbbing music sometimes she would dance with the baby in her arms twirling him until he was almost out of breath with giggling but when the beat ended and she opened her eyes she would hand the baby to delores and leave across the sky the downpour was approaching and delores ran for the buckets with a prayer that it wouldnt rain the next day and cancel the show u u p the air in the special recreation department bus was muggy it had rained all night and part of the day not stopping until late afternoon but now the sky was clear and delores was relieved to be on the bus with the other kids on her way to the amphitheater somebody played a transistor radio and two couples danced in the aisle disregarding the drivers orders delores had expected her best friend ann to sit with her on the bus but somehow tommy had squeezed between them at the door and taken the seat instead short too quiet tommy who liked her his presence disturbed her branded her for herself and others as being unworthy of more dynamic attention she ignored him and joined in the fun around her while watching strip who sat with a girl across the aisle his arm was curved around the girls shoulder and his fingers dangled nervously an inch from the point of her breast under delores jealousy ran a vicarious tingling at the possibility that his hand would brush against the girl and she giggled excessively at the jokes being passed around until she left the bus and was walking toward her seat delores had been almost satisfied with her appearance her dress was a sleeveless print that had once been albertas and except for armholes that were a little too large and would expose her slip if she raised her arms it was a good fit but now she saw that compared to the other spectators she and her friends looked bedraggled and they drew together walking to their seats in a silent huddle like a giant dowdy earthworm in her daydream delores had seen the amphitheater as a traditional moviehouse picked up from its main street location and set down in the park and the unexpected treewalls and starred sky roof dwarfed awed her crickets chirped a competitive background to the comedian and the girl gospelsinger who were the preliminary acts on the show delores waited not listening willing her emotions into a state of suspension for lonnie barrage of screams four gold suits flashing onstage drums lonnie at the mike why why why did you go did you leave three pairs of arms swing up back out bodies swayingstep forward step back turn around clap turn around clap sweet sweet guitar its a brand new worold lights spinning orange blue purple spinning pur pie purple ann singing softly voices whiningsing to me lonnie baby ohhh shit now oh my lord screams exploding hands jackets off flaming green shirts sleeves flowing seats and people shrinking sliding away lonnie singing for her to her oohooh babay babay baabaaa going higheraaaa shrieks from far away coming in wavesaaaahigher stretching stretchingstrange tickleitch in her breasts and throbbing between her thighsaaaay sliding down to its finish endless scream of ecstatic painhers oh lonnie lonnie she stared out the window all the way back to the recreation center she felt a quiet quietsomethingunshatterable in the clamor on the bus she felt insulated somehow made forever invulnerable by what had passed between lonnie and her she walked home with ann chattering at her side they said goodnight at anns house and delores walked on to hers four doors down the tinny sound of water dripping in a recently emptied bucket greeted her as she unlocked the door although it hadnt rained for several hours the dripping would continue throughout the night delores could imagine countless plotting drops of water gathered in a puddle on the roof trickling down between the walls of her house and mrs stones next door and across the first floor ceiling until they found an opening to squeeze through that you lores her mother asked coming from the kitchen her voice sounded as if it were caught in a pocket of her throat her eyes were red and delores rememberedalberta was pregnant again in bed she thought about lonnie and about herself she knew that lonnie hadnt actually sung to her that the dream was just an illusion but the new air she had breathed was real lonnie and the music the trees the stars had all been real and for the first time in her life she had felt the way al berta looked when she danced but she wasnt alberta she was delores for her there must be there had to be other tastes of airand other dreams of europe and therefore of the civilized world that africans south of the sahara were instrumental in the development and perpetuation of the north african civilizations there can be no doubt yet these same africans in their often small kingdoms south of the sahara when they did accept islam and other aspects of north african culture syncretized it with indigenous religious beliefs as of course they still do my question is why really do we embrace islam as a reaction to christianity because of the religious tenets these i can accept because it can unify africans i seriously question that if we mean to also include africans of africa in this unity drive i wonder if in addition to our choosing islam as a rejection of christianity and for its tenets we are not also accepting it because of its legitimacy by the same token i wonder why we spend so much of our discourse about africa emphasizing the great kingdoms of songhai bornu ghana and mali could it be because these kingdoms were similar in structure and size to european ones and serve as reassurance to us that we had the same thing they had even when as with islam these kingdoms were not the norm my point is that we still cannot deal with black africa with pagan africa from whence most of us came somehow we suspect that what they have taught us so well about black africa is really sound after all these africans did not have a writing system except for the moslems who were not the majority they worshipped fetishes they were organized by and large into small societal bodies it is easier to embrace islam than to begin to look seriously at traditional african religions to find what those concepts are and which ones attract us and are in fact malleable for our situation here again it appears we have been reluctant to look closely at ourselves we are also too lazy often to take close looks i have heard revolutionary music and read revolutionary plays with what was represented as african languages in the text but it was simply mumbojumbo just like hollywood would do it not even one word or pharse was authentic harsh echoes of tarzan and the westerns with the injun talk are reverberating as i conclude by offering some suggestions i will admit that my criticism touches various thrusts of black liberation efforts already one reader of a draft of this has accused me of moving in the direction of advocating antiquity cults i admit that i could not deal with his comments because when i hear the words cult and dialect in the racist way they are usually employed various kinds of bells and buzzers automatically go off in my head effectively impairing my power of reasoningafrican cults african dialects black_power cults negro dialect or patois as though the standard language form is not also a dialect but aside from that the question of whether or not i want africans here to transfer from africa lock stock and barrel all of its culture f can clearly respond to black africa has cosmological beliefs that are very similar just as the life styles the dress patterns the languages all share a common mold yet in this unity there is diversity in terms of specific rendering of the cultural patterns f am suggesting that we try to get to the essence of african culture the tarppings are not as important and i am suggesting more there is absolutely no substitute for hard organizing we can not escape it f have been convinced of that by my observations of the ascria movement in guyana and of the movements president eusi kwayana a giant of a man various dramatic programs such as the black manifesto on reparations certainly educate us by exposing the contradictions we did not know were there but whatever hard cash we need for psychological reasons must come from us we must be organized to think in terms of relying on ourselves we must think in terms of building and sustaining our own institutions a herculean task for organizers it requires a discipline we momentarily lack and an orientation too few of us have our leaders are still looking for easy ways out we will hardly get the orientation that is necessary unless we can take that long look at ourselves as has been suggested over and over in this essay in the absence of a powerful media to be our mirror there seems little substitute for travel to get out of this territory is to get a breath of clean air and to put everything into perspective but more we must see that there is a circular link of africans little here gives us even an inkling of that fact the west is aware of the vast potential we have as a people it is for that reason that we have been kept so cleverly fragmented the publicized enmity between american africans and west indian africans and between the western hemisphere africans and the africans of our motherland has certainly been a vast and successful propaganda ploy we have been so demoralized by this trickery that all of us move timidly with each other the african visiting from africa is very cautious when we visit africa or latin america we build a wall with the same caution from all indications the ploy has worked more on us than on any other africans we have no real i idea what affection our brothers and sisters all over feel for us here we are not told in any of the media of the various ways they move to demonstrate their support and affection this news is effectively blotted out to keep us feeling isolated nor do we realize how much small hardworking well organized groups are doing in many countries to strengthen black people and to build solidarity amongst us all assuming that we are the baddest we spend little time in healthy interchange with groups that could teach us so much as we give them insights all africans would readily acknowledge however that in a real sense we here are the baddest since we are to be sure at the vultures beak in many ways we have fortunately protected ourselves from americas hangups in one crucial way we have not and we must immediately purge ourselves when we travel it must be american style with a maximum of material comfort this means that we live in luxury hotels and become tourists since that luxury hotel environment dooms us psychologically and cuts us off in actual fact from all but caucasians or their types but we do have problems there is the problem of heat insects bad water strange food and language barriers to deal with the last obstacle to our nontouristy travel first language is probably wise language is not as much a barrier as we fear if we really want to communicate you will find nothing but goodwill on the part of our brothers who will go to all ends to try to understand us a djuka boy in suriname just could not understand how both of us could look alike and not be able to understand each other he set in to try to teach me djuka he would never have tried so tirelessly with a caucasian even when i have insisted that i just did not understand and was ready to give up there has always been that brave soul in every country who would not let me be so cowardly i am not suggesting that we should deliberately move about without knowing the languages of the countries we plan to visit there should be some knowledge of the languages if it is possible i have not meant to imply that everything will run as smoothly if you do not speak the language as it will if you do in nine weeks in latin america i gathered far more vital information than many of the white researchers i met there who were studying us yet i missed so much that i would have gained had i spoken the language of the people as was indicated above there are times your nerves fail or you become so frustrated that you want to retreat but i have learned far more on what for me have been informal trips and have met far more beautiful people than i ever would have had i lived in big hotels and not ventured out language or no the other problems for the american africans are far more grave than the language barrier they center around the need for material comfort america has made us so soft that many of us honestly cannot survive outside an american type environment notice how we always come back to this place we honestly do need airconditioning we cannot survive the greedy mosquitoes and other worrisome insects the latest trend is to move about from our airconditioned living rooms and bedrooms to our airconditioned cars to airconditioned offices the new genocide will not be a very expensive operation for the man he will not need to fire a single bullet nor to populate a single camp why he will only need to blow his hot breath on us and watch us as we affected by the heat from his mouth melt and die before his eyes we need comfortable beds we could never sleep on benches as many of the nationbuilders in guyana have accustomed themselves to doing enabling them to sleep anywhere i hasten to say that i am not suggesting that we sleep on benches before i lose all readers forthwith but i have good reason to believe that many students are now not so frightened by the prospect we expect room service and are happiest with european food especially hot dogs and hamburgers therefore perhaps some intermediate stops before leaving this territory will help toughen us for profitable travel abroad i propose trips to the rural south first bypass atlanta and that fabulous ho tel go to the country to little towns like my hometown buena vista georgia someone has suggested getting northerners down to rural areas and having them pick cotton shake peanuts pick peaches etc with our brothers and sisters there it is a good idea it would certainly force us into another physical environment and just as travel abroad will solidify us with our brothers so would close communication with the rural southerner it would probably help some of us to begin for the very first time in our lives to eet the sense of community so pitifully artificial no matter the efforts in northern cities still another obstacle keeps the american africans from traveling abroad modestly and so meeting more local people just as the fashions we ape are those that new york paris and london sell to us by way of madison avenue so are the aspirations and tastes we struggle to acquire those that are made glamorous to us by the powerful multimedia we want when we finally are able to travel to travel executive fashion firstclass all the way because these trappings have been dangled in our faces for so long more than anything in the world we want to experience them we should work hard on ourselves also to extricate ourselves from our feelings of superiority we exist in a country that is highly technical but there is absolutely nothing superior about us nothing it will be difficult not to feel superior at times when a certain amount of adulation and wonderment is being heaped upon you by those who see the united states as the most wonderful place in the universe a portrayal beamed to all the world by u s multimedia and reinforced by those been tos who have come here to visit or reside and needs to enhance their prestige upon their return to their homes this is why we must work on our ego needs as much as possible before departing many people will simply welcome us because we are their brothersnot cousins as mboya suggestedand because we are involved in a liberation movement this group will be able to detect those unwarranted superior feelings immediately and while they may or may not react directly to them they will nevertheless shift to a white relationship with us but the same will be so when we go to the rural south the same currents will be present this is why the south provides such an excellent dryrun for latin america and africa until now the word revolution has not been used in this essay do we have black pride before we can begin to think that a revolution is near that question must be answered affirmatively the answer can not be affirmative when we have only begun the discussion of values and have no machinery for transmitting them it can not be an affirmative answer when we are spending more time with theatrics than with hard unglamorous organizing it can not be said that we have black pride or that a revolution is near when we are still no matter the elaborate disguises trying to be white to have black pride will mean redefining blackness to redefine blackness necessitates examining what we are and sorting it out deciding what should be retained and strengthened and what should be cast aside redefining blackness necessitates removing the artificial boundaries that now exist amongst all africans by thrashing out the contradictions that created them we would then rip down the artificial boundaries of class complexion agethe latest hangupand territorial limits to see that we do have resources and that these resources do not in any way need to be legitimized by the nonafrican world we need only one stampour own with our solidarity assured we can move as a strong force instead of in our usual role of junior partner flunky and the other recognizable slots joining forces with whatever people we choose ann cook author of the article black pridesome contradictions is currently doing formal study and library research for a book project of a proud poetic ship in irons but the open organic form of the cahier permits the development of these tendencies seriatim here is selfexpression maximized he is himself he is all the potentiality of gifted youth a perfect vehicle for the expression of the confined potentiality of his weary race who are we really we blackmen he now asks and the poem moves forward into a series of jerky dance stepspunctuated by the refrain voum rooh ohin which the poet celebrates his favorite pagan frenzies in a headdress of parakeet feathers a spit in the face of the missionaries for once but is not all this also a lie the phrase bout de petit matin limps forward again slightly truncated it is the morning after the poet is hung over it is the filthy end of the world the end of a hundred years of whiplash what sort of words go with these realities the catalog of exotic transformations is replaced albeit reluctantly by a catalogue of base occupations and indignities no we have never been amazons of the king of dahomey he says never princes of ghanathereby poetically establishing his heritage by renouncing it weve been lackeys shiners of shoes but by we doesnt he still in a sense mean they there follows an individual confrontation the harrowing description of a single black observed in the streetcar along with others in the car the poet has found him comic and ugly such is the extent of his complicity with the white world such is the extent of his cowardice and the old dream of cannibalistic cruelties he cannot resist giving his apocalyptic exoticism another go these are replaced by sarcastic acknowledgments of his newfound humility reclaim for my face the brilliant praise of expectoration a new movement is again introduced as an extended answer to an abrupt question but what strange pride suddenly illuminates me this is the ecstatic hymn to negritude uttered in the fraternal presence of all the fresh things of nature all beginnings summoned to participate in the recreation of the black self here the poet speaks what are to become his most famous lines litanies of acceptance alternate with supplications for sorcerers powers to transform his island his it plunges into the red flesh of the soil it plunges into the ardent flesh of the sky it bores through the opaque prostration of its upright patience eia for the royal kailcedrat eia for those who have never invented anything for those who have never explored anything for those who have never tamed anything but they abandon themselves possessed to the essence of every thing ignorant of surfaces but possessed by the movement of everything v heedless of taming but playing the game of the world islanders his race by the arts of language into manifestations of pride and beauty suddenly further life and force assail him the expansion of his being has reached mystical proportions and the resources of his language are no longer sufficient to his task he feels the seismic pulse of the island in his embrace he sees prophetically the future of the negro race which he expresses in a cadenza of simple statements beginning with the word debout upright in the hold upright in the cabins upright on the bridge upright in the wind upright in the sun upright in the blooderect and free as his people rise so the poet ascends on the wind to meet new sources of verbal inspiration in the night sky the poem ends vertically debout perpendicular to the beginning the flat face of the island au bout du petit matin cesaire imagines that henri christophe was an incarnation of the yoruba god shango shango has a curious legendary history as a king who angry as ajax once destroyed his entire family by mistake and then hung himself in his apotheosis as the thunder god dispenser of justice his manifestations are sporadic and violent shango wears red and red is the color of those whose heads he mounts whom he rides like horses who by temperamental affinity are his votaries blood horses thunder and a savage spirit have always been linked in cesaires system of correspondences and his most powerful monsters are dipped in red but in la tragedie du roi christophe for the first time the identification is at least temporarily explicit was it always implied or was it only recently in a dry time that the poet anxious about the strength and efficacity of his vocation became at last completely aware of the full of the shattering ambiguity of the african presence on a caribbean isle must be remembered that the colonized male is very much the target of the colonial system a number of studies have shown that the black male is failed more often and tends to be encouraged out of the school system with much greater frequency than the black female it is little wonder then that the black school children protect what is left of their egos by calling anyone who succeeds academically a sissy so much for descriptions of what is and what has been the only reason for describing what the outlines of a psychology of colonialism may be is to call for the participation of black psychologists to help end the colonial relationship between the black community and white america we must begin to do experiments to find out the best ways of developing black people on their own terms rather than to continue to use the instruments of the colonizer to describe what colonization has done to us we must end the tradition of what one of my colleagues likes to call the victim analysis type of research and begin to do reconnaissance research on every colonizer the history of lynching which is not over would be a useful starting place since it reveals deep fears which have helped to produce the long history of hatred and aggression against us i might suggest that lynching is an early sample of overkill requiring both a political and psychodynamic approach to understand it the current notions of a psychology of adjustment as psychological health are inappropriate to our struggle as albert memmi says the colonial condition cannot be adjusted to like an iron collar it can only be broken lw thus if there is to be therapy for black people it must be a therapy of struggle if it is the condition of colonized people to be torn from their past then the struggle must involve a poignant sense of history if the colonized culture is closed to the future as the master psychologist of colonialism frantz fanon suggests then we should see this manifested in individuals as fatalism note the theme of powerlessness in another tat fantasy from the patient mentioned earlier card well this is heaven what heaven really looks like its ruled by six people and these are standing here center detail they are looking down on the world and they rule everybodys life like puppets on a string they can do what they like with people below and the funny thing is that out of all these people not one of them is good they just have a lot of cruel fun with people on the earth i guess they just make life one big joke this severe fatalism brings out nicely the essence of the colonized world view colonized people do not seriously deal with their own existence we must begin to educate our children without transforming them into white anglosaxons in black skins to borrow a phrase from nathan hare nobody not even white folks seem to be pursuing that any longer we must end the use of testing designed to contain and control our existence we must take the notion of nation building seriously as a crucial stage in the creation of a new world we must think of black people as a whole because although we think as individuals we are treated as a whole black professionals must undergo a process of decolonization so that we can think as social scientists and not continue to be defined externally as psychologists anthropologists and etcetera finally a wider point of view is needed if we are to learn the bitter lesson of south african blacks who protested in the early s for nationalism and community control and got it in the form of the bantustan reservations where they are now captive perhaps the best warning from nazistyle south africa can come from the words of de ridder a european liberal reflecting upon some of the uppity brothers and sisters in his study the educated african must be given an outlet he has become educated to increase his earning potential and if he cannot do so he will turn either to crime or become disgruntled frustrated and an agitator the urban african tends towards immature attitudes and an exhibitionistic approach but such functions in no way imply that he will not respond to understanding and tactful handling he has still much to learn especially in the spheres of emotional moderation and control his ideas are rather egotistically biased and education tends to make him feel disproportionately superiorbut he is learning the problem which the european in south africa must face is what to do with those africans whose learning has given them ambitions beyond the industrial colour bar ambitions need outlets if their latent energies are not to be diverted by continual frustration into antisocial activities perhaps we can begin to see the booming black studies business in light of the south african experience by l a egwuonwu ear mr barrett we have read with keen interest your recent article the nigerian crisisin negro digest vol xviii no october your open confession of your limited knowledge of what happened and is still happening in nigeria casts doubts on the validity of your analysis how then can you advise our black brothers in america on situations you profess to be ignorant of in the first and second paragraphs of your article you seem to understand the intentions of the socalled world powers not only in nigeriabiafra but also in the whole of africa it is significant to note that you have been working with the nigerian government over the past two years consequently no one is surprised at your pronigerian stand it is also interesting to note that you quoted maj gen yakabu gowon as having admitted that all was not well in nigeria before and after the january coup and the july mutiny of the same year for the benefit of those black americans whom your article might have deceived we offer the following information young army officers from every part of nigeria took part in the january coup in order to correct the ills of the corrupt government subsequent facts revealed that maj gen aguiyiironsi ibo who later became the head of the federal military government narrowly escaped being killed for the mere fact that most of the coup leaders were lbos and most of those killed in the take over were northerners the suspicion grew that the coup was really an lbo plot to suppress the north and dominate the federation this was the time the british seeds of disunity started growing in nigeria eventually the british succeeded by planning and executing through the northern infantry the mutiny of july in which lbo army officers including general ironsi were slain and general gowon assumed the mantle of office this was followed by the organized killing of about lbo civilians in the fall of you failed to take this loss of human lives into consideration and concluded that these acts of black mans inhumanity to other black men were the best things to do at that particular time here you should be reminded that general ironsi was slain in ibadan western nigeria where he was supposed to discuss and listen to the grievances of the elders and the chiefs drawn from all over nigeria unlike his predecessors general gowon whom you described as stepping in to quell the mutiny was not only a traitor but a rebel to general ironsis regime general ironsi was not given the time and the cooperation to put nigeria on the right track merely because he happened to be an ibo thus a threat to the british interest in nigeria and neocolonialist opportunists would like to refer you to randolph churchills article see london times march churchill traveled to biafra and reported as follows there is scarcely a family that has not suffered loss either in the massacres of the lighting on the war front the bombing of towns and market places or from starvation which has taken the greatest toll of all during and after these massacres general gowon had little choice but to keep silent since the very soldiers who put him in power were the ones most stained with ibo blood despite all these atrocities the then eastern nigeria military governor now majgen odumegwu ojukwu pleaded for a round table conference in order to determine the future of nigeria and to work out a sort of constitutional arrangement that would eliminate causes of friction and restore confidence and harmony throughout nigeria this led to the aburi conference which you have emphasized as though you were a representative i would like you and your nigerian collaborators to explain to the world these few points was an agreement reached at aburi why did nigeria fail to honor such an agreement r for how long after repeated reminders did the then eastern region now biafra wait patiently for the lagos junta to implement the agreement reached at aburi before declaring independence you have tried to make the world believe that biafra is not united under the learership of his excellency general ojukwu responses to this point have been made clear by willintentioned foreign pressmen who have in the past or recently visited biafra here i refer to time magazine of august with the heading biafras agony all the points you made were answered in this particular publication many writers who have been to biafra have written and spoken that the biafrans have been fighting with bare hands small quantities of ammunition captured from nigcrans and the little that could be bought from the black market in europe lastly mr barrett people like you have sought in various ways to dismiss our struggle as a tribal conflict people like you have attributed it to the greed of a fictitious powerseeking clique anxious to carve out an empire to rule to dominate and to exploit this is not so our cause is transparently just and no amount of propaganda can detract us from it our struggle is of far greater significance than you seem to imagine it is a total vehement rejection of all those evils that blighted nigeriaevils which were bound to lead to the disintegration of that illfated federation our struggle is a positive commitment to build a healthy dynamic and progressive state which will be a bulwark against neocolonialism and the pride of black men the world over we hope that all people who have conscience will not fail to chastize you for regarding as a trifle the streams of blood biafra has so far shed would he look better in a sweater and chinos with a science book under his arm what happened to transform the american dream into a potential nightmare the answer to that question will depend of course upon the answerer the runofthecomputer white racist will blame the militants isolating as the root of all the evil those blacks who have said enough and who are ready to back up their decision with fire and funerals the beseiged white liberals ever true to form will also blame the militants begging for moderation characteristically straddling the racial chasm by also admonishing the racists for their extremism the black moderates that everdiminishing breed of successoriented middleclassstraining blacks will follow the white liberals lead as they always do routinely moaning about rampant racism while religiously adjusting to it the black moderates to be sure loathe the black militants more even than the other groups the militants threaten their unsteady perch upon the pedestal of security and stability and so all fingers point accusingly at the militants american society hovers on the edge of catas trophe they would have the world believe because a minority of disaffected blacks will not lie down and play puppy with promises of equality and respect in some vaguely envisioned tomorrow but the militants have another answer to them five centuries of western adventurism and exploitation have brought america to this moment white men fanned out over the earth enslaving and colonizing other men degrading and destroying other cultures at midtwentieth century america holds the legacy of the west and she guards the legacy well the sons of europe still swarm into her gates and america welcomes them with an incomparable gift no matter how diseased or ignorant or debased or criminal the european is presented with the status and privilege and preference to which white skin entitles him in a racist society no matter how low the european may sink or fall he needs never fear to reach the bottom for america has permanently reserved that place for her nonwhite natives and to those blacks who demand an end to degradation america replies wait it takes time the militants say enough they say we will be free men in this country or else this country will go down with us hear also their side of the argument it affects you a rejoinder to by william j wilson the march issue of negro digest vincent hardj it l wrote a passionate and thoughtprovoking letter to black i r students and faculty in the north which seriously challenged the legitimacy of our creating various programs to effect a more meaningful black experience on predominantly white campuses in hardings own words his letter was written in the spirit of black ecumenical concern as we move towards a new humanity and he encouraged those of us to whom his remarks were directed to respond i am therefore taking this opportunity to react to professor hardings very timely letter since space will not permit an elaborately detailed rejoinder to professor hardings arguments i shall here concentrate on what i take to be the basic points of his statement if i understand his position correctly he maintains that white northern institutions as a result of black student pressure have recently discovered the need to enroll more black students to hire more black faculty and to establish various levels of blkoriented curricula and in attempting to deal with this problem they have begun to exploit black schools in the south by recruiting competent black faculty by entering into serious competition with the southern schools for the best black students and by pirating some afroamerican curriculum which had not been destroyed by integration that such activities are threatening the survival of black institutions because they are not in a position to compete elfectively in terms of the fabulous scholarship and financial aids offered to the best black students and the attractive salary figures assistance for research and other inducements extended to black faculty that black students and faculty of northern institutions are participating fully in this common destruction common in the sense that their activities circumvent the concept of the black university and impede the development of new levels of black solidarity not only by demanding the enrollment of more black students the recruitment of black faculty and the establishment of black studies programs but also by helping to raid black schools to meet their demands that serious questions can be raised about the fruitfulness of such demands and the contradictions they entail eg if only a few institutes in afroamerican studies can live with significant integrity where should they develop and would it not make more sense to bring black students to a blackoriented professor in the south than to take him away from his campus that a program of action to deal with these problems and make it possible for us to serverather than destroyeach other includes a establishing special visiting professorships rather than raiding of black schools b creating a consortium in which one or more black and one or more white schools would pool their funds and jointly participate in the recruitment of black students and thereby provide each student the choice of spending three years at a black institution and a year at a white institution or vice versa c encouraging white institutions to make long term substantial financial investments in the black academic institutions and d organizing institutes to train future teachers of black studies programs at black colleges especially those black schools that have the resources to launch such an institute immediately eg the atlanta university center since i shall have to challenge professor harding on several points of a fundamental nature i should like to begin with a brief statement of the no less important arguments with which i find myself in general accord i agree with professor harding that the frantic search by white college administrators for black faculty if left unchecked will threaten the survival of black schools and that many northern black students and faculty are either consciously or unconsciously contributing to this precarious state of affairs moreover i agree that questions may be raised about the practicality of some northern student demands and the contradictions they entail furthermore i agree that a program of action is needed to correct this unfortunate situation my areas of disaccord are concerned with a number of professor hardings specific criticisms and recommendations and more importantly his tendency to altogether ignore or to treat in a cursory fashion certain very crucial matters pertaining to the black higher education crisis let me begin by amplifying this point as it specifically relates to the recruitment of black students if those of us who are involved in increasing the enrollment of black students on northern white campuses were committed to the view that we should only search for the socalled best black students professor hardings arguments would have an unshakable foundation and we would be forced to seriously reappraise our efforts although professor harding seems to confine his remarks to the elitist segment of the black student population i do not know of any massive recruitment campaign which is designed to enroll hundreds of black students each year that restricts itself in this manner on the contrary in response to or anticipation of black student demands northern colleges have developed a proliferation of programs to enroll high risk black students attempts to discourage such efforts would in the final analysis be catastrophic for the hundreds of thousands of denied black students who were until recently virtually ignored by institutions of higher learning they were the forgotten black students from impoverished backgroundsconcentrated in northern ghettoes they either did not meet the entrance requirements of nearby state colleges or did not have the financial resources to attend opendoor black colleges in the south in fact black students who lived in the south had a greater chance of entering colleges than those living in the north for instance we know that in approximately percent of the black high school graduates in the south enrolled in institutions of higher learning mostly black schools in the north however except in the state of california which has a large number of opendoor junior colleges the situation for black students was critical i would like to focus very briefly on the new england area for here the critical state of black higher education throughout the north is most forcefully exemplified in there were only blacks enrolled in the colleges and universities in new england including junior colleges or percent of the total student population because the few black students attending new england colleges at that time represented largely the managerial and professional segments of the black population one author was led to conclude that as far as the economically and socially depressed main body of american negroes is concerned it would not matter at all if new england colleges and universities closed their doors tomorrow black students demands have helped to produce steppedup recruitment efforts and although the figure is still pitifully low there were more black students enrolled in colleges in the state of massachusetts in than there were in all of new england in and the massachusetts figure is expected to dramatically increase over the next few years for example at the university of massachusetts we expect to have nearly a thousand black students by the fall of most of whom will come from the ghettoes of springfield and boston we are not recruiting students who would ordinarily go to black schools in the south but students who would have difficulty enrolling in any college in fact there are presently several high risk students on our campus who were rejected outright by black schools because they did not meet the conventional entrance requirements the emphasis on increasing the enrollment of black students is certainly not restricted to the state of massachusetts large state universities and colleges in the north are on expansive recruitment campaigns in the ghettoes some enrolling as many as black students a year these programs assist students in getting admitted to college provide financial support needed to attend college and furnish academic assistance needed to stay in college in the past denied black students were measured by the same academic criteria that were applied to other students no recognition was given to the crippling influence of ghetto schools by using such criteria these students were usually rated as academically marginal at best being marginal in these respects however may have nothing to do with their potential or intellect it merely indicates that they do not meet the conventional white middle class standards of admission it is incumbent upon black students and faculty in the north to continue to pressure their respective universities to abandon the system of recruiting only the best students which therefore ultimately leads them to search for students in the south i think it is ludicrous for black students from say northwestern university to go all the way to atlanta georgia searching for black students when there are thousands of black students in the ghettoes of nearby chicago just itching for a chance to enroll in college as northern universities continue to recruit the forgotten black students of the ghetto it is entirely conceivable that in the very near future and unless an equally concerted effort is made in the south an overwhelming majority of black students will be concentrated in these institutions and i would be hard pressed indeed to tell a black faculty member who was recruited expressly to satisfy the needs of these students that he should recognize his true obligation and teach in a black institution as the enrollment figures of northern black students continue to mount their needs cannot be denied however i do not feel that in order to satisfy the needs of increasing numbers of black students in the north black schools in the south should suffer it is for this reason that careful consideration should be given to professor hardings suggestions i shall discuss this matter shortly i was pleased to see professor harding at least acknowledged the fact that many faculty and administrators at predominantly negro colleges have been reluctant to grant that our experience as a people was worthy of serious academic exploration in the final analysis this obstacle has to be overcome if professor hardings suggestions are to be seriously entertained only a few black schools have the orientation which would permit immediate implementation of his proposal we cannot ignore the rigid resistance to change described by nathan hare gwendolyn midlo hall and others who have taught in traditionallyoriented negro colleges it is ironic that these schools provide a good deal of the opposition to the black university concept and the creation of afroamerican curricula it is additionally ironic that the administrators of predominantly negro schools have now been forced to recognize that they have indeed a valuable commodity in their black professor and although they are unable to compete with rich white schools for his services they may now find it necessary to at least give him the same rewards they have traditionally given to their white professor i recognize that professor harding did not address himself specifically to this issue but it comes up time and time again in a critical assessment of his proposed solutions to which i now turn considering our sadly limited resources professor harding states can there be more than a few really excellent programs of institutes of afroamerican studies no doubt may of the premature black studies programs will fail if for no other reasons than a lack of qualified personnel to staff them and a lack of commitment on the part of white administrators to keep them in operation this is a serious problem that demands a thoughtful and creative formula we may quickly dismiss therefore the rhetorical suggestion that it might make more sense to bring black students to a blackoriented professor in the south than to take him away from his campus as the institutions in the north continue to enroll thousands of black students it would be physically impossible considering the limited space and resources of southern black schools and financially unfeasible to ship all of them or even a majority of them to the south only a small percentage of the total number of black students in the north would be able to take advantage of this opportunity this would create a most unfortunate situation for those who are forced to remain moreover unless the receiving southern institutions are blackoriented we would be exposing the already uptight northern black students to the traditionallyoriented negro colleges which as i emphasized above have yet to acknowledge the legitimacy of black studies programs however professor hardings suggestion of visiting professorships for southern black teachers in northern institutions is a feasible temporary solution to this problem i emphasized the word temporary because i am convinced that even with such visiting professorships the demand for black professors far exceeds the available supply and the gap will rapidly widen it cannot be denied however that this suggestion would help to alleviate the pressure on white administrators and lessen their frantic search for permanent black professors as a stopgap solution then the visiting professorship idea should be immediately implemented an arrangement could be made with white institutions to hold a moratorium on the recruitment of permanent black faculty from the south in favor of visiting black professorships with the proviso that these institutions be permitted to hire as permanent faculty those black professors who personally initiate such an appointment i should think that if white administrators were assured of the participation of black faculty in this regard they would be willing to cooperate in this connection professor hardings recommendation that white institutions make long term substantial financial investments in the black institutions can be realistically entertained more specifically our historic experiences in this society should certainly make us aware that when men have to choose between protecting their own interests or preserving the interests of others they almost invariably decide in favor of themselves altruism regardless of how justified rarely plays a major role in important decisions black people in their interactions with whites have painfully found this proposition to be universally true accordingly in order to assure long term commitment white institutions have to be made to recognize that they have a vested interest in financially supporting various endeavors in black institutions for example in return for an agreement to financially support research programs in certain black institutions white institutions might receive the cooperation of black professors in accepting visiting professorships to staff their black the black university in peril before birth by ronald davis ear brother harding the questions and concerns that you raised although heavily weighted with ramifications for both our present and our future have for too long eluded our attention thanks to you they now command our attention i find myself wanting to say how right you areabout everything you said but your comments deserve more than that i feel that we not only have to explain the thinking or lack of it and action which led up to the present state of affairs but that we also have to offer something towards the resolution of our present difficulties and for the realization of our goalthe black university while i do not wish to belabour or lengthen unnecessarily the points i wish to make in this response i can see no way of adequately explaining what has occurred outside of recalling somewhat in detail the rather complex formation of events which preceded the present situation i do hope that you will bear with me near the end of august i was visited by brother bill moore a representative from the monterey peninsula black community which is situated near the santa cruz campus of the university of california bro moore had come to inform me that the community he represented was presently engaged in a struggle to get the university of california which is committed to erecting some twenty colleges on the santa cruz campus to devote the seventh college erected to the teaching of the black experience more specifically they wished the college to be named the college of malcolm_x and be designed to reflect the heritage of the afroamerican people its instructors to be of the black experience degrees up to and including the phd to be awarded in afroamerican studies and a forum room open to the people to be built in the college as a center for the expression of the finest minds and talents of the people of color i was further informed by bro moore that the drive to obtain public support for the proposed college was already underway and that he was presently seeking the support of all bay area student groups my response to the brother had been conditioned by several months of rather intensive thought and action on this and other like subjects much of this is also worth recalling for five years prior to the summer of bro moores visit i had been active in bay area black student circles first at san francisco city college and later at the university of california at berkeley just as it should have been we had protested everything at one time or another oppressive campus rules and regulations meager black faculty discrimination in athletics american involvement in south african apartheid and in rhodesia the vietnam war the draft discrimination in admissions policy and the resulting small number of black students all earned our contempt and verbal condemnation there can be no doubt that all these were outrages before which we had to cry out but once we had cried out we returned to feeling vain and empty we felt there had to be more that we could do but were yet uncertain common landmarks and mutual outcries would soon bring us to the same neck of the woods but at that time we were still trying to define ourselves trying to delimit the scope magnitude and horror of our circumstances and things continued to crumble around usmaking our path difficult to trod the civil_rights movement folded malcolm was murdered and the first long hot summer began to whisk away the people we wanted to save then in sncc was reborn black and many of us found new hope this development was followed by a noticeable concern about reaction and some of us began to see what the other thing was that had to be done creative action began to take the place of reaction two merritt college students bobby seale and huey newton left their campus and organized the black_panther party the black students at san francisco state went into the black community to organize and recruit they had already begun to develop black curriculum a handful of black students from the university of california went into east oakland to work for mark comfort a black radical who was then running for the state assembly we were all acting on the notion that protest alone would not suffice it was clear to us that if we were to survive we would have to come forth with meaningful programs of action we next entered a period in which there was much talk about and general recognition ofwhat the ultimate solution would be but there were and still are many thousands thet we had to reach train and prepare for this inevitability thus the need for black studies loomed large and clear and almost simultaneously we responded to it i should add that at this point early our efforts to develop black studies by and large had not yet gained notoriety or been widely publicized we were still thinking talking writing and organizing however one thing was clear to all concerned if education was to play any part in our survivalit would have to undergo a radical qualitative change we also realized that we would have to take it to some people while enabling others to come and get it thus in nearly every set of demands for black studies there is language which deals with community participation and admissions policies but there were and still are problems that remained unresolved and this gets us almost back to bro moore in june of the black students at the university of california having conceptually developed a program of black studies the previous spring began to cast around for someone to headup the program this effort greatly expanded our awareness of what was going on around the country to begin with we had made a selfdefeating concession to our masters at the university reluctantly we had agreed to try to find someone who by understanding and commitment would be palatable to us and by credentials would be acceptable to the white university this of course is a near irresolvable contradictiona contradiction about which our worse fears and suspicion would later be confirmed but naively and foolishly we tried and in the process an even greater contradiction the real rub came to light again and again everybody and anybody who had even the slightest commitment to what we had in mind was either already committed to some place school or had too many offers to consider another one when this was not the case the person sought was usually grappling with what has emerged as the central issue that we face today ie will we be able to develop one worthwhile black university if we all persist in our efforts to develop little ones all over the country i specifically recall one scholars lament that he had worked for the last several years with the hope of completing his degree and meeting with other scholars at some point of conversion to develop a black university he was now being torn apart by offers many of which were so lucrative that he was greatly distressed by having to reject them but most of all he was distressed by a development which he felt would surely result in the dissolution of his dream of a black university the wholesale development of black studies programs throughout the north it now appears that he was even more right than he thought anyway as we continued in our search for someone to head up black studies at berkeley and found more and more people unavailable became clearer that black students throughout the north were mustering for a stampede in the direction of black studies indeed as i look back it appears that nothing could have stopped this the black student revolts that occurred on the northern white campuses in late and were in the breach long before martin_luther_king jr was murdered in april this is borne out by the unavailability of anyone who could relate to the action of black studies both before and after dr_king was murdered the stampede did not surprise us we knew it was coming we were just in no frame of mind to stop it the events of the time may or may not have contributed to our inability to arrest our energies and change directions but i am rather certain that no single event caused our behavior the overall causes are certainly of a more ancien sic character the basic problem of course was that this was no way to build a black university which was something most of us agreed should be done clearly we were being divided and scattered in as many directions as there are white northern colleges and universities but we made no concerted move to check it instead we all attempted to comer as much of the terribly limited black talent as we could and to outstrip one another in the development of black studies not everyone however was oblivious to what was happening a few people agreed that the most ideal setting for the black university would be some southern negro college with a surrounding metropolitan black community and a rural black community within reach those who favored this model imagined that such a community might indeed become the nucleus from which a black nation could spring i should add that the proponents of this notion were notare not unaware of the various ideological challenges to this concept not the least of these is the bakunian argument that there should be no building of any kind until the present system of oppression is destroyed to which proponents of nationbuilding respond that it is unlikely that this can be done without some base of support which is controlled by the protagonists this is of course a major question for those of us who favor the creation of a black university and ought to be decided as soon as possible but let me go on there have always been persons among us who have argued that no black program of any kind should be placed in white schools the people who make this argument generally believe that we should be setting up schools in the black community and there are really few people who do not agree that this should be done the problem here is that there are obstacles involved which many of us feel we are not presently geared to handle foremost among these is the aggressive recruiting activities being conducted among our people by major colleges and universities all over the west coast whereas we could match the aggression which is still minimal we are in no position to match the lucrative aid and assistance packages that they are handing out and until we have done a sufficient amount of ground work we will not be able to compete with the name and prestige of these institutions no matter how unearned and unjustified these names and their prestige are and this is not a fact to be scoffed at indeed recent efforts to force these same colleges and universities to deal with our needs have been seriously hampered by the lack of participation by many students who refused to get involved because they were afraid that their money would be cut off or that they would lose the opportunity of attending big name schools that they had always aspired to attend we dont like this but the average brother is still more entranced by the notion of attending cal than he is about attending any school that we could get together in the community this is a problem to which i see no solution until we have begun to be more realistic in our assessment of it at berkeley we finally decided that the only way we could even hope to deal with this trend and perhaps reverse the attraction syndrome of which so many students are victims would be to set up some kind of black program that would act as a kind of catch mechanism this is to say that we had no intention at this point of actually institutionalizing any black studies program in a white school instead we hoped simply to have enough of a program to catch the minds and energies of those students who would surely come to berkeley and direct them to where they were really neededthe black community we had no illusion that just getting black students into the black community was going to solve allor anyof the problems there on the contrary we had actually experienced the fallacy of this notion we had always encouraged students to go to the community and to offer service anytime we managed to get a few of them to actually do this invariably the same problem would arise they had no skills or experience that qualified them to deal with the problems they found there they were no different from the white social worker all they did was remind the people that they had problems but in most cases they could offer no solutions they could render no positive service and this turned the people off so we were aware that we not only had to catch people and direct them to the communitywe were also aware that we had to give them something to take there this was our thinking about the catch action and black studies at the time most important of all perhaps was that feature of our thinking on black studies which opposed its institutionalization it was our belief that if such a program was institutionalized it would at the same time be deradicalized and reduced to a purely academic experience and we could see no good coming from an isolated sterile dissection of the black experience we refused to consider any program that would not have arms for action beyond this our concerns centered around what happens to people who get caughtup in institutions we imagined that it would be very easy for concern and enthusiasm to be replaced by indifference and complacency we saw this as a real threat and made all kinds of arguments against it we argued for instance that instructors working in the program should not be tenured this to us was very important because we saw it killing two birds with one stone first of all a number of opportunists who valued the security and prestige of tenure would be discouraged from getting involved from the outset and second we would be able to purge the program from time to time of those influences which proved negative we had not wanted to develop a program with any aspects of permanence we wanted a program that we could pick up at any time intact and sit it down anywhere that we wished and we were sure that we would have to do just that if the program effectively did what we wanted it to do i have bothered to call the occasion of bro moores visit and some of the thinking that preceded it from memory because it sheds a great deal of light on what we were thinking and what was happening on the eve of the great stampede we can see by this rather vividly how sometimes when we begin to move we abort the ideals of our initial intent so how did we respond at that time to the proposed college of malcolm_x watch naturally because of our commitment to the creation of a major black university in the south and our belief that most northern programs should be of the catch type we were predisposed to believing that the proposed college of malcolm_x was a bad idea objections were both primary and secondary the latter centered around what appeared to some of us to be an insidious even if unconscious attempt to legitimize malcolm_x our concern about this was based on an unusual amount of emphasisboth in bro moores verbal explanation of the proposed college and in the literature written for its promotionon the conclusions reached by bro malcolm after his trip to mecca while we did not wish in any way to challenge those conclusions we still found the amount of attention given them disconcerting it was as if the entire bitter experience of malcolms life had been subordinated in importance to the assertion that no one who knew him before and after his trip to mecca could doubt that he had completely abandoned racism separatism and hatred such as this never fails to strike me as being weird and specious i mean it is as if the problem of racism and hatred in america is primarily one of black racism and hatred and we therefore ought to rejoice when a black man abandons racism and hatred kind of reminds you of the common fallacy regarding violence in this country if we black folks werent violent everything would be ok it also occurred to us that any institutionalizing of malcolms name based on such a premise could only serve to reduce the impact of the revolutionary meaning and significance of his life further still our reservations were enhanced by the subtle but unmistakable connection which was being drawn between this proposed undertaking and the philosophy of nonviolence wouldbe patrons were being asked to sign a statement of support which began i wish to show proof in the form of positive action that i support nonviolent projects that will give evidence to the black community that we are interested in them and are willing to accept their ideas on what is best for them it is possible that our comprehension of this statement was awry but it appeared to us to clearly imply that the proposed college was expectedeither through its realization or its functionto contribute to the perpetuation of nonviolence our suspicion of this was greatly increased by bro moores verbal assertion that he believed the college would show goodwill on the part of whites thats fine we thought if others wished to believe this but we remained convinced that any effort to further nonviolence or to show goodwill by exploiting the name of malcolm_x who again and again cautioned us against trickery and taught that nonviolence was suicidal was both insulting and misleading i should like to make it clear that i am not attempting to take on the philosophy of nonviolence here that indeed is the subject of another argument as i stated we had other reservations of a more primary nature to understand these it is necessary not to forget our stated commitment to the creation of a black university in our opinion this was a commitment before which all other considerations having to do with the higher education of blacks should yield in light of this the proposed college of malcolm_x it was thought would affect prematurely the develop institute of the black world basic assumptions the institute of the black world approaches the controversial and highly significant issue of black studies in america with five basic assumptions they affect the character of all that we do and all that we plan to do in the arena of black studies these are the assumptions that black studies is really a field still being bomin spite of all the discussion which seems to take for granted the existence of an agreed upon body of thought this is not to deny the existency of significant and often unappreciated work related to black studies which has already been done but it does deny the fact that there is any clear understanding of the specific ways in which a profound mining of the black experience challenges and transforms the basic educational structures of the nation that the establishing and the defining of the field of black studies stand logically as a task and a challenge for black people in america and elsewhere others may be called upon for assistance but the initiative must be ours that the institute and its sister institutions of the martin_luther_king jr center and the atlanta university complex are in an excellent position to play a central role in defining the field and creating some of the models so urgently required in this task of course we must find ways of combining the thought and activities of those black persons throughout the nation who are working at the black studies task often in scattered and isolated situations that a unified rather than a conventionally understood academic disciplinebound approach to the creation of black studies is not only desirable but absolutely necessary indeed this unified approach is central to the demands of most thoughtful black student and faculty groups across the country that a serious building of this field is the task of years and not a makeshift program for a few persons to do in several weeks or months institute of the black world basic program elements against this background of assumptions the planning staff of the institute of the black world has been working towards tentative models for more than a year benefiting of course from the older hopes and dreams of such predecessors in black studies as w e b du bois charles s johnson ralph bunche and alain locketo mention only a few already it has become apparent to us that several elements must be a part of any creative wellstructured approach to black studies we have understandably sought to include them in our own planning among these elements are serious research in many areas of historical and contemporary black existence which have either been ignored or only superficially explored iethe black church and its theology comparative black urban development in the new world comparative slavery the encouragement of those creative artists who are searching for the meaning of a black aesthetic who are now trying to define and build the basic ground out of which black creativity may flow in the arts encounter among these artists on the one hand and scholars activists and students on the other must be constant in both formal and informal settings continuous research on those contemporary political economic and social policies which now shape the life of the black community in america and which determine its future it is clearly necessary to develop a think tank operation which will bring together the many varieties of black approaches to struggle and existence in america this must be done of course in a nonpolemical unpublicized black setting constant experimentation with the meaning of black studies for the surrounding black community and openness to the possible input from that community into the creation of black studies the twowayness of the experience is essential and must be encouraged the development of new materials forand new approaches tothe teaching of the black experience which must grow out of laboratory situations at every grade level the training of a constantly expanded cadre of persons deeply immersed in the materials methods and spirit of black studies who can help supply the tremendous demands for personnel in a variety of formal and informal teaching environments the creation of consortium models which will make possible the constant interaction of black students and faculty on northem and southern campuses around certain selected foci of black studies this must also expand to the encouragement and development of contacts among black students scholars political leaders and artists from various parts of the world for it is clear that black studies cannot really be developed unless we understand more fully both the unique and the common elements of our experiences in the black diaspora the gathering and consolidation of those library and archival resources which will facilitate the development of black studies as it proceeds towards definition the establishment of a publishing enterprise which will not only make available the results of the experimentation and study of the institute but which will also encourage that increasing number of authors and researchers who wish to present their work from the heart of a black matrix the gathering cataloging and critical analysis of those black studies programs and personnel which have already developed across the nation so that we may begin to gain a fuller sense of direction possibilities and problems this process began with a summerlong seminar in june and will continue with monthly seminars of black studies directors and several larger working conferencesat least through the summer of the institute of the black world sees all of these elements as crucial to the development of creative models for the kinds of black studies programs which will not be palliatives but significant pathways to the redefinition of american education and of the black experience these are therefore the elements which have guided us so far in the establishment of our own institute the communiversity by the staff students and parents a national conference for black teachers was held in chicago in april educators came from all sections of the country and from all levels of educational involvement from wayside rural classrooms to widely acclaimed and distinguished colleges and universities the primary concern of those assembled was to become united around the causes and effects of crises in education and to recognize that the solutions to these problems could and would only come from black educators who recommit and rededicate their lives to these ends a basic structure was put together specific tasks were delegated and the word went forth that the newlyorganized a a a e association of afroamerican educators would begin to deal with and search for all means to educate in the black community qualitatively in atlanta georgia the following year august the guiding principles were clarified to express that in order for a real and lasting educative process to have support and acceptance legitimacy it must have as its base the total involvement and total dictates of each local area or community in order to achieve total involvement with the entire black community participating the madison avenue style of executive management and hierarchal omnipotence had to be ruptured this style of management was the cause of the initiation of the conference the black communiversity evolved from a monthlong concentration on the historical evolution and development of the black manfromafrica through our present situation in america during the month of february in chicago black liberation north many groups and individuals worked in unison to bring culturallyexpressive programs to all segments of the black community the project was a success from out of this endeavor a black congress was formed and from out of this congress a black communiversity came into being classes were scheduled teachers volunteered and black students enrolled at this time over students were involved in the curriculum the question now is that a strong demand has come forth to attempt to broaden the scope of the services that the communiversity offers and to develop a structure that will envision and encompass the totality of the black community thereby unifying all partsas only an educative process can all educationoriented organizations or groups are being called upon to assist in the structuring of a more comprehensive educational system toward this end a weekend conference has been planned for july and in chicago the location will be announced later is our intention to review briefly some alternatives to the v present systems of education that have been setup for us by suggesting a separate and independent system of education for colonized blacks in america i white people have institutions while black people have institutionalized leaders this paper could have been called an alternative to black charismatic i leaders you can kill a black charismatic leader but how do you destroy the white institutions which produce black charismatic leaders an alternative is to build our own institutions institutions are created to perpetuate the system that sets them up therefore if a racist system creates institutions the institutions must reflect racism understanding this one concept makes it very clear that all schools attended by black people are doing exactly what they are supposed to doperpetuate the idea of white superiority and black inferiority even when some blacks are led to believe they have reached europeanization they are rejected because rejection devices for all nonwhites are built into the institutions two of the most important things about institutions are they are selfperpetuating and they never produce an alternative for outsiders today black schools are structured so as to be both reactionary and repressiveto both black teachers and black students our new school system must serve as the instrument for black resistance to white dominance and as this immovable force propel black people toward selfunderstanding and clear directions of goals our new schools must provide us with alternative solutions for arriving at our newly deflned and newlyaccepted goalsfor our students and our teachers are our future it is within our new system of education that our children may receive the assistance and acquire the stability to forge our new lifestyles this system must enable them to recognize respect resurrect and create new and positive images for from out of this will come the rhythmic dynamic and futureoriented base for total and lasting access to power this new system will become established as the fundamental cornerstone upon which all other institutions will be solidly built these new institutions will become our first line of collective defense against white cultural oppression other educational institutions have withdrawn even their semblance of support for black people and we are left to build our own this is a challenge but not an impossible dream when one considers the timeliness of this necessity and when one operates within the confines of a properlychanged frame of reference the basics are already present to begin to build the last two decisive social groups yet intact and caught up together our students and our teachers two strangers in a world unknown and to be explored will create this new system of educationwith and not for the black community therefore we suggest an independent educational systemtotally accountable to the black community and financed supported and controlled by black people the purpose of an alternative system to help black people students parents professionals etc understand what is being done to them and at the same time reveal to them the drama of everyday local national and international events to help black people understand the relationship of the black colony in america to the white metropolitan society in america by studying euroamerican colonialism to help the black professional who is confused and now stands helplessly by as the white colonial worldandthe black resistance movement prepares to destroy him to help black students who are presently struggling without a proper frame of reference to help black parents and their children who shoulder the total weight of victimization and exploitation to help black community organizations which have attempted to stand and serve as a bulwark or retaining wall between the white oppressor and the black oppressed to also help community organizations understand all methods of mobilization to cope with the fundamentals of true and victorious resistance to acquire all of the basics for communal survival and to become fully acquainted with a definitive difference between organization and movement steps to an alternative system of education i local community leaders a identification and communication with local leaders identify communicate and meet with organizational leaders or their representatives at an appointed time and place the purpose of the meeting should center around the possibilities of total community alliance or at least total community cooperativeness and legitimization strengthened by the membership of each individual group all concerned should aim for a unified tactical goal independent system of education which in this case will be the search for an answer to the problem of urban innercity education the head of each organization or his representative should submit an oral synopsis of his organizations activities goals accomplishments and strategies an overview of views and concepts about an alternative system of education should be made with sanction and a cooperative acceptance from as many groups as possible and necessary plans should be made for a citywide conference ii student groups the same or similar procedures as suggested for community organizations should be used contact existing black student organizations in a high schools b universities c other educational institutions iii parents the same procedure should be followed with parents only parents should be organized within a given school district or specific school all however should be invited to attend and participate individually until organized or from any private or parochial parentchild school involvement iv teachers and other professionals teachers should be organized by school districts at the elementary high school or college levelpublic private or parochial other professionals should be organized according to the dictates of their particular field of endeavor and according to how their expertise can best be meshed with the total program malcolm s a community college with a new perspective by charles g hurst jr he deplorable state of public education in the united states t f leads to the conclusion that the future is bleak and unpromis ing for millions of black americans who are being tolda f constantly that education is a ticket to freedom to coin a term familiar to all in the black community education in the united states from kindergarten through college is in a mess from the standpoint of a community that is witness to the many failures of education to do what it claims as its jobnamely educatean insidious hypocrisy is being perpetrated compounded by a callous white public that does not seem to care moreover the black community is becoming painfully aware of the high level of undesirable waste occurring as more and more students emerge illfitted to serve themselves or society the results may be seen through serious erosions in community confidence and a reluctance of the community to participate in educational programs that demean without teaching recently released statistics by the chicago board of education showing that attempts to teach reading are exercises in futility even at the eleventh grade level are carbon copies of those released sporadically by boards of education in all parts of the united states these statistics document the absolute inability of public school systems and programs as presently constituted to meet the urgent needs of a large majority of black children and youth and for that matter the needs of the poor generally black or white the overall verbal level for eleventh grade students in chicago is percentile points below the national norm the reading level for vast numbers of black students in high schools such as crane high school in chicago is points below the average and only slightly better than the zero levelor complete illiteracyat the eleventh and twelfth grades strangely and tragically attempts to pinpoint responsibility for the failures of public schools expose one of the most sophisticated systems of buckpassing in existence the end result is to place the blame on the student or more insidiously to recreate the myth of black inferiority such practices are not only unfair but also destructive as well simply as a matter of selfpreservation this country can no longer afford to permit the managers of education to miseducate or not to educate at all and to escape the consequences of their failures hopefully it is not too late for education to put its own house in order but for this to happen education must be willing to take a new view toward itself the students the community the curriculum and teaching practices to begin with we in education can no longer hold ourselves above reproach for the failures we produce we must be willing to readily admit that our record in urban education is a sad one with little if anything to recommend it or us further we have lived too long on the records of the past and upon the achievement of a few who make it in spite of us not because of us finally we must face squarely the fact that many students get absolutely nothing out of their school experience even many who graduate are unable to read or write at a literate level we are obviously in an educational crisisa crisis more subtle than a hunger crisis or military crisis but a crisis nonetheless the dangerous potentialities of the educational crisis are demonstrated through the antisocial behavior of many of educations rejects and the fatal consequences ensuing from their attempts to survive in a world where the odds are stacked against them anyone seriously interested in analyzing the etiology of the crisis must be well aware of the causes and of what we must do since our country has undergone almost unbelievably swift revolutions in science and technology economic and political affairs and demographic and social structures but despite revolutionary advances that have made travel to the moon a routine miracle education in the united states has adapted to space age demands with lethargic reluctance five specific problems appear to be paramount the demands of a space age and computer paced society for the certifications provided by education the sharp increase in the number of people seeking an education especially black people the unwillingness of the society to meet the costs of mass education the inherent inertia of the educational system the inertia of the society itself and the racism that is so deeply embedded in every aspect of american life to meet challenges to the nation of current crises in domestic as well as foreign affairs education will needmore than moneyideas courage determination and a new will for selfappraisal reinforced by a will for creatively conceived change as matters now stand education has not shown either the ability or the willingness for searching selfcriticism neither has it been able to seize opportunities for innovations that will help teachers achieve more in classrooms filled with distractions and angry students it has failed to infuse the needed knowledge and methods required to meet the current crisis while exhorting everyone to change education has remained stubbornly resistant to innovation and new ideas in a larger sense the crisis of education is the crisis of the greater society and thus it is the urgent concern of all citizens committed to the perservation of our present way of life i firmly believe that the crisis of education in the black community can be overcome a critical selfanalysis is a beginning a reeducation and sensitizing of teachers is a second step a relevance and upgrading of curriculum is a third an effort to truly involve the community in school affairs is a fourth application of some new theories of teaching and learning as suggested by repeated research findings is a fifth and a new responsiveness to conditions and to the people education purports to serve is the last i list here but far from the last in possibilities if education is to provide the answers we need so urgently rather than faulting its critics who are engaged in an exercise of love and faith the managers of education would do better to take stock of educations obvious weaknesses and move to do something about them continuation of programs and techniques that do not work is wrong and a breach of public trust the black people of america deserve the best that education can produce not the worst essentially therefore it is to the thousands of black youths and disenchanted adult poor to which a community college in an urban ghetto must address itself the following statement of philosophy representing the raison detre of malcolm_x college should make it abundantly clear how this can be done limits of space will not permit a full discussion of proposals for each educational level thus the present paper must be limited to a delineation of a relatively new kind of institution the community college that is serving as a reclamation center for the human problems created by callously inefficient public schools yet many of the principles and philosophies are basic to contemporary education at any level malcolm_x college is a concept of the future whose past is rooted in the enslavement of black people so pervasive is the heritage of slavery in this society that we must constantly struggle to keep from unconsciously allowing to develop at this institution situations which serve to enslave and to exploit rather than to develop and actualize human potential the processes by which ideal slaves are made have been described as follows step establish and maintain strict discipline step implant in the bondsmen themselves a consciousness of personal inferiority step awe them with a sense of their masters enormous power step persuade the bondsmen to take an interest in their masters enterprise and to accept his standards of good conduct step impress them with their helplessness to create in them a habit of perfect dependence upon their masters clearly if we do not wish to perpetuate the systematic psychological and social enslavement of black people we must develop articulate and practice counter mechanisms which will serve to liberate ourselves and our students such mechanisms as the following have been instituted at malcolm_x college step discipline follows from a precise understanding of what must be done and why it generates from within the individual and the group and is enforced by each individual in the group step a deliberate effort is made to develop a capacity to master whatever one aspires to learn to succeed in whatever one aspires to do step those in positions of authority endeavor to empower their colleagues and subordinates teaching them how to use power for the good of all step the enterprise is viewed as belonging to the people specifically to those people in the community who voluntarily express an interest in itand hence the standards norms and values permeate from the base to the apex in terms of the kind of institution desired by the students and the community step people are helped to help themselvesto learn from failures rather than seek to avoid them to be honored more for having tried than for having succeeded the educational model to which we subscribe is built upon a different assumption about the nature of potential human ability than is typical of most educational institutions while we recognize variation we know that the ability potential of the average black american is well beyond the normal demand level of the most rigorous academic programs and hence we justify a maximum social effort to develop the abilities of all people concomitantly any failure to achieve high levels of performance constitutes a group social failure rather than an individuals failure we propose to educate our students for three goals freedom individuality and service freedom in a very general sense refers to a freedom from external constraint malcolm_x college is characterized by free access to the resources of the institution the city the world the role of staff and student body is to remove the obstacles which block the path of those seeking the more specific freedom defined as the capability to deal creatively and effectively with ones situation we take the position that in order to achieve positive freedom students must be encouraged to actively and consciously attempt to utilize their personal resources their life style and their experiential background in the classroom the student must become skilled at identifying needs problems and issues which affect the nature and quality of life in his environment and then use them in his research hopefully he will learn to relate his learning to the problems of his community with a view toward ultimately finding solutions to the communitys problems as well as his own individuality cannot genuinely exist without the freedom described above the thrust of this perspective is to resist any simple accounts of what a person really is or intends to become and allows for distinction between ones real self and ones apparent self the real self is in our judgment dynamic and expanding and defies prima facie or merely quantitative assessment individuality presupposes a social context and yet underscores the uniqueness of each person in that context our notion of individuality is characterized by builtin capacities not necessarily apparent for good which are inseparable from the good of the community and ultimately of all mankind service involves being a contributing member of society by bringing ones unique resources to bear upon human problems particularly the problems confronting the black community as with the others this concept recognizes that the truly educated man is also a learned man but more than that he is one in whom learning is combined with an understanding of social injustice and a commitment to correcting it at malcolm_x college we reject the educational process which places didactic instruction at the core and we propose that the time has come for us to control our zeal for imparting knowledge and skills and to concentrate our efforts on developing the individual student by education for individual development i mean a program consciously undertaken to promote such qualities as flexibility creativity openness to new experiences responsibility accountability and commitment education no longer can be a pouring into it must be a means of providing the climate and conditions in which the greatest possible development of potential can take place further we reject organizational structures which tend to be paternalistic administrators and faculty know best students know least we propose organizational structures in which power is shared and the participation of all is guaranteed finally we must emphasize that malcolm_x college is a black institutionone in which the educational services are designed to serve in a unique way the goals of black people as the community becomes more clear about the kind of society it is trying to build we will design our educational programs to promote the black agenda there is emerging a degree of concensus among black people that our educational system has to prepare our young people to play dynamic and constructive parts in the development of a society in which all members share fairly in the good or bad fortune of the group and in which progress is measured in terms of human wellbeing not prestige buildings cars or other material things whether privately or publicly owned in essence we believe that our kind of college with a black oriented curriculum and philosophy is in a unique position to deal both with the ills of our society and with the human consequences of its derelictions as an integral part of the community itself the institution can and must be creatively and flexibly responsive to the communitys needs as well as to those of the individual inhabitants where necessary the college must serve as a catalytic agent to synthesize the varied components of the community into a viable force for liberation never losing sight of the individual the contemporary educational institution must be concerned at all times with massive changes of social and economic conditions which may enhance the communitys potential for successful selfdetermination creative response to educational needs becomes in consequence only one even if the most important of the educational institutions responsibilities leadership where there is a void and unlimited supportive assistance where there is a need represent the basic tenets of a practical philosophy of commitment that views liberation of any oppressed people as the specific charge for all democratic institutions if education can not participate enthusiastically in achieving this aim it does not deserve to exist finally if education does not begin to educate for the kind of humaness implicit in some of the aforegoing paragraphs education will cease to exist a victim of its own inertia by chuck hopkins n october in durham north carolina the black community saw its dream of a relevant black educational institution become a reality with the opening of malcolm_x liberation university in an old warehouse which had been cleaned out and renovated on the th of october over black people from durham and communities around the country gathered in front of the building site to listen to the dedication message of sister betty shabazz widow of brother malcolm_x sister betty charged the participants in the ceremonies and black people around the world with the task of organizing for black unity and building for the black nation with the opening of the university have come several questions concerning the need for such a venture on the part of black people why malcolm_x liberation university why durham north carolina why in in order for us to answer these questions we must understand somewhat the political struggles of black people in durham as well as in other communities around the country in the spring of a concentrated effort was started in durham to organize black people to bring about better living conditions the effort had two basic objectives the involvement of black people in the decisionmaking apparatus of the local oeo office of economic opportunity poverty agency the creation of neighborhood organizations to press for improvement in such areas as the lack of traffic stop signs playground equipment street lights etc in the black community initial organizing efforts proved quite successful neighborhood councils were formed the community action agency granted representation to these groups for a while it seemed as if the democratic process might actually work for black people but the optimism was shortlived for black people ran into a brick wall when they pressed for more substantial changes such as housing repairs street paving and public housing reforms when black people met continuous opposition in their efforts to bring about change the tone of the movement became more and more militant the next two years saw important changes in the thinking of the community people the neighborhood groups pressed for autonomy from the oeo poverty agency tactics for change accelerated rapidly petitions changed to pickets picketing evolved into mass marches mass meetings gave way to protests characterized by violent confrontationsall this in two years the militancy of the community drew the attention of black students at duke university and north carolina central university in addition links between the community and students were formed during a summer intern program in in which black college students from throughout north carolina lived and organized in the neighborhoods this involvement created a new atmosphere of co operation between black college students and neighborhood people during this time black students at duke university underwent some important ideological changes they began to work more in the community and with the black nonacademic employees on campus the students began to think and talk in terms of the critical question of the relevance of the entire educational process to the needs of the black community they concluded that the process as it exists is in fact irrelevant events on campus at this time began to move in rapid succession there were a series of protests and confrontations which culminated in the students seizing the administration building and demanding that a black studies program be established and controlled by black people throughout these confrontations and protests the students found that they had the strong immediate and active support of the organized neighborhood groups it was all of these ingredients and of course the subsequent refusal of duke university to speak to the question of relevant black education which led the students and the community people to take a second look at their efforts a simple truth was realized throughout the movement that those who are oppressed cannot look to those who oppress them to deal in any way with the nature or source of the oppression if black people in durham north carolina wanted a relevant educational institution they would have to build it themselves it was decided that the next logical step was the development of malcolm_x liberation university ideas for the universitys development were obtained in a series of meetings with students faculty and black people from communities throughout north carolina these meetings ended in the late spring of at this point an outline of the university had been developed which served as the base for its continued development during the summer months of a task force of former students headed by brother howard fuller worked with the community people in durham and other black people around the country in order for the university to open in the fall so we can see that the answers to the above questions can be simplified thusly malcolm_x liberation university opened on october in durham because it was an idea whose time had come it had come because of a logical progression of events which had occurred both in the black community and on the campus of duke university the overriding purpose of the university is to provide a framework within which education can become relevant to the needs of black people training at the university therefore is geared toward the analysis of the american system and of all other institutions of colonizing societies which serve the process of black dehumanization beyond this however the university represents an attempt to develop a functional black ideology which will serve as a guideline for black people and will further define and develop a program to build selfreliance it is the feeling of those at the university that if we are in fact serious about black liberation then we must be speaking ultimately of black independence and if we are speaking of black independence then we are speaking basically about these things the control by black people of our goods and services the control by black people of our consciousness the control by black people of the mechanisms of force and violence malcolm_x liberation university then is essentially concerned with the building of black selfreliance in order to help bring about black independence the curriculum of the university is broken into two sections running for approximately to months each the first section broadly defined as the ideological and cultural part includes five basic topics plus physical development and language classes the five topic areas are independent african civilization slavery colonialism neocolonialism independent african world each of the areas is designed to provide the student with a knowledge of the historical social economic and political framework of black existence both in this hemisphere and on the continent the second section of the curriculum is set up to give intensive training in some of the basic skills needed to build selfreliance for black people these skilled areas are food scientists architects medics engineers black expressionists teachers communications technicians there are also community seminars which are offered weekly by students or instructors at the university the student body at malcolm_x liberation university is made up of regular day students and approximately who attend the night seminars these students represent a wide range of geographical areas from massachusetts down the east coast and into mississippi there is also a wide range in their educational backgrounds most of them have had some experience working in the black community organizing neighborhood problem groups or organizing youth groups students with rural backgrounds have worked in such enterprises as coops and simple farming many of the students backgrounds show that they dropped out or were asked to leave their former schools and colleges for political activism because of these varying backgrounds innovative teaching and learning methods are of a necessity at the university the malcolm_x liberation university experience is a young one still there have been and there are still some difficult hurdles to overcome but those who are attending and working with the university are very serious about black liberation this seriousness is reflected in a statement which was made public prior to the official opening by howard fuller the main organizer and present head of the university we view malcolm_x liberation university as an integral part of the black community therefore we will be involved in any activities affecting the community there will be neither guns nor drugs of any kind in the building therefore if this building is invaded by socalled law officers of a federal state or local variety on the pretext of looking for guns and dope it will be just thata pretext we will be about educating black people this building will serve as a base for that education we will not take any invasion of it lightly we will consider any invasion as an act of aggression against our people and we will respond accordingly thus far no response has been necessary but the concept which the above statement embodies is always kept in the minds of the university participants this concept is that in order to build institutions to bring about a better future for black people we must be constantly aware of the present day forces which seek to blunt such efforts we think that malcolm_x liberation university will not be stopped but we recognize the need for the spiritual as well as the physical support of black people wherever we may be center for black education by the center staff th the rape and penetration of the african continent by the europeans resulting in the destruction of african independence the ability of african people to determine establish and control an education that functioned in their behalf was destroyed a dependent relationship between african people and european people has since then been maintained in three areas they control our minds and instill white consciousness they control the ability to provide goods and services agriculture health industry etc they control the mechanisms of force and violence from the local cops to nato one of the results of this dependency has been the growth of the assumption that the only valid and legitimate standards of wellbeing are those of white supremacy white power and white nationalism white consciousness is always equated as human consciousness education is the primary instrument used to instill i consciousness the educational i process that we are forced to un i dergo demands a commitment to white standards and values it insists that we become white of mind if not white of skin and that our commitment be to the assumptions practices and priorities of white supremacy and white nationalism this assumption is usually ex pressed in such phrases as the struggle for equality other examples include equal employment equal housing equal pay equal toilets etc this of course avoids the question of equal to what this catechism of equality only addresses itself to the everchanging specific manifestations of our oppression it avoids the question of independence maintaining that america is my homecontrary to all historical evidence the question for us is whether to be equal or to be free to be dependent or to be independent to be integrated or to be liberated the history of the equal rights mode of struggle shows that this mode of struggle has only resulted in the maintenance of domination and the continuance of dependency as justice roger b taney of the u s supreme court said in the black man has no rights that a white man need respect we are an african people as a people our struggle is one for independence there are three stages in the struggle for independence selfreliance liberation independence selfreliance is the condition of relying on our resources as a people in order to accomplish any number of specific tasks and responsibilities that contribute to our liberation and independence this can mean for example the ability to develop our oil resources in nigeria our minds in a school in washington d c our bauxite in the caribbean our gold in south africa or our water resources in the sahara there are countless specifics in essence it means proceeding to utilize all of the skills that exist among our people selfreliance concretely begins to break the dependence forced upon us by europeans for the last years it begins to consolidate the collective strength of our scattered nation and to focus this strength on the tasks of reclaiming our natural and human resources which will lead to our independence the hand and mind begin to function in a liberated and liberating manner independence is the ability to possess our minds and consciousness the ability of our people to produce the goods and services necessary for the wellbeing of our people and the ability to protect and defend what is ours we have said that the first step in our struggle for independence is to become selfreliant a critical area in this regard is education it is necessary that we begin to assume responsibility for our own education in order that we begin to determine what our interests are and what responsibilities we have to collectively assume we cannot realistically expect the institutions and programs committed to white power to meaningfully commit themselves to the interests and priorities of african people we have the responsibility to begin to establish schools that function in the interests of african people such schools will outline a course of study that will develop the body the mind and scientific and technical skills that will be be used in the interest of african people each member of the school will be expected to fulfill a teaching responsibility within the larger african community establish and encourage standards and values that commit our people to the struggle for african independence in fact the educational process undergone in this school will intensify the neverending conflict of interest between european peoples and african peoples it is not our intention to prove with this school and others that will be established that we are able to provide the credentials necessary to function comfortably within the framework of white america itis not our intention to occupy students minds with passfail or phdistheroadtosuccess delusions we are not charting a route to mainstream america as j j jones has said harvard and other freak factories has ruint more good niggers than bad whiskey this is the task before us to teach the truth of our situation and what we must do a we are an african people our history has been that of an african people and our future will be that of an african people b african people are at war with european people and have been for the last years c the struggle of african people is for an african nation while it is important that a number of battles for selfreliance be waged in the americas by african people we should always politi cally see those battles in relation to the struggle for an independent african continent d we must use our human resources for the development of the physical resources of africa we must use our political resources to advance the independence of africa e in any society education has two functions to carry on the culture and traditions of that society and to provide the skills and training necessary for the development of that society our education must function in this way as an integral part of society in the interest of the total society as opposed to the interest of the individual as a people we are fragmented geographically eg we live in the u s brazil caribbean senegal gambia etc and we are fragmented in terms of our consciousness eg afroamerican afrotrench afrojewish afrogreek etc that is to say we define ourselves and our interests within european frameworks given this fragmentation we find ourselves in an indefensible position as a people at this point in our history we must forge our fragmented people into a strong nation as edward blyden said we need some african power some great center of the race where our physical pecuniary and intellectual strength may be collected we need some spot whence such an influence may go forth in behalf of the race we need to collect the scattered forces of the race and there is no rallying ground more favorable than africa an african nationality is our great need we should not content ourselves with living among other races simply by their permission or their endurance our school therefore begins to extricate our people from the american nation and focus them on the development of an african nation this requires a knowledge of the african past and a commitment to the african future the development of the scientific and technical skills that will be important to the capacity to deal meaningfully with the resources within the african world the development of language skills important in order to communicate within the african world and also in order to broaden the range of available information travel to the african continent in particular and more generally to the various parts of the african world that the educational process not be allowed to be contained within any single physical facility there is a teaching responsibility to be directed towards meeting the educational needs of the community a special concern is given to the ways and means of communicating varying kinds and amounts of information within the african community whether it be from northwest washington to southeast washington or from new york to nairobi or from texas to trinidad physical fitness and training be an important concern we must understand that strength in body is as important as strength in mind and that there is a relationship between the two let us finally repeat that the fundamental task before us is that of building a nation which will be responsive to the needs and interests of all african peoples we must begin now to integrate the vast body of skills that exist among african peoples into the work of nationbuilding we must put our total being into this task with total commitment to the establishment of independence for african people sketch in blub by e had just finished a bottle of white port and koolaid in a dark corner of a hallway and moved out onto the baseball field do it to me one time cody sped the ball toward me my palms

he so slewfoot he caint walk know he caint run hey blue hey blue voices rung from a window of a building near the baseball lot cmere the voices belonged to two of the archer captivators duck and bunky you cmon down heah if you wanna see me blue yelled back at the window the archer captivators were socalled because they usually met at the triangle formed with archer avenues diagonal cut through wentworth avenue the other base of the triangle was formed by a dirt road dearborn street at the dearborn base stood the archer building a huge dirty rusted structure that had stood at least three quarters of a century it wuz four stories and housed anywhere from four to five hundred people the odd shape of the triangle building created long hallways which were seldom lighted by anything other than daylight dashed through the dirty sometimes paneless windows or trickles of light that crawled from overunder the apartment doors the first floor contained two storefront churches one penny candy store one auto supply store one gypsy fortune teller and one herb and sacraments store that doubled as a policy station duck and bunky were standing in front of the building when blue got there followed by we hangeroners what you dudes up to duck pulled a small shiney blue steel revolver from under his shirt check this out nigga as he handed the gun to blue blue carefully checked out the piece as we peeped for the man whered you cop duck spoke with a grip i copped from warshawsky last night did you git any dough blue licked his lips as he asked naw the cash draw wuz clean but sumbody

the mutha rt my crib blue took one last look at the blue steel deathdealer and handed it to bunky who moved quickly back into the darkness of the hallway how old you duck eighteen lets whup a nigga eighteen times for yo birthday blue suggested duck nodded and looked away for a stick a piece of twobyfour lay in the dusty road behind him he walked over and picked it up i guess thisll do at that moment two young white boys came into view they were heading south on wentworth avenue who dem white boys somebody asked dey aint from duh hood tutti said les gitem when they noticed that we were near them they started to run the railroad embankment made escape difficult if not impossible one of them outdistanced us and made the corner he stood there at the corner watching us quiz and hold his friend please let me go i didnt do anything to youse guys today yo birthday hunky blue shouted its not my birthday the white boy said with puzzlement in his voice it might as well be cause we gon beat yo ass wit this stick juicy and cheetah held him while blue started to slam the twobyfour into the seat of the squirming boys pants you dirty black bastards he screamed tuttis fist caught him in the bastards that screamed from his lips blood and spit flew during the whole thing i was sooo happy that these boys had happened along at the right moment almost a miracle i decided that the moment was a good time to vacate the scene while the white boy wuz the brunt of the hostility ment of the black university this made all kinds of sense when we considered such things as our limited resourceshuman materialthe distribution of the black population and the most fertile sitesfor the black university as i have already stated rightly or wrongly many of us agreed that the black universityat least the mother campus would be best situated in the south assuming that there were others who would agree with this again rightly or wrongly we naturally balked at what sounded like a major development outside of the south we could not help but view any such development as being premature we were also concerned about what appeared to us to be a purely academic approach to the many problems of the people of color neither could we overlook the fact that the college would ultimately be controlled by whites as it was to be part of a white university which is controlled by a racist board of regents and a reactionary governor even more disturbing to us was the fact that the college would be at santa cruz which is certainly not an area with any significant number of black people relative to other areas in california and at the time of the proposal there were less than a dozen black students on the santa cruz campus we couldnt buy the college of malcolm_x but unknowingly we were getting ready to stake our lives on another bill of goods i now recall how some of us shivered with fear for the black university when the santa cruz people spoke of setting a national example perhaps some expert on mass psychology can tell us how ironically even those of us who opposed such developments and had perceived some of the dangers would soon come to speak the same language less than three months went by after bro moores visit before the cry of black studies now was raised across the land many of us who had been the opposition found ourselves leading the charge in berkeley after nine months of fruitless negotiations over our catch action we issued an ultimatum in january for several months prior to the ultimatum asian students chicago students and native american students had been engaged in a crash effort to develop their own programs these were nearing completion when the ultimatum was issued when it became clear that we would have to go downand that the other groups would probably have to do the same at some future datewe joined hands and asked for a third world college to house the four programs it might be said that our catch action died a natural death but the memory of the college of malcolm_x and our response to it three months earlier wasis extremely painful constant vigilance constant vigilance now brother harding i must attempt to deal with your letter more directly i too believe that some of our actions have placed us in bad company in trying to assess what might have been our greatest mistake i seem unable to avoid thinking that it was to assume that every white school which had even the smallest number of black students ought to have black studies most white schools will never make a workable adjustment to such programs still more of them simply do not deserve such programs but im getting ahead of myself this is something that i should return to all black students are not interested in black studieslet alone a black university au naturels dashikis and bubas have caused us to become presumptuous traditional motives for going to college are still very much alive the students want in and college is still the gateway when they came in different attire and coiffured differently many of us assumed that they wanted out for the most partwe were wrong but it is true that you can never fool everybody in this case it was mainly the socalled negro teachers who were not fooled they seemed to recognize immediately the difference between a change in style and a change in motive the new black thing was clearly a case involving a change of style and the socalled negro teachers recognized this one might think that they would have immediately called a conference as they so hurriedly have for a thousand other reasons to warn the students that they were dealing with style instead of substance but no for obvious reasons this was not in the cards what did occur instead was that prestohundreds of socalled negro teachers suddenly became black instructors out the window went murrays tuxedo royal crown and straightening combs the buba business had a new market books dealing around black folks were rushed into print course outlines were developed others were borrowed sold or stolen and letters and circulars carried the good tidings of jobs for black instructors the students were told to keep on pushin when schools were not sending out such letters and circulars various other programs were the entire country is now literally crawling with black programs and everyvhere the end result is division and confusion but we face an even greater danger what must be one of the greatest dangers we now faceif not the greatest dangeris the obvious creation of a class of opportunists who are determined to make off black studies what texas millionaires have made off oil in common parlance i would call them hustlers like the story of the ship at sea without fresh water we are fast approaching a situation where there will be black experts everywhere and not a drop of expertise this brother harding is what many of us are presently in league with and it is a league that we must break with very soon if we are ever to have our own on many occasions the central issue in our struggles with white administrators has been that of autonomy and in most cases we have not gotten it although in many cases they have acquiesced in such a manner as to offer the illusion that we have gotten it this is of the utmost importance in assessing fully the danger of the aforementioned problem because we do not have autonomy over the programs we are creating quite often when we discover that we have a dud on our hands which may be the whole program or someone in it we are unable to get rid of itthem this of course is very risky monstermaking and has considerably stiffened the demand for self determination there is yet another unseen danger in trying to operate without the power to purge when necessary quite often we do not really know the people we bring in to teach and administer us if no struggle occurs which calls for a demonstration of their commitment it is safe to assume that we never really know where they are alas in many cases when struggle has occurred more often than not we have discovered that our black and third world instructors were on the other side at best they were for themselves this was graphically illustrated during the strike at berkeley when only six third world faculty and administrators out of approximately seventyfive would agree to go on strike when we asked them to of course there were all kinds of reasons why they couldnt many of which could have been offered by the students who were on the line but then its ok if students get offed they should keep on pushin so that faculty and administrative people can continue to multiply and give credence to the lie but i really didnt wish to get into all this i only meant to say that we have learned that it is extremely dangerous to act as the head of a house when you cant bring people in or put them out when it comes to that point i should like to suggest right here that one simple way of dealing with this problemwhile checking the overall shotgun approach to the development of black studieswould be to rule out from the git go any development of black studies in those institutions where we are unable to gain the autonomy necessary to control them i fear if we fail to do this now we shall all suffer for it later but the total solution of this problem calls for more than one move the other moves i feel represent a partial response to your questions regarding our sense of vocation as is clearly borne out by the problems we face regarding programs and personnel there is an urgent need for us to begin to identify both faculty and students who have a serious long term vocational interest in developing a black university and getting them to work on it immediately if successfully carried out this alone would probably kill twothirds of the nonfunctional black studies programs in the country somehow at some time we have got to make it clear that black studies is not a mere cultural phenomenon which one relates to by parading around in the latest nationalist garb and talking bad sooner or later there just has to be a parting of the ways between those who just want to be in either the thing or the know and those who want to aid in our liberation through education we are simply no good for one another it will also have to be made clear that black studies has not come about to guarantee jivetime boogaloo opportunistic students degrees by padding their grades at present there is an immense amount of outright shuckin and jivin ie students expecting grades of excellent for writing papers which in essence say only ive got my shit together which is doubtful or im doing my thang others expect good grades for simply reaffirming the fact that whitey is doing his thang this is not the way to liberation and i think we should stop letting people believe that it is students who want to play football basketball go to europe become stockbrokers get into the movies become black capitalists or playboy bunnies should be taughtwarned and left alone most certainly they should be identified we have committed some regrettable mistakes because we failed to identify them in the past many of us saw them walking around looking militant and felt compelled to create campus revolts in their behalf this was certainly not the least of our mistakes but let me move on i had hoped that i could deal with the questions that you raised at the end of your letter in the order that you raised them however as i have attempted to respond torather than just answeryour letter a large part of the order has already been preempted but i will at this point attempt to go beyond the body of your letter to those numbered questions that remain you will i hope permit me one exception questions numbered i see no way to proceed without first dealing with these clearly there cannot be more than a few really excellent programs in afroamerican studies in this country the scarcity of our resources leaves no doubt about this take for example what is happening in northern california in the san francisco bay and surrounding area there are some major and minor colleges and universities all of these are presently in the process of developing black andor ethnic studies programs really i can think of only a dozen or so black instructors who may have more than an elementary understanding of what is actually meant by black studies of these i can think of less than half a dozen who have demonstrated or expressed any genuine interest in developing a black university further still if we started to speak of less than to a year in salary i would be afraid to bank on more than three of these on the brighter side if we can call it that the situation is somewhat better with concerned students but this glimmer too is dulled when you consider the task at hand the development of some college programs not to mention the demands being made by local and surrounding high schools given these circumstances not only in california but across the nation it is easy to appreciate the absurdity of trying to develop black studies at random but even if this could be done it would be certain to weaken if not totally dispel any effort to develop one or two major programs anywhere so the question of where such programs should be developed becomes key perhaps for a change we are actually in need of a conference to decide where we should or should not attempt to develop black studies and if such a conference were to be called it should be made clear to all concerned that the purpose of the conference would be to bring together all of those persons who are not only concernedbut who wish to devote their energies to the creation of a black university if this is not done and we bring an amorphous group of people together to discuss black education in general we run the familiar and often catastrophic risk of lapsing into needless oration and generalities this is not to say that we do not need or appreciate the support that we presently haveonly that someone must actually do the work now something is implied here which ought to be dealt with what is implied is that some differentiation is being made between black education in general and the black university in my opinion this is a necessary differentiation it is my understanding that we who wish to work towards the development of a black university are not saying that we wish to dictate or control everything educational that has to do with black people instead we are simply saying that we believe that there should be a black university in other words i do not believe that we are implying that no school other than the black university should attempt to have its curriculum reflect the presence of black people indeed i think we all agree that this should be done i think however that we ought to be saying to our own people that any major program developed should in some way be either directly related to or at least complimentary to the development of the black university otherwise such programs are bound to do a disservice to the black university by contributing to our already disturbing state of diaspora once we have decided where the mother campus of the black university is going to be i can see no difficulty in then determining where other programs should be developed you raised the question of how you our brothers in the south might be of the greatest help to us in the north how much of your energies should be spent in consulting and lecturing in the north at our request when you have so much business to take care of down there i am tempted to answer this question by saying that you should do nothing with respect to the northjust continue to do your thing down there but that would be too blatant an expression of my bias for what you are doing there as opposed to what we have gotten involved with here then too there are some things that you can do for us without adversely affecting what you are doing there first of all you can help all of us by using your influence and ideas with other sincere black educators to help us form some kind of an accrediting association to deal in the area of black or afroamerican studies it seems our only chance of insuring some degree of integrity when so many things are happening i think we could also expect such an association to be able to determine which programs schools in the north are worthy of your attention visits consultation lectures etc and which ones are not the national association of africanamerican educators should facilitate an easy start in this direction all we have to do is relate to it other than this i urge you all to persist in your loyalty to the black students who study with you in the south even in the face of tempting salary offers and the handful of us who have been farmedout as window dressing for the prestigious institutions of the north you have the ball essence and they are simply waiting to steal it after we have tackled you in answer to question no it is my opinion that you should refuse any offers from either us or them until some arrangement regarding the above has been formalized there is presently nothing in white institutions that is worth imitating anything that we could create in them to imitate might just as well be created in the right place to begin with it would make a great deal of sense in my opinion for us to attempt to provide as many serious northern black students as possible with exposure to the blackoriented brothers in the south and the southern black experience in general indeed many of us have already developed a vision of our circumstances that is tunneled because we lack such exposure as is evidenced by the tone of this letter i found your suggestions for action wholly appropriate and in keeping with our needs of these i do not believe that enough can be said for the usefulness of a scheme such as the consortium that you suggested unless some such arrangement is effected we may reasonably expect not only a continuation of the present rape and deprivation of southern black institutions but it appears that we can expect an escalation of this situation whether or not we are able to create such consortiums may be largely determined by our ability or willingness to communicate the sordidness of these circumstances and to move constructively to prevent them still there is the need to be more specific about what to do and where to do it and it is here that i wish to offer some further suggestions it is a fact that we are still in the midst of a general stampede in the direction of black or afroamerican studies it is equally a fact that this approach black studies everywhereanywhere is not conducive to the construction of one really good program anywhere therefore we ought to decide where such programs are really neededcan function and devote our time and energies to these alone the to million people that we are concerned about are spread across the country west coast east coast midwest and south the task as it appears to me is to construct some programs that will bring as many of us together as is possible to insure that at least four major programs directly related to the black universityare developed in the country broken down here is how i see this on the west coast and pacific northwest california has the largest concentration of black people this concentration is primarily in the northern and southern parts of the state within the northern and southern parts of the state the black population is dispersed in such a manner that to speak of an educational endeavor expected to affect all of them is to speak of at least two sites in both the northern and southern parts of the state say two in or around the los angeles area and two in or around the san francisco bay area on the east coast the black population is concentrated primarily in new york new jersey and pennsylvania here any action expected to affect a majority would probably require three sites possibly four because of the unusually large number of people in this case i cannot guess about where these sites should be because of my limited knowledge of the areas involved i merely wish to convey that an expanded effort will be required in this area in the midwest the folks are primarily in illinois michigan and ohio again the action should probably be triple then of course there is the south where more than half the souls still are as i have already related many of us feel that this is where we should attempt to do our main thing the mother campus of the black university other than the fact that you have already made a notable start there which probably exceeds anything that we have done in integrity i am inclined to believe that there are many more reasons for this decision that are rather obvious i am further convinced that the south is the place when i look and see not only beautiful potential sites for the mother campus but so many beautiful sites for extension programs of all kinds now what i am saying here should not be construed to mean that we ought to undertake the establishment of nine universities at least not at this time i am instead suggesting that we attempt to create one university and eight catchvrelated totype actions to support it i mean this is my vision of your consortium ideally constructed we name the sitesthe schools choose the people see that the money is pooled recruit the students and faculty and send the kindling down south as we have seen so many promises swell and fail to gain the crucial burst needed for an overflow of success i fear for the ebbing but yet unborn and contained black university pray to all damballa first that we do not fail this time but there must be something that we can do to lessen the possibility of a failure one thing that we have not done in the past is to be specific enoughboth in terms of our interest and our commitment we can think talk and write about everything but we can only act effectively on one thing at a time nearly everyone among us can recall attending meetings conferences etc where we dealt with so many things we were told so many things to do that we seldom accomplished any one of them in our haste to do them all possibly we can avoid this if we remember that our goal is the black university we canmust and will be concerned about everything else but some of us must work towards the establishment of the black university if it is ever to become a reality it may at this point sound foolishly ambitious but the best possible assurance we could provide to see that our dream is not stillborn would be to find a way to pay a small but devoted group of people to work fulltime towards the development of the black university and the aforementioned supporting actions otherwise the risk of failure that we run is incalculable your commentary regarding finances hardly calls for any response save a resounding amen and an affirmative nod you are certainly correct in assuming that the time has come for the northern white institutions to do something more than attempt to destroy the black institutions of the south there are so many ways in which they might begin or be forced to contribute positively that i could hardly begin to list them but i should not pass one of these many black graduate students across the country are being paid to act as teaching assistants in their respective schools but who really needs these teaching assistants many of whom are already qualified instructors are there not enough white graduate students in white northern schools to teach introductory courses and to grade papers surely these guilty committed and concerned white institutions would not mind paying the salaries or some part of them of those black students who wished to do their assisting in the black institutions of the south where they are really needed this is something that militant black students and black teacher recruiting programs should look into the autonomous black foundation of which you speak is long overdue why did we not think of this at a time less pressing for its need most of us know about foundations who establishes them supports them operates them and keeps them going black professionals the middle class bourgies artists and others whose faith taste style and nerves hope that they will not be offended by the jargonor intimidated will not allow them to do anything else must be urged to get going i such is a common excuse for doing nothing words other black faculty persons have evidently taken a similar point of view how does that way of producing blackness fit into our rhetoric concerning the needs of the community is it really more imitation that we must have now considering our sadly limited resources can there be more than a few really excellent programs or institutes in afroamerican studies in this country is it possible that the recent announcements of the creation of at least two dozen such programs will lead to even more dispersion of our black talents rather than to the consolidation we so badly need for this period if only a few such black research and teaching centers can live with significant integrity where should they be developed indeed where will they find nurture during a period of prolonged struggle to move to an even more directly personal level have any of you considered the possibility that it might make more sense to bring black students to a blackoriented professor in the south than to take him away from his campus in other words have you questioned your own locations seriously in the light of our need to gather ourselves together have you given serious thought to your own sense of vocation the building of the black university whether it be realized in one or a dozen locations demands totally committed teachers organizers and administrators who have moved beyond jiving to real work what about you perhaps you dont know that black students in the south on the negro campuses are also calling for more black faculty where will we find them concrete suggestions for action on the recruiting of black faculty for northern schools if this must be done during these days when the supply of wellequipped blackconscious brothers and sisters is so limited then why not work for the establishment of special visiting professorships rather than outright raiding of black schools under such an arrangement faculty from the south could be invited for one year we could teach one course in our specialty each quarter or semester and be available for many kinds of counselling there would also be freedom from the many ordinary academic pressures of our southern campuses and time as well as secretarial and research assistance could be made available for more research writing and publication at the same time we would not be wrenched away from the southern schools on an indefinite basis in a sense this would be no more than a token presence of course but it represents a temporary measure which might have some mutual benefit while we discuss the questions above and while we seek to increase the supply of brothers and sisters who can do the job on the recruiting of black students there are obviously hundreds of thousands of black students outside of the colleges who ought to be involved in some meaningful experience of higher education since your institutions have obtained funds from many sources for some of this task why not make at least part of that money available in more creative ways for instance a consortium of one or more white and one or more black schools could be created solely for the purposes of recruiting black students through some pooling of funds mostly yours in the north black students could then be approached with this offer here are the funds you need to go through college you can use the money to attend for example morehouse dillard cornell or the university of illinois if you choose a black school we ask only that you agree to spend one of your years on the predominantly white campus strengthening your brothers there if you choose an overwhelmingly white school you will have the privilege of going home for a year in this way black students could take the money from white schools and use it in any way they choose besides under the new conditions now prevailing in both black and white institutions the exchange could not help but be fruitful the issue of finances is a crucial one especially as it relates to the future of black colleges some institutions would obviously serve the cause best if they merged with other schools to create new strengths and expanded facilities but even those which remained need to be enlarged and endowed in ways that black schools have not known up to now why for instance should it not be possible for prestigious northern schools to use their prestige to help obtain special research grants for certain work which can be done well only by black scholars or why should your more affluent northern institutions not be pressed to make other significant financial contributions to the life of these schools they now so blithely seek to rape the united negro college fund might be one general depository others can be found perhaps an autonomous but well funded black educational foundation ought to be established with its single mission the financing of creative ventures in black education this would not exempt the existing white foundations of course it would simply mean that this black institution would be able to give all of its time and energies to the task so far it has been relatively easy to get white institutions to perform certain kinds of moneyproducing acts on behalf of black education on their own campuses perhaps the time has come to press them to use part of their budgets even sections of their endowment funds to help establish such a foundation or otherwise to make longterm substantial investments in the black academic institutions these would of course constitute no more than preliminary steps towards restitution certainly it is no accident that such proposals fit the pattern of what the former colonizing nations must do to be of significant assistance to the areas they crippled finally it is apparent in the current rush to blackness on the part of white institutions that there simply is not the beginning of an adequate supply of persons trained in afroamerican studies it is imperative for usand for youthat we move urgently to fill that gap in ways other than the stripping of the southern black campuses the various institutes and phd programs in this field which have appeared over the past year are obviously meant to meet the need as well as to satisfy you and to keep you off certain backs but i would argue that most of them cannot and will not do the job indeed some of them may die as soon as you stop blowing on the other hand it is only logical that black institutions in the black community if properly funded organized and led could probably do the best job of creating new scholars in the field of afroamerican studies this seems especially likely in those places where traditions libraries and faculties seem at least adequate even now and where students are pressing sometimes reluctant others towards blackness in atlanta that has been our basic assumption and a group of us have moved towards the creation of such an institute for afroamerican studies we think that black students throughout the nation should know this and should ponder its possible meaning for your own presents and futures as some of you know there are in the atlanta university center six negro institutions in various stages of their search for blackness on the faculties are more than persons whose training experience and teaching in the field of afroamerican life and culture are at least significant the slaughter collection of negro literature the georgia state archives and the newly begun martin_luther_king memorial library a documentation center for the movement combine to present unusual library and archival resources on the black experience apart from such tangibles we are also beneficiaries of the spirit of the great pioneering work in black studies done in atlanta by such persons as w e b du bois e franklin frazier rayford logan e s braithwaithe ira dea reid and many others it is against this background of past and present resources that we are now in the process of creating an institute for afroamerican studies under the umbrella of the martin_luther_king jr memorial center research teaching celebration and action are to be the central driving forcesall focused on the life and times of the peoples of african descent i mention the institute here because it will need many things which you can help provide it will need millions of dollars the best staff from every part of the african diaspora students who are ready to take care of business and it must have continuous exposure throughout the black community the schools you attend could help raise funds for this institute for they will need our products both human and informational if they are to be transformed into viable situations some of you will ultimately comprise the staff and student body the plans you now have for the afroamerican studies in white settings must be reexamined and challenged by atlanta in short i am proposing that you help this institute become the major black educational creation of this generation you have a kind of leverage in the white world which must not be dissipated in minor ambiguous victories more importantly you have a power which must not be turned against meaningful black institutions the challenge to help create such an institute to break down the many brittle assumptions of conventional american education to move consistently towards our intellectual roots in the struggle for liberationthis is i think a challenge more appropriate to your power as you ponder these matters i trust you will remember that my questions and proposals are meant to be only some of the ingredients in a dialogue which must take place among us the letter is written in the spirit of black ecumenical concern as we move towards a new humanity the words are my own but the concerns are shared by many other persons on the southern campuses we look forward to appropriate response from the north east and west black studies as an academic discipline by preston wilcox laremont college c f is to be commended for convening a cone ference on the subject jssue biac k studies as an academic discipline considering the amount of ivory tower energy that has been invested in proving that the only way black students can achieve is to deny any association with their own cultural heritageand the historical inequities designed to destroy itthis is an important step in the right direction claremont colleges efforts to explore this subject in a systematic fashion may be the first step in the direction of its own rehumanization this observation is made because of the ease with which a large number of whitecontrolled institutions of higher education have dodged the intellectual issue they did so by setting up separate and sometimes autonomouslycontrolled black studies programs without taking one step to decolonize their core curricula the organized resistance to courses such as swahili is a case in point not only were efforts undertaken to invalidate swahili as worthy of location within an academic curriculum several mainstream scholars challenged its relevance to descendants of africa all this took place in the shadow of freshman orientation courses which function mainly to acclimate students to the campus but not necessarily to education for meaningful survival and liberation but one can not permit himself to be carried away by the opportunity to explore this question recall that the concept of academic discipline as perceived by most scholars does not include authentic blacks as full participantsnor does it seek to define them as equals it is a creation of a white supremacist society one in which scientific colonialism was utilized both to conceal the reality of racism and also to label black scholars as unqualified the criteria by which most white americans have earned their phds has had little to do with white merit it has had more to do with white oppression white scholars have not had to compete with black scholars as students or as codefiners of the social fabric of this society i call this phenomena the satchel paige syndrome satchel paiges very excellence as a baseball pitcher increased the possibility that he would not be admitted to the major leagues until he was thought to be over the hill this reminds me of a white friend who was the florida state champion in the yard dash while in high school he graduated the same year as did bob hayes now of the dallas cowboys bob hayes may not have the trophy in his homesince he was prevented by the white segregationists from competingbut everybody in florida knows who the real champion is a corollary to this analysis is the content and style of the academic format shaped deliberately to include and deepen white control over blacks and to exclude authentic inputs such an academic concept can only be fully understood as being politically and intellectually oppressive colonialistic in action and white supremacist in content the phding process which is similar to that of the making of a priest requires that candidates surrender the right to think for themselves to the doctoral committeesin the same way that a candidate for ordination takes a vow with the pope the political nature of academic disciplines as applied by mainstream scholars raises a further question the socalled apolitical stance of mainstream scholars is in fact a fabrication such a policy merely conceals the politics behind it under a fagade of scientific objectivity to apply the same criteria to black studies as has been applied to white studies is to ensure that black studies will become white studies a new social contract that claremont college has raised this issue to the level of intellectual inquiry is a commendable effort only to the degree that such an inquiry respects certain basic understanding about the issue being engaged a whitecontrolled institutions of higher education have survived as full members of a societv in which it is illegal to be human herewith defined as being a positive relationship with one of minority group status a poor person or one who is different from oneself b whitecontrolled institutions of higher education have survived not as instruments to reshape society but as tools of the same society that has assigned illegal status to the groups mentioned above c the thrust of black studies programs must remain at the level of a movement they must resist institutionalization and any partnership which is not pluralistic humanistic in function and integrally related to the liberation and restoration of all black people more than anything else black studies programs must be viewed as instruments for the development of the black communitythey should not become token instruments for the legitimation of white institutions of higher education d the scientific colonialismdefined by galtung as that process whereby the center of gravity for the acquisition of knowledge about a nation is located outside itself w must be replaced by scientific humanism wherein the center of gravity for the acquisition of knowledge about black people is collected controlled managed and distributed by black people before this issue can be systematically approached then a social contract involving the following points must be made a the powersthatbe in the white controlled institutions must get involved in overcoming the racist practices that benefit them in economic and educational terms to the disadvantage of black and other minority group students recall that most such institutions are organized as though we reside in an egalitarian society when in fact the democracy they espouse is a hypocrisy blacks are not treated as equals by whites because of the essential meaning of being nonblackin style habits behavior etc part of the meaning of being white is to define blacks as being inferior an active manifestation of white superiority stokely carmichael raised this question for whites when he wrote it must be offered that white people who desire change in this country should go where that problem racism is most manifest the problem is not in the black community the whites should go into white communities where whites have created power for the express purpose of denying blacks human dignity and selfdetermination b the black studies institute must be involved systematically in redefining understanding and codifying the black experience to ensure that a body of relevant and transmittable knowledge is developed this effort must involve the development of new definitions of old perspectives an increasing reliance on black selfaccreditation and the planful use of instinctual understandings such as selfconcept functional anger and the like the old perspectives have assigned inhuman status to blacks the efforts of blacks to integrate with whites has led to a new level of white paternalism whites keep the real power blacks become acting colonial relations agents traditional ivory tower intellectualism is in fact a higher form of antiintellectualism it isolates theory from practice separates apprehension from comprehension thought from action and conceals the politics of social control behind a facade of a political intellectuality this new social contact should be characterized by a pluralistic approach to curriculum development and management and institutional governance the white segment of the institution should be involved in getting its house in order while the black segment does likewise the interface between these two should involve a continuing identification of shared curriculum and decisionmaking and opportunities to increase the possibility that a legitimate integrated institution will result a whitecontrolled institution can never achieve the status of authentic integration neither can a predominantly white institution achieve that status such a status can only be achieved within a racist society if the student body is predominantly minority group and the control at the least is multiracial with clear divisions of labor and responsibility significantly the meaning of education and the educational goals of the university system should undergo a process of reordering student orientation should engage students in beginning to learn about that particular contribution they want to make toward the betterment of the society of which they are a part the traditional plan orients students into participantconsumer roles into the system rather than as participantproducers a second order of business is that of enabling students to learn how to think for themselves rather than the way we would like to have them think part and parcel of the process is enabling students to begin to view education as a tool for their own liberation as a political instrument if you will rather than as a means to make it this new social contract will foster a different set of social relationships a an identification of a shared responsibilityblack and whitein defining the role of an educational institution within a democratic society and how to achieve such a society b an identification of those decisions which are the exclusive purview of the participating partners as they relate to the various componentsadmissions course requirements faculty status curriculum content etcof the university system this new social contract will foster a different set of social relationships between the participating partners rather than competing with each other to define and redefine the white and black positions each will be assigned to defining a human position in his own terms rather than competing with and confronting each other they will find themselves competing with and confronting themselves the first rung on the road to meaningful selfeducation whites will not have to feel like patrons blacks will not have to feel patronized importantly white administrators will not have to learn how to make relevant decisions about blacks instead they will be called upon to give up their need to do so blacks in turn will not have to expend decisionmaking energies teaching whites to understand the black experience these energies can be better utilized deepening its implementation the rationale for proposing such a social contract is based on the following a among the many consequences of our racist society is not only its impact on the blackwhite encounter but its impact on how people feel about themselves others and their frames of reference white unity is a factor then of the common negative attitudes toward blacks whites perceive each other positively largely because of their common disdain for black people and not because of a positive identity with whom they are to make a humane decision affecting black people is antiwhite in the view of most white people black unity thus far has derived from common oppression and exploitation and less from a development of positive group selfinterests this pattern is gradually being reversed by the black_power ethos black people are relying less and less on a humane response from whites they are utilizing their skills and resources to increase the degree to which they control and define their own lives b as most institutions of higher education have operated they have systematically overlooked the legitimate concerns of black people the communities in which they reside and their legitimate aspirations black students until very recently were significantly absent on most such campuses as a consequence large numbers of students have been educated not to be able to perceive and deal with black people and their experiences on a humane level not only is there a missing body of knowledge but effective ways and means of collecting interpreting and understanding it have yet to be developed toward a definition before black studies can earn the status of an academic discipline whitecontrolled institutions must recognize their inability to so accredit them black studies should not become a replica of white studiesnor should they be perceived as being a reaction to the failure of institutions of higher education to include such programs as an integral part of their curricula the thrust for black studies programs developed not on white college campuses but at selma birmingham and at the march on washington it was on the civil_rights battlefield that blacks learned that an appeal to the white conscience had to be replaced by an appeal to black consciousness that the alternative to white oppression was not integration but the mounting of black_power that white people could not save black people from exploitation and degradation as long as white people benefited from them in order to fully understand this movement one must understand jim formans black manifesto as an attempt to define a new socioeconomic contract between white donors and black recipients it is based not on white philanthropy but black restitution grants made to black students should be perceived not as white charity but as the return of legal entitlements to a group on whose backs this nation was built the concept of reparations must be fully understood as a prerequisite then to understanding the subject at hand black studies can not be perceived as an academic discipline as long as the program resources are whitecontrolled andor managed james boggs has discussed the subject of black capitalism as being mythical and irrational he has raised the question in order to warn blacks against displacing whites as economic exploiters of blacks as a means to urge them to develop a new set of socioeconomic relationshipsnonexploitative in nature and collectively incomeproducing in operation his point seems to be that racism and capitalism are so deeply intertwined that they shape and are shaped by each other this behavior on college campuses is seen in the pattern of utilizing federal grants and special programs as a way to increase the inventory of black students whites continue to get paid to serve as gatekeepers for the onebyone admission of black students on criteria established by whites and not blacks as forman has put it we have always resisted attempts to make us slaves and now we must resist attempts to make us capitalists the reparations concept based on the articulation of a humanizing socioeconomic contract between white donors and black recipients and the recognition of a need to develop a humanizing socioeconomic network of relationships within the black community are important to understand this externalinternal relationship construct became the basis on which the national association for africanamerican education began to develop an educational paradigm addressed to an understanding of the black condition it began by defining the black educator as follows students parents community leaders clergymen businessmen activists moderates college professors teachers educational administrators and all who are actively involved in the educational liberation and survival of the black people it attempts to avoid exclusion on the basis of social class ideology age occupational role andor organizational affiliates the paradigm under discussion focused attention on education for life rather than education for scholarship it was based on the interrelationships between the phases of psychosocial development and the social systems under which the change and growth take place the family the neighborhood the city the nation and the world threaded throughout the paradigm was a concern with the physical and mental health of black people and a positive association with their own cultural heritage this paradigm was to provide the foundation on which education for black humanism was to be based the concept of academic discipline was to include these considerations as a sine qua non importantly it was to provide the framework on which new and substantive bodies of knowledge about the black condition were to be linked it would require that such issues as selfconcept reparations cooperative and collective economic enterprises psychological and political liberation a reordering of given values be systematically addressed and understood i many black scholars have begun to address these questions from a variety of perspectives and as they would operate within a functional black university james boggs has sketched out some guiding principles as they affect relationships between student and community research and community theory and practice intellectual studies and manual work studies and social change students and teachers and students to one another and subject matter productive or technical skills black culture social change and interdisciplinary relationships as he views it the educational process must restructure blackwhite relationship and i internal relationships among blacks as it operates scientific colonialism vs scientific humanism any serious and studied review of the writings and productions of mainstream scholars will reveal three major shortcomings one is the tendency to define black people as being in need of white accreditation before earning the right to be perceived as humans the white supremacist policies which undergird such efforts are concealed behind a facade of objectivity this tendency is observed as follows a the practice of comparing black and white statistics without taking into account differences in opportunities emanating from the reality of white institutional racism b the concealment of the exploitative nature of the relationships between social class groupings blacks and whites and less chance communities and the larger systems in which they are embedded c the labeling of the same behavior by whites and blacks by the use of different sociological terms d the tendency to treat blacks as equals only as it relates to negative criteria such as crime statistics drug addictions etc e the tendency to view the problems of blacks from the perspective of negative individual and group characteristics rather than perceiving such problems as being one consequence of their treatment within a white racist society thinking black scholars are aware of the fact that a william whytes organization man should have been labeled the white uncle toms b the only effective analogy between white and black families has little to do with the role of the woman it has more to do with the presumption of white male superiority and actual black male genocide the fact of the matter is that white suburban families are matriarchial even though the man is in the home c the residential patterns of this nation have less to do with land use choice and income than they do with discrimination minority group exploitation and the overprotection of the vagina of white women by white men d the ghetto cannot be understood as an orientation ground for becoming middle class its structure approximates that of a plantation or a prison system controlled externally and internally by outsiders the problems of the ghetto are whitegenerated whiteproliferated and whitecontrolled flowing from this recognition should be an understanding of how the judgments of many scholars and those of their students have been systematically screwed up many of us cannot distinguish missionaries from mercenaries clergymen from conmen nuns in habits from prostitutes in habits teachers from wardens students from inmates policeman from the gestapo criminals from philanthropists and pimps from able parents this phenomena has increased the possibility that the perceptions of the student submit him to easy external controland that he too will be educated to use knowledge to manipulate rather than to liberate this phenomena is further characterized by the rhetoric of oppression in the use of words to present the illusion of a democracy that does not exist really means really means real lx means mr really means really means really means school decentralization really means a third shortcoming is the failure to draw upon the natural shrewdness of the black community to define its own problems and aspirations the current proliferation of autobiographies biographies novels position statements and social studies produced by blacks themselves are characterized by a a lesser degree of intellectual fragmentation such writings are marked by a discussion of the impact of white institutional racism an awareness of the political realities and the interrelationship between separate concepts icebergs slims biography of otis tilson a black homosexual describes male castration and homosexuality in one person as it has been seldom understood otis writes my reason for telling my story is not money im telling it for my poor dead papa and myself and the thousands of black men like him in ghetto torture chambers who have and will be niggerized and deballed by the white structure and the thrill kill police he further links the degradation of the black man as it occurs both down south and up south a papa had some importance and a sense of worth down south even though living conditions were subhuman up north poor papa would become a zero unimportant to everyone even to his wife and children b the use of the subject of study both as the sources and interpreters of the data not only has this provided a new source of data but a body of missing knowledge for instance very few libraries have a category white institutional racism most libraries still view the race problem as the negro problem as discrimination as racial and cultural minorities heading home it may appear that i have refused to confront and examine the subject issue black studies as an academic discipline it only appears that way the crucial issue requires a redefinition of the concept such that blacks are perceived as and treated as humans with a common heritage african descendency and victimization by white institutional racism to discuss such an issue in the setting of whitecontrolled institutions requires several prior actions it is these prior actions to which this statement has been addressed a the articulation and implementation of a new coequal and parallel social contractextending from admissions to governance b the replacement of the philanthropic socioeconomic contract between blacks and whites with one which is based on the legal entitlements of black restitution c the development of the technology leading toward the establishment of a cooperative and collective socioeconomic network of relationships among blacks d the replacement of scientific colonialism with scientific humanism e the development of a systematic and transmittable body of knowli edge about the black condition black studies is an academic discipline fully accredited within the black world it is that body of experience and knowledge that blacks i have had to summon in order to learn how to survive within a society j that is stacked against them the white campus then is a means to an end not an end in itself it is a place to learn the mans language as a second language to understand his institutions so as to be able to subvert and humanize them to hone ones mind to apply ones intelligence to an understanding and alleviation of the black condition to internalize a need to participate in ones own liberation to contribute to a sense of black nationhood in the last analysis this nation can not be a human nation until black people and other minorities say and behave as though it is in the same sense any white institution which seeks to evaluate black studies program on white oppressive criteria can never be a great institution until black students so accredit it black studies at this juncture by j frank yates year ago the entire country was being swept with demands by black students for more relevant educational institutions what were those demands about what has been done what remains to be done only after hundreds of black studies programs have actually begun has the real message of that movement made impact many have thoughtindeed hoped that the black studies movement of was simply a fad to be sure there was definitely spontaneous contagion in the movement this is a necessary part of any mass action there are however underlying issues that will either sustain the work of the serious black studies programs or lead to new crises if they fail simply stated a school or educational system justifies its exist i ence in a community by fulfilling two functions first it must impart the skills needed by the people to maintain their physical existence r second it must cultivate and transmit traditions and ideological concepts that meet the peoples psychological and moral needs to perform satisfactorily a school must be able to deal with both issues simultaneously the rebellious black student of was say n ing essentially that his schools black and whitewere adequately fulfilling neither function but es l pecially the second j we should examine that second function closer what really is ideology the concept has various i facets milton pokeach the open and closed mind and t w adorno the authoritarian personality isolate several of the core ideas they stress that ideology represents an institutionalized set of beliefs that one just picks up an organization of opinions attitudes and valuesa way of thinking about man and society other students of social movements emphasize another essential feature applied to this discourse they imply a fundamental relationship between the two functions of a school in the words of daniel bell the end of ideology pp ideology is the conversion of ideas into social levers in essence the ideology running through a society does much to determine how the people perceive themselves the perspective from which they evaluate all issues even the very alternatives they imagine clearly the course of human events is determined largely by just such factors i submit that the creation or development of a new ideology permeating the lives of black people is one of the most important if not the most important issue facing us today if such a black ideology already existed we would not see hundreds of agencies and organizations operating in our communities with all of them getting essentially nowhere if such an ideology already existed it would no longer be necessary to keep in stock a thousand and one powerful black orators to stir the black masses to action if such an ideology already existed it would not be necessary to create crises to solicit black support that soon peters out we are not the first group of people to experience the need for a new ideology the very group we recognize as our nemesis the white americans have experienced such a crisis in fact the resolution of their crisis has had much to do with the creation of ours winthrop jordan white over black chronicles the identity or ideological conflicts felt by the white american people during and shortly after the revolutionary war the american ideology that evolved from that period had at its core the notion that a true american was essentially a slightly modified anglosaxon the definition of american consciously excluded j nonenglish european influences the incorporation of blackness into the recognized concept of americanism was so absurd that the idea was never seriously considered reality and the official ideology of americanism could not and cannot be reconciled consequently white america has had to maintain two ideologies the official ideology incorporates all the ideals expressed in the countrys official documents the real ideology provides the foundations for racial oppression since a societys ideology serves as a basis for the attitudinal and belief systems of its people the duality and inconsistency of the american ideology implied a corresponding duality and inconsistency in the model american white personality all the various notions of cognitive balance can be applied toward understanding the probable result that result has most often been denial and compartmentalization we cannot deny that to some extent black people too have internalized aspects of the dual american ideology this is the crux of the issue dealt with here the situation is more complex than that involving whites in that neither portion of the american ideology has been adequate for black americans there have always been the rudiments of a functional black ideology in our communities however it has had to contend with tremendous odds for its mere survival let alone growth we control few instruments of communication and education the result has been three distinct and often inconsistent constellations of ideas attitudes and beliefs permeating black society small wonder that so many black individuals experience hangups and more important there is little to maintain our programs for change many including harold cruse crisis of the negro intellectual and rebellion or revolution and other cultural nationalists have recognized the ideological need of which speak their proposal that cultural nationalism is necessary to fill the void does not seem adequate the american political economic and cultural apparatus seems far too complex for cultural nationalism to be sufficient the final resolution may however involve some aspects of cultural nationalism it is incumbent upon those seriously committed to black studies to seek out the ideological positions that would be most beneficial to black people black thinkers especially black psychologists must aid in the development and transmission of the new black ideology this is the challenge of black studies at this juncture unless it is met we have simply added another agency to the pile and the next explosion will be just a bit stronger perhaps then we will deal with the gut issues of a black ideology and ultimately a truly american ideology mod modish and militant keeping on top of the scene for some people gameplaying is a fulltime preoccupation not only does it keep them on top of things it also has solid benefits playing the black intellectual game for example actually encourages them to read the books everyone is talking about making it possible for them to rap with authority about important current topics and that is definitely a plus that game neatly ties in with the black militant game which is all the rage just ow and which has merits of its own in attentiongrabbing a brother can come on like gangbusters with a boss fro and a handtailored dashiki set off with a soft silk turtleneck and a big brass pendant and that game dovetails beautifully with the swinger game allowing a brother to make the scene in imported bellbottoms direct from carnaby street and expensive italianmade boots shined to a gloss name the game and some brothers are right on top of it but the black revoultion is not a game nor are the legitimate aims of the black revolution served by assorted poseurs and hustlers playing revolution across the country a small but determined body of black men and women are dedicating their energies and in many cases their livesto the task of liberating black people from the psychological shackles which have rendered them powerless for centuries in whatever they doin education in art in music in literature or in community servicethey are concerned with shattering the old ikons of whiteness and with validating in the minds of black people regenerative black images and black idols and a black perspective on the world these serious men and women know that intensive and unwavering vigilance in the cause of black consciousness is necessary to break for all time the debilitating cycle of hope and despair which has characterized black life on this continent for years their task is monumental and it is not made easier by the diversionary tactics of the gameplayers it is imperative that the black community know the difference between the committed and the comedians 4908 100 s а v q e ףv 9 l c
