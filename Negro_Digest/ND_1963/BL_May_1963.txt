judge thurgood marshall 
by ernest e goodman
he post of federal judge might prove unexciting to a lawyer who spent   more than onehalf of  his  years before the bar of justice often pleading seemingly hopeless causes sometimes under extreme duress and even the threat of bodily harm but not for thurgood marshall who as judge of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit has found each day of his  months on the bench as challenging as his  years before it a  graduate of the howard university school of law judge marshall was appointed to his present position by president kennedy in october  and confirmed by the us senate  months and many hearings later the cases which come before judge marshall today at the us courthouse overlooking new york citys foley square run the gamut admiralty criminal tax civil all types this court is the largest of its kind in the nation with the greatest variety of cases last year judge marshall participated in the hearing and decision of more than  cases on appeal from us district courts this year the docket is even heavier but heavy schedules are not new to the foot pound jurist whose  years as special counsel for the national association for the advancement of colored people were filled with workdays of  hours or more then again he no longer is required to travel the  miles a year that were necessary in his effort to obtain equal protection under the law for americas  million negroes and although his present workload is somewhat lighter the length of his workday has shown no appreciable decrease his many other talents notwithstanding he never quite learned to relax today his evenings usually are spent poring over law books and examining case after case always with one thought in mind that of providing the same protection under the law for the parties involved in the cases before him that he sought for his clients during his naacp days to understand thurgood marshall one must go back to his boyhood days in baltimore racial discrimination and segregation were the way of life in baltimore in those days and young thurgood saw and felt these evils at every turn his father a railroad dining car worker and later steward at a country club and his mother a teacher in the public schools provided a comfortable home for him and his brother but outside the home were the everpresent humiliations of secondclass citizenship however his father was a man of principle as judge marshall puts it who told his sons that they not only had his permission but his orders to fight anyone who humiliated them because of their race about his father marshall says will marshall would sleep in the streets rather than betray his principles the same is said about judge marshall by those who know him it was while attending baltimores douglass high school that thurgood marshall developed an interest in the us constitution the document of which his knowledge years later was to earn for him the name of mr civil_rights judge marshall laughs today when he reflects on his introduction to the constitution it seems that in those days a form of discipline at douglass high consisted of sending the offender into the basement with instructions to read and memorize sections of the constitution i went to the basement so often judge marshall recalls that i knew the whole thing by heart before i reached my senior year after high school marshall enrolled at lincoln university in pennsylvania where he began a curriculum which would prepare him for dental school his plans for a career in dentistry were forsaken after he tried out for and won a position on the schools debating team this was the young students first experience at formal debating although argumentation had been one of his fortes since childhood one of the favorite pastimes at the marshall home had been the regular pro and con arguments between thurgood and his father on the issues of the day there were never any pros and cons on segregation however judge marshall says our only arguments on this subject were over the best methods of doing away with it marshalls success as a debater and the encouragement offered by his teammates combined to change his plans from dentistry to law marshall was graduated with honors from lincoln in june  and enrolled in the howard law school three months later as an institution howard held no particular attraction for marshall at that time but the nations worst economic plight was setting in the university of marylands law school at baltimore barred negroes and howard had the most accessible and least expensive law school available to him then too during his travels as a debater he had met and come to admire charles h houston vice dean of the howard law school who was then pioneering in the field of civil_rights law throughout his three years at howard marshall commuted daily to and from baltimore a trip of some  miles as a freshman he had to be up at  am in order to make an eight oclock class then return to baltimore by midafternoon to one of the halfdozen or so parttime jobs which helped pay his tuition and transportation costs at the end of his freshman year marshall was the ranking student in his class thus qualifying for a job as student assistant in the law library the job paid the cost of his tuition but it also lengthened his day in washington during his second and third years of law school marshall rarely returned to baltimore before  pm and the occasions were even fewer when he crawled into bed prior to midnight but the job of student assistant had its advantages too for one thing it gave marshall greater access to and knowledge of the books which were to become his bibles in later years then it put him in closer contact with houston who soon was to become his idol the howard law school had no formal course in civil_rights law in those days in fact it was not until  when a young law professor from houston texas arrived on campus and introduced such a course that any american law school taught civil_rights as a part of its curriculum that young professor by the way is today the president of howard university dr james m nabrit jr in the early s those law students who showed real promise were selected by houston to participate in his informal civil_rights seminar which met two or three times a week in the law library not only was marshall an avid member of this group but midway his second year he was assisting in the preparation of briefs for actual civil_rights cases by the end of the year he was accompanying houston into many of the nations courtrooms it might come as a surprise even to those who knew the houstonmarshall team that the young law students first participation on a civil_rights brief was not for a houston case but for that of one of his colleagues professor william hastie who later was to become dean of the law school the case involved the right of a negro to enter the university of north carolina law school and the decision went against the plaintiff not too many years were to pass however before marshall would have a hand in changing such decisions no one seems to have greater admiration for marshall than hastie who today is himself a federal judge serving on the bench of the us court of appeals for the third circuit at philadelphia among judge hasties prize possessions is a contracts brief which marshall prepared as a student now and then i take it out and look at it again and still admire it hastie says marshall could talk for hours about the late charlie houston not only about his role as an outstanding lawyer but also his role as a scholar at whose feet a student was privileged to sit houston had three goals during his tenure at howard according to judge marshall he wanted first to raise the academic level of the law school secondly he wanted the negro lawyer to attain a position of respect and esteem and thirdly he wanted his students to become not just lawyers but social engineers before resigning his law school post in  to accept the position of legal counsel for the naacp houston had accomplished all three objectives marshall was graduated at the top of his class in february  and established his law practice in baltimore seven months later but the nation was still in the throes of a depression and marshalls practice reflected it judge marshall estimates that he lost  during his first year as a lawyer things took a turn for the better during the second year and the young lawyer began to gain in reputation as well as financial solvency the latter gain proved to be shortlived though for the civil_rights bug again had bitten him increasingly he began to find himself handling such noteworthy but low paying legal actions the first major civil_rights case which marshall was to argue was murray v pearson in  it involved the right of donald murray negro to enroll at the university of maryland law school in baltimore the school which marshall himself might have entered five years earlier had he been permitted marshall remembered this then too he remembered that he had helped prepare the brief on the similar university of north carolina case which had been lost for the murray case marshall was teamed with houston his friend and teacher so effective were the arguments of the team that the lower court ordered murrays admission to the school an unprecedented action in those days the state of maryland appealed but the decision was upheld at the appellate level houston was granted a sixmonth leave from his naacp post in  and marshall was called to new york to replace him for the next two years his practice was divided between new york and baltimore with less and less time being spent in the latter city when houston resigned in  to return to private practice marshall was named to succeed him as special counsel for the naacp well does judge marshall remember those early days in new york a  salary and the walkup flat in harlem but the lack of luxury failed to bother him once you get into this business of civil_rights he said you dont think of money and get into it he did trade union discrimination restrictive covenants segregation in interstate travel racial exclusion from state universities unequal pay for negro teachers the white primary exclusion of negroes from jury duty and discrimination in the armed forces all were to fall before marshall and the battery of naacp lawyers during his first  years on the job and although he trod dangerous grounds and had his life threatened on more than one occasion on his treks into the south even there he was winning the respect of many of his adversaries during his first year on the job marshall had an occasion to go to dallas texas to protest the exclusion of negroes from jury duty the young lawyer went directly to the governor james allred who was so impressed with his presentation that he not only ordered out texas rangers to protect the right of negroes to serve on juries but also volunteered to ask the fbi to study the situation then there was the time in  when marshall was interrupted in the middle of the night by a telephone call from a southern city the caller informed him that a lynching party was gathering at the local jail and asked his help in averting a tragedy as was his custom marshall took the most direct avenue available to him he put through a call to a prominent attorney in the state saying look just two sets of people cant afford a lynching at this timeus negroes and you people youre right in the midst of a dixiecrat political campaign and a lynchings going to make you people look awful bad twenty minutes later the attorney called back the state troopers made it in time he said call this number in a few minutes your man will be there unharmed these instances were by no means typical of marshalls experiences with southern officials however many was the time when he had to enter and leave a town under cover of night although the reverse of this occurred one year in a small mississippi town there he was warned by the sheriff to leave before nightfall because of the towns reputation of not letting the sun set on a negros head then there was columbia tenn in  marshall had been called to the town to defend several negroes accused of murder during a race riot because of the hostile atmosphere in columbia marshall and his legal colleagues took up residence in nashville and commuted  miles each day it was on leaving columbia one day that marshalls car was forced off the  road by several police cars out jumped eight to ten policemen their pistols brandished demanding to see marshalls driving permit the attorney produced his license and after a while the officers left but moments later the same police crew curbed marshalls car again this time charging him with being drunk and transporting liquor in his car they searched the car but found nothing so they left again hardly five minutes had passed before the same crew was back this time the charge was drunken driving and marshall was ordered to get out of the car and walk across the road to the magistrates office thurgood knew that terrible things had happened to negroes for resisting arrest in such cases so he refused to walk across the road unless escorted by the police after some debate the officers escorted him across the road to the magistrate where he stood breathing as hard as i could into his face judge marshall said he nearly used up all his breath in convincing the magistrate that he had not been drinking and was allowed to leave after that i really needed a drink marshall declared by word and deed the naacps preference in racial matters has been for persuasion rather than legal action but the hard core of resistance which the organization has met has left it with no alternative but the courts and it was in the courts that marshall was to earn his reputation as one of the greatest constitutional lawyers of all times marshalls talents were widely known in the legal profession and in the negro community well before  but it was not until that year may  to be exact that his name became a household word throughout america in the civil_rights cases of the s marshalls method had been to attack the inequalities of separate but equal facilities for the school cases he and his colleagues decided to go all out in an attack on segregation itself with the weight of precedent against them the naacp lawyers decided to use a new tack marshalling a group of some  outstanding educators historians economists sociologists anthropologists psychologists and psychiatrists marshall  co built their case on the premise that segregated education could not be equal an indication of the respect that marshalls opponents had for him is seen in the case of the state of south carolina rather than send its attorney general up against marshall south carolina called in john w davis dean of us constitutional lawyers to defend its separate but equal position when the supreme court handed down its unanimous decision in favor of the plaintiffs i was so happy i was numb marshall said the school desegregation decision was considered by many including judge marshall as the wedge to open the door to full citizenship for negroes but the best estimates at that time were that yet another generation of litigation would be needed before the goal could be fully realized marshall was opening the door wider and wider when tapped for the federal bench in  there were misgivings in some quarters when marshall accepted the judgeship nabrit had assumed the presidency and spottswood robinson of richmond va the law deanship at howard robinsons partner oliver hill had accepted a government post and now marshall was leaving the field there was even some talk of a plot to rid the negro of his best civil_rights lawyers but marshall and his colleagues had no such misgivings we had built up a core of able young lawyers all over the country who could pick up the ball and run with it judge marshall said at naacp legal defense fund headquarters in new york there was to be a staff headed by jack greenberg and constance motley and including derrick bell michael meltsner rufus smith and james m nabrit iii the latter being the younger half of what marshall calls the finest fatherson team ive ever met today judge marshall can look back on a record before the supreme court that with the possible exception of john davis can be matched by no man cases  wins and  losses but marshall is not a man to look back besides his preoccupation with present duties has left him little time for reflection or anything else the honors and awards which have come judge marshalls way during his career number more than  among these are the two highest given by howard universitythe alumni achievement award  and the honorary degree of doctor of laws  the latter being one of  such degrees which have been conferred upon him and although marshall refuses to give priority to any one of his awards one cannot help but think that his greatest moment came when the naacp conferred the spingarn medal upon him in  judge marshall does very little traveling now partly out of the desire to be at home with his family and partly because of his conception of what a judges role should be his speaking engagements by and large are limited to law groups and even his social contacts are restricted particularly where trial lawyers are involved at home there is little rest for the weary jurist his two young sons see to that thurgood jr age  and fouryear old john william take over from the time he arrives for dinner until they are forced into their beds at  pm only then can marshall relax briefly usually in front of the television set before dragging out another law book his wife the former cecilia suyat who once worked as a secretary at naacp headquarters tries to get him out to a play or movie at least once a week but even she  meets with only moderate success cissy as judge marshall calls her is his second wife his first marriage to the former vivien burey of philadelphia ended after  years with her death in  judge marshalls prime concern at this time seems to be his sons and their development he says that they will get the best education money can buy will they be lawyers this will be left to them marshall admits however that he will not be at all unhappy if they select legal careers thurgood jrs sights already have been set chief judge j edward lumbard of his fathers court was visiting the marshall home one night recently when he encountered young thurgoods usual who are you where do you work what do you do interrogation after judge lumbard supplied the answers thurgood jr turned to his father and in a loud and stern voice announced i dont want to be just a judge i want to be chief judge

east liberty the house is an unremarkable twostory structure of wood with an attic and a small backyard and if it is gathering a measure of fame these days it is not because of edgar wideman or his

the other depicting impressionistic horsemen won him an award in an arts contest sponsored by a city store john his father said loves to paint he even painted his aunts bedroom pink during a recent visit he loves music too modern and classical in a way im glad he never took up an instrument who knows with his touch he might have been great at it and then where would he be you can only do so much in one life for a while he was very interested in psychiatry so he wondered whether he shouldnt be a psychiatrist but he decided it would take him too long to finish then he wanted to be a psychologist i do think hes settled in literature he wants to teach and write he wants to write a great novel or play but hes also realistic he knows he has to have a job a regular profession and he

girl merely shrugged but said her mother hes already got a phi beta kappa key    so has president kennedy letitia said evenly and swept out of the room  
how to win the rat race 
 problem with surriviving the threat of i  nuclear annihilation freeway traffic and  riots on the ole miss campus is that survival still leaves you alive in the rat race this is a condition preferable perhaps to death but just barely nevertheless if youre going to be stuck in the pressure cooker of modernday living the cliche if you cant beat em join em is just no longer good enough it is not sufficient to merely join the rat race you must become good at it in the interest of ascertaining what qualities or guide rules are necessary in gaining proficiency at ratracing we have interviewed scores of successful businessmen and found the formula to be simple nothing so mundane as hard work or so oldfashioned as marrying the boss daughter or even so naive as the golden rule but simple nonetheless it should be pointed out at this time that these rules apply primarily to the business world where ratracing has been developed to a high art the soundness for concentrating in this area is based on the fact that you will need money as long as you live and while it really cant buy happiness it does make a nice down payment thus with the thought of success in the world of money in mind we come to rule one be sincere sincerity is described in the dictionary as the quality of being without deceit pretense or hypocrisy the reason for being sincere is that to be insincere is to run the risk of being uncovered as a scoundrel and an opportunist nothing could be more damaging to your chances of success than to have your boss learn that all those times you asked him about his wife and kids all the concern you showed for his ulcer and all the admiration you have evidenced at his great wisdom and keen intellect was simply to put him on therefore the rule is be sincerewhether you mean it or not rule two never lie the problem with lying is that it sometimes requires betterthanaverage creative powers and frequently demands an excellent memory the average person has enough trouble trying to remember what has actually happened let alone something that didnt occur at all besides lying is as bad as insincerity and morally indefensible in the final analysis there is but one exception to this rule only one occasion when lying is permissible that is whenever it will make things easier for you rule three be decisive getting ahead in life invariably re quires learning to make decisions this is especially important in the business world in your struggle to achieve success however you should avoid making really important decisions for there is always the possibility that your decisive action may reveal you as having an inadequate grasp of the facts or inferior mental powers instead you might wait to get the boss opinion then quickly agree with him this is sure to mark you as a bright perceptive fellow turn your mind instead to deciding such matters as whether to find a good excuse to get out of the office for the afternoon or go goof off down at the water fountain incidentally the water fountain is your best bet often a piece of office gossip picked up there can if properly exploited be far more valuable in advancing your career than weeks of hard work which is not to be recommended anyway rule four accept responsibility the principle of accepting responsibility is one we learn at childhood and practice the rest of our lives while it is usually considered a burden there are certain subtle and ingenious ways in which this can actually become a magic carpet to success let us say for instance that your boss is highly enthusiastic about a report prepared by you and a coworker and happens to drop by your desk to tell you so at a time when your partner is out to lunch a seemingly casual but careful acceptance of responsibility at this point can be invaluable you might answer the boss compliments with something like oh that well as long as you like it sir it was worth my staying up all night to write the final draft or better still it was really pretty easy once i got anderson around to my way of thinking the fact that anderson wrote the entire report without your being able to understand what the hell any of it was about has nothing to do with it the responsibility is there for you accept it rule five make sacrifices this is one of the toughest things for young men on their way up to realize that they must be willing to make sacrifices the bookkeeper in one eastern firm understood this fact of life well however and when a  shortage was discovered in his books one day he sacrificed his assistant his secretary and by the time he got through pointing his fingerhalf of the office force his willingness to make sacrifices of this sort eventually earned him a vice presidency rule six invite criticism if you are going to truly succeed you must learn to accept indeed even encourage critical analysis of workaday actions you must realize that there is absolutely nothing wrong with healthy constructive criticismespecially if it is not directed at you you may learn to adopt the proper attitude toward this important business tool by using it on your fellow workers whenever the opportunityin the form of the bosspresents itself so there you have them a halfdozen rules guaranteed to get you well ahead in the rat race a position you can easily maintain by keeping a wary eye out for anybody sneaky enough to use your system 
the time is now
by dr broadus n butler
we are deeply impressed by two facts about the present employment   and career horizon for xt a young negro men and women one of them is bold and encouraging the other should be a matter of grave concern to us all the bold fact is that the dedicated labors of the many organizations and people who have striven for equal employment opportunity have begun to come to harvest and opportunity is real now the fact about which there should be grave concern is that neither the young people nor their parents nor their counselors with few exceptions have achieved a full appreciation and realization of what this means it can be said with complete justification and validity that until the past year equal opportunity or even opportunity itself in any genuine sense was a kind of nebulous thing that made good platitudes but did not really exist for young negro men and women in the important sectors of our national and economic life it is no wonder that they could not be easily motivated to engage the strenuous effort of high preparation for careers which they were at the same time being impressed that they would be denied however it can now be said with equal validity that so radical a change has taken place over the past year that the mantle is upon our shoulders now to produce young men and women to assume the responsible roles that now cry for them and now find them neither sufficiently motivated nor yet fully prepared in the sense of discipline not in the sense of capacity to gird themselves to assume we are so rapidly approaching the dream and the hope expressed by langston hughes when he said o let my land be a land where liberty is crowned with no patriotic wreath but opportunity is real and life is free equality is in the air we breathe the most degrading and depressing consequences of employment discrimination have been that it has made the potential man look down and has sunk that potential mans aspirations and achievements so far below the level of his inherent capacities that it not only demeaned and degraded the man but it deprived society of the full measure of what would have been that fully developed man any person tends to see things at his own eye level so if our youth do not raise their sights or have their sights elevated they will not even now see the real opportunities and concomitant responsibilities there are for competent confident responsible and adequate young men and women in this day industry is calling for young executives where are they skilled trades are calling for young negro men to return to them where are they technology is calling for men of science and research where are they government is calling for civil service executives for classifications g and above where are they cities states and the nation are looking for capable and responsible office holders where are they agencies of stock exchanges and banking and finance are looking for brokers and analysts where are they educational institutions and boards of education need able and visionary policy makers who will avoid the inadequacies of the past and have the courage to build an educational foundation adequate to the needs of the future where are they houses and communities which are not yet homes and neighborhoods are calling for young men and young women who can make houses homes in the real sense of family life and make communities neighborhoods in the positive reciprocity of neighborliness where are they they are in our schools and collegessome of them they have dropped out of school and are not working at allsome of them a relatively recent report showed that almost half of the best students in high school still do not enter college they are working odd parttime jobssome of them they are working jobs out of proper classificationsome of them they have resigned themselves to ? jobs that are well below their performance capacitiessome of them they are confused and discouragedsome of them wherever they are they must be found and counseled and encouraged they must have the confidence in themselves to explore and to keep exploring above all they must quickly acquire that added measure of competence qualification and confidence which transforms a youth into a man to this end we need more or ganized efforts to bring promising young people together under an entirely different definition of purpose frankly we have had the day of massive mobilization of resources for annual dances we need less social club emphasis and more preprofessional and prebusiness club emphasis we need fewer social fraternities and more career orientated fraternities and sororities among such clubs and fraternities we must get well beyond future teachers clubs to add future engineers clubs future architects clubs future diplomats clubs future executives clubs future politicians clubs future writers clubs future poets clubs future businessmen clubs and so on fathers mothers and counselors ours is now the responsibility to gain more knowledge of the realities of this new day and to guide and inspire our youth to a sense of the fullness of the opportunity that now prevails for them to explore and to realize the full range and extent of their capacities without regard to previous restrictions their sights and personal horizons need breadth their personal sense of confidence competence and adequacy needs depth their sense of projection purpose and potentialities needs length their aspiration levels need height their sense of their own dignity and value as persons needs unfolding their knowledge of the heretofore inaccessible tools and instrumentalities of knowledge and training for the full development of whatever capacities they possess needs fulfillment even in northern colleges and universities only onethird of negro students are men twothirds are women the majority of these men are looking to fields of teaching medicine and law the majority of the women have been conditioned to seek careers in teaching nursing and social work fields while the needs in these fields should not be overlooked we must set the sights of our young men and women far beyond these to the more diversified roles and responsibilities which our economy our society and our nation are already begging for them to assume today this is the new meaning of the discipline that is incumbent upon parents and counselors as well as youth in this day because more than anything else our young men need to regain the lost or suppressed meaning of what it is to be a male man with a male image of adequacy responsibility and selfrealization commensurate with the responsibility of a free man questing to develop and utilize his creatorendowed talents this is their task and ours instead of systematically suppressing and demeaning and disvaluing our youth and leading them through successive stages of submission and forced retreat into the bramble bushes and hazy thicket of feelings of inferiority and inadequacy so please wake up young men young women gird yourselves for the longer and more demanding preparation for an earlier assumption of more mature more real responsibilities than your fathers and mothers were privileged to do little more than dream of in their lifetimes dont stop dont dropout persevere it is only six years now between george shirley student at wayne state

f we could probe the innermost secrets of some weary negro sharecropper in the south or a persecuted black muslim in a northern city mosque we might find him ever so briefly enjoying the wish that russia and white america would blow each other up and leave negroes to live on in peace but the unfortunate and strangely neglected fact is that the negros probability of being decimated is much higher than that of whites although he would hold a number of useful advantages in a nuclear war why then has such an important subject been gagged in the barrage of research and verbiage on the negro and on the nuclear threat why would scholars who have studied and bisected the negro in all of his ramifications from the negro as seen by the mulatto and the negro as seen by himself to the ecological distribution of negroes and georgia pines pass up the glaring question of the negros relative exposure and immunity to nuclear annihilation much of the neglect may be a product of the fallacy that since wars are waged between territorial and political blocs called nations all persons therein confined are equally subject to a common enemys destruction on the contrary sociologists have found a consistent relationship for example between income level and the tendency to die in wartime the lower an individuals family income the greater his chance of dying in battle the reason is probably that the lower classes produce more combat soldiers while the higher classes serve rather frequently as officers and as strategists then there are the critical occupationsnot to mention political offices to be filledwhich keep more of the higher classes safe in civilian life however the question of our concern is not simply a matter of social class it exists as we shall see in the racial condition of the negro per se there is in the first place the ecological fact that the negro race is ghettoed in black belts now more properly called i thinkblack corsets near the centers or bullseyes of our big cities bullseyes and sitting ducks professor karl taeuber of the university of chicago and one of the foremost authorities on the concentration and location of the races in this country recently discovered that negroes are less dispersed residentially than even puerto ricans even though they puerto ricans havent been in the city as long and have an inferior economic status in a speech before the board of directors of the chicago urban league he reported a study financed by the ford foundation which found that five out of every six u s cities having more than  white households in  had indexes of residential segregation above  complete segregation would show an index of  and absolute nonsegregation an index of  this is especially so in large cities chicagos segregation index for example rose during the past decade from  to  this means that negroes in our big cities now live in bullseyes enclosed by white satellite suburban rings the u s census for  shows  suburbs known to be devoid of a single negro inhabitant and likewise in washington d c the capital of the nation for example whites have dwindled to a numerical minority moreover the concentration of negroes in these black corsets is on the increase my computations from u s census data show negroes for the first time in  more urban than whites  per cent to  and the change in the negros urban proportion during the decade was more than twice as large as that of whites in addition more than nine out of ten of all negroes living outside the south west north central north east  sections more likely to attract enemy warheads and missiles live in cities  indeed the central cities of the  largest u s metropolitan areas new york los angeles chicago philadelphia detroit san franciscooakland boston pittsburgh st louis washington cleveland baltimorenow hold three out of five of the negroes living outside the south and one out of every three in the entire country   assuming that such large central cities as the foregoing would be priority targets let us calculate the relevance of the negros distribution to a nuclear attack as a preface to our treatment of the social psychology of the negros survivability say russia does drop a  megaton bomb on washington d c or chicago for example up to five miles from ground zero the point of the explosion nine out of ten of all inhabitants would be killed instantly and the rest seriously injured or victimized by radiation all structures would be demolished from  to  miles out half of the inhabitants would be killed a third of them injured all others dazed shocked and sickened by radiation and all buildings damaged beyond repair in other words this would just about take care of the negro community on the other hand from  to  miles out only  per cent of the individuals would be killed  per cent injured seriously the others slightly or not at all while buiidings would require considerable repairs only two per cent of persons more than  miles out largely white areas and beyond would be killed while four out of five would go mainly unhurt and damage to property would be minor although we have assumed that the attack would occur by night the picture would be much the same if the attack should come during the school hours of the day as children for examplethe future of a raceare sent to school in relation to their residence more than half of philadelphias  elementary schools are either  per cent white on the one hand or  per cent negro on the other and  per cent of chicagos negro pupils attend virtually allnegro schools persons at work during a daytime attack would offset the pattern considerably but studies show a tendency for people to try to live as near as possible all things considered to their place of work although this is less true of whites employed in the central district and at the higher income levels  thus at any given moment during the hour cycle the majority of negroes are in or near the heart of the cities while the whites predominate in the outer rings of the metropolitan community this is especially so at night you cant hide here in spite of all of the foregoing if there are shelters in the black belt no one knows where they are says a chicago defender editorial october   with an average income about  smaller than the average white familys and with more mouths per family to care for the typical negro couldnt afford a shelter if he wanted to not that this makes that much difference slum dwellings and shelters near the center of the city would amount to incinerators anyway from the blast itself in part but also because the trash and debris of the fireprone buildings would be more subject to fire storms true a few negroes caught away from the center and shelterless may be admitted to one as a guest but most prospective shelterhosts would be white and the negro intruder probably would not be permitted even to place his feet on the welcome mat however with the chaos and the breakdown of social control the government itself plans to go underground it may be a bit too idealistic to expect individuals to obey current laws regarding property rights people might just fall into any fallout shelter in sight and it is not hard to imagine a negro maid or handyman suddenly taking authority and demanding space beside the white boss in his shelter but even on the shareyourshelter plan there would not be anywhere near enough whites themselves are said to have more swimming pools than they have shelters realizing this the government now is stressing community or mass shelters but there is no reason to expect that in these tombs of human moles the negro would receive any more of his  share than he does in the serenity of the present day particularly in prejudiced localities there would be no time to stage a hidein or a shelterin no naacp to take it to the supreme court and no national guardsmen or u s marshals to call out even if the attorney general could be found thus the negro would find himself with no place to hide even in the matter of evacuation there probably would be no way out living in the central city fenced in by whites he would have a longer distance to go but a shorter time to travel five miles from a megaton explosion the heavier fallout would reach the ground in half an hour but twenty miles away there would be nearly an hour to get ready or evacuate   also open country and highways would not be far away from the suburbs while all through the congested black corsets the narrow crisscross sometimes winding streets would be hopelessly jammed with wrecked autos and frantically honking cars containing by then negro wrecks even a warning signal would have done them little good survivability or postattack hustling some experts have raised the question wouldnt the survivors envy the dead anyway they refer to the enduring hazards of fallout and enemy attack on the one hand but particularly the emotional shock of emerging lost and separated from the persons and things once held important to face the turmoil and destruction of the postattack environment much of the problemthey feelwould revolve around the breakdown of law order and morality and the frustrations of extreme social and psychological insecurity thus notwithstanding the negros special exposure to the blast and his narrow chances of escaping or absorbing direct attack those remaining might prove better equipped to survive in some respects than whites especially in the psychological sense the negros superiority in psychological survivability is a product of the contrasting experiences and conditioning of the two races in this country for example even in the physical sense of enduring the intense heat likely to prevail in a fallout shelter many negroes possess cottonchopping cottonpicking backgrounds in the southern sun and long years of tending ovens and furnaces in white kitchens and factories which in this case would be to their advantage in the social or psychological sense negroes are far more conditioned to hard times and suffering they know what it is to have to hustle from check to check and in many cases from one meal to the next much of the shock that whites would experience in the postattack environment of deprivation and social inconsistence would seem commonplace to negroes for they have known a world of agony from the middle passage and plantation slavery down to the present regimes of the south and the southernyfied north in contrast to white persons they would not be so prone to suicide judging by past and present rates and their ability to stand up under stress and torture also may have been evident in the korean war in korean prisonerofwar camps it was recorded that negro pows were much less likely to defect to the side of the communistsquiet as it is kept on the other hand the negros condition would of course present a tremendous handicap to him many for one thing would find themselves unprepared to follow the fourth key to household safety issued by the office of civil defense it reads brusquely close all windows and doors and draw the blinds but many such fixtures in low income negro homes would be in need of repair with broken and jammed windows and blinds ready to come tumbling down if tugged too hastily also even negroes who have heard of geiger counters and such instruments for detecting radioactivity generally cannot afford them this may be one reason why so many have taken a returntosender attitude with regard to such pamphlets sent out by the office of civil defense but that is not the only reason a peaceable race in the peace race although negroes are wellnoted for their patience and piety and now boast of their facility in this regard as exhibited in the passive resistance campaign they have been conspicuously shy of peace movements as such while professing to be a peaceable race they have disdained the peace race for fear of seeming unamerican thus they have been lured by white superpatriots into the most unamerican tendency in the ideal sense historically speaking that this country has ever known in the fashion of the typical white citizen of our day the negro has become what c wright mills the late sociologist of columbia university called cheerful robots mills wrote this in his book the causes of world war iii which was an expansion of his sidney hillman lectures delivered at howard university in march of  he noted that cheerful robots white and black sit back and accept with glee and indifference without question anything white leaders present to them as reality regarding international relations indeed some professors lecturing in negro college classrooms on war and related phenomena have had to pause midway and ask the students please to arouse some snoozing classmate even the grandiose negro leadership conference on africa recently held at impressive columbia university uniquely bringing together more than  negro representatives of some  different organizations had as its theme the integration of negroes into the existing scheme of things untouched while these leaders justly issued a plea for more negro diplomats and demanded that white policymakers let negroes know all about the full details of all us dealings with africa the only direct effort they made to improve or contribute to us foreign policy was to try to sic white america on south africa they wanted the us to cast the first stone and chastize white south africa for mistreating local africans in domestic relations thus in spite of all the picturetaking and speechmaking at the conference it was no refutation of the sad truth that there is a paucity of concern among those most in jeopardynegroes as we have seenin the event of a nuclear war while it is possible only to speculate on the relative survivability of whites and negroes in a nuclear war figures are convincing and it is hoped that neither will ever face the test however there is one thing apparent negroes had better go ahead and take over the battle for peace now bleakly muddled by the whites of the world before it is too late even to call on st peter for help 
who is to blame 
n the past this magav zine has been criti£ cized for not admonishing negro americans of their faults our editorials tend too frequently to concentrate on the failures of whites their lack of charity for the negro minority their neglect of the requirements of justice where we may have failed the july harpers magazine and its hardhitting editor john fischer have registered devastating blows in a severe editorial later reprinted in readers digest editor fischer lashes out at the negro and his failure to shoulder a bigger responsibility for the fix hes in there is no use denying his stern allegations they are undoubtedly true but as is so often the case their full import is a matter of perspective and of emphasis the faults of the negro are present for all to see the responsibility for these faults is not so easy to discern the correction of them we submit is not simply a matter of negro responsibility once more as so often in the past we return to an insistent reminder of ours the failure of the negro to take his place as a first class citizen does not rest on his shoulders alone and even if a greater proportion of blame is to be attributed to the negro again we insist that any effort to distribute responsibility in a country as large as ours and with the history that lies behind race relations becomes a futile pastime of pot and kettle exchanging invectives we come back to our old position social tensions and outright crime in the united states today are not a matter of one segment of the population alone for that reason we do not like mr fischers constant use of the phrase negro community you cannot separate criminal activity into neat compartments of one group alone while such neat divisions of responsibility may satisfy the demands of a certain type of tidy thinking they frequently fail to register the correct balance crime and its correction are the product of joint correlative action for every dope addict in harlem we can point to white pushers and white smugglers who control the trade in narcotics for every knifing and mugging we can point to an entire chain of law enforcement agencies that are an insult to community trust for every pariah on our welfare lists there stands a battery of silent partners labor racketeers rentgougers and slumlords whose power and influence keep them outside the pale of law for years on end no it is not the socalled negro community alone that must be brought to book in this indictment we americans are a people a community of white and colored with a sacred trust a public philosophy to sustain and cherish every criticism of negro failure must be examined side by side with white failure responsibility must be matched with responsibility it is too easy for one group to denounce the other to hold up standards that must be met before we agree that the negro has earned his citizenship that prize was conferred on the negro long before the editors of harpers and readers digest were born let them make sure that the nation as a whole deserves the quality of citizenship it demands of its most vexed and underprivileged minority

n the context of maurice morning wills religious background his father is a minister his own private consideration of a postbaseball y career placing himself in a pulpit and his tremendous influence on americas youth he lectures to them frequently it was properly fitting that a little child should lead the grownups in recognizing his titanic major league talent during the summer of  when the name maury wills was merely an eyebrowlifter in most baseball circles a yearold los angeles dodger fan watched with bugeyed awe as maury practiced his profession then returned home to pen this prophecy in rhyme the league will soon learn hes no one to spurn as he dazzles the crowds with his speed when he steals a base its not even a race cause he runs like a thoroughbred steed that lad whomever he was wouldve been eligible for full pardon last fall if he had thrown out his teenage chest to big daddy proportions and boasted to his friends i told you so for indubitably maury wills had confirmed his youthful poets appraisal in the short span of a single major league season maury wills turned baseballs clock all the way back to preruthian days brought the lovers of scientific baseball out of their bombshelters where theyd sought protection from a  year barrage of homers with broad smiles on their faces taught dodger fans that as president walter omalley said you dont have to bump the ball over the wall to win games andif i may borrow eloquent words once spoken in tribute to joe louis by i believe the late new york mayor james j walkerplaced a beautiful rose on the grave of the georgia peach ty cobb the statistics have been recited so often that moonshiners in the tennessee hills now know them by heart displaying the most amazing sleightoffoot trick baseball has ever seen in  wills stole  bases in  games the incomparable jackie robinson stole only  in ten seasons broke cobbs presumablyuntouchable modern singleseason mark of  theftsand besides batted  banjoing  hits most of them singles merely six of them homers the baseball world which just a season earlier had gone gaga over roger maris feat of blasting  homers turned full circle from power to finesse in its approach to the game to acclaim wills years old born october   in washington d c one of  children father of fivea superstar holding a hot hand to pain with his magic feet willsthe green light bandit mighty mouse or just plain mousywon the national leagues most valuable player award nearly everyones athlete of the year award and spokane washingtons outstanding citizen of the year honor maris was lost in the wake of his dust willie mays who hit  home runs played second fiddle to his banjo solo the musical playing of which brought in  at a las vegas club during the winter luis aparicio who he in his series of mad dashes for athleteoftheyear honors mad dashes involving mostly feetfirst or belly slides into second base wills utilized to perfection his natural speed a special ability to hit full speed with his first or second stride an uncanny knowledge of pitchers one of baseballs finest minds a fierce competitors spirit which unlike jackies was cloaked in gentility an astounding imperviousness to torn muscles diamond burns and sheer wearinesssplus let us  never forget manager walt alstons implicit confidence and rare permission the green light for him to run on his own decision the story behind this fantastic saga isin these cool times when illegit is fine as long as you dont get caughtas corny as that tall grain with which iowa identifies all the horatio alger pluckandluck yarns ever written the theory that early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise aesop would have loved maury wills he would have written a book of bromides about him put it this way it is the fact of baseball as it is a fact of life that many of the sureshots never come in while some of the longshots do many of the preps voted mostlikelytosucceed arent ever heard of after the diplomas are passed out while some mousy little kid in the back row grows up to become president of a billiondollar firm many of the flashy highbonus boys of baseball fizzle in the hot glare of professional competition while an unpretentious little fellow who keeps on plugging along ignoring slights suddenly develops into the comethrough clutchman when the chips are down thats the maury wills story in a nutshell every last word of it hes the longshot who came in and paid off at milliontoone odds the los angeles dodgers lost the national league pennant he didnt in the last two pennant playoffgames with the san francisco giants while the dodgers were cutting their own throats maury stole four bases he brought home the winning run in the second game when he singled stole second went to third on a sacrifice and scored on a short fly in the final game he stole second stole third and raced home when the giant catcher threw wildly into the outfield trying to nab him in the background of these heroics there is to be found an incredible saga of dedication sticktoitiveness and big heart thats been matched seldom if ever since baseball was known as one o cat when a man appraises the hardships and disappointments that maury wills endured while striving for the major leagues of baseball if he is the sort of guy who beefs because the boss didnt say hello this morning he must be now reminded of the pointed saying i complained because i had no shoes until i met a man who had no feet maury wills is a little david whos made it big in a sport dominated by giant goliaths simply because he didnt quit as he says didnt get my diaper down when the powersthatwere continued to say youre too small youre good field no hit yesyoure pretty goodbut   in  when maury graduated from cardozo high school in washington d c nine colleges and universitiesincluding ohio state rutgers and syracuse dangled attractive athletic scholarship offers before him a potential a student whod make cs because like so many athletes i didnt concentrate enough on books maury passed over the offers because he was already married to his high school sweetheart gertrude elliott he was a father and at  his family responsibilities dictated that he earn as much money as he could as quickly as he could hed been a fine high school quarterback quite some shucks as a prep pitcher and hed hit better than  inspired by jackie robinson maury decided to seek his fortune in baseball but alas and alack after hed displayed his wares in a new york giants tryout camp at havre de grace marylandstriking out  men in seven innings which is as perfect as baseball law allowsgiant scouts said he wouldnt do he was they said too small their goodbye was cordial but its effect was basically the same as an unfriendly order get out the giants like most everyone else in baseball were thinking along ruthian power lines thats understandable the ruthian influence being as dominant as it was even today maury stands only fivefootten but looks shorter weighs  pounds he says but he must mean after hes taken a shower in his fulldress uniform maury was disappointed nobody can blame him for that but he didnt latch onto a persecution complex hurray he had a family to feedand blues arent edible when the dodgers then located in brooklyn held a tryout camp there he was showing em what he could do just as hed shown the giants the dodgers signed him gave him an infinitesimal bonus and ye gads they do say that dave nicholson who hit  for the orioles last year was paid  grand then promptly dumped him into their farm system where they forgot him for eight and a half years during that time maury bounced around like a basketball in the hands of marques haynes from hornell n y to spokane by way of pueblo colorado and some place in texas every year the dodgers looked at numerous phenoms but had no use for maury wills nobody else wanted him either incidentally maury stole  bases at hornell in  his first year of professional play returned to hornell in  and to prove his previous seasons mark was no fluke stole another  a hundred times or more during these eight and a half years as maury watched dozens of phenoms most of whom are now lodged somewhere in oblivion pass him by in a continuous parade to the parent dodger club he wondered  did i do the right thing when i went into baseball he has explained it wasnt so much for myself that i was worried  it would have been different if id been a single man i worried for my family i didnt want my family enduring all the hardships i had to endure finally i compromised myself stopped eating my heart out about making the major leagues and decided to make the best living i could in the minors now we dissolve to the  major league season the los angeles dodgers are making a bold dash for the national league pennant they stumbled of course butwhat the heckthey were dashing boldly at one time and e j buzzie bavasi club vicepresident scoops  writers at midseason by declaring that maury wills is the most valuable player on our club leo durocher a dodger coach who was himself a fine shortstop once and later the manager of two fine shortstops alvin dark and peewee reese says wills is the most versatile shortstop ive ever i seen walter omalley whod i feared hed built his  million i stadium in los angeles chavez i ravine too big for his power boys i relaxes as he listens to the rafter i rattling cheers for maurys sleight i offoot tricks legions of writers i and fans compare maury wills to i the immortal ty cobb maury i wills to jackie robinson maury i wills to a forgotten national i league star bob beschler of cin i cinnati who stole  bases in  i to set a modern national league i record  in  when cobb set the alltime singleseason record of  stolen bases he averaged a theft every  games wills in  averaged a heist every  games fresco thompson covice president of the dodgers was asked to compare maury and ty its difficult to compare them said thompson because theyve played in eras where the type of game was entirely different in cobbs era one run was more important than it is in todays type of baseball where teams seem to go for the big inning  believe a player who steals  bases today would compare favorably with a player who stole  in cobbs era this sounds like thompson is saying wills would have or could have stolen close to  bases in cobbs timethat is when you remember that hes comparing  thefts to  thefts and in reality maury pilfered  sacks in  but lets be honest thompson was queried at midseason  and neither he nor anyone else actually believed at that time that wills would erase ty cobbs mark a mark which for sheer effort and talent was more demanding or tougher this writer believes than babe ruths feat of  home runs in  the national league allstars and the american league allstars clashed in their first annual game of  at washington dc wills though voted the no  shortstop behind pittsburghs dick groat ran wild as  of his relatives watched proudly and the national leaguers won this was the day when thanks to television and the importance of the occasion maury wills bolted into national if not international famehis performance in the  world series when he outplayed chicagos thenheralded shortstop luis aparicio notwithstanding when the same two sets of allstars appeared in chicago for their second annual game of superlatives at wrigley field i corralled such creditable experts as stan musial the incomparable st louis cardinal del crandall milwaukees fine catcher and fred hutchinson manager of the cincinnati reds and asked each one for an appraisal of maury wills the thief of bases they chorused hes the best i tried to pin musial down to a shortstop comparison of wills to marty marion his old teammate stan hedged but there was no hedging about wills the baserunner crandall said the only way he knew of getting wills out was to throw to third when maury headed for second but at this time roughly midseason  not every one who mentioned maury wills name conceded that he was an ecclesiastical performer subject not to critical analysis only to lavish praise which proves these fellows didnt know historyinthemaking when they saw it but who did vin scully the irrefutably great dodger broadcaster proved to be an uncompromising jackie robinson loyalist tough inadvertently he was forced to pay maury a lefthanded compliment wills is a nice little guy who steals bases robinson was a runner he had a defiance    he was the only player i ever saw who could steal better when he was mad wills has everyone pulling for him to steal and cheering him when he does ive seen robinson steal when the crowd was booing and defying him to try it and furious when he succeeded bavasi enlarged on that robinson and wills are two oppositetype players robbie was more daring but not as quick nor as fast as maury one was more powerful the other is more agile and they are definitely different type hitters in my mind they were and are the most valuable players on our club so it went as the  season progressed one was defiant the other nice one was more powerful the other more agile one was more daring the other quicker meanwhile jackie robinson entered the hall of fame wills became the greatest individual baseball star of the year and it all boiled down throwing the two togetherthat a stolen base was a stolen base was a stolen base incidents like those that follow enabled maury to dominate the sports year in houston on june  he walked  to lead off the th inning promptly stole second base sliding safely in on his belly because it was a game situation and i can save a halfstep sliding head first three pitches later he stole third with a hook slide and after willie davis flied to center he fled home scoring the winning run for the dodgers without the benefit of a hit said manager walt alston wills is the greatest basestealer ive seen in the majors in the aforementioned first major league allstar game at washington on july  wills was sent in as a pinchrunner for musial whod singled in the top half of the sixth inning wills promptly stole second so cleanly that earl battey the american league catcher and a fine thrower didnt even bother with an attempt to get him out wills has explained i steal  per cent of my bases on pitchers although catchers get most of the blame moments later dick groat singled and wills scampered home with the games first run when wills whod relieved groat at shortstop by this time stepped up to home plate as the leadoff batter in the eighth inning the national leaguers held a slender  to  lead he singled to left field as jim davenport also singled to left wills rounded second base and stopped mesmerizing rocky colavito who fielded davenports hit held the ball a costly moment then threw behind the runner to second base as soon as colavito committed himself wills took third shortly thereafter felipe alou hit a foul fly which leon wagner caught in short right field wagner may not be the worlds greatest thrower but neither is he the worlds worst and any scoring attempt by anybody or anything save greased lightning seemed strictly suicidal but the mercurial wills a positive thinker bolted home and slid deftly under john romanos frantic futile tag the national leaguers won the game  to  wills had scored two himself in a dodger home game against the new york mets on august  wills again provided the margin of victory with his dashing feet in the sixth inning he beat out an infield single stole second advanced to third on a wild throw by met catcher chris cannizzaro and scored on willie davis infield hit wills stolen base in this game was his th of the year at this point the experts the better gamblers among them conceded that maury might erase beschlers national league singleseason record of  stolen bases virtually no one not even wills himself envisioned that hed bag  more how did maury wills bridge the gap between a compromise on comparative minor league oblivion and major league superstardom during the course of a fourhour taped interview for which maury is yet entitled to collect a steak dinner from the writer which sooner or later he will collect the star provided the complete answer to that question when i stole all those bases at hornell he said i ran mostly on sheer speed but as i moved up the ladder into classa aa triplea and so on i discovered that the pitchers were getting smarter they forced me to adjust they made me smarter i said fred hutchinson tells me that one reason why youre so good at stealing bases is that you get a better jump on pitchers than most runners del crandall says you study pitchers and basestealing in general more than most runners   wills said yes i do study the pitchers constantly i try to detect little telltale signs little tips as to when i should take off from the movements of their heads and their shoulders their feet and that reminds me of something since that first allstar game last summer numerous reporters have asked me about basestealing and ive talked too much four pitchers made adjustments in their mannerisms on the moundthat means ive had to readjust to them but back to study i want to speak a good word for the dodgers they run a terrific training camp at vero beach every spring a campanis gives six or eight lectures on baserunning each training season i dont think ive forgotten a word ive heard him speak on the subject maury didnt mention it but when the dodger brass gave an exhaustive test dealing with various inside aspects of baseball play last spring he was the only player on the club to score  i asked how important is raw sheer speed to a base bandit wills replied you have to have speed of course but the fastest runner isnt necessarily the best stealer of bases willie davis is faster than i am but im quicker the most important components of success in basestealing are  knowing the pitcher  knowing how to get a good lead and  having the reflexes that let you get away instantly without having to think about taking off  quickness and  the slide i use three slides straight in with my feet extended out in front the fadeaway or hook slide and the head first slide thats when you dive into the bag on your belly to be a successful basestealer youve got to know which slide to use in a given situation he continued now  ive omitted three important items desire dedication and confidence i rate desire over ability a player with mediocre ability but the great desire to excel can become a star in the major leagues but a player with great ability and no desire wont make it this is what i mean by dedication im always trying to do my job and a little extra i think all ballplayers ought to be dedicated  to the game i dont believe in doing just what i have to do and letting it go at that confidence especially when youre trying to steal bases youve got to run with confidence you cannot be afraid to fail the fear of failure will keep you from being a good thief you have to be daring you cant be a safetyfirst runner and steal many bases i said youve always been a pretty good athlete starring as you did in football and basketball and baseball in high school and i would have presumed that this success would have provided you with an ample supply of confidence yet ive heard you say that there were times in the minor leagues when you lost some of your confidence when you thought of quitting    wills said baseball is so full of ups and downs and heartaches and i suppose i must have wanted to quit a hundred times figuratively speaking during my years in the minors but as you know i never did my wife and iwe have five children and they have to eat when i felt down i thought about my family and my friends they were pulling for me and they wouldve been terribly disappointed if id turned out to be a quitter when things went roughly i called on my religious faithi think a ballplayer has to have a strong faith in something i was reared in church so i get my strength from religion i tried to understand that when things were going roughly for me god was testing me to see how strong my faith was i felt hurt and disappointed in the spring of  when the detroit tigers purchased my contract from the dodgers on a conditional basis and then although i hit well and fielded flawlessly with them during training camp games they turned me back but i didnt get my diaper down i said to myself well im going back home to spokane to play again how could i complain when i was going back home but to tell the whole truth after the tigers turned me down i realized id lost some of my confidence bobby bragan then manager of the spokane team is the man who rebuilt my confidence hes the man most responsible for my being in the major leagues today i asked what did bobby bragan do for you specifically wills said bobby bragan did something for me that no one else had ever done he was like a father to me it wasnt so much that he showed me how to play although he was the man who made me a switchhitterand i dont carry a bigenough stick to make it in the majors without switchhittingbut what was most important to me was the way in which he talked the way he let me know he had confidence in me he told me i had the ability to go all the way to the major leagues i had thought so all along but its hard to fight a battle all alone he rebuilt my confidence as ive indicated after seven years in the minor leagues  you sort of lose your confidence and you start concentrating on making a good living in the minors instead of eating your heart out about going to the majors the major key to maury wills resurgence was bragans idea of making him a switchhitterthat was done in  that year maury hit only  for spokane and stole only  bases in  games but after the tigers turned him down in  he stole  bases and hit  in the first  games of the regular pacific coast league season on the basis of this sensational performance the dodgers considered him for their own club for the first time in the eight and a half seasons he played in their system when wills arrived to join the dodgers he was so unknown that a leading writer asked maury wills whos he for a while wills had a rough time he was tense in the field he couldnt beg borrow or steal a hit eventually though he found himself the dodgers won the national league pennant and during the ensuing world series with the chicago white sox wills outplayed the great luis aparicio i said when you first came to the dodgers in  you had a pretty rough time of it you found yourself and sparked the dodgers to a pennant but you werent exactly a star yet walt alston was pinchhitting for you again in  how did you hurdle the final obstacle to stardom wills said youre right in what you say you know when i went to spring training camp in  i thought i had it made i thought i was the dodger shortstop i thought id finally get to live with the big team at vero beach which was my ambition but i found myself starting all over again i had to win the position all over again well after the regular  season began i found myself still coming out of the game in the sixth or seventh inning for a pinchhitter one day alston took me out for a pinchhitter in the third inning its embarrassing to be removed from the game for a pinchhitter in the third inning if you cant stay in the lineup any longer than that you dont have any business being in there in the first place i went to pete reiser a dodger coach and asked for help i said previously that bobby bragan was responsible for my being in the majors well pete reiser kept me there he opened my stance shortened my swing and told me to hit to the opposite field  per cent of the time we worked on this  days i was playing but i was still coming out in the fifth sixth or seventh inning for a pinchhitter but on the thirteenth or fourteenth day i broke loose    theres a short sequel to the story i corralled reiser in los angeles and bragan in chicago i told them that maury wills had paid great tribute to them for his success in the major leagues i asked them to give me their versions of the story to tell me just what they had done for him both men neither knowing what the other had said spoke identical words about maury wills each said he did it he did it all hes the hardestworking ballplayer ive ever known 
i need your love so bad

ie walker was returning to alabama she was seated mid way in a miserable little coach the only passenger car on the train the  was the towns only train taking and bringing an average of twelve or thirteen passengers weekly except for holidays and funerals she tried to look out the window but it was so streaked and grimy that she turned to reading for the last time ever the fourpage article the national magazine had printed when her retirement from the entertainment world had been announced a few months ago leonie walker the great american negro blues singer shocked the western world last week when she announced in no uncertain terms im quitting best known for her rendition of i need your love so bad    it began like all the other articles on all the other negroes who had established themselves it described her life as much of it as she had thought fit to tell them before and during her meteoric rise in the blues world it had rambled on and on filling space until it came to the line which now as it had months ago cut her to the quick the amazing thing is said one colleague that despite all her good fortune leonie has managed to retain her spirit of humility there it was thats what the whole article was about thats what it seemed to her all the articles about famous negroes boiled down to sooner or later that spirit of humility was the east coast euphemism for the despised southern that nigger knows how to stay in his place that unnamed but omnipresent white colleague had mouthed and would mouth that obscenity as long as the population ratio remained what it was that was not what bothered her it was the fact that the thing she was going to do now would make that article sound like gospel truth north south east and west it would seem like little eva coming back across the river but she couldnt stop it coming into oak grove the  began its usual ritual of jerks starts and reverses before coming to a dead halt in front of the one room double partitioned in the cause of racial purity station she got up tossed the magazine onto the seat opposite pulled her traveling kit down from the rack and made her way down the aisle into the vestibule and out into the dust gravel and heat of alabama sam mrs glenvilles driver had come up the cars right here he said they shook hands glad to have  you back leonie that was all it was enough she knew he meant it yes she was returning and gladly after twelve years of pleading for love on the stages of new york paris london after years of entertaining white men and women by singing those songs born of the tortures which they inflicted upon negroes and in turn paid such fabulous prices to hear oh shed packed auditoriums every program was sold out weeks in advance she autographed  photographs every other day just to get ahead but she was always alone in her hotel room a funny kind of prostitution thats what it was only this was worse because the commodity was her soul they paid heavily through that pimp her manager then they entered the darkened room waiting she appeared stripped down to her bare soul flung wide her arms and alternately screamed and whispered i need your love so bad when it was over they were gone she never knew their names did not even recognize the faces of those who came more than once to see her only one thing was sure they were always confident assured of a good performance her voicethat bronze and velvet instrument as one critic called itwas her health card she noticed that sam was taking the short cut as the limousine bumped along the dusty road adding yet another layer of film to the sheets and undergarments hanging on clotheslines she reminded herself without feeling of any sort that she had no point of contact with this the black section of town she had never known a father or mother her first memory being that of playing in a wide back yard with white childrenthe yard of the house to which she was headed now shed never had a black mama to nurse to have comb and grease her hair no black papa to cuddle up to and learn the fear of god and the white man from no black brothers and sisters to run barefoot with in the hot sand no leonies heritage was her song the first time she remembered singing it was in the back yard with michael anne and susan now mr michael miss anne and miss susan and them kneeling at her feet to listen in high school she had sung it on a talent program and had swept away the prize it had launched and kept aloft her career a canarys got to sing she was fond of saying he dont know where the song came from he dont care he just keeps singin three things he dont understand his song his color and his cage he cant understand em he cant fight em and he cant lose em without dyin as they passed washington high school she thought not so much of the years she had spent there as of the years that had passed since her graduation shed returned to the glenville household as cook shed never left it of course it was just that the recognition of the difference between the blackhandinwhitehand relationship of the childhood years and the backofwhitehandacrossblackface relationship of the adult years had to be instilled as subtlety as possible this could be accomplished best so the glenvilles had felt in a negro school only somehow their strategy and her learning had failed them shed learned what they had intended she saw fear hope longing distress daily shed heard all the cruel stories as well as the cruel jokes in self defense she found out what could happen what had happened and what was happening and she armed herself like all the rest of the soldiers in her campfor defeat not victory but it didnt turn out like the experts had predicted perhaps the difference was in her marching song i need your love so bad had won out nobody else had sung a blues that day on the talent program yet leonie had won the prize nobody understood it just as nobody had understood in paris london new york shed had to repeat it everywhere they didnt understand it but they wanted to hear it over and over again perhaps they tried in the rehearing to grasp it but it escaped them nobody knew what it meant either to themselves or to her nobody that is but the glenvilles theyd understood it since that moment they knelt around her feet in their back yard to hear her sing it they knew it was more than a blues they knew it was a fundamental wail from somewhere in the blackness that shielded leonies soul they also knew that it was not directed at them or at anybody in particular and in it they recognized their own needs doubts hopes she was singing for them all it was this that made their bond indivisible they were all caught in that well of loneliness and only leonies song could give their feelings adequate expression it drew them together it made the long journey toward the light a little easier what makes these biscuits so good leonie mrs glenville would ask when they were at supper it was probably the only house in oak grove where the cook ate with the family sweat tears and a song was the answer it was always good for a laugh yet they knew the truth of it they had seen her making bread the water from her brow mixing with the water streaking her cheeks and together falling into the dough and they knew the song it was the one they heard on good days and bad it was the one she hummed when they brought to her their troubles it was the one she involuntarily sang aloud when the troubles were mutual it was the same song whether its function were lullaby lowdown blues or a hymn it was hers to give and theirs to share feeling the car change gears au tomatically she glanced out to find that they were in the oval driveway to the house that twelveroom structure which mr michael and his sisters had left long since leaving mrs glenville widowed childless and alone shell be her old self tonight thought leonie with me and the children all back yes and the grandchildren ive never seen she looked over at the newly mowed kentuckybluegrass lawn and realized that there the decision had been made to present her to the fast moving entertainment world twelve years and a half ago at a glenville family reunion on this lawn leonie had sung to the accompaniment of two guitars sams and the yard mans miss susans brotherinlaw from new york an impresario had known a good thing when he heard it and asked them to entrust their cook to his care she was willing just knocked off my feet as she had put it and her career began weil that was all over now the limousine stopped opposite the front door when she got out sam said ive got to go back downtown to pick up a few things nobodys home but the grandkids and theyre out back its all yours leonie she entered the house looking neither to the right or left not so much out of confidence as out of hope that nothing had been significantly altered since she left until she was in the dining room the note was there on the table which had been set for eight mrs glenville had written just family tonight leonie mike and his wife sue and anne and their husbands you and me leonie sighed and in that exultation swept away the memory of the last twelve years dinner was always served at five thirty she had little over an hour she made for the kitchen alone there she surveyed her old domain it was just as it had been twelve long years ago except for a new tiled floor and different curtains everything else seemed untouched the faucet still had a silent intermittent drip with an effort she could see a portion of the playground where the grandchildren were the window above the sink had not been enlarged after all she turned to the closet beside the pantry took down a starched white uniform and laid it across a chair slowly she took off her turquoise dress and hung it up after the uniform was buttoned she took from her purse a faded bandana and slowly wound it round until it covered every trace of hair from neck to forehead the flour milk salt yeast stood beside the big bowl she began to hum rolled up her sleeves and poured in the ingredients her left forearm cradled the bowl against her stomach her right hand grasped the spoon handle and began the revolutions wide at first against the edges of the bowl and then in closer and closer circles the sweat and the tears were already starting 
the lost pioneers

are so few ne t groes living in rural   nebraska that it is interesting to find that  some did take land in the homestead days in various parts of the state like many of the white homesteaders they were handicapped by lack of capital to carry them through drouth hard times and hard winters those who were lured to cherry county by the  acre kinkaids found the land of little use for farming and the homestead acreage far too small for successful ranching an effort was made by the writers project of the wpa to make a record of the negro farmer in nebraska and there are two short accounts of the settlement in cherry county in reeces history of cherry county and in reverend o j burkhardts history of the negro settlement in cherry county near brownlee the wpa writers found that as early as  several families came out from omaha to file claims on sec  twp  range  in franklin county these were the  homesteads given under the first homestead act signed by president lincoln in  the settlers in franklin county planned to make permanent homes on their claims for they laid out a village to be called grant and they named a nearby stream lovely creek their money gave out and they left the county within the year two groups came from tennessee to take land one group settled in hamilton county in  the other group went to harlan county in  hard times and hard winters discouraged both groups and they returned to tennessee a lasting settlement was made in  in dawson county near overton these people were descendants of slaves who had escaped to canada via the underground railway and had evidently done very well there they had the finances to stay on their homesteads until they could get a crop and to make the necessary improvements on their land to get the patents after the residence stipulation had been met in  eight of these families disposed of their dawson county holdings and led the way to cherry county they crossed the platte river and trailed through the sandhills in covered wagons to ten miles north west of brownlee to file claims to acre homesteads roy brown of valentine nebraska thinks that his father george brown took the first homestead in the area on sec  twp  range  in  he was soon followed by dawson county neighbors william walker albert riley george riley c h mehan joshua emanuels j a hatters and william crawford they staked out their claims built their soddies and settled down to living in a wilderness with few roads few fences few trees and hills with much less grass on them than is there now seth hanna long time rancher in cherry county thinks that the first claim was made by a negro railroader clem deaver deaver may have heard of this large tract of unclaimed land when he was in seneca a booming railroad town at that time seth thinks that deaver may have alerted other negroes to the opportunity in land for they soon came from other nebraska towns lincoln schuyler alliance north platte and broken bow they came from other states ohio indiana kansas and missouri roy brown says that at one time there were over a hundred families in the colony it is stated in the reece history of cherry county that by   homesteads had been taken by negroes this was more than  acres of land beginning  miles northwest of brownlee it lay for  miles on either side of the north loup river some of it was the best land in the  county on the other hand joshua emanuels land was such a blowout that they dubbed it emanuels desert they named their sod post office dewitty after the first postmaster mail was brought in daily from seneca they added a store building to their post office ed white who has run a store at brownlee for many years says that they used to purchase merchandise from his store to sell from the dewitty store school districts  and  were organized in an area where there were no white settlers later another district was organized for both white and negro children goldie and fern walker became school teachers goldie who became mrs w r hayes taught in the rural schools of cherry county and south dakota all of her life her last teaching was in  she was an excellent teacher her schoolrooms were very very clean and had carpets on the floors and white curtains and the best of all equipment that she could persuade school boards to purchase she put on many fine musical programs with her pupils after she moved to valentine in  she was a member of the m e church choir for many years before her death in  the rev mr o j burkhardt a missionary evangelist of the african methodist episcopal church visited the colony and helped them organize a church they built it across the river about a mile from their post office it was made up of many denominations who forgot their differences and worked together for the common good their first pastor the rev mr w h mance from topeka took a homestead where the parsonage was built he remained long enough to get a patent for his claim the next pastor the rev mr william kerby from kansas city also took a claim and proved up on it before he left the settlers from dawson county were used to farming and continued to farm in cherry county they knew little of crop rotation and other means of crop improvement roy brown says they corned it to death with a little more capital and knowhow of stock raising some of them could have developed successful ranches the rileys stuck it out until  when albert sold out and moved to valentine to work for the niobrara wild life reserve he remained at this work for twenty years when he retired and moved to danver his son albert of valentine says that the hard times of the s forced his father to give up his land cows were bringing  and corn  cents a bushel they couldnt make a living at those prices some very able mechanics such as carpenters and masons were among the negro colony both men and women worked wherever they could get it from other ranchers to add to the income they could get from their land eddie ford walked seven miles night and morning to and from a ranch job robert hannahs rode his horse to brownlee every friday to open his barber shop by sunday evening he had taken care of his customers at brownlee and the surrounding countryside and rode back to his home several men are still living in the area who were barbered by hannahs and some remember going as children to his home for their haircuts old settlers who lived in the county at the time of the negro settlement speak of them as good citizens good workers good musicians and good baseball players they brought color and gaiety to the usual drabness of pioneer life there was music for all occasionsdances fairs fourth of july celebrations and the threeday rodeo at brownlee when the negroes were there the price brothers made up one orchestra and there were other groups of players their instrumentation was violin guitar mandolin and piano boss woodson was a fine singer as well as a mandolin player it sounded like an organ when mr and mrs c spees sang together in the congregational church at thedford old settlers say it was an entertainment treat for them to go to the negro dances to watch their beautiful dancing when they got together for a dance in the town hall roy brown says that most of them played by ear they would get a phonograph record and listen to it over and over until they could play it a few could play it after one hearing teams from thedford and brownlee played their baseball team the negroes not only played ball but entertained the spectators all the while with clowning along with their playing four young men from the colony served the country in world war i w r hayes joseph boyd mckinley boyd and glen hannahs all returned to their homes but boyd had spent so much time in wet trenches that he never fully recovered his health a few of these settlers lived on their land for a quarter of a century others relinquished their rights for what they could get as soon as they were able they didnt like rural life or couldnt make a living there others held on to get the patents to the land and then sold out others mortgaged the land and lost through not being able to meet interest payments the cattlemen who bought the land had come to the sandhills in the days of the free range and had learned what could be done with those hills while riding for other outfits they had learned that it wasnt farm land and that it takes thousands of acres to make a ranch they usually had a little capital and a few cattle when they took their kinkaids they picked up other land as they were able until they had a ranch sothe corned to death land has gone back to prairie sod the soddies have been destroyed by wind cattle and moisture such frame buildings as there were have been hauled away by the new owners most of the negroes have gone to the cities omaha denver kansas city st louis or to the west coast all that remains is the cemeteryprobably a dozen unmarked graves in one of seth hannahs pastures some are buried at brownlee and memories remain for the old settlers of a good people gay and lighthearted in trying circumstancesand memories for the negroes of the great good times they had down there that roy brown speaks of 
the untold story of open housing in suburbia
by bill boone
park forest a middleclass suburb of chicago the james robinson family moved quietly and almost uneventfully into their newlybought home integrating what was formerly an allwhite community the only incident which the robinsons and park forest residents now recall with humor was an almost bazaar enactment of a scene from a silent movie a day before the robinsons moved in unknown but suspected youthful pranksters painted their wooden fence black the following day police and other residents appeared with buckets and brushes in hand apologized to the robinsons and repainted the fence white in hastings ranch an upperclass suburb of los angeles mr and mrs albert morris a retired professional couple have lived peacefully in their pleasant surroundings since august we have made delightful friends and we like the area says mrs morris there was some opposition shortly after the morrises moved in almost  persons met to block the first negro familys move into the allwhite suburb the course of action chosen by the majority was to accept the single occurrence but to socially reject the morrises and work to keep other negro families out dissenting from the majority were two individuals members of a fair housing group who thought differently and went to work to change attitudes shortly afterwards a second meeting was called under the new auspices and  persons attended to welcome the morrises to hastings ranch in boston air force captain and mrs g b tracy and family were desirous of moving to the suburbs for the usual reasons better schools fresh air back yard barbecues etc after locating a house through the clearing house office maintained by the fair housing federation of greater boston they drove out to talk with the owner who felt obligated to consult his neighbors before selling after sampling the opinions of neighbors which were about equal in regard to accepting a negro family as neighborsthe owner decided to sell assured by the owner and the suburbs fair housing committee that although there may be some stresses and strain there would be no violent reactions the tracys moved in there were no serious problems their two children went to local schools and have encountered no discrimination some neighbors have ignored the tracys but most were friendly and welcoming and as predicted by members of the fair housing committee several of the neighbors who were opposed to the tracys buying have now become good friends  in levittown new jersey more than  families have integrated that suburban area without incident peaceful integration of hundreds of negro families in suburban boston philadelphia and washington have occurred with scant notice from the press the examples go on and on in suburbs villages and townships hundreds of negro families have yielded to suburbia fever and have fled the overcrowded ghetto areas for the same reasons as their white counterparts over the past five years the incidence of peaceful and harmonious integration of previously allwhite areas has been occurring with increasing frequency in practically all areas in the united states above the mason dixon line how has this receptive atmosphere come about through what avenues or agencies may a negro buyer find housing in the suburbs why have there been little or no publicity about the peaceful moveins are enough negroes taking advantage of this open door policy the answer to the last question is not nearly enough according to the reports of many whites and nonwhites working for open occupancy in suburbia in fact many feel the negro is still too reluctant still too fearful of making the move even though studies and polls point out that the negro wants and needs better housing and the advantages suburban living offers many persons most of whom are whites working for residential integration go so far as to say it is the negros duty to move into the areas now made or being made available to him that he should take advantage of this opportunity after he and so many others have fought for open occupancy and other white members of such housing groups who have tired of seeking and trying to persuade negro families to move to the suburbs throw up their hands in frustration and despair and withdraw their efforts with the attitude if they dont want to come well what is all this talk about discrimination and racism but to answer the above questions in order the receptive atmosphere in hundreds of suburban areas is being created by the increasing number of fair housing groups springing up all over the united states they may be called fair housing committees human relations councils friends suburban housing home home opportunities made equal or by various other names they may be a part of or cooperate with existing human relations groupspublic and privatewhich are working in the housing field but the general purpose of all of them is to make possible for every man the equal opportunity to obtain housing without regard to race religion or national origin but as pointed out in trends in housing a publication of the national committee against discrimination in housing an organization of  associated groups who have successfully fought on the national level for equal housing the various fair housing groups concern goes beyond the effort to guarantee the right of minorities to move freely into any neighborhood they desire and can afford they actively promote residential integrationwhether a fair housing practices law applies to their community or not they are committed to the proposition that integrated communities are socially healthy politically desirable and economically sound if they live in an allwhite community they want it to become integrated if they live in an integrated community they want to keep it that way these grassroots organizations are interested in general improvement of housing conditions but they are not trying to meet housing needs per se and since their purpose is to maintain residential in tegration they may search for the white as well as the nonwhite homeseeker as a result they fight to combat unethical real estate agents since such tactics almost always create other segregated areas many of these organizations limited their activities almost exclusively to opening up housing for negroes in the suburbs since it is believed that the suburb is where the solution to the housing problem lies too violence most often occurs in fringe areas just two to three blocks from a negro ghetto where blockbusters used in the derogatory sense have incited suspicion and fear within the white areas near the ghetto credit for the present breakthrough in the suburbs as well as in certain allwhite areas in cities must also go to the presence of fair housing laws on various states statutes and to such organizations as the above mentioned ncdh which since  has played a central role in the movement toward equal opportunity in housing according to margaret fisher editor of trends in housing its constituents include the principal religious civic labor and civil_rights groups which are dedicated to the proposition that equal opportunity to bargain in an open competitive market for shelter is a basic constitutional and moral right of every american another organization religiously oriented and which has pioneered in equal housing opportunity and in helping to create a receptive atmosphere for nonwhites in allwhite areas is the american friends service committees housing opportunity program a committee of the friends community relations program the housing arm has worked for several years toward the basic goal of expanding areas for nonsegregated living by working with members of the housing industry and with concerned citizens and organizations but the most recent acts that have given a moral as well as a legal impetus to open occupancy was president kennedys long awaited stroke of the pen and federal housing administrator robert c weavers directive that prohibits discrimination in the sale or rental of fha and va financed housing although activities of the local fair housing groups may vary somewhat their pattern of operation is usually the same the decision is somehow made by several people or groups in the allwhite community to work toward integrated housing on at least one occasion trend reports the motivation came from a welladministered shock by a fouryearold a suburban housewife and her young son met an elegant and distinguished negro woman at the home of a friend  mommie queried the fouryearold whose maid is that  that night a group of friends met at the womans home to talk about what white suburbia was doing to our children and what we could do about it a fair housing committee was organized on the spot after such a group is formed a query in the form of an open occupancy petition or fair housing pledge is circulated in the community from the petitions can be determined the feeling of the community and therefore how much work must be done to create a receptive mood or atmosphere it must be noted that the petition is not circulated as a poll since the individual members know that the right of an individual to buy a house cannot depend on a vote of the neighbors too experience of the groups prove that whites refuse to sign the petition or pledge or indicates he is opposed to nonwhites as neighbors is likely to change his position after meeting the newcomers since no subterfuge is used in selling to nonwhites homes are shown to prospective customers in broad daylight no quota system is set although friends suburban housing one of the only such groups that actually is a licensed real estate firm limits the number of houses to minority group families in one neighborhood for fear of further segregation within the suburb in addition to maintaining listings for available housing the fair housing groups sponsor rumor clinics workshops on the housing problem or intergroup relations organize forums or speakers bureaus to combat the popular misconceptions about the negro and property values usually backed by or working in conjunction with the church or other civic organizations the various councils also prevail upon village officials and law enforcement agencies to cooperate with them and to assist them whenever necessary and although law enforcement officers in the example of park forest might have gone beyond the call of duty other communities have reported full cooperation by police in protecting the rights of all citizens and some law enforcement offices in several communities like park forest and skokie illinois announced these intentions publicly in addition to actively seeking out negro families interested in moving to a suburban community the councils also supply white checkers for nonwhite applicants who are running into difficulty securing accommodations and in many cases locate cooperative real estate agencies for the prospective buyers outside of the aforementioned friends suburban housing which was also organized for the purpose of promoting residential integration fsh has sold  homes mostly in allwhite areas to negroes in the philadelphia suburban communities the councils are predominantly nonprofit and manned by volunteers the listing services are free and are maintained for the purpose of facilitating direct communication between the home seeker and the owner or landlord this also serves to bypass the restrictions imposed by discriminatory real estate practices what must be added is the fact that the fair housing councils do not attempt to force a seller to sell or a negro to buy the aim of these groups is to meet the need and desires of the homeseeker with appropriate available housing and adds arthur smith of levittown n j cochairman of the burlington county human relations council and a negro we are much interested in having this integrated housing come about in the right way as we are in just having this come about this means no blockbusting techniques no scare selling no panic and no violence why has there been little publicity on peaceful moveins as one member of a fair housing council stated just as one often reads news of divorce but rarely of happy marriages so one frequently hears of hostility and violence when a negro family moves into a previously allwhite neighborhood but rarely learns of peaceful and harmonious integration little publicity on the successful moveins can also be attributed to the policy of the various councils which regard the purchase or sale of a home a private and personal decision secondly the process of creating a receptive atmosphere or attitude of acceptance in a community requires thoughtful frank discussion by concerned individuals both of which may be made more difficult if not impossible by publicity or published statements by the more radical elements in a community perhaps partly decause of this unpublicized progressas well as many other reasonsthere is in many communities more available housing than nonwhite families to fill them according to ncdh why is this so especially since negroes have been knocking on the housing barrier and with greater force in the past few years why do they not take advantage of the open door to the suburbs or is  open occupancy in housing only an issue for airing grievances against whites and not to be taken advantage of when the openings come the reasonssome might call them argumentsare valid say many negroes who have addressed themselves to the question first of all there is fear a very real and valid fear of moving into the suburbs away from people of the same racial background and experience negroes homes have been bombed or vandalized and the newcomers harassed although this has happened only relatively few times in suburban areas but as stated earlier such acts of violence and hate usually are publicized more and are remembered more readily than the numerous peaceful incidents secondly there are those for whom the suburbs hold no fascination to them the better school yard space and fresh air is no compensation for the cost and trouble of commuting back and forth to work negro families falling into this group perhaps should not be mentioned but they are to be distinguished from those who vocally share these same sentiments but later move into an allnegro suburb sometimes farther away than comparable white suburbs perhaps the thought of leaving relatives friends and people of similar interests and experiences is the most oftenheard reasons why negro families remain unattracted to suburban living this reason of course erroneously implies that there will be no families in the suburbs with similar interests background and experiences the fact is according to the case history of negro families who have moved to the suburbs their background interests and professions were more similar to those in their new community outside of different racial experiences other factors were quite surprisingly similar what about schooling will the negro child be discriminated against or hurt through being the only nonwhite in the classroom or school how will his being a minority affect him psychologically from the experiences of several negro parents with children of school age the record shows the youngsters are readily accepted by both teachers and pupils in at least one case a suburban mother said her children were treated almost like celebrities by other students and teachers and that her only fear was the effects of the abundance of attention her children were receiving the psychological effects of being a minority in a school are perhaps longreaching subtle and difficult to assess and may depend on the parents attitude and teachings in the home in regard to racial matters and human values but the opportunity for varied racial experiences it must be recalled have been among the motivations behind many of the fair housing councils efforts to integrate their community is it unlikely to assume that such interracial experience will also benefit the negro child responding perhaps defensively perhaps with resentment to such urgings to move to suburbia other negroes say we lived together in the city and you fled from me why do you want me to live with you now the same question has been put another way why do whites consider a school that is  per cent negro as intolerable so they move away and one that is  per cent white as integrated perhaps no better person could answer that question than harry teshima of park forest a japaneseamerican whose wife and children are longtime residents of the area says teshima who was instrumental in getting the first negro family into park forest i refuse to take the blame for those people you may be speaking about for not all people in the suburbs fled from negroes many moved out of their former neighborhoods to the suburbs for the same reason i believe negroes want to move out of the enforced ghettoes many negroes ive talked to say they dont necessarily want integration but equality of opportunity in america how can you have equality of opportunity and not have integration still another factor in the negros fear of the suburbs is the misconception about suburban living according to the experiences of some fair housing council members many negroes believe housing is cheaper and taxes are lower this is not always true in  addition commuting if one works in the city is an inevitable fact that usually frightens a citydweller considering moving to suburbia then there are rumors usually false rumors that discourage potential home buyers what advice would you give to families who are thinking about moving to the suburbs a newlyarrived negro suburban housewife was asked dont listen to relatives and friends she said the rumors mostly unfounded and distorted were related to her after she had talked to friends about her familys planned move to a particular suburb her fears on moving into the new home were multiplied she said and every car every strange sound chilled her later she found the rumors to be either false or completely distorted the responsibilities and tasks voluntarily assumed by members of these local fair housing councils are difficult and at times disappointing its members have discovered but as indicated by the growing number of fair housing councils and the hundreds of successful moveins in many areas the efforts being made are not futile the successful examples prove that the door to the suburb is open to negro houseseekers and that there are hundreds of fairminded conscientious americans who are helping to hold it ajar

home to africa
by saunders redding
he story is told that  aii  when that flinty old ii £ scholar writer and  world traveler dr w kjr landed in ghana in  at the invitation of president kwame nkrumah he lowered himself to his knees and kissed the mother earth of africa the story is probably apocryphal it is hard to imagine dubois doing anything so contrary to the character he has given himselfand the world has acceptedfor threequarters of a century but when i raised the objection the british highechelon civil servant who was returning to his post in africa after home leave and who claimed to have witnessed this act of obeisance replied ah but africa does some strange things to you people although i instinctively resented what struck me as condescendence in the phrase you people i did not dispute the assertion i had heard other incredible stories of the transforming power of africa including some about going native and taking to the bush but as our plane banked into the approach pattern over dakar senegal all i really know was that my curiosity about africa was excited almost beyond tolerable measure it had been excited before by other places and many people and i hope it will be excited again but this time it was different africa had been a vague troubling presence in my imagination for nearly as long as i can remember like most americans of my generation i had had the wrong learning about africa and like most negro americans had never felt any pride in what i had been uncritically taught to believe indeed the oppositewhich i think was probably intended i was ashamed that africans were rated the lowest of the human species that once captured and sold into bondage often by other africans they took happily to slavery as if it was their natural condition that they lived in mud huts went naked and ate human flesh and that africa was the white mans graveyard so wasnt i glad that my ancestors had been brought from that benighted landthat dark continentand i could enjoy the blessings of civilization i could not then say forty years ago but i could now counter that question with another what blessings dakar was a refueling stop and as we walked toward the dimlit in transit lounge i turned to my wife arent you going to kiss the ground i said at three oclock in the morning a cool breeze was blowing off the ocean we were moving with a sluggish stream of people mostly white and the language we heard was french besides my wife said looking around what makes you think were in africa well its a state of mind i said we were joking of course but both of us were right nothing made me think of africa until at twothirty in the afternoon we reached lagos nigeria at our stop in accra which is the capital of the most african of black african countries the sense of africa i might have had was diluted by the presence of more britishers than blacks at the airport they were what is frequently pictured as the ubiquitous colonialtype britisherstarched khaki shorts pyramids of service ribbons pinned to the breasts of shortsleeved belted tunics ruddy cheeks mustaches slateblue eyes blond wives and blond children tugging and yapping at darkskinned nannies the scene at the airport brought back sharp memories of poona nagpur and jubbulpore the sun dazzling on the low louvered cement buildings the heat the red dust powdering the foliage and rising in great funnelclouds in the wind of prop washall of it might have been in the central plain of india in the dry season in the best days of the british raj but blackskinned hostesses met the plane at lagos with a minimum of fuss black officials ushered us through customs and policemen almost the color of their dark blue woolen shirts waved our car into the swollen tide of traffic moving cityward because our skins were pale to theirs we were not negroes nor for all the proof of passports american europeans they called us with the accent on the second syllable and at dinner that night at the mainland hotel it did not occur to the waiter to offer us the african menu we ate europeanpotage du jour brussels sprouts irish potatoes english mutton danish pastry nevertheless we were in africa all right and specifically in the capital of the largest independent country south of the sahara the african summit meeting was about to take place there and almost the first african i met on his home groundsa civil engineer with the hybrid name of james wellington ogu educated at rugby and cambridgenoting that africans had taken over the european hotels at least for the duration of the meeting remarked that the whites had all but fled from this new manifestation of the black mans concert and his will to power i think perhaps mr ogu overstated it the hottest most humid weather had come it was a good time for short leaves and the inviting mountain heights of jos were only a few hours away so what one saw everywhere were proud black faces gleaming atop billowing rich robes over the collar insignia of smart uniforms and above the tidy knots of ties tailored in bond street what one heard were yoruba ibo hausa swahili and oneself addressedfrench and english the native markets swarmed spotting europeans a block away slicksters sidled up to offer ivory beads swiss watches german cameras the main streets were gay with bunting and often shrill with the piping of uniformed school children marching four abreast to the rhythms of their own pure voices along the marina the flagdraped portraits of the heads of state of the monrovia powers looked sternly down on guards of honor shining official cars and soldiers frozen at the gates of government compounds and at stations every fifty feet along the palmlined thoroughfare the summit meeting which was convoked with restrained enthusiasm and great dignity by sir abubakar tafawa balewa prime minister of nigeria did not resolve any of those problems that african leaders themselves call pressing it did not level tariff barriers or standardize african railroads or decide on an intraafrica monetary system to certain biased unofficial observers including afrikaners portuguese and a clutch of sir roy welenskys bluster boys it proved only that africa is nationsand increasingly more of them to such observers africa is nations inevitably and naturally divided by ethnic groupings by language and culture by territorial boundaries and by sociopolitical alignments with various parts of the nonafrican world it is true of course that africa is caucasoid and negroid hamitic and semitic it is coptic priest and pagan priestess moslem christian hindu and animist it is portuguese exclave the french community the british commonwealth and the still undissolved central african federation in short africa would appear to be an irresoluble clash and confusion of native and foreign values and the inherited prejudices of nearly all the nations of europe and one who looked to the summit meeting for proof of this might have thought he found it in the declination of the casablanca group ghana guinea mali egypt and algeria to attend and mr nkrumahs denunciation of the monrovia powers but he would have been deceived i think for the one thing the summit meeting seemed to make clear is that in spite of diversity and all the appearances of fragmentation africa is nations committed and bound in spiritual congregation to the idea of panafrica it is not quite the old idea for with the emergence of the independent arab states north of the sahara it has taken on new political dimensions as a political idea it had not been conceived twentyfive years ago and what it means to bourguiba king hassan and ben bella is something quite different from what it meant then as a political idea panafrica faces problems that europe has failed to solve in all the years of onagain offagain effort since napoleon it envisions nothing less than what has been variously called a united states of africa a concert of africa and a parliament of africa in deference to this the new constitution for morocco overwhelmingly approved just recently plays down arab unity and declares that morocco will have among its prime objectives the realization of african unity surely too ethiopias and tunisias membership in the monrovia group of states which are all but solid black and moroccos and algerias membership in the casablanca groupalso all but solid blackhave the same objective and meaningthat is the political union of the african continent but the evidence available to an american negro visitor to subsahara africa suggests that this may be the least of the meanings in that region where the concept of panafrica is deeply involved with the idea of racethe black race it is an emotional involvement that confuses recent history and confounds political thought one cannot avoid the feeling of unhappy ambivalence that is provoked when in the same speech dr nnamdi azikiwe governorgeneral of nigeria says take the individual prophets of panafricanism and it will be found that in all cases they are ethnocentric in their ideas and concepts of panafricanism    when edward wilmot blyden    preached the projection of the african personality he had at the back of his mind the black inhabitants of africa the same may be said of    burghardt dubois of america mojola agbebi of nigeria jomo kenyatta of kenya javabu of south africa    kwame nkrumah of ghana and leopold senghor of senegal   that and then this my considered views are that panafricanism has come to stay and  it will yet be a shining example to the rest of the world how people of different races divergent cultures and diversity of languages can live together in political unity in one continent    not being a seer i can only prophesy that    panafricanism is destined to be feasible   destined to be feasible whether a bright hope or a desperate who can say and who can saym whether the apparent race bias of president nkrumahs struggle for black africas regenerationpolitically socially economically within the milieu suited to the    communal pattern of african society which is the foundation of panafricanism is corrected by the casablanca group which nkrumah himself called into being there is little to wonder at but much to understand that out of an overwhelming emotional need unsatisfied for half a millenium offices of africanization are set up and staffed ethnic symbols and myths are ever more viable western cultural authority courageously challenged and the prestige of  whiteness diminished everywhere in black africa as an old idea the association that clung to panafrica were ethnic and as dr azikiwes speech made clear its prophets were ethnocentric if it meantas it certainly didafrica for black africans it also meant hope in black africas future and a resurrectionno a new birthof pride in its past as an old idea panafrica had been made respectable to me by my experience as a negro in america long before african intellectuals of the stature of leopold senghor and alioune diop elaborated it and the west indian poet aime cesaire refined out of it the mystique negritude and nkrumah gave it fresh utterance at the allafrican peoples conference in  and long long before elijah poole the american negro who now calls himself elijah muhammad screamed it as a battle cry for mindless violenttongued revolutionaries to echo and gather to panafrica was an assertion of the common cultural heritage of all black menwhich as i saw it certainly included me since a cultural history is proclaimed everywhere to be the unassailable testimonial to the dignity and worth of a people and since by definition i was excluded from the cultural heritage that should have been mine by right of birth panafrica was the door through which fulfillment gleamed yet so frustrating and divisive was the learning of my youth and so charismatic the projection of the american dream when that door was opened at the allafrican writers conference in uganda last spring i could not enter through it of the black african writers most likely to be known to the west only leopold senghor peter abrahams and the ailing and aging amos tutuola were missing chinua achebe ezekiel mphahlele gabriel okara wole soyinka amadou samb bloke modisane thirtytwo in all representing the finest writing talent in africa were there there were four americans and of the several british at least four were publishers or publishers representatives including the poet langston hughes who is negro and the novelist robie macauley who is the editor of the kenyon review we americans were guests and our participation in the conference was appropriately lowkeyed the british had a somewhat different status difficult to explain but supported by the fact that they were there on business they were scouting the conference for publishable manuscripts and they were prepared to announce that a group of publishersbritish and americanwould sponsor a competition for the best novel by a black african on an african theme knowledge of this however was a wellkept secret it was to be the piece de resistance of the cultural feast to come as a surprise in next to the last plenary session having been let in on it in strict confidence i had three or four days in tingling expectation of a joyous reaction almost as if the competition was a project devised of my own thoughtful generosity many of the sessions had been taken up with questionsmore complex and more passionately discussed than i make them seem nowof the african writers audience which is limited and the cold indifference of the nonafrican world to africas literary aspirations the announcement i thought happily would be satisfaction of a real complaint i rather expected a spontaneous cheer but i was mistaken in supposing that the silence that followed was the speechlessness of ecstasy the dark sensitive intelligent faces over which i had watched animation play for nearly a week were immobile and impassive the silence was a challenge to a code i had learned so thoroughly that i had ceased to think of it i did not know the depth and substance of my african friends pride i had been taught that at the very least one should look thankful for even gestures of small favors from an all too casual and perfunctory white world i looked toward langston hughes but he was far down the table and opposite me robie macauleys head was lowered and i could not see his face plainly though the publishers were puzzled and i guessed hurt by this indifference to their charitable intentions it was not quite indifference someone asked a question when did the competition open close there were other questionsneutral routine products of politeness gradually however i could sense a subterranean flow of thought and feeling i could not guess then who will judge this competition the answer was that since they the publishers were primarily interested in a nonafrican audience the judges would be nonafrican suddenly all the writers were talking at once i will not try to relate all that was said for indeed i cannot but the gist was this it is all very well for european publishers to establish a rich prize for us africans to compete for and we thank thembut what are these publishers expectations essentially nonafrican perhaps they do not understand the insidiousness of this our standards reflecting our own values and ideals  are different from theirs and until they accept our standards we can have no pride in our accomplishments as africans and no hope that the dignity of black men is recognized although colonial despotism has forced us to use their language our standards of expressiveness are different from theirs our imaginations work differently from theirs and are not inspired by the same realities they make  certain assumptions about experience that we do not make nor ever will make they would have us disregard the new political sanctions that have come with independence and that encourage black artists and writers to be creative according to the standards and tastes of our own people will competing for this prize assure our cultural rebirth indeed will it not have the opposite effect and if this is not a hazard who are the europeans to judge us by our own standards and expectations if it is their mind to favor us then let it be on our own terms let them know that african nationalism the african personality and negritude are adequate to inspire black writers and artists with themes and to creative works justified by the authority of a black audience let us define our own genius stated with a blunt eloquence of passion that i have completely failed to convey this was the argument this was panafrica both in spirit and in word there was no discourtesy in itno fleer of sarcasm no intentional sharp anger of reproof it was simply triumphant and it moved its darkskinned audience to triumphant cries of hear hear and to surges of spontaneous applause that were not meant to be a reproach to an american negro guests pallid conception of his negroness i felt small gutted wretched i was locked out of the brotherhood of blacks by the terms used to define the black brotherhood confronted by this palpable african presence i was neither american nor black i was no one america had not made me real in the sense that africa had made real the men my elbows touched on either side they were substance i was shadow the african personality and negritude were no longer a myth compounded by a mystique again my eyes stole toward langston hughes but i still could not see his face across from me robie macauley looked withdrawn and remote from the american scholar 
jazz at the 
by leonard feather
n philadelphia a i d few months ago jazz £ singer dakota staton filed suit in a federal sewh district court against the leader of the black muslim cult she claimed that a new york disc jockey had denounced her a new jersey nightclub proprietor had refused to book her because he feared he would be boycotted and various other misadventures had befallen her because many associated her with the cults advocacy of negro nationalism this was happening miss staton declared because the public was confusing the black muslims with the orthodox moslem faith of which she and her husband are devout advocates in clarksdale mississippi according to a recent issue of jet the most popular recording on the juke box at aaron henrys fourth street drugstore was a white mans heaven is a black mans hell the tune written by two black muslims was getting more plays than records by ray charles in los angeles new york and wherever he has appeared for the past few years dizzy gillespie has regaled audiences with anecdotes before each tune stories about mississippi the john birch society his own overseas tours we wrote this next one on our recent trip to africa where we were busy making apologies for the state department    and a mock admonition to his white listeners you better be ready cause were fixin to take over the world these reflections of contemporary american society focus attention on two central facts that the american public black and white alike is more raceconscious than at any time since the civil war and that the american negro fed up with a hundred years of being told lets not be hasty is finding common cause with the nonwhite people who make up a majority of the worlds population the new militancy of the negro has naturally found its way to jazz and by an ironic turn is making itself felt in a reversal of the prevailing roles of white and negro in our country in socalled crow jim an antiwhite racial barrier on the occasion of the gifted white saxophonist brew moores departure for europe because he could not find work in or around the san francisco area jazz columnist ralph gleason wrote racial lines are now drawn much more strongly than ever before in jazz clubs are reluctant to hire any white groups except the top few    eastern record companies specializing in jazz record almost no white musicians at all these days and have in several instances turned down nationally known jazz figures for recording dates because they were the wrong color hand in hand with this goes the claim by some musicians that jazz is the progeny of the negro race and is totally alien to the white man in stockholm a famed and respected american negro jazz musician told reporter bjorn fremer the negro has a long inherited tradition in jazz its his music white people have no right to play it its a colored folk music white society has its own tradition like the polka this is the kind of music that it should concentrate on the negros ascendancy in jazz if put in less extreme terms would seem indisputable yet there are pervasive and persistent contradictions how when and where white musicians became involved in jazz and the degree to which they made an original contribution to the form cannot be determined at this historical distance years elapsed before students became sufficiently concerned with the birth of jazz to do substantial research and by this time most of the witnesses of the early innovators were dead senile or totally unreliable contradicting each other according to personal prejudices curiously enough none other than louis armstrong points to a white origin for jazz in an autobiography called swing that music  he wrote four years before i learned to play the trumpet  the first great jazz orchestra was formed in new orleans by a cornet player named dominic la rocca his orchestra had only five pieces but they were the hottest five pieces that had ever been known before la rocca named this band the old dixieland jazz band actually the original dixieland jazz band the band has gone down in musical history la roccas fame as one of the great pioneers of syncopated music will last a long long time as long i think as american music lives in contrast a white jazz historian marshall stearns devotes three chapters of his book the story of jazz to its musical roots in africa and the west indies he asserts that around the turn of the century more than a decade before the events mentioned by armstrong playing jazz was    integrated with the everyday life of the negro community that the contribution of the negro gave minstrelsy its vitality and that minstrelsy and ragtime collided in the s the former serving as a training ground for early jazzmen nick la rocca himself provides a good example of the oldtimer with a personal bias before he died a few years ago he worked closely with the author of a book called the story of the original  dixieland jazz band la rocca virulently resented negro successes in jazz and as a consequence there is scarcely any mention of negro musicians in this book if one relied solely on the evidence of the book it would appear that jazz was a fairhaired baby indeed yet stearns suggests that white players only imitated the negro musicians of the time reporting that around  in new orleans at the  ranch cabaret according to a negro musician who worked there the white kids who later became famous as the original dixieland jazz band used to hang around and listen openmouthed to the music nat hentoff in a survey of race prejudice in jazz for harpers recalled that the new orleans negro trumpeter freddie keppard turned down an offer to record for rca victor in  fearing that records would make his music easier to steal it was therefore only because of keppards reluctance that the white original dixieland jazz band happened to be the first to make records a year later on the other hand stearns says of ragtime originally a form of guitar and piano music that later merged into dixieland that it began in the midwest rather than new orleans and goes on to say that there were firstclass white as well as negro composers and performers history having thus passed into limbo undocumented and largely unobserved we can be certain now only that such prejazz forms as ragtime folkblues and minstrelsy sprang up in a firmly segregated society in my own book investigating jazz origins the book of jazz  i observed that it was the segregated american negro not the negro who contributed most of its essential characteristics jazz was the product of a specific social environment in which a group of people the american negroes largely shut off from the white world developed cultural patterns of their own but if the bent note the plaintive flatted thirds and sevenths of the blues scale were drawn from the spiritual and the countryblues cries of the negro such perpetual components of jazz as the diatonic scale melodic structures and compositional patterns stemmed from white european sources the current theoreticians of the souljazz movementsoul here being an ingroup synonym for negro as in soulbrothertrace the jazz patrimony to the negro southern baptist churches yet many great jazzmen negro and white born in connecticut or new mexico michigan or ontario owe little or nothing musically to such a background nor can syncopated rhythms almost the trademark for jazz be ascribed to a single source the evidence points to an amalgam of influences from west africa cuba the west indies and various sections of the united states though it may not be clear where interracial crossfertilization began the separation of the races as a factor in forming jazz history can hardly be overestimated segregation shaped in negro musicians certain characteristics widely imitated by whites who could not undergo firsthand the experiences that provided the emotional basis for much of the negros music not only were negro and white musicians unable to work together publicly but until the late s with rare exceptions they did not even mingle in the recording studios the original dixieland jazz band was heard on records from  on there was no regular recording of negro jazz until about five years later even riversides valuable history of classic jazz sdp  offers no real evidence of pre negro jazz except for a couple of ragtime solos transcribed to piano rolls once in gadsden alabama the musicians union refused to let three white members of fletcher hendersons band play a date until they had applied burnt cork to their faces even today the american federation of musicians has segregated locals in chicago and many other cities louis armstrong an illustrious son of new orleans may never again play there because local law will not let him bring his mixed band because of such anomalies of american society the exchange of musical ideas between races was long confined to private meetings occasional sittingsin of white musicians with negro bands and vice  versa and the radiothe last mainly a source of white jazz since whites had a nearmonopoly of the jobs with the best air time recordings were less influential than might be assumed the s by louis armstrong fletcher henderson bessie smith and others were branded as race records sold largely in negro neighborhoods and purchased by whites only when they visited these ghettos the broadcasting of records was a minor factor since there were no disc jockeys in the s and early s despite these obstacles an interchange did occur during the twenties and thirties armstrong earl hines coleman hawkins and fats waller reached and influenced thousands of young white musicians bix beiderbecke was a source of inspiration to negro trumpeters rex stewart used to play bixs famous singin the blues chorus note for note and frank trumbauers saxo ph one style impressed such youngsters as lester young and benny carter in  benny goodman shattered the barrier by taking teddy wilson out on the road as a member of his trio but the taboos still prevented his incorporation into the bandhe was considered a separate added attraction slowly the public image of allwhite and allnegro groups changed but it was not until the late s that mixed combos and bands were common  if the american jazzman was aware of the negros role in the music they shared the white public even many jazz fans had little knowledge of it a glance at the annual metronome poll in  shows that guitarist charlie christian was the only negro winner in the eleven categories at a time when benny carter coleman hawkins jimmy blanton j c higginbotham roy eldridge and ella fitzgerald were at their peaks the winners in their respective categories were toots mondello tex beneke bob haggart tommy dorsey ziggy elman and helen oconnell negro musicians ideas tunes and arrangements were duplicated for fun and profit in dehydrated versions by whites as witness glenn millers bonanza with tuxedo junction borrowed from erskine hawkinss band in the midst of such surroundings some of todays angriest jazzmen the max roaches and charlie minguses who speak most loudly of racial injustice were growing to maturity and observing that the negro was getting less than his full creditand financial reward it is not hard to understand why crow jim the antiwhite feeling of the past few years and the second wrong that does not make a right arose as the product of decades of jim crow  during the past twenty years there has been a sharp change in the attitude of the american public little by little negroes have gained majority status as jazz musicians while the tendency to equate jazz authenticity with dark skina trend that began some years ago in francehas become more widely established though ellington basie and gillespie have been using white musicians off and on for years the young white musician now finds it increasingly harder to gain acceptance among his negro contemporaries and among many negro and some white jazz fans there is a growing and highly vocal minority of negro musicians to whom the presence of a white man in a negroled band is galling several negro leaders and negro sidemen working for white bands have been asked why do you hire a white man when a negro is available or similarly why do you work for this ofay band and make it sound good stay with your own fortunately most jazzmen reject the notion that jazz is solely the province of the negro and agree that it is as wrong to exclude whites from jazz as to forbid negroes to play bach or stravinsky interracial cooperation has produced some of the most vital recorded jazz of our day miles davis and gil evans john lewis and gunther schuller dizzy gillespie and lalo schifrin sonny rollins and jim hall and so forth the primary influence upon ella fitzgerald was the radio voice of connee boswell and negro guitarist wes montgomery greatly admired django reinhardt a few years ago roy eldridge bet me he could distinguish white from negro musicians on records and the muchcited results of the blindfold test published in down beat demonstrated that there was no such thing as a negro style in jazz eldridge did not even get as many right answers as the law of averages entitled him to it is true of course that certain jazz styles are commonly associated with negro musicians for example the style of horace silver and other combos that record for blue note records is played almost exclusively by negroes similarly a certain saxophone style is nearly always identified with white musicians such as stan getz and zoot sims but there are exceptions in both cases the important point is that both have been created by social and aesthetic influences and have nothing to do with skin color one has only to observe the negroes of nonamerican origin as i did in my teens in england to pierce the illusion british negro jazzmen were and still are no more adept than their white colleagues at developing the feeling for the jazz beat that seems second nature to so many americans today in fact there is a wide range of musical approaches among negro jazzmen some such as john lewis deeply involved with orchestral developments are closer to european traditions than to the core of jazz while others like max roach more concerned with improvisations and rhythm are seeking kinship with their african ancestors and cousins still others dizzy gillespie for example draw the best from both camps and manage to combine pragmatic realism with a sense of humor despite the rapidly changing social climate and its effect on the world of music jazz will almost certainly continue to be an interracial art form a spirit of good will still prevails between most negro and white musicians despite the pressure from the disenchanted and the dissident these last are sure only of what they are against while the majority is sure of what it is for the right to work play and live together on equal terms jazzmen of the past especially those who fought stubbornly to mix their bands at a time when this was hazardous and financially risky have played a laudable part in helping to eliminate racial barriers those of the present and future no matter what some current skirmishes may seem to indicate will in my view carry forward the initiative of their precursors
