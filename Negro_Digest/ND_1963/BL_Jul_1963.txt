a challenge to negro leaders
by louis e lomax
ime settles all disputes thus the social critics are separated from the vested interest leaders truth is separated from organizational propaganda in mid  i published in harpers magazine an article the negro revolt against the negro leadership class that article led to my current book the negro revolt which is now in its fifth printing and also issued in paperback the thesis of both the article and the book is that as of the montgomery bus boycott the american negro has been in a state of revolt that the revolt is not only against segregation but against the entrenched negro leadership class as well my specific point was that legalism had taken the negro about as far as it could that from this point  forward the negro would fight his main battles in the streets and in the market place i agreed with the militant students core and dr martin_luther_king that the law was clear that what was needed was for negroes to present their bodies as living sacrifices to implement the already stated court decisions as a necessary consequence of this position i was critical of those negro organizations specifically the naacpthat refused to make a clearcut committment to whatever kinds of demonstration were necessary to actualize the rights the courts have long since said we have for this i was drawn and quartered by certain national leaders i have in my files proof that one negro organization tried to stop certain publications from employing me i have letters from local naacp branch presidents saying they had been advised by the naacp national office that i was not to be allowed to speak before naacp meetings white liberal columnistsnotably harry golden and lawrence spevackcalled me an extremist and suggested that i smelled of malcolm_x in some instances the attack on me approached calumny the crisis article the revolt of louis e lomax reprinted in negro digest december  was so invidious that i felt deep sorrow for the excellent and brilliant mind that had been given such an assignment but time settles all disputes and i held my rebuttal in the certain knowledge that moving events would speak for me or against me with my critics or against them and time spoke with a thunderclap at birmingham alabama i was there i ran with hundreds of negro children as they like jack rabbitsscampered from  churches past fire hoses over policemen and by growling dogs into the center of birmingham where they staged one mighty rockandroll for freedom and dignity and when the tumult was done birmingham department stores had pledged themselves to desegregation of their facilities to upgrading of negro employees to the release of negro demonstrators and a biracial committee had been formed to watch over continuing racial progress in that tormented town reporting from birmingham time magazine said birminghams negroes were not worried about legalities they were not worried about the niceties of timing instead theirs was a raging desire to achieve equal human status now and by whatever means as any liberal well knows when time comes upon such a discovery the fact is at least three years old and it was edward brooke the attorney general of massachusetts and its first statewide negro official who underscored the point said brooke the pressure is mounting it has been smoldering for many years and it is a justifiable impatience birmingham is but the beginning the continuation actuallyfor at this writing nashville memphis chicago and albany georgia are belching racial flames demonstrators have already taken to the streets and the market places of these towns in allout efforts to gain what they deem to be their just freedoms philadelphians led on by core have just staged an all night sitin at city hall as a result the mayor has signed an order that will stop all city building until the unions involved hire and upgrade negroes so then the story goes but this is no hour for gloating as ambassador carl rowanthen a minnesota newsmansaid lomaxs the revolt against the negro leadership class raises the question that will plague leadership for the next decade or so and it is with this issue not for personalities involved that i wish to deal first of all the bickering among negro leaders and leadership organizations has reached such proportions that it could hamper racial progress the classic evidence of this is the story surrounding the birth of the voter education program that is now doing such magnificent work in the deep south while i was working on the tv documentary walk in my shoes i was given a news tip according to the tipster some quarter of a million dollars was available to underwrite a concentrated negro voter registration drive in the deep south provided the various negro leadership organizations could pull together and carry out the program each in its own way but with an umbrella of central guidance i checked out the story found it to be true and was able to isolate the taconic foundation as the fountain of funds i did not break the story my agent had a ready market for it because those in the know felt that a premature break of the story would endanger the entire project for the better part of two months i kept the story quiet but managed to stay abreast of developments things moved slowly but eventually i received irrefutable information that every negro leadership organization but the naacp had agreed to participate in the program from inside the naacp national board itself i received information that the program was in grave trouble there that the board had just decided to defer voting on the project until a future board meeting this is the way we handle hot potatoes the board member told me we never turn them down and open ourselves to criticism we simply keep setting them over to another meeting at about the same time i discovered that the holders of the purse strings were getting nervous they had about decided to withdraw the money if the naacp did not agree to work with the project after all a spokesman said to me we cant afford to launch such a drive without the cooperation of the largest best organized and best known negro leadership organization on the day this information fell into place i was scheduled to make a broadcast on radio station wbai in new york it was a freewheeling type program that allowed me fifteen minutes to say whatever i chose i elected to break the story as i have related it here i omitted the name of the organization that had so far refused to work with the voter project i concluded by asking whether a negro leadership organization had the moral right to refuse participation in such a program without a public explanation the result was electric innocent organizationsspecifically core were bombarded by memberdonors who demanded to know how such a large sum of money could be lost when theythe organizationswere constantly begging for funds the organizations replied we are not the guilty ones the mystery of the guilty organization was solved by the naacp itself whena few days laterit sent an emergency memorandum to all its branches in the new york area the memorandum castigated me for being an inaccurate sensationseeking reporter and then went on to say why the naacp had not agreed to the voter registration project witnm hours after that memo the naacp agreed to the project and the now famous voter education program was underway what was behind all this the naacp feltand rightly sothat it had been doing a good voter registration job in the south the power structure had qualms about joining a broad program where the naacp efforts would become less distinctive and identifiable from an organizational point of view the naacp leadership was absolutely correct joining the voter education program would certainly blur the specific contributions made by that organization from a negro point of view the naacp leadership was absolutely wrong for the purpose of the naacpor of all negro leadership organizations for that matteris not to perpetuate the organization but to free negroes from second class citizenship and when the bickering over who will get the credit and thus have a larger base for fund raising begins to cloud the sky of freedom then it is time that a warning be sounded secondly negro leadership is so sensitive to social criticism that it has resorted to tactics that border on censorship item in  i was the associate producer of the awardwinning tv documentary walk in my shoes which was seen on the abc network several days before the show was aired abc officials received a letter from an naacp official on naacp stationery objecting to the airing of the program abc officials were astounded because we didnt know just how the documentary would shape up ourselves at that moment we were still in the final stages of editing and cutting abc contacted the official and asked how he could object to that which he had not seen that which we ourselves had not settled on he replied in essence that it didnt make any difference what was in the documentary as long as lomax has anything to do with it we object i hasten to add that the official involved was a national official but no one was more shocked than roy wilkins when he was apprised as to what one of his underlings had done item a similar situation occurred when i wrote the bitter cup a dramatic show that was seen on nbcs frontier of faith the naacp got wind of it demanded a screening got it and literally frightened network officials into making last minute changes item mrs tina sattin wife of singer lonnie sattin and program chairman of the mount vernon new york naacp branch called and asked me to speak for their membership rally on the morning of the rally mrs sattin called and with deep apology she had just the week before helped me with a telethon during which upwards of  were raised for the freedom riders told me that gloster current naacp secretary for branches had issued an order that i not speak several hours of telephone wrangling ensued and the branch president mrs gerry johnson decided that i should speak anyway i addressed the rallyall  of those present item during a recent lecture tour of california a white member of the santa monica naacp at tended one of my lectures she asked me if i would come to her branch and help them raise money and members both of which they desperately needed despite a clause in my lecture agency contract which forbids me to make unscheduled free lectures i agreed to come a few days later i received a letter from the embarrassed white liberal the lecture was off the naacp national office had advised that i was not to speak i have kept these items personal for a reason i can defend and prove each of them if challenged to do so but i am by no means the only one on the naacps list my sin is that i feel the naacp should become directly involved in direct action as a member andthenexecutive board person this was certainly my right what better place for a debate concerning naacp policy than naacp meetings themselves or is the pursuit of civil_rights impervious to free speech thirdly negro leadership attacks upon those who engage in honest open social criticism has begun to embrace pure meanness dr john morsells article the revolt of louis e lomax is the ultimate evidence of this item dr morsell blames me for misspelling a name and the inconsistency of certain dates mentioned in my book the negro revolt now i write books i dont edit proofread or publish them the job of correcting misspellings and making sure dates are correct is that of the proofreader and copy editor dr morsell should know this if he doesnt he is too stupid to lead anybody anywhere if he knows it and still made such charges he is a disgrace to his job and our people as well item dr morsell refers to me as a selfasserted naacp board member who that either i am a member of my naacp board or i am not if i am notand the books are certainly available to dr morsell roy wilkins top aid then i should be exposed for making such a dastardly public claim if i amand no one knows better than dr morsell that i was a board member at the time the book was writtenthen why call me a selfasserted member this was of course pure meanness an unvarnished attempt to smear my image as a local naacp official who dared speak out against the policy of the national office item dr morsell writes that i have managed to master the ageold negro art of fooling white people this from a top naacp official and a man of dr morsells mind at that is all but incredible as the executive director of a major foundation remarked to me they the naacp must be pretty frightened to write something like that but if the aim of this attack on me was to frighten off further criticism the naacp has all but succeeded i doubt that another negro writer will soon write criticism of the naacp even though to a man they agree much more should be both written and said finally negro leadership with the exception of james farmer of core has about lapsed into moderation on the race issue the distinction between the militants and the moderates is now rather easy to define the militants hold that there should be demonstrations calculated to paralyze the economic and political structure of a town until that towns fathers give us the freedoms the courts have certified the moderates favor additional legal wrangling or at best token demonstrations and this is the very issue between the naacp national leadership and me dr morsell makes much of the fact that the naacp staged sitins years ago he couldnt be more right i say as much in my book what he doesnt explain is why they stopped staging them had the naacp kept the sitins going the student sitin of  and the freedom rides of  wouldnt have been necessary and even while dr morsell was castigating me by saying the naacp had a long history of direct action dr stephen gill spottswood national board president of the naacp was calling the student demonstrations signal flares and roy wilkins was predicting that the funds for such forays would soon dry up if one is schizoid he can probably be both peter and paul but ill be damned if he can be both christian and pagan and this with respect to direct action is precisely what naacp national leadership is trying to do at dead center of all this as i point out in my book is the burning need for negro leadership to meet at the summit and parcel out areas of action and responsibility core martin_luther_king and the student non violent coordinating committee are experienced mass demonstrators let them march into the streets and the market place and the rest of us should either march behind them or send them money to buy marching shoes and the first national negro leader who throws stoneshard or soft should be unfrocked the naacp legal defense and education fund is the nations top civil_rights law firm and it is ours it belongs to us jack greenbergs job is to get us out of jail and fight our case when we demonstrate for our rights let jack greenberg do it and the rest of us should give him a hand when it comes to raising the funds to carry on this being true why is it necessary for the naacp to maintain its own legal division although the naacp legal defense and education fund is a separate entity roy wilkins insists that it and the naacp are under the same umbrella fine but if true just what is robert carters job and why is attorney carter beating the bushes for money to increase his legal office to a  a year operation the naacp is without question one of the best of the lobbies its contacts with big white people in high places cannot be duplicated here is an important role after all the naacp does talk to the establishment and to be sure the establishment runs this republic there is enough prejudice to go around negroes dont have to squabble over the right to grapple with mean white people there are enough of them to keep all of us busy for the next twentyfive years what we must do is unify decide who will hit where and with what weapons this done the rest of us like good little indians should fall in line we are on our way no one desires to displace our present leaders we do ask that they lead us rather than follow white moderation come what may we are on our way if our leaders wont go then dont hinder us for we are on our waythank godto freedom land  
have negro ministers 
failed their roles 
by dr nathan hare
may come as a suri v prise to many persons r to see negro clergy men analyzed as if they were merely human beings past practice has been to let them hide behind a pious shield of infallibility which while protecting them from public rebuke shut out the advantages of kind and impartial appraisal it is no secret however that they are talked about like wenches by their membersbehind their backs in a manner which cannot help them because it is kept a secret from them my own decision to offer the clergy the charity of my frank and unexpurgated observations came only after my sympathy for them was aroused by the sorrowful manner in which they have begun to cry out in distress c eric lincoln for example a methodist minister and an expert on the black muslims in america has bemoaned the efficiency of malcolm_xs contingency for stealing protestant ministers and other religious bigwigs reporting that as many as  per cent of a typical muslim congregation is exchristian the rev james f campbell for another while pointing out that statistics show more churchgoers in america than ever before reports a drastic decline in negro attendance see what happened to the negros religion negro digest april  the rev mr campbell sadly conceded that todays negro would just as soon go bowling but he concluded that it is simply a hard thing to figure out and chastized negroes for their fleeting piety i submit that ministers err in blaming it all on backsliding converts and elijah muhammed and father divine and so although i am not prepared to serve as a diplomat between ministers and their members i should like to give them the benefit if i may of the humble insights to follow assuming that if they know the truth then the truth shall set them free the passing of the shepherdpastor to understand the trend of waning negro piety we must look for the answer first in the changing society as it affects negro churchlife there is for one thing the special extent to which the negro has experienced the sudden transition from the close intimate familiarity of farm folk to the cold impersonality of metropolitan life and what that has done to the relations between minister and member the close friendship of the oldtime pastor of farm and small town life tor example has not been generated by the amicable strangers now elected to pastorates on the basis of their divinity degrees and formal credentials whereas the  pastors life once bloomed side by side with his flocks both in and out of the church the cityward trek of the negro has brought him to the mass church and the sunday preacher who is seldom if ever seen closeup by the majority of his members this does not exclude the occasional postsermon handshake administered by him or one of his assistant pastors as members mechanically file from the church building this separation of minister and follower has made it ever less likely that the ends of the minister and those of the members will be of one accord quite frequently in fact the members find themselves pursuing salvation while their pastors pant after power and glory in general the shepherdpastor has been replaced by the administratorexecutive who even resents being called preacher and pompously demands the title minister thusly bent on officialdom he is consumed by a passion for presiding as an end in itself the passion for presiding the passion for presiding fed no doubt by a longing to master leads to an eternal turmoil of petty resentments a number of washington d c ministers recently were salty because a chicago minister rather than a local clergyman was chosen by the white chairman of an emancipation exercise to give the closing benediction similarly because the ministers chances of presiding are greater the higher his status they must constantly contend for position and official recognition this is due partly again to the factor of urbanization in the anonymity of the metropolis no longer is the ministers status wellknown and unchallenged throughout the community the resulting competition for renown impells him perennially to publicize his prestige in the struggle for conspicuous repute the consequences of this condition are now wellknown many persons have been appalled over and over again by the necessity for switching from the churchhouse to the courthouse and back again on the part of our major denominations in order to have disputes arising from power struggles among black men of the cloth settled by white judges thus although some still tell their flocks to take their troubles to the lord and leave them there they suggest by example that our troubles should be taken to the white power structure the reputation for this among negro baptist ministers whose policy appears to be to do unto others before they do unto you is even greater than that of our negro methodists when the baptist group flocked to kansas city for the  event the mayor met them with warm words of welcome saying in effect according to the chicago crusader welcomebut go home if you came here to raise hell well these spiritual leaders including some wellknown advocates of passive resistance and nonviolence proceeded to do just that at one point a coterie of clergymen stormed the pulpit in an effort to keep the claimant to the throne off the speakers platform this resulted in the death of an elderly pastor and parttime mortician from detroit who fell off the back of the platform with another minister on top of him yet this is becoming an annual ministerial pastime and it is getting so nobody is willing or able to predict what might happen when negro baptist preachers convene however the conventioners eventually grow tired or perplexed by the debating of roberts rules of order and general parliamentary procedure then nominate unanimously or reelect the entire slate of candidates by a standing vote anyway the devotion to squabbling in addition to the annual and semiannual exhibitions of ministerial efforts to outpower one another negro churchdom is burdened with a continuous circus of church splits walkouts court suits and demands for recounts and new elections right on down to the local pastorates with such models before them it is no wonder that members do likewise when former heavyweight contender hurricane jackson was fighting and singing in a new york baptist choir he was impelled to drop out long before leaving the prize ring because they squabbled too much for him the same thing was borne out by my own past experience as a choir member in oklahoma and virginia the devotion to squabbling pervades most business meetings where pastors purport to preside over the transacting of church politics and finance but generally wind up invading the business or private affairs of various members some such meetings end in a battle of the trustees as was recently reported in the press regarding a clash between the pastor and deacons of a church in wilmington delaware police called to the ruckus said they found the meeting in a state of bedlam and several trustees were hospitalized for broken noses and lacerated cheeks the preeminence of the collection plate the fact that money matters increasingly are at the root of pastormember relations is apparent in the tendency to measure the success of a given sunday by the size of the collection lifted estimates of the collection consume the bulk of the banner and bulletin board publicity and the necessity for squeezing the utmost from the congregations tightmouthed pocketbooks is the source of the solemn sequence of offertories many an inexperienced church goer has proudly and selfrighteously placed a large bill in the first offering only to be confronted by a multiplicity of subsequent trays for foreign missions home missions guest speakers the pastor and last but not least the eternal building fund the perpetual construction of elaborate church houses giving rise to the preeminence of the collection plate in church circles is perpetrated by ministers largely as monuments to their earthly esteem the quest for conspicuous repute also is the major motivation for the various days programs where ministers can play at messiahship and otherwise bask in superficial divinity there are to name a few appreciation days anniversaries silver and golden although greenbacks always reign supreme institutes womens day mens day sisters day deacons day may day and just about every other kind of day short of judgment day although they will get around to that eventually this also reflects the widespread flair for pomposity and the spectacle which leads many pastors to promote the bizarre at the expense of the beneficial thus as carter g woodson the late historian once wrote in his miseducation of the negro ministers dont come any more so much to feed the multitude as they come to fleece the flock this is not due however simply to the love of money as some persons believe but is one aspect of the quest for conspicuous renown i say this in spite of the fact that many do have a fetish for big fine cars church station wagons and tailormade suits which in turn are deadly attractive to fast fashionable women inside and outside the church tall in the pulpit accordingly it will be boasted say that the national baptist convention of the usa inc is one of the most powerful organizations in the world and its presidency referred to as a juicy plum in their local churches some pastors parade as little emperors even the control of nationally elected officials is so great the representation of as many as  colored christians at a given religious confab will pivot on the whims of the president when the largest conference on race relations ever held by religious groups of all racial derivations in america was scheduled for chicago in midjanuary of  the largest negro group was the only major group in the country which did not accept an invitation to send official participants the reason according to a reporter for the chicago defender the president himself a chicago resident and pastor misconstrued the invitation to request his personal participation rather than the groups the president went on to explain that his position as chairman of the american negro emancipation centennial authority would not allow him personally to take part although he might occasionally find time to drop in as a spectator the true reason probably derived from the fact that as some ministers complained not enough negroes were represented on the planning and steering committee and as platform speakers although the conference allegedly was an effort in the first place to get white ministers participating for a change in the negros quest for freedom in all fairness however it should be said that ministers frequently do adopt a shareandsharealike policy with reference to whatever superfluous power they may attain indeed they promiscuously bestow titular blessings and honor on secular individuals a leading baptist group in chicago was so impressed by millionaire s b fullers cosmetics talk on religion in business and business in religion that it licensed the businessman for the ministry but without full rights in that he can preach in the pulpit but cannot preside over baptisms sacraments and marriage vows but i do not myself expect a ministers license for the things i have said here on the same subject of politics and business in religion as i unlike fuller and a number of leading ministers am neither rich nor a politician predictably one of the most popular recipients of superfluous honor from negro pastors is the rich white individual whenever he will accept recently a citation was presented to republican governor rockefeller following a nonpolitical address by a baptist minister in brooklyn new york the governor was cited as baptist layman of the year and of course a collection was lifted for the multimillionaire white ruler it was said that the relatively penniless congregation really dug into its pockets to come up with a whopping offering since ministers have told them that to him who hath shall be given however the governor was politic or political enough to donate the money in turn to one of the churchs moneyraising projects politicking preachers others who suffer from a want of power instead of a superfluity grope for recognition outside the confines of the congregation proper indeed beyond the boundaries of churchdom some however such as adam clayton powell and chicagos archibald carey reign supreme in both spheres but most are doomed to political dawdling and thus their political escapades less frequently come to light other ministers have been known to use their special position in the negros struggle due to their freedom from white economic pressure and the traditional white preference for their brand of rebellion and their access to a more or  less permanent multitude of readymade followers to appease the passion for presiding and the search for publicity some fellow ministers even chastized a chicago batch who left the most segregated city in the world residentially according to a population research center study and flew south to fight segregation in albany georgia when that now forsaken but unintegrated city was the focus of national news coverage one group went on a much publicized missionary tour to russia since a number of africans have said they didnt want negro missionaries who have no blessings in their own country and presently a squad of ministers are crusading in jamaica much of the stamina spent hopping about from spot to spot on distant fronts might well be exerted in their own backyards at the last national baptist convention impressively generous plans were made to purchase   acres in liberia to help liberian farmers get on their feet but only  acres were purchased at home in highly publicized fayette county tennessee although it doesnt take newspaper headlines to point up needy negroes nary an acre was bought in the big city northern slums where droves of negroes unlike liberians are not only off their feet but actually are down on their haunches at the doorsteps of some of the most elaborate church houses in the country stiffcollar life likewise negro religious leaders have failed to help their followers tackle the problem of crime and immorality to any significant degree while strategically adopting the white policy of deriding what progress black muslims are making in that area to appease their guilty consciences they sniggle snobbishly that muslims contain all them exconvicts in defending their egos and sustaining their semblance of prestige via mechanisms of snobbishness and seclusion they shut out the very persons they are dutybound to save many ministers even draw back from the application of tight standards of morality to their own behavior they derogatorily label such norms as stiffcollar and resent with indignation any efforts to regulate the participation of themselves and their wives in excessive pleasure of a worldly nature some even laud the practice of appearing a bit mundane as modern and may even gain celebration as the swinging minister as in the case of a leading brooklyn pastor resting on peace others make use of a repertoire of showingoff behavior based mainly on lung power the chief power of a minister and related talents for oratory and the impromptu production of oral poetry but in spite of the fact that such ministers spend the balance of their time flying about the country delivering addresses they curiously get the lockjaw when it comes to speaking out against such rampart evils as the collective murder of modern war like their white counterparts they readily don uniforms and while safely out of range of actual combat assume the role of chaplains using their special contact with the divine to sanctify the killing done by young men they once taught never to kill it is not unusual moreover to read in a pastors biographical sketch printed at every turn in some weekly newspaper a longwinded account of all the theaters of war in which he has seen battle how strange that the battlefield is called a theater when most of the acting takes place during peace time certainly it is curious that the majority of negro ministers who so eloquently expound the philosophy of nonviolence have not breathed a word of warning to a single modern nationlet alone our ownregarding the folly and immorality of nuclear war they fall back along with white ministers on the consolation that god is on our side but nobody would have the gall to suggest that they are on gods side this sidling up to the lawd for reprieve from mass devilment is merely a quest for refuge from their early failure lipservant piety and copycat christianity increasingly it seems to me if negro ministers are to survive the competition with negro muslims and other temptations pulling members away from the church house they will find it necessary to rise above their role as lipservant experts for white contributions to morality so far they have failed to add to the wisdom of ancient biblical characters such as moses solomon and job resting content to parrot the conventional insights of leading white theologians this point recently was confirmed by the inadvertent testimony of rev e franklin jackson president of the washington branch of the naacp after a speech delivered by congressman adam clayton powell at a rally honoring the editor of the washington afroamerican the rev dr jackson rose to lift the offering and said to the sprinkling of whites present in the negro crowd we negroes have added just two things to religionthe spirituals and the practice of walking to the collection table the rest we borrowed from you instead of stressing those aspects of the christian religion most appropriate to the demands of the negros condition such as a policy of good deeds and sustained endeavor for selfuplift based on the admonition that everybody is responsible for his own salvation and that god helps those who help themselves ministers as a group have naively or selfishly played up poetic dictums rationalizing the negros lot and soothing his psy chological injuries such as it is better to give than to receive and the meek shall one day inherit the earthapparently by simply remaining meek and doing nothing to warrant the prize many devote the bulk of their sermons to tirades on the sinfulness of their flocks extinguishing what little selfrespect they may have had some ministers even echo the petty ethnic prejudices of white religious bodies one leading minister remarked publicly that he would rather see his daughter dead than married to a catholic he succeeded in breaking up an impending wedding of his daughter and a catholic a former white professor of mine at the university of chicago and now president of the american sociological association everett c hughes who like myself was the son of a baptist minister used to make the point that white christians have been the greatest carriers of racial prejudice for example that the world has ever known they rationalized and justified slavery for centuries and have participated in all of the major wars of modern times not to mention the holy hell of the holy crusades they failed to take the lead in the current struggle for equality of opportunity and have lagged behind the courts the schools and other secular institutions they trailed the european explorers into africa hawaii and wherever else the explorers led them they would follow now enlightened africans are saying that once we had the land and the white missionaries came and brought us the bible now we have the bible and they have the land thus while most of the current crop of negro ministers are pathological imitators of white clergymen the new negro minister must break away from such mere copycat behavior he must disdain the lure of ritualism adopted for the mere purpose of appearing proper and saintly or to gain a superficial sense of getting something done he must replace the huffing and puffing of the present breed of orators with strong deeds and sustained action based on a sound program of uplift and morality in all of these things he must resist the impulse to seek personal glory at the expense of a trusting flock this is not all of it there are other points one could make and many examples to support those already presented just as there are exceptions to many of them but these exceptions as in everything else are no refutation of the general condition on the other hand whatever exceptions may exist are the only salvation of the negro church which they can save if they are willing to suffer for the bad and if they can persuade those who have deflected from their calling to erase past missteps and set out again resolved to withstand the temptations of present and

 it helps if you are a negro but this is not an absolutely essential requirement congressman adam clayton powell has spoken at some length on this topic therefore i shall not bore you with a needless reiteration of who runs your negro organizations  in your quest to become a negro leader remember this others before you have overcome the handicap of not having been athletes or popular entertainers if you cant hit the curve ball or a high c dont fret there are other ways of getting to the top of the heap  an invaluable aid to becoming a negro leader is an address outside the negro community this will give you a more objective view of those whom you will represent it also helps if your children do not attend the same public school as other negro children this too will lend a certain cool dispassion to your pronouncements on de facto school segregation and the pace at which it should be cured  get mentioned in the new york times preferably denouncing malcolm_x or adam clayton powell remember one mention in the times is equal to two mentions in the new york post or four mentions in jet how often you get mentioned in the daily press will depend to a large extent upon how often their editors need someone to deplore bellicose statements by irresponsible negro militants you cannot so to speak carry the ball you must wait for the white press to dribble it to you  one of the best ways to become a negro leader is to get yourself photographed with prominent white people even if you can cadge an invitation to the white house getting photographed there has its disadvantages you are likely to get lost in the mob of other negro aspirants clustered around its distinguished occupants the best way to get yourself photographed with a prominent white person is to give him an award for meritorious service in the fight for negro equality this can be rather risky though since there is always a chance that someone in your audience may recognize the honoree as a landlord who doesnt rent to negroes or an industrialist who confines his employment of negroes if at all to the janitorial level do not be discouraged the experience will be good practice for your role as negro leader you will learn how to combat such sharpeyed troublemakers you will learn or your career will perish  as a negro leader you should be willing even eager to speak outagainst other negroes for instance when the white daily in your town calls up to get your comments on malcolm_xs call for civil insurrection you will not say id like to see some evidence of that statement before making any comment such nitpicking will immediately brand you as a possible supporter of extremist elements the correct reply to such a query would be violence is not the answer this will be a good phrase too to appease animallovers who may object when a negro participating in a mississippi voter registration drive cuffs a police dog who is about to fang him in the jugular vein remember you cannot go wrong with a statesmanlike violence is not the answer it will show where you stand on bloodletting  another handy word is deplore like allpurpose new crisco the verb to deplore can be used to fry all sorts of things for example you can deplore racism of all kinds or you can deplore the appointment of public figures negro on the basis of race etc etc  this brings us to stock phrases keep a good supply at hand remember stock phrases are an indispensable part of the rhetorical equipment of all leaders black or white use them liberally example never before in history has a people made such great strides     in baseball the switchhitter has a decided advantage over the batter who swings from only one side of the plate in negro leadership you will be a leg up if you can talk out of both sides of your mouth at the same time remember there are more important things in this world than consistency you do not have to tell white audiences the same thing you tell negro audiences our negro youth is not preparing itself for the wonderful opportunities ahead goes over big with white listeners negro listeners on the other hand might get hacked especially if they have been preparing for the future by stocking up on application blanks for unemployment insurance  in pursuing your goal to become a negro leader you may want to employ the researchstudy bit remember there is a vast difference between stating an obvious fact and researching an obvious fact remember too that research grants to study obvious facts can help the unemployment situation by providing jobs for deserving social workers  lastly as a responsible negro leader it is encumbent upon you to let white people know we do not hate them make them feel loved a word of caution you do not have to go to such extremes as marrying one of their daughters merely to prove your point just tell them theyll be happy to take your word for it now you are on your own go out and seek your rightful place in the cosmos of the black establishment good luck and bon appetit 
as we read the letter
by eddie b ellis jr
would be interesting to note the re£ action of the young people in and around the negro community to the open letter that jackie robinson recently wrote to representative adam clayton powell jr jackie robinson to most of us is the symbol of the negros struggle to achieve equal rights there is no young adult in the negro world who doesnt know the jackie robinson story there are no young people in the negro community who dont hold jackie robinson in the highest esteem for we all know that this courageous man fought the cruel injustices of an ignorant society everyone knows that baseball is supposed to be the national game of the united states yet until jackie robinson the negro population onetenth of the total american public was not represented in this game we all know how branch rickey vice president of the then brooklyn dodgers dared to defy the narrowminded and the bigots to allow jackie robinson to play organized major league base ball and we all know that willie mays maury wills elston howard and all the other negro major league stars are the end result of jackie robinsons courage on the other hand we have adam clayton powell jr the son of adam clayton powell sr who was one of the pioneers in the fight for civil_rights here we have a man who as an individual has done almost singlehandedly the most to help the cause of equal rights that the negro is seeking in adam powell jr we have the single most powerful negro politician in america today in the minds of the young adults of our country the name of adam clayton powell may not be stamped as indelibly as that of jackie robinson but i am sure that it is there and it is well respected many of us who were either too young to understand or who never really took the time to learn about adam powell will surely remember our mothers and fathers speaking of him in almost reverent terms as the minister of the abyssinia baptist church in harlem we remember our parents talking of the wonderful way in which he inspired the negro people from his pulpit and gave them a sense of pride and belonging we remember hearing of how he got many negroes jobs when jobs were hard to get even for whites we remember hearing of the bread and soup lines at abyssinia baptist church feeding those who didnt have jobs and  barely if any means of support and we remember how he took his fight to congress constantly we are reminded that adam powell has always been our champion and has always placed the welfare of the negro ahead of everything else and we all look up to him and respect him tremendously even though adam powell was at his best just a little before most of us reached the age of reason we have been reminded so relentlessly of all the good he has done that we regard him with the greatest admiration now we are faced with a problem the man we all know about has suddenly lashed out and with good reason at the man we have all heard about and we all wonder just what will come of it although we were told that in context adam powell is the negroes negro the fighters fighter the congressmens congressman in our time adam powell hasnt been the fighting congressman we all have heard so much about in recent years we have read so much about his absentee record and of his delinquency to his congressional duties yet because we hold adam powell on a pedestal we never questioned his motives and we saw his results and they were good hand in hand with organizations like core sclc and the naacp adam powell has been fighting bigotry and bias in america and we believe that adam powell is still our champion the national association for the advancement of colored people has long been associated with equal rights civil liberties and all the ingredients that go with the baking of an equal citizenship cake we have heard from our parents and we have seen for ourselves the work of the naacp the single most important organization in bringing about many of the civil liberties we now have and because of our ages we tend to take for granted we have been told by our parents that they didnt enjoy many of the freedoms that we scoff at lightly today and again we are confronted with a problem we hear adam powell criticize the naacp and ask for negro support in boycotting this wonderful organization in addition we hear and read jackie robinson criticizing adam powell and we are more confused than ever we all wish that adam powell would reevaluate his high office and the responsibility he has to the negro people and act accordingly we would like to be able to tell our children as our parents told us of the civil_rights fighter who by that time if he takes stock of himself and mends some of his ways will be a legend we would also like to be able to tell our children of the organization that helped our parents helped us and will help them to achieve all of those freedoms that were promised us in the constitution and bill of rights last but not least we would like to be able to tell our children of jackie robinson the great baseball player the courageous fighter the great american who helped bring it all about by simply writing an open letter to a friend  
the case of the athletic patsies
by a s doc young
he plan was neatly set the instructions were g few and simple  reward was ample a brandnew sleek and expensive automobile plus expenses and other gratuities all the sports star had to do was alight from this airplane in this major city walk a few feet across the airport and shake hands with this waiting republican candidate while flash bulbs flashed and movie cameras made motion pictures but believe it or not the star athlete goofed it all up he shook hands with the wrong man not because he was in any way a stupid personfar from itbut simply because he didnt know the republican candidate he was supposed to shill for this is but one odd incident from a running ageold saga which might well be entitled the case of the athletic patsies over the years as dozens of powerhungry political candidates underestimated the intelligence of negro voters dozens of americas greatest negro athletes have been lured into their nets with promises of green dollars and the athletes often believing that they are putting over a fast one have played the strange role of momentary campaigners the allstar roster of sometimepoliticians include joe louis sugar ray robinson jackie robinson jesse owens willie mays mai whitfield andmany of his critics sayernie banks the chicago cubs infielder banks it should be noted differs from the others in an allimportant aspect which will be explained shortly yet when his chicago aldermanic candidacy was announced by republican leaders last winter more than a few veteran observers sighed well    here we go again there is of course no reason why athletes shouldnt enter politics nearly everyone else does as one writer said in retort to banks critics why shouldnt he run for city council he might be right at home some of those guys have been playing ball for years ralph metcalfe the extrack ace is one athlete who has made the transition successfully a chicago alderman or city councilman for several years metcalfe one of congressman william dawsons beneficiaries ran for of fice under his own name and won similarly banks entered the aldermanic race under his own colors as did archie moore when he campaigned for a lameduck post in southern california as did monte irvin in new jersey a few years ago as did former ohio state university and chicago bears gridder bobby watkins in chicago more recently these then are not the athletic patsies of which we speak the athletic patsy per se is employed by politicians on much the same basis as cigarette manufacturers utilize the testimonial advertisement with this exception the athletic patsy doesnt necessarily smoke his candidate nor does he necessarily vote the cold calculated theory is that since negro voters idolize the athlete they will accept his advice on voting for candidates ranging downward from united states president the athlete pockets a few bucks his ego expands at the touch of a warm handshake with the candidate the publicity is gratifying but once the campaign is over win lose or drawthe athletic patsy is seldom if ever appointed to an important position nor is he consulted on such issues as civil_rights or real estate taxes he is instead a discarded tool mai whitfield the olympian was more fortunate than most athletic patsies which he freely admits he was mai was appointed to a southern california post that paid  for oncemonthly meetings only recently have the top echelon of discerning politicians begun to realize that negroes dont seek advice nor votingbooth instructions at ball games what the average star athlete has to say about a political candidate means next to nothing when negroes enter the polls when the lucid highlyintelligent olympian jesse owens supported alf landon for president back in  he joined a losing republican squad which suffered a worse trouncing than sonny liston administered to floyd patterson last september  when joe louis went on television to question the wisdom of presidential candidate john f kennedys nowfamous telephone call to mrs martin_luther_king to inquire about her imprisoned husband few if any negro voters were swung over to richard nixon not once but twice jackie robinson the hall of fame baseball star went to bat for nixon and did something uncommon for him struck out both times in  jackie plugged nixon for the united states presidency last year he supported nixon in the california governors race following jackies second political pinchhitting job for the loser a california writer observed negroes out here dont care if jackie robinson never returns to the west coast jackie a newspaper columnist who bats out cryptic retorts to his  critics once explained his choice of nixon over kennedy by saying that when they met nixon looked him straight in the eye while kennedy apparently permitted his gaze to wander in the sports world this may be a legitimate test of guts soul or heart but as most experts will attest the steady gaze does not necessarily prove the truth of politicians when jackie supported nixon he exercised his constitutional rights he was free to support either nixon or kennedy the great tragedy was that jackie surely qualified by experience training and mental capacity to operate in the political firmament illadvisedly backed a loser had he been on the winning team in  it is quite probable that he would be stirring up positive constructive action on the national scene today but the suspicion is that jackie didnt weigh heavily enough the fact that he was courted by politicians not because he was jackie robinson american but because he was jackie robinson internationallyknown athlete jackies services were courted and welcomed mostly because the politicians gambled that negroes who idolized him as a player would become properly starryeyed at the polls whether or not sugar ray robinson ever harbored serious political ambitions is not known but when vincent impelliteri was mayor of new york sugar ray was a handy ally to have around his harlem cafe was a gathering place for the political elite the mayor was so enamored of sugar ray that he was among the first to offer robinson consolation inside his dressing room the night he lost a bout to extreme heat and joey maxim not even sugar rays unconscious spewing of hot profanity on the mayorsugar ray was out of his mindcould break the strong bond of political friendship but now that sugar ray though probably wiser than ever before is no longer a fistic great his political stock is valued only slightly higher than that of billie sol estes enterprises aside from the fact that most athletes dont seem to realize as they reach for the easycome green dollars that negro voters do not now nor have they ever looked to them for political advice the same as they dont seek such advice in many other professional areas the athletes appear to be totally unaware of the fact that they are when asked to support a candidate momentarily merely being used as tools if the negro athlete were involving only himself no one would raise a howl but the fact is that the athlete himself the beneficiary of racial militant action sells out his own people and beggars his hardearned popularity when he shills for a politician whom he merely knows casually whose real beliefs opinions and practices he knows not mai whitfield by his own admission has yet to recover from his disillusioning experience as a sometimepolitician condensed from several thousand words this is mais story he was asked to support a candidate he was leary of politics from the beginning but militant friends of his assured him that he could help them do some good mai was encouraged as he heard these friends make excellent suggestions to the party superiors but as election time neared he realized that not one of these excellent suggestions were encompassed by the partys platform mai became ill later when as inaugural ball invitations were being passed around he and his militant friends were left emptyhanded what money id made was all gone before election time mai has confessed my friends got exactly nowhere with their proposals as usual the handkerchief heads got the gravyinvitations to the inaugural ball being most of it plus one or two meaningless appointments i decided to get the hell out of politics the ernie banks political story broke in chicagos daily newspapers like a big bomb of surprise at the time ernie was vacationing in california the announcement stirred up a giantsized hornets nest in a ward already buzzing busily with political activity political writers had to query ernie by longdistance telephone to ask if the report of his candidacy was true when hed decided to run what his platform was many political observers questioned the possibility of ernies properly serving his constituency if elected while contracted to spend much of his time out of chicago playing baseball ernie said he could manage it and cited as an example a canadian athlete whom he said combined sports and politics ernie candidly admitted that he knew little about practical politics but said hed like it especially if i can work with youth what did cubs owner phil wrigley think of his candidacy mr wrigley approved said banks hell probably vote for me quickwitted observers noted wrigley couldnt vote for banks they didnt live in the same ward while replying to another question as to his ability to function as a baseball star and politician banks said hed bridge the gap with a good office staff what was his platform banks said he hadnt constructed onehe would he said lay his platform after hed consulted his constituents when the official party organization met overwhelming refusal to back banks candidacy was voted someone claimed that banks had failed to vote in the most recent election but banks had his supporters too  why shouldnt he run a beautician asked heatedly during a discussion of his candidacy hes as good as anyone else a popular newspaper columnist agreed substantially pointing out that banks was and is one of americas bestloved celebrities despite the hotglare of controversy and the longshot possibility of victory banks vowed that hed go on and fight the political fight but after the official party turned him down he was quoted as saying they sure strike you out fast up here said a man wise in race and politics theres nothing wrong with ernie banks running for city council except his timing i think hes being used by republicans who want to capitalize on his popularity they dont expect to win anywayso they dont get hurt if banks strikes out if ernie wanted to enter politics he should have waited until he was through with baseball and able to devote full time to public office too many important things come up in council meetings for our ward to be represented by a parttimer on the credit side this much could be said unlike the ageold athletic patsies banks was at least running for office not shilling for a stranger he was in a sense as was bobby watkins blazing a trail for modern stars and with a record of solid sports citizenry behind him he very well may have been paving a political success road for the future he was in case of failure using no ones face but his own to fall on banks candidacy reflected finally another credit factor modern negro athletes are slowly but surely branching out into areas of community responsibility often neglected by their counterparts of the past better educated than their predecessors they have a finer grasp of the intricacies of life they know better how to capitalize on their popularity there is no gainsaying the fact that any serious knowledgeable athlete who enters politics has a plusfactor ie his broad acceptance as launching power and the field of current sports encompasses many athletes who might very well become outstanding political leaders among them are ollie matson professional football star bill white professional baseball star walt dukes professional basketball star stan sanders rhodes scholar from whittier cal college rafer johnson exdecathlon great these and other politicallyminded negro athletes need not suffer the disillusioning experiences of the athletic patsies and they may take inspiration from this fact ralphe bunche was a basketball player  
the original musketeer 
lions of readers
 t yif and theatergoers
£ vj ii  throughout the world
g  have thrilled to the
¦sz»rt dumas writingsfor
example the three musketeers
and the count of monte cristo of
alexandre dumas the father and
camille of alexandre dumas the
son
now we are reminded
by a book
on napoleons exploits
in egypt that
dumas the father
himself had a father
who was a most remarkable
manas
remarkable in his
way as his son or
any of the characters
created by that novelist
this founder of
the dumas dynasty
was half french half
negro and all hero
he seems to have
been as strong and
brave a soldier as
history records
in battle there
was a recklessness
about him that was
almost legendary
he was entirely devoid
of fear he possessed the
divine simplicity of the negroso
related the biographer herbert
gorman of the first dumas one of
napoleons generals
general dumas father was a
french nobleman and retired colonel
of artillery marquis alexandreantoine
davy de la pailleterie in
 he left france and acquired a
plantation in the eastern part of
santo domingo now the dominican
republic on march 
 he became the father of a
son whom he named thomasalexandre
the mother was a negro
slave cesette
dumas she died
when the boy was

the marquis later
decided to return to
paris and took with
him his son then 
such was the custom
of french noblemen
with their colored
sons the daughters
were left behind
thomas  alexandre
grew into an astonishingly
powerful
and attractive youth
he enjoyed the company
of many parisian
ladies he was a
friendly and kind
hearted young fellow
but his temper
was easily aroused
when a man insulted
him in a theater box
thomasalexandre simply pitched
him out on the floor challenged to
a duel he quickly killed his adversary
because he was an expert with
the sword and other weapons
four years after his return to paris the yearold marquis who was becoming stingy and eccentric married his housekeeper rebuffed by his stepmother and denied funds by his father the young man told them that he was enlisting in the armyas a private i am a nobleman and a colonel the marquis exclaimed angrily you will not degrade my name to a privates rank then i will take my mothers name he retorted and as thomasalexandre dumas he joined a regiment of dragoons soon his feats of strength made him the idol of the outfit he was the only dragoon who by taking hold of one of the beams of the stable roof could hoist himself and his horse off the ground andre maurois records none of his comrades in arms could equal his feat of thrusting four weapons at the full extent of his arm in the summer of  the french revolution was blazing fiercely and there were threats of peasant insurrection and looting at villierscotterets a town north of paris dumas regiment was sent there to preserve order and the townspeople turned out to welcome them marielouise labouret the daughter of a leading citizen noticed the handsome soldier and persuaded her father to select him when the residents were told to billet the troops the young people soon decided to wed and asked m labourets permission he told dumas you may marry my daughter when you are promoted to corporal within a few months the french armies were battling on several frontiers and dumas who eagerly supported the revolution was quickly raised to corporal lieutenant captain lieutenant colonel and at the age of  to generaljust a week before his first child a daughter was born dumas experienced heavy combat in the pyrenees the low countries and in the alps one of his many feats was the single handed capture of a group of cavalrymen in the alps he led his troops up a steep slope by the use of climbing irons at the top was a palisade which the men could not surmount so he grasped them one after another by the seats of their pants and flung them over the wall into the ranks of the terrified enemy after alpine service dumas at  was placed under the command of gen napoleon bonaparte aged  for an italian campaign dumas performed prodigies of valor he captured six standards from a detachment larger than his from a spy he drew information that exposed austrian plans he routed a large army with a small one alone he held the end of a narrow bridge against a whole squadron these stories maurois insists are absolutely true a fellow general thibault called dumas the bravest strongest and most active man i have ever known his reputation in the army was extraordinary his many deeds of chivalrous daring and the athletic skill were quoted far and wide off the battlefield dumas was the kindest and friendliest of men he detested the grisly operations of the guillotine and once ordered such a machine to be chopped down and used as firewood for his men for this he was called m le humanite but in combat his enemies called him the black devil when bonaparte was assigned by the government to undertake his ill fated invasion of egypt in  he immediately asked for and received the services of dumas in egypt as everywhere dumas was his courageous ceaselessly active selfhis leadership of cavalry charges threw the natives into a panic he quelled a revolt in cairo was the first man to enter the great mosque and sent a fortune to his commander with these words the value of this treasure is close to two million francs should i be killed remember that i am a poor man with a wife and child in france  nevertheless relations between napoleon and dumas became strained the latter shrewdly perceived that the corsican was working only for his own glorification and that the egyptian adventure was headed for disaster dumas asked leave to return to france and his commander granted it but never forgot or forgave such desertion dumas chartered a small ship whose captain promised to land him in france but it was an unseaworthy craft and when caught in a storm it had to take refuge in a port of the kingdom of naples this region ruled by the bourbons was violently opposed to revolutionary france and dumas was imprisoned in the castle of brindisi for two years during his detention his food was systematically poisoned so that he lost his hearing and the sight of one eye he was partly paralyzed and a cancer of the stomach developed when in the spring of his th yearhe was exchanged for an austrian general his once magnificent health was shattered he was destitute when he rejoined his wife and daughter and the labourets bonaparte by that time was the allpowerful first consul to him dumas sent this letter you are aware of the misfortunes which have come upon me you are aware of the state of my purse you remember the treasure of cairo    but i have other cause for griefi have been placed with other generals on the unemployed list    bonaparte with typical cynicism did not reply gen dumas could not possibly be of further use to him the generals second child alexandre dumas was born july   his skin was white his eyes were blue only the hair denoted his african extraction because mme dumas parents had means and were fond of their venturesome soninlaw the general lived in comfort in the country he and his little son were devotedly attached and the famous author of the future never lost his memories and admiration for his mighty sire when gen dumas was  he was granted a boonpermission to hunt in the neighboring forests which now were napoleons imperial property he mounted horse for an outing but felt such pain that he was obliged to return and take to his bed he died that night that was the generalaction and adventure from the beginning to the end he was indeed the man fitted to sire the creator of dartangnan dantes and so many other heroes of war and romance 
charles white artist
by hoyt w fuller
the work of charles white has such simple directand profoundly poeticpower that it is astonishing he is not world famous well perhaps not so astonishing after all the artist is a negro characterized by great pride and integrity and his subject matter is almost invariably his own race i suppose i am trying to say something about negro people the slender softspoken artist explains negroes have been my primary theme for  yearstheir beauty their feelings their aspirations there is no question that his message comes vividly through all the negro heartache and heartbreak and terror and suffering together with the indomitable spirit cry out from his work long before soul became a concept around which raceproud negroes could rally charles white was portraying it through his art for nearly six years now he has been living in altadena a los angeles suburb with a climate white terms ideally conducive to creative work his studio is a converted garage adjacent to his home and adjoining a large yard and patio but prior to moving to california he lived  years on the east coast primarily in new york he admits that too much of his time in manhattan was spent in active involvemoonlighting from his regular work white designs an naacp recruitment poster fighting racial discrimination once consumed on unequal share of the artists time a striking figure mayibuye afrika is one of the original works purchased by playwright lorraine hansberry it is also available in reproduction ment with organizations at the expense of time at the drawing board but all that is behind him now while in new york he secured a good agent who still handles his work and spent a year at howard university as artistinresidence he also spent a year traveling through and over two years as a of mexico before settling down in altadena the foreign travel he now recalls as a great experieurope resident ence most of whites work is in black and white ink drawings prints woodcuts and lithography i work very slowly he says the older i get the more selfcritical i become he produces only about four or five paintings a year about eight years ago reproductions of a group of his drawings were massproduced and sold through art outlets in los angeles chicago and new york apparently none of them are available now although the prints represented some of his most moving work currently a new set of  reproductions are on sale at selected outlets across the country and they too are very much in demand white now  has been earning a living from his work since he was  and was drawing and painting years before that he was born in chicago and it was in that city that his work first gained attention like so many chicago artists he studied at the art institute he also was an easel and mural painter and teacher with the federal art projects administration from  to  when he was drafted into the u s army later he studied at the art students league of new york and at the taller de grafica in mexico city his instructors included such noted painters as harry sternberg george neal edward millman alfredo zalce and briggs dyer over the years whites work has found its way into museums all over the world from moscow to brazil and even the library of congress a pennell fund purchase at least five negro universities have samples of his work as have the national academy of arts and letters and the american federation of arts the list of awards and fellowships white received between  and  included the john hay whitney fellowship the art institute of chicago scholarship two julius rosenwald fellowships and a grant from the national institute of arts and letters over the years his work has been exhibited in major galleries from san franciscos museum of art to manhattans metropolitan museum of art and in leading museums in leip sig germany and mexico city he painted murals at tuskegee institute hampton institute and the chicago public library white is listed in whos who in american art he is a member of artists equity association the german academy of art and the national association of artists and his work can be seen in galleries on both coaststhe aca gallery in new york and the heritage gallery in los angeles occasionally white accepts commissions to do commercial work and he recently designed covers for leontyne price record albums for rcavictor he was special graphic designer for the movie anna lucasta with sammy davis jr and eartha kitt released in  by united artists he currently is designing a book on the late george washington carver for the field enterprises in chicago for many years whites work seemed to interest europeans more than americans and even those americans who admired and purchased his work were primarily white in recent years however an increasing number of negroes have been drawn to his drawings and lithos and such wellknown names as harry belafonte who owns  white pieces sidney poitier roland hayes paul robeson eartha kitt and nat king cole have collections of his work this is most gratifying white says i am extremely happy that negroes are now interested in their own subjects in art a highly disciplined worker white rarely leaves his home and studio for long periods anymore and his schedule is as regular as if he were punching a clock this fall exhibitions of his work have been arranged for several european cities and a show is set for occidental college in the winter but there is no certainty that the artist will be on hand for the openings his satisfaction comes from creating it is a glorious experience being an artist he says to seek the meaning of truth reality beauty in short to meet the challenge of life through ones sensitivities for me art is a very personal intimate communicative affair he pauses reflects then goes on to the point i look to the life of my people as the fountainhead of challenging themes and monumental concepts i strive to create an image that all mankind can personally relate to and see his dreams and ideals mirrored with hope and dignity and one has only to see charles whites work to know how well he has succeeded 
i have nothing against white people
by mary dickerson bangham
have nothing against i white people so long  as they stay in their place but when one of them says negroes should be shipped back to africa he has overstepped what would our country do without negroes in the sports world or in the entertainment world or in the shoeshining and windowwashing worlds what would the armed services do without negroes to fight for liberty and to uphold our democratic way of life why if negroes were shipped back to africa the white men would just have to go haul them back like they did in the first place besides if negroes should be shipped back to africa shouldnt whities be shipped back to where they came from geography sharks figurative sharks could help rout out and send those whose ancestors followed on columbus shipborne heels back to italy and spain those whose ancestors were on the mayflower passenger list to holland and england miscellaneous descendants to miscellaneous ports leaving america to the reds red indians that is this would solve the race problem in case enough ships were not available a few yellow people might be flown in from asia the red men let off the reservations and temporary relief found through this change in the balance of color population explosions might necessitate frequent rebalancing  some whities say negroes have mental capacities differing from theirs to be sure not many white people have brains like george washington carvers or booker t washingtons or james weldon johnsons or marian andersons or ralph bunches or howard thurmans better end the list before some reader sees red and labels the writer a red writer is a whitie who claims the right to  write while imagining herself some other hue    many whities say negroes are shiftless this shifts the subject into an area where there are no restrictions it might be good for southerners who want college degrees to spend one academic year in the north where theyd learn that negroid coloring does not rub off and diplomabent northerners to spend an academic year in the south where they would learn that blacks can outnumber whitesnot on campuses of course but in certain land areas this involves problems for advanced math students some wag suggested that race problems might be solved by studying the new testament a harmless suggestion since it has not yet been banned as subversive literature however there are spots alien to our modern culture which require interpreters the fact that the entire bible appears in plain black and white causes some confusion confusion compounded by many new testaments being published with the words of jesus in red a new color scheme will surely be devised soon having a commondenominator rib adam and eve doubtless belonged to the same race but which one bible writers evidently considered it unimportant to explain humanitys variegations    couldnt god have made us of one color say green since we all act pretty green at times or blue since everybody gets blue once in a while or yellow for who hasnt a yellow streak or two different colors look pretty when mixed up in the landscape prettier than monotones maybe god looks at it that way but what im really thinking about now is that ive nothing against the human race so long as it stays in its place

wo ideas puzzled me v deeply as a child grow ing up in brooklyn during the s in what today would be called an integrated neighborhood one of them was that all jews were rich the other was that all negroes were persecuted these ideas had appeared in print therefore they must be true my own experience and the evidence of my senses told me they were not true but that only confirmed what a daydreaming boy in the provincesfor the lowerclass neighborhoods of new york belong as surely to the provinces as any rural town in north dakotadiscovers very early his experience is unreal and the evidance of his senses is not to be trusted yet even a boy with a head full of fantasies incongruously synthesized out of hollywood movies and english novels cannot altogether deny the reality of his own experienceespecially when there is so much deprivation in that experience nor can he altogether gainsay the evidence of his own sensesespecially such evidence of the senses as comes from being repeatedly beaten up robbed and in general hated terrorized and humiliated and so for a long time i was puzzled to think that jews were supposed to be rich when the only jews i knew were poor and that negroes were supposed to be persecuted when it was the negroes who were doing the only persecuting i knew aboutand doing it moreover to me during the early years of the war when my older sister joined a leftwing youth organization i remember my astonishment at hearing her passionately denounce my father for thinking that jews were worse off than negroes to me at the age of twelve it seemed very clear that negroes were better off than jewsindeed than allwhites a city boys world is contained within three or four  square blocks and in my world it was the whites the italians and jews who feared the negroes not the other way around the negroes were tougher than we were more ruthless and on the whole they were better athletes what could it mean then to say that they were badly off and that we were more fortunate yet my sisters opinions like print were sacred and when she told me about exploitation and economic forces i believed her but i was still afraid of negroes and i still hated them with all my heart it had not always been sothat much i can recall from early childhood when did it start this fear and this hatred there was a kindergarten in the local public school and given the character of the neighborhood at least half of the children in my class must have been negroes yet i have no memory of being aware of color differences at that age and i know from observing my own children that they attribute no significance to such differences even when they begin noticing them i think there was a dayfirst grade second grade when my best friend carl hit me on the way home from school and announced that he wouldnt play with me any more because i had killed jesus when i ran home to my mother crying for an explanation she told me not to pay any attention to such foolishness and then in yiddish she cursed the goyim and the schwartzes the schwartzes and the goyim carl it turned out was a schwartze and so was added a third to the categories into which people were mysteriously divided sometimes i wonder whether this is a true memory at all it is blazingly vivid but perhaps it never happened can anyone really remember back to the age of six there is no uncertainty in my mind however that the years that followed carl and i hardly ever spoke though we met in school every day up through the eighth or ninth grade there would be embarrassed moments of catching his eye or of his catching minefor whatever it was that had attracted us to one another as very small children remained alive in spite of the fantastic barrier of hostility that had grown up between us suddenly and out of nowhere nevertheless friendship would have been impossible and even if it had been possible it would have been unthinkable about that there was nothing anyone could do by the time we were eight years old item the orphanage across the street is torn down a city housing project begins to rise in its place and on the marvelous vacant lot next to the old orphanage they are building a playground much excitement and anticipation as opening day draws near mayor laguardia himself comes to dedicate this great gesture of public benevolence he speaks of neighborliness and borrowing cups of sugar and of the playground he says that children of all races colors and creeds will learn to live together in harmony a week later some of us are swatting flies on the playgrounds inadequate little ball field a gang of negro kids pretty much our own age enter from the other side and order us out of the park we refuse proudly and indignantly with superb masculine fervor there is a fight they win and we retreat half whimpering half with bravado my first nauseating experience of cowardice and my first appalled realization that there are people in the world who do not seem to be afraid of anything who act as though they have nothing to lose thereafter the playground becomes a battleground sometimes quiet sometimes the scene of athletic competition between them and us but rocks are thrown as often as baseballs gradually we abandon the place and use the streets instead the streets are safer though we do not admit this to ourselves we are not after all sissiesthat most dreaded epithet of an american boyhood item i am standing alone in front of the building in which i live it is late afternoon and getting dark that day in school the teacher had asked a surly negro boy named quentin a question he was unable to answer as usual i had waved my arm eagerly be a good boy get good marks be smart go to college become a doctor and the right answer bursting from my lips i was held up lovingly by the teacher as an example to the class i had seen quentins facea very dark very cruel very  orientallooking faceharden and there had been enough threat in his eyes to make me run all the way home for fear that he might catch me outside now standing idly in front of my own house i see him approaching from the project accompanied by his little brother who is carrying a baseball bat and wearing a grin of malicious anticipation as in a nightmare i am trapped the sursoundings are secure and familiar but terror is suddenly present and there is no one around to help i am locked to the spot i will not cry out or run away like a sissy and i stand there my heart wild my throat clogged he walks up hurls the familiar epithet hey mof r and to my surprise only pushes me it is a violent push but not a punch a push is not as serious as a punch maybe i can still back out without entirely losing my dignity maybe i can still say hey cmon quentin whaddya wanna do that for i dint do nothin to you and walk away not too rapidly instead before i can stop myself i push him backa token gestureand i say cut that out i dont wanna fight i aint got nothin to fight about as i turn to walk back into the building the corner of my eye catches the motion of the bat his little brother has handed him i try to duck but the bat crashes colored lights into my head  the next thing i know my mother and sister are standing over me both of them hysterical my sistershe who was later to join the progressive youth organizationis shouting for the police and screaming imprecations at those dirty little black bastards they take me upstairs the doctor comes the police come i tell them that the boy who did it was a stranger that he had been trying to get money from me they do not believe me but i am too scared to give them quentins name when i return to school a few days later quentin avoids my eyes he knows that i have not squealed and he is ashamed i try to feel proud but in my heart i know that it was fear of what his friends might do to me that had kept me silent and not the code of the street item there is an athletic meet in which the whole of our junior high school is participating i am in one of the seventhgrade rapidadvance classes and segregation has now set in with a vengeance in the last three or four years of the elementary school from which we have just graduated each grade had been divided into three classes according to intelligence in the earlier grades the divisions had either been arbitrary or else unrecognized by us as having anything to do with brains these divisions by iq or however it was arranged had resulted in a preponderance of jews in the  classes and a corresponding preponderance of negroes in the s with the italians split unevenly along the spectrum at least a few negroes had always made the ls just as there had always been a few jewish kids among the s and more among the s where italians dominated but the junior highs rapidadvance class of which i am now a member is overwhelmingly jewish and entirely whiteexcept for a shy lonely negro girl with light skin and reddish hair the athletic meet takes place in a cityowned stadium far from the school it is an important event to which a whole day is given over the winners are to get those precious little medallions stamped with the new york city emblem that can be screwed into a belt and that prove the wearer to be a distinguished personage i am a fast runner and so i am assigned the position of anchor man on my classs team in the relay race there are three other seventhgrade teams in the race two of them all negro as ours is all white one of the allnegro teams is very talltheir anchor man waiting silently next to me on the line looks years older than i am and i do not recognize him he is the first to get the baton and crosses the finishing line in a walk our team comes in second but a few minutes later we are declared the winners for it has been discovered that the anchor man on the firstplace team is not a member of the class we are awarded the medallions and the following day our homeroom teacher makes a speech about how proud she is of us for being superior athletes as well as superior students we want to believe that we deserve the praise but we know that we could not have won even if the other class had not cheated that afternoon walking home i am waylaid and surrounded by five negroes among whom is the anchor man of the disqualified team gimme my medal mofr he grunts i do not have it with me and i tell him so anyway it aint yours i say foolishly he calls me a liar on both counts and pushes me up against the wall on which we sometimes play handball gimme my mofn medal he says again i repeat that that i have left it home les search the lil mof r one of them suggests he prolly got it hid in his mof n pants  my panic is now unmanageable how many times had i been surrounded like this and asked in soft tones len me a nickle boy how many times had i been called a liar for pleading poverty and pushed around or searched or beaten up unless there happened to be someone in the marauding gang like carl who liked me across that enormous divide of hatred and who would therefore say aaah cmon les git someone else this boy aint got no money on im i scream at them through tears of rage and selfcontempt keep your fn filthy lousy black hands offa me i swear ill get the cops this is all they need to hear and the five of them set upon me they bang me around mostly in the stomach and on the arms and shoulders and when several adults loitering near the candy store down the block notice what is going on and begin to shout they run off and away i do not tell my parents about the incident my teammates who have also been waylaid each by a gang led by his opposite number from the disqualified team have had their medallions taken from them and they never squeal either for days i walk home in terror expecting to be caught again but nothing happens the medallion is put away into a drawer never to be worn by anyone obviously experiences like these have always been a common feature of childhood life in workingclass and immigrant neighborhoods and negroes do not necessarily figure in them wherever and in whatever combination they have lived together in the cities kids of different groups have been at war beating up and being beaten up micks against kikes against wops against spicks against polacks and even relatively homogeneous areas have not been spared the warring of the young one block against another one gang called in my day in a pathetic effort at gentility an sac or socialathletic club against another but the negrowhite conflict hadand no doubt still hasa special intensity and was conducted with a ferocity unmatched by intra mural white battling in my own neighborhood a good deal of animosity existed between the italian kids most of whose parents were immigrants from sicily and the jewish kids who came largely from east european immigrant families yet everyone had friends sometimes close friends in the other camp and we often visited one anothers strangesmelling houses if not for meals then for glasses of milk and occasionally for some special event like a wedding or a wake if it happened that we divided into warring factions and did battle it would invariably be halfhearted and soon patched up our parents to be sure had nothing to do with one another and were mutually suspicious and hostile but we the kids who all spoke yiddish or italian at home were americans or new yorkers or brooklyn boys we shared a culture the culture of the street and at least for a while this culture proved to be more powerful than the opposing cultures of the home why why should it have been so different as between the negroes and us how was it borne in upon us so early white and black alike that we were enemies beyond any possibility of reconciliation why did we hate one another so i suppose if i tried i could answer those questions more or less adequately from the perspective of what i have since learned i could draw upon james baldwinwhat better witness is there  to describe the sense of entrapment that poisons the soul of the negro with hatred for the white man whom he knows to be his jailer on the other side if i wanted to understand how the white man comes to hate the negro i could call upon the psychologists who have spoken of the guilt that white americans feel toward negroes and that turns into hatred for lack of acknowledging itself as guilt these are plausible answers and certainly there is truth in them yet when i think back upon my own experience of the negro and his of me i find myself troubled and puzzled much as i was as a child when i heard that all jews were rich and all negroes persecuted how could the negroes in my neighborhood have regarded the whites across the street and around the corner as jailers on the whole the whites were not so poor as the negroes but they were quite poor enough and the years were years of depression as for white hatred of the negro how could guilt have had anything to do with it what share had these italian and jewish immigrants in the enslavement of the negro what share had theydowntrodden people themselves breaking their own necks to eke out a living in the exploitation of the negro no i cannot believe that we hated each other back there in brooklyn because they thought of us as jailers and we felt guilty toward them but does it matter given the fact that we all went through an unrepresentative confrontation i think it matters profoundly for if we managed the job of hating each other so well without benefit of the aids to hatred that are supposedly at the root of this madness everywhere else it must mean that the madness is not yet properly understood i am far from pretending that i understand it but i would insist that no view of the problem will begin to approach the truth unless it can account for a case like the one i have been trying to describe are the elements of any such view available to us at least two i would say are one of them is a point we frequently come upon in the work of james baldwin and the other is a related point always stressed by psychologists who have studied the mechanisms of prejudice baldwin tells us that one of the reasons negroes hate the white man is that the white man refuses to look at him the negro knows that in white eyes all negroes are alike they are faceless and therefore not altogether human the psychologists in their turn tell us that the white man hates the negro because he tends to project those wild impulses that he fears in himself onto an alien group which he then punishes with his contempt what baldwin does not tell us however is that the principle of facelessness is a twoway street and can operate in both directions with no difficulty at all thus in my neighborhood in brooklyn i was as faceless to the negroes as they were to me and if they hated me because i never looked at them i must also have hated them for never looking at me to the negroes my white skin was enough to define me as the enemy and in a war it is only the uniform that counts and not the person so with the mechanism of projection that the psychologists talk about it too works in both directions at once there is no question that the psychologists are right about what the negro represents symbolically to the white man for me as a child the life lived on the other side of the playground and down the block on ralph avenue seemed the very embodiment of the values of the streetfree independent reckless brave masculine erotic i put the word erotic last though it is usually stressed above all others because in fact it came last in consciousness as in importance what mainly counted for me about negro kids of my own age was that they were bad boys there were plenty of bad boys among the whitesthis was after all a neighborhood with a long tradition of crime as a career open to aspiring talentsbut the negroes were really bad bad in a way that beckoned to one and made one feel inadequate we all went home every day for a lunch of spinachandpotatoes they roamed around during lunch hour  munching on candy bars in winter we had to wear itchy woolen hats and mittens and cumbersome galoshes they were bareheaded and loose as they pleased we rarely played hookey or got into serious trouble in school for all our streetcorner bravado they were defiant forever staying out to do what delicious things forever making disturbances in class and in the halls forever being sent to the principal and returning uncowed but most important of all they were tough beautifully enviably tough not giving a damn for anyone or anything to hell with the teacher the truant officer the cop to hell with the whole of the adult world that held us in its grip and that we never had the courage to rebel against except sporadically and in petty ways this is what i saw and envied and feared in the negro this is what finally made him faceless to me though some of it of course was actually there the psychologists also tell us that the alien group which becomes the object of a projection will tend to respond by trying to live up to what is expected of them but what on his side did the negro see in me that made me faceless to him did he envy me my lunches of spinachandpotatoes and my itchy woolen caps and my prudent behavior in the face of authority as i envied him his noontime candy bars and his bare head in winter and his magnificent rebelliousness did those lunches and caps spell for him the prospect of power and riches in the future did they mean that there were possibilities open to me that were denied to him very likely they did but if so one also supposes that he feared the impulses within himself toward submission to authority no less powerfully than i feared the impulses in myself toward defiance if i represented the jailer to him it was not because i was oppressing him or keeping him down it was because i symbolized for him the dangerous and probably pointless temptation toward greater repression just as he symbolized for me the equally perilous tug toward greater freedom i personally was to be rewarded for this repression with a new and better life in the future but how many of my friends paid an even higher price and were given only gall in return we have it on the authority of james baldwin that all negroes hate whites i am trying to suggest that on their side all whitesall american whites that isare sick in their feelings about negroes there are negroes no doubt who would say that baldwin is wrong but i suspect them of being less honest than he is just as i suspect whites of selfdeception who tell me they have no special feeling toward negroes special feelings about color are a contagion to which white americans seem susceptible even when there is nothing in their background to account for the susceptibility thus everywhere we look today in the north we find the curious phenomenon of white middleclass liberals with no previous personal experience of negroes people to whom negroes have always been faceless in virtue rather than faceless in vicediscovering that their abstract commitment to the cause of negro rights will not stand the test of a direct confrontation we find such people fleeing in droves to the suburbs as the negro population in the inner city grows and when they stay in the city we find them sending their children to private school rather than to the integrated public public school in the neighborhood we find them resisting the demand that gerrymandered school districts be rezoned for the purpose of overcoming de facto segregation we find them judiciously considering whether the negroes for their own good of course are not perhaps pushing too hard we find them clucking their tongues over negro militancy we find them speculating on the question of whether there may not after all be something in the theory that the races are biologically different we find them saying that it will take a very long time for negroes to achieve full equality no matter what anyone does we find them deploring the rise of black nationalism and expressing the solemn hope that the leaders of the negro community will discover ways of containing the impatience and incipient violence within the negro ghettos but that is by no means the whole story there is also the phenomenon of what kenneth rexroth once called crowjimism there are the brokendown white boys like vivaldo moore in baldwins another country who go to harlem in search of sex or simply to brush up against something that looks like primitive vitality and who are so often punished by the negroes they meet for crimes that they would have been the last ever to commit and of which they themselves have been as sorry victims as any of the negroes who take it out on them there are the writers and intellectuals and artists who romanticize negroes and pander to them assuming a guilt that is not properly theirs and there are all the white liberals who permit negroes to blackmail them into adopting a double standard of moral judgment and who lend themselves again assuming the responsibility for crimes they never committed to cunning and contemptuous exploitation by negroes they employ to try to befriend and what about me what kind of feelings do i have about negroes today what happened to me from brooklyn who grew up fearing and envying and hating negroes now that brooklyn is behind me do i fear them and envy them and hate them still the answer is yes but not in the same proportions and certainly not in the same way i now live on the upper west side of manhattan where there are many negroes and many puerto ricans and there are nights when i experience the old apprehensiveness again and there are streets that i avoid when i am walking in the dark as there were streets that i avoided when i was a child i find that i am not afraid of puerto ricans but i cannot restrain my nervousness whenever i pass a group of negroes standing in front of a bar or sauntering down the street i know now as i did not know when i was a child that power is on my side that the police are working for me and not for them and knowing this i feel ashamed and guilty like the good liberal i have grown up to be yet the twinges of fear and the resentment they bring and the selfcontempt they arouse are not to be gainsaid but envy why envy and hatred why hatred here again the intensities have lessened and everything has been complicated and qualified by the guilts and the resulting overcompensations that are the heritage of the enlightened middleclass world of which i am now a member yet just as in childhood i envied negroes for what seemed to me their superior masculinity so i envy them today for what seems to me their superior physical grace and beauty i have come to value physical grace very highly and i am now capable of aching with all my being when i watch a negro couple on the dance floor or a negro playing baseball or basketball  they are on the kind of terms with their own bodies that i should like to be on with mine and for and that precious quality they seem blessed to me the hatred i still feel for negroes is the hardest of all the old feelings to face or admit and it is the most hidden and the most overlarded by the conscious attitudes into which i have succeeded in willing myself it no longer has as for me it once did any cause or justification except perhaps that i am constantly being denied my right to an honest expression of the things i earned the right as a child to feel how then do i know that this hatred has never entirely disappeared i know it from the insane rage that can stir in me at the thought of negro antisemitism i know it from the disgusting prurience that can stir in me at the sight of a mixed couple and i know it from the violence that can stir in me whenever i encounter that special brand of paranoid touchiness to which many negroes are prone this then is where i am it is not exactly where i think all other white liberals are but it cannot be so very far away either and it is because i am convinced that we white americans arefor whatever reason it no longer matters so twisted and sick in our feelings about negroes that i despair of the present push toward integration if the pace of progress were not a factor here there would perhaps be no cause for despair time and the law and even the international political situation are on the side of the negroes and ultimately therefore victoryof a sort anywaymust come but from everything we have learned from observers who ought to know pace has become as important to the negroes as substance they want equality and they want it now and the white world is yielding to their demand only as much and as fast as it is absolutely being compelled to do the negroes know this in the most concrete terms imaginable and it is thus becoming increasingly difficult to buy them off with rhetoric and promises and pious assurances of support and so within the negro community we find more and more people declaring as harold r isaacs recently put it in these pagesthat they want out people who say that integration will never come or that it will take a hundred or a thousand years to come or that it will come at too high a price in suffering and struggle for the pallid and sodden life of the american middle class that at the very best it may bring the most numerous influential and dangerous movement that has grown out of negro despair with the goal of integration is of course the black muslims this movement whatever else we may say about it must be credited with one enduring achievement it inspired james baldwin to write an essay which deserves to be placed among the classics of our language everything baldwin has ever been trying to tell us is distilled here into a statement of overwhelming persuasiveness and prophetic magnificence baldwins message is and always has been simple it is this color is not a human or personal reality it is a political reality and baldwins demand is correspondingly simple color must be forgotten lest we all be smited with a vengeance that does not really depend on and cannot really be executed by any person or organization and that cannot be prevented by any police force or army historical vengeance a cosmic vengeance based on the law that we recognize when we say whatever goes up must come down  the black muslims baldwin portrays as a sign and a warning to the intransigent white world they come to proclaim how deep is the negros disaffection with the white world and all its works and baldwin implies that no american negro can fail to respond somewhere in his being to their message that the white man is the devil that allah has doomed him to destruction and that the black man is about to inherit the earth baldwin of course knows that this nightmare inversion  of the racism from which the black man has suffered can neither win nor even point to the neighborhood in which victory might be located for in his view the neighborhood of victory lies in exactly the opposite direction the transcendence of color through love yet the tragic fact is that love is not the answer to hatenot in the world of politics at any rate color is indeed a political rather than a human or a personal reality and if politics which is to say power has made it into a human and a personal reality then only politics which is to say power can unmake it once again but the way of politics is slow and bitter and as impatience on the one side is matched by a setting of the jaw on the other we move closer and closer to an explosion and blood may yet run in the streets will this madness in which we are all caught never find a restingplace is there never to be an end to it in thinking about the jews i have often wondered whether their survival as a distinct group was worth one hair on the head of a single infant did the jews have to survive so that six million innocent people should one day be burned in the ovens of auschwitz it is a terrible question and no one not god himself could ever answer it to my satisfaction and when i think about the negroes in america and about the image of integration as a state in which the negroes would take their rightful place as another of the protected minorities in a pluralistic society i wonder whether they really believe in their hearts that such a state can actually be attained and if so why they should wish to survive as a distinct group i think i know why the jews once wished to survive though i am less certain as to why we still do they not only believed that god had given them no choice but they were tied to a memory of past glory and a dream of imminent redemption what does the american negro have that might correspond to this his past is a stigma his color is a stigma and his vision of the future is the hope of erasing the stigma by making color irrelevant by making it disappear as a fact of consciousness i share this hope but i cannot see how it will ever be realized unless color does in fact disappear and that means not integration it means assimilation it meanslet the brutal word come outmiscegenation the black muslims like their racist counterparts in the white world accuse the socalled negro leaders of secretly pursuing miscegenation as a goal the racists are wrong but i wish they were right for i believe that the wholesale merging of the two races is the most desirable alternative for everyone concerned i am not claiming that this alternative can be pursued programmatically or that it is immediately feasible as a solution obviously there are even greater barriers to its achievement than to the achievement of integra tion what i am saying however is that in my opinion the negro problem can be solved in this country in no other way i have told the story of my own twisted feelings about negroes here and of how they conflict with the moral convictions i have since developed in order to assert that such feelings must be acknowledged as honestly as possible so that they can be controlled and ultimately disregarded in favor of the convictions it is wrong for a man to suffer because of the color of his skin beside that cliched proposition of liberal thought what argument can stand and be respected if the arguments are the arguments of feeling they must be made to yield and ones own soul is not the worst place to begin working a huge social transformation not so long ago it used to be asked of white liberals would you like your sister to marry one when i was a boy and my sister was still unmarried i would certainly have said no to that question but now i am a man my sister is already married and i have daughters if i were to be asked today whether i would like a daughter of mine to marry one i would have to answer no i wouldnt like it at all i would rail and rave and rant and tear my hair and then i hope i would have the courage to curse myself for raving and ranting and to give her my blessing how dare i withhold it at the behest of the child i once was and against the man i now have a duty to be

hen ivory coast w president felix houphouetboigny arrived in washington for a state visit in what he brought with him was not merely a feeling of friendship for the united states seldom found among african leaders brought to brainwashed americans a startling new image of afwomanhood for he also when marie even rican svelte cool and elegant therese houphouetboigny stepped off the plane that had whisked her in from paris the most prejudiced of the washington correspondents had to admit thatby any standards they chose to judgehere was an exquisite lady during the few days that president and madame houphouetboigny were white house guests washington society was agog at state function or informal luncheonwhenever she appearedthe cocoacolored african beauty effortlessly seized the spotlight not only did she possess a natural grace worthy of a princess but she was invariably attired in clothes befitting a queen out of socalled darkest africa had emerged a jewel so brilliant as to light up the capital of the worlds most powerful nation for a first lady of such uncommon charm it perhaps was inevitable that marie therese houphouetboigny would be compared to jacqueline kennedy the press dubbed her africas jackie meaning to compliment her and there are indeed points of similarity between the two beauties madame houphouetboigny like mrs kennedy is familiar with the life of paris although the african first lady lived there for several years while the american first lady studied there only briefly and like mrs kennedy madame houphouetboigny is a connoisseur of fine clothes good art and gourmet food an advocate of excellence but there the similarities all but end madame houphouetboigny was born marie therese brou  years ago in one of the suburbs of abidjan capital of the ivory coast at  she was dispatched along with  other local girls to private schools in france there she grew up learning all that was accessible absorbing all the bountiful culture about her at  she met and then married the most powerful man in her country mrs kennedy on the other hand was born to wealth and the man she married was just one of  senators when they exchanged wedding vows as the wife of the chief of the most prosperous country in frenchspeaking africa marie therese houphouetboigny cannot help but set the pace in style and breeding and accomplishment for the young women of africa she is a splendid example if marie therese houphouetboigny is a paragon in the realm of politics and power leontyne price is her match in the lofty world of grand opera if not the prima donna assoluta of grand opera then miss price is unquestionably her closest rival a tall stately creature with the voice of a fullblooded angel and the grace of a lithelimbed cat she fills the operatic stage with an almost unbearable excitement from milan to manhattan and in all the musical centers in between leontyne price has been hailed as one of the great sopranos of all time hers is a classic story born in a little mississippi town brought up in the poor but dignified manner native to so many southernbred negroes there was no logical reason why her star should have ascended to such heights she sang in the church choir and studied music and voice as have thousands of girls from similar towns and families and finally she managed to go away to college wilberforce where she studied education in preparation for a career as a teacher but leontyne price had an ambition which would not be stilled and she had a voice the ambition was to stand on the stage of the metropolitan opera house and sing and she aimed to shape her voice toward that moment soon the students and faculty members at wilberforce had joined with the people of laurel miss in praising miss prices singing and when famed baritone paul robeson heard her on the campus fate stepped in robeson sang a benefit that raised  for leontynes expenses at the juilliard school of music in new york and the way was clear few music lovers who heard leontyne price sing remained unmoved and her climb to the top rung in the music world was marked by successive encounters with experts who came to listen and stayed to praise producer robert breen cast her as bess in his revival of porgy and bess the national broadcasting company dared to star her on tv as the highpowered tosca and the eminent herbert von karajan made plans to feature her on the opera stage in europe her grand opera career began in  when she sang in dialogues of the carmelites with the san francisco opera in the next  two years she sang the lead role in aida in san francisco and at londons covent garden then von karajan invited her to sing the ethiopian princess at the vienna state opera and leontynes conquest of europe began she sang at salzburg and at berlin and finally at la scala and when she came home to open the met in ii trovatore in  her triumph was complete now at the pinnacle of her success la price is one of a small group of superlative sopranos who can virtually write their own tickets gwendolyn brooks may be unable to write her own ticket to front page fame and queens fortune but nobody is prepared to deny that the lady can write it is our cultures misfortuneas well as miss brooksthat poets have so little honor in our land for this poet has the power to elevate our spirits and to enrich our souls in fact for that lucky minority of poetry lovers miss brooks has been providing elevation and enrichment for almost  years since her first book of poems a street in bronzeville brightened the literary horizon back in  those poems told all about life in the modest neighborhoods of chicagos south side that then boxedin area of the city where negroes were contained the walls of that particular ghetto have since crumbled and the people have spilled out southward and westward enlarging the ghetto formlessly but inexorably and the poems are marked by a simple beauty that is almost unbearable four years later following publication of her second book of poems annie allen gwendolyn brooks was awarded a pulitzer prize in  harper published miss brooks first novel maud martha the novel like her poems is simple in structure spare and small and as deceptively potent as vodka lurking in orange juice it is the story of an ordinary negro woman making her way and a life in that same chicago ghetto and its statement of the human condition is profoundly moving it is unmistakably a poets work in the nearly ten years since maud martha there have been new poems from gwendolyn brooks and one of them an elegy to her novelist friend frank london brown was published in the september  issue of negro digest she has appeared on various lecture platforms participated in a poets whingding at the library of

tailored to their special dimensions and miss carroll is one of that select few richard rodgers wrote the music and lyrics for no strings with miss carroll in mind and thousands of happy theatergoers

stage as the elegant young americaninparis mannequin in the musical no strings all the nation knew that a big new star had set some  years separate the ascendant stars of diahann carroll and josephine baker but there are interesting points of coincidence in the real and stage lives of the two famed entertainers in no strings miss carroll displays a wardrobe fit for a queen in fact the lithe little ladys closest competitor for attention in the musical are the exquisite clothes designed by donald brooks when a decade ago the great josephine baker swept back into her native country on a theater tour the furs and gowns she brought with her from paris all but stopped each show and while miss carroll plays the role of an american model in paris josephine baker wasfor a long timethe model on

them at last count a total of  children were established in the bakerbouillon household at les milandes keeping what amounts to a whole town a chateau a platoon of servants and  children demands a great deal of money and josephine baker has only her name and her talent on which to capitalize at  then long after most entertainers have retired from the glamour derby the remarkable jo baker is still touring the world still dazzling audiences still earning a kings ransom she has indeed come a long way from st louis andfrom all indicationsshe still will go a long way 
freedoms song
safe to say that the freedom movement in the south is a singing movement this is somewhat to be expected when one considers that music has strange power to evoke various emotional responses in the human animal it has historically been of special value to the oppressed in every age somehow the literature and idiom of music makes possible the restoration of lost hopes it binds up the wounds of the brokenhearted and by its character welds together the cohesive sentiment of a group of people of common experience in the experience of the children of israel particularly that of the period of the captivity we are able to see some evidence of this in the literature of the psalms extrabiblical sources reveal that the psalms were chanted in unison or antiphonally expressive of the particular emotion and experience to be conveyed one illustration suffices to indicate the significant role of singing during the captivity of the house of israel the th psalm infers that in the midst of despair the children of israel were tempted to stop singing by the rivers of babylon there we sat down yea we wept when we remembered zion we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof for they that carried us away captive required of us a song sing us one of the songs of zion how shall we sing the lords song in a strange land and then the affirmation that despite the captivity the body and spirit of israel could only be held together by holding on to their faith through the only apparent medium available the singing of the psalter that stirred the fires of faith if i forget thee o jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning if i do not remember thee let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if i prefer not jerusalem the faith of the nation in jehovah above my chief joy the history of hymnody details the role of music in the early church it was the thread of faith that bound the believers together in the face of the oppressive cruelty of the roman empire most revolutionary movements have been singing movements the overthrow of the czarist regime in russia and the rise of the labor movement in america are instances where music played its role it has been thus with the negro and perhaps uniquely the negro himself created the music that is helping to emancipate him the negro spiritual is the primal art form of the musical literature of america the religious folk melodies of the antebellum negro produced in turn the negro folk song which in turn evolved into the blues and thence into what we know now as jazz across the years the negro spiritual has maintained its integrity and its message while the perverted form of the spiritualthe blues songhas developed many different forms i use the word perverted here advisedly the spiritual is distinguished from blues primarily by its ultimate expressionspirituals though they speak of travail and woe are faithfilled and hopeful the blues while utilizing very much the same basic musical idiom is a song of despair and hopelessness i wish to submit that the negro spiritual the one pure music art form that america has produced has played a strategic role in holding together the threadbare hopes of a people reduced to chattel slavery and has served across the last  years of emancipation to persuade them that a better day is coming from our present vantage point it is perfectly clear that the recent nonviolent thrust of the negro community might not have had the vitality and dynamism that it has were it not for the impact of the negro spiritual the natural response to music coupled with the deep meaning of the negro spiritual has produced a unique effect on the freedom movement in the south it must always be remembered that religious orientation of the freedom movement intensifies the effect produced perhaps it should be said that the freedom movements natural character of being religiously orientated is inseparable from the effect of the music of the negro spiritual they are each a supplement of the other the place of the negro spiritual in the musical literature of america has not always been clearly understood the negro community itself is just now becoming aware historically speaking of the spirituals critical significance to the communitys own development and progress we have set forth in an earlier lecture that had there been no negro church there would be no negro communitythat is a cohesive sociological grouping capable of influencing the mainstream of american life by the same token the faith expressed in the negro spiritual had very much to do with keeping the negro church intact there was a time not too long ago when the negro spiritual was somewhat in illrepute as far as a large part of the negro community was concerned they were naturally associated with the slaveexperience and many negroes were not willing to identify themselves with what they considered slave songs this was in large measure due to an effort not to identify with the group psychologists call this attitude produced by the system of segregation and discrimination selfhate mistakenly the negro of the middle class particularly as he laboriously improved his lot economically socially and educationally felt the negro spiritual represented a leftover from an era that had passed and the continued use of music was deemed out of date with the progressive age of which the negro was slowly becoming a part quite naturally the survival of any tradition written or sung depends largely upon the ethnic group from which it sprang this accounts for a decline in their use and for a while the infrequent attention given them as a genuine part of the musical literature of america progressive negro churches rarely found use for the negro spiritual save in the informal services where singing might occur without the accompaniment of piano or organ as the negro church became more structured and emotionalism began to decline there followed less frequent use of spirituals fortunately though there were some with vision and insight who recognized the real worth of this body of musical literature and who took definite pains to see that it was preserved in message content and idiom notable in these efforts were the fisk jubilee singers and the college choirs of many of the small churchrelated negro colleges in the south professor j w work dr r nathaniel dett harry burleigh and james weldon johnson did much to codify and preserve in writing the words and music of the negro spiritual that had existed for nearly two generations by oral tradition alone the dedication and persistence of these groups and persons over a period of years helped to awaken a new interest and appreciation in the religious folk songs of the negro the programs of roland hayes and marian anderson were never without a section given solely to negro spirituals they insisted on including them out of their honest concern and belief that the spiritual was a part of the great musical literature of the world for these worldrenowned artists it was only incidental that they themselves happened to be members of the community in which this strange and sometimes haunting music was bom during the last fifteen years there has been a revival of interest in the negro spiritual we have come to understand that the negro spiritual is not a slavesong at all true enough they were spawned in the midst of the slave experience but their message belies hope in a better day these songs are rather the portraits of the souls of men who though their bodies were shackled expressed in unmistakable terms that their spirits were free close scrutiny of the words of the negro spiritual evidences their absolute timeliness every genuine spiritual has a biblical origin and the truth of the bible is still as fresh as tomorrow mornings newspaper no real indictment can be made that the negro spiritual is out of date or oldfashioned as far as the inference made by many that the emotional content of the spiritual made them less appropriate for use in the formal service of the church the best expression of religion is one that is in proper balance emotionally and intellectually the extremes of emotionalism and intellectualism leave much to be desired when it comes to meaningful worship somewhere between the two extremes the proper balance of thought and feeling can produce a worship experience that is intellectually challenging and emotionally satisfying thus for me and an ever increasing number of devotees the spirituals of the negro fit with grace and facility into the worship order of any protestant church it is not unusual today to discover the spirituals being used in white churches as well as negro churches with considerable regularity let us consider the negro spiritual for a few moments purely as musical literature the masters of music tell us that for a body of musical literature to be adjudged as great music at least three essentials are required nobility of theme dignity of expression and originality of thought and medium the great body of the spirituals generally answer these basic requirements let us consider them one at a time nobility of theme the familiar spiritual go down moses represents a clear example of this one must consider the tremendous odds against which the antebellum negro labored to fashion his religious faith most of it was acquired through what he was able to glean from reading of the bible by the slave master and slave mistress it was transmitted then by rote to the other members of the slave community it is something short of miraculous that these slave people were able at all to gain clear insight into the meaning of the bible stories distill them through their own experience as slaves and create a musical idiom that was neither devoid of theological content nor the basic faith of the old and new testament the spiritual go down moses reflects the slave communitys perception that their own experience was a parallel to the slave experience of the house of israel under the egyptians and when intoned by them evidenced their faith that one day god would send them a moses to tell the pharaohs of the slave system to let gods people the slaves go what more noble theme could there be dignity of expression if you have heard the words of any spiritual and are familiar with broken dialect common to them all i suppose at moments there is the temptation to laugh it must be remembered however that the slave community was composed of a people who had been uprooted from their homeland against their will transported to a strange land and very often there existed the possibility of as many as forty different dialects being spoken the broken english they used was their feeble attempt to express themselves in a strange language and be understood however humorous their phonetic attempts were it must be kept in mind that the antebellum negro never intended anything funny his was a deadly serious attempt to convey through musical expression what he believed ultimately it was this music which did more than anything else to keep body and soul together one such spiritual de blin man stood in de road and cried exhibits the simple faith of the negro in the lord jesus christ to heal him from his diseases as he healed the blind man bartimeus who cried out for mercy along the jericho road as the galilean prince had mercy on a man born blind it was the hope and belief of the negro that he would be merciful to him in the affliction of slavery no matter how broken the dialect it was a sincere attempt to voice some facet of his personal and group faith thus the spiritual despite its brokenenglish quality does in fact possess a dignity of expression originality of thought and medium it is now generally conceded that the music of the negro spiritual is original to the negro in so far as any folk music is original of those who sometimes still assert that the negro folk idioms are derivations of revival hymns the question might be pertinently asked where is that wonderful matrix of hymnology out of which has grown these song jewels of negro spirituals it has long been accepted as scientifically true that the black man brought his musical idiom with him from his native land as he must have brought his susceptibility to religious suggestion it would of course be unreasonable to suppose that this idiom was entirely unaffected by environment further the wordpicture drawn in the poetry of the spirituals is matchless one such example is sometimes i feel like a motherless child the doleful intonations of this spiritual and the lucid description of how wretched the singers fortunes have become combine to telegraph immediately the deep sorrow though still buttressed by hope his condition is such that he feels as a child without a mother the one upon whom the child is totally dependent a long way from home this is philosophical selfanalysis this one example belies both originality of thought and medium the body of musical literature that embraces the negro spiritual fulfills the essentials for that which makes great music  we can never know fully what the ability of the black man to improvise his troubles into artforms has meant to him very likely it serves as a sort of safety valve for his pent feelings saving the country from an even greater tragedy than that precipitated by the civil war and himself from a disaster equally great the paramount contribution of the negro spiritual is that it has brought to the world a great message of goodwill one of the most outstanding characteristics of all the songs is that free as the music is from cacophony and discord just as remarkably free is its poetry from any word of bitterness anger or reproach whatever the condition or circumstance the music of the negro spiritual plumbs the depths of human experience when he felt like giving up he would chant stay in de field until de war is ended in his moments of meditation and reflection he sang every time i feel the spirit moving in my heart i will pray in the midst of his troubles he would sing soon i will be done with the troubles of the world when he was remiss from the discipline of his faith he cried in penitence its me its me o lord standing in the need of prayer when death came close in confidence of another life he sang swing low sweet chariot cornin for to carry me home let us consider the character of the negro spiritual every genuine spiritual is easily earmarked by some very similar characteristics most of the spirituals if not all evidence certain basic qualities which warrant reviewing let me briefly discuss them the order is purely arbitrary the negro spiritual is characterized by its deep biblicism there is always a definite bible reference for the negro spiritual they were coined within the context of their deep religious faith and we find in them the clearest expression of the faith of the antebellum negro the titles ring with biblicism walk togedder children ride on king jesus didnt my lord delibered daniel and ole time religion are but a few to illustrate their biblical posture the spirituals possess a simple and repetitive musical idiom generally speaking the lyrics and music of the negro spiritual have a basic theme which is varied only slightly to differentiate between the refrain and stanza eg come by here ma lord come by here come by here ma lord come by here come by here ma lord come by here o lord come by here the stanzas continue in the same idiom and identical rhythm somebody needs you lord come by here somebody needs you lord come by here somebody needs you lord come by here o lord come by here this quality especially lent the spiritual to group and memory singing  the spiritual was not only an expression of faith it was at times a device many many spirituals have double or codemeaning we could safely presume that for the most part the spirituals were created in their original form out of a genuine religious need and later on acquired the double codemeaning this is not to say that some genuine spirituals were not created out of a specific circumstance that required subterfuge and the spiritualmedium was the safest way to transmit the information without drawing suspicion chroniclers of the days of the underground railroad attest to the usefulness of some of these religious folksongs in making their operation a success story one such spiritual that was used for a secondary purpose is the familiar steal away when some of the plantation owners detected that the christian faith was spawning ferment in the slave community and surmised that perhaps they might be better off wihout the instruction in the bible from northern missionaries who frequented the south they forbade the slaves from attending the camp meetings this spiritual was used to alert the slaves from one field to another the day and place of the meeting the day on which the singing of this hymn occurred signaled the meeting to be set for that night and improvised stanzas indicated the precise location of the meeting viz across the river in the grove or trees etc sometimes it was used to signal another movement of the underground railroad this was the significance of the last line in the refrain in this instance i aint got long to stay here the use of the spirituals for their second or codemeaning has been varied and numerous another discernible quality of the negro spiritual is that of possessing profound thelogical content the mystique of the negro spiritual aside from their birth and existence is that their messages make sense theologically we must not overlook the fact that these people had no judeochristian heritage upon which to lean it is unlikely that the concept of monotheism had any meaning at all to them yet illequipped as they were and with the fragmented bits of faith they managed to forage as leftovers from the masters table they were perceptive enough to capture the meaning of what they believed and transmit it into religiomusical expression this is nothing short of fantastic the spiritual o lord i want to be a christian inamy heart a classic speaks the eternal truth that an individuals commitment to faith and religion must be something that is internal as over against that which is external it was as well a gentle gibe at the religious practice of the slave holder from whom he had siphoned his faith we cannot overlook the eternality of the message the negro spiritual lived primarily because of the timelessness of what it seeks to say this quality perhaps is a corollary of its deep biblicism the spiritual you got to walk dat lonsome valley  you got to walk it for yoself underscores the eternal fact that each man must someday die and within the context of the christian faith must stand in the judgment on the basis of his personal faith and not that of another the words are searching and eternal you got to walk dat lonsome valley you got to walk it for yo self o nobody else can walk it for you you got to walk it by yo self the final two qualities can be mentioned together the spirituals are given to improvisation and are best rendered nonaccompanied by musical instruments the proper rendition of the religious folk songs of the negro makes the voices the accompaniment and the instruments much of the musical literature of the negro spiritual is designed to be sung antiphonally and coupled with its repetitive character it is readily understandable that a great group of voices could be handled as an organ expressive of many nuances of the negros songfilled faith it is the latter quality also that encouraged members of the group by design or spontaneity to take the lead and create in the midst of a rendition a new stanza once the pace or beat of the spiritual was established no great genius was required to fashion a line that would properly fit the musical idiom and the basic message of the hymn this new stanza would immediately receive the choral support of the others singing in the group this onthespot improvisation was and still is common in the singing of the spirituals how has the negro spiritual served the freedom movement in the south we have already set forth in an earlier paper in some detail the relationship of the negro church to the nonviolent revolution in the south against this background it is no mystery that with the negro communitys social life focused in the church and his protest movements religiously oriented it would follow that the music of the movement similarly would be that which is most informal and expressive of the deep yearnings of the ethnic group from which it has sprung it is an oddity that the introduction of the negro spiritual into the movement as a means of clear group expression of common goals and united efforts was through a young white folksinger guy carawan for many years mr carawan had traveled the south searching out the history and variations of negro folk music out of his own appreciation for them as a genuine artform and in an effort to develop his skills in interpreting the music of the negro that he used in his repertoire consciously aware of the value of music to unify and rally groups around a common aim mr carawan began to adapt the musical idiom of the negro spiritual familiar to all with new words geared to the new thrust for freedom in the south in conjunction with workshops sponsored by the highlander folk school at monteagle tennessee and public appearances around the south mr carawan collected and edited those songs most easily adaptable and most familiar it did not take very long for the idea to catch on in the various communities that he visited and individual protest movements began coining their own adaptations much of the content of present day freedom songs was worked out in jails of the southland as a means of killing the inevitable boredom of jailstaying and as a morale booster to those confined so much has the practice developed that it is taken for granted in any instance of jailgoing that the singing of freedom songs is the order of the day some of the freedom fighters in the south have paid severe disciplinary penalties in the prisons of the south because they insisted on singing in jail in my own experience of a halfdozen jailings the singing of the freedom hymns or songs has been for me an indispensable aid without which the jail experience might have been totally intolerable let me illustrate now the process of transference of a spiritual to the freedom hymn i have listed below first the spiritual as it appears in an original form then to the right the adapted typical form which is used in the movement i want jesus to walk with me i want jesus to walk with me yes i want jesus to walk with me yes i want jesus to walk with me all along my pilgrim journey all along this freedom journey lord i want jesus to walk with me lord i want jesus to walk with me in many instances the variation is at best slight as above the stanza of the original form is easily adaptable to the theme of the particular focus of the movement see below when im in trouble lord walk with me when im in trouble lord walk with me all along my pilgrim journey lord i want jesus to walk with me down in the jailhouse lord walk with me down in the jailhouse lord walk with me all along this freedom journey lord i want jesus to walk with me one of the most popular adaptations used by the albany georgia movement follows woke up this mornin with my mind stayed on jesus woke up this mornin with my mind stayed on jesus woke up this mornin with my mind stayed on jesus hallelu hallelu hallelujah woke up this mornin with my mind stayed on freedom woke up this mornin with my mind stayed on freedom woke up this mornin with my mind stayed on freedom hallelu hallelu hallelu hallelu hallelujah this example perhaps is one of the oldest of the spiritual forms but lends itself just as easily to the freedom hymn principle if you want to get to heaven do what jesus says if you want to get to heaven do what jesus says if you want to get to heaven do what jesus says hallelujah amen if you want to get your freedom register and vote if you want to get your freedom register and vote if you want to get your freedom register and vote hallelujah amen even the antebellum slaves had freedom songs one such hymn still a classic required only modernizing the stanzas oh freedom oh freedom this spiritual hymns refrain is and before id be a slave sung in its exact original form id be buried in my grave and go home to my lord and be free i have placed the original stanzas and the modern stanzas in juxtaposition to illustrate the principle we have been describing no more weeping etc no more segregation etc no more moaning    etc no more jim crow  etc and another over my head i see trouble in the air over my head i see trouble in the air over my head i see trouble in the air there must be a god somewhere over my head i see freedom in the air over my head i see freedom in the air over my head i see freedom in the air there must be a god somewhere numerous other spirituals lend themselves to the adaptations illustrated above but space will not permit their inclusion here they embrace such religious folk songs as amen in which the word freedom is inserted to replace the title word git on board little children in which the freedom train is substituted for gospel train and countless others we have mentioned earlier that the overriding theme of the spiritual music is the determined faith of its creators that a better day is coming it is safe to say and accurately so that the same theme permeates the message and fervor of the freedom hymns that have been constructed in the frame idiom and beat of the original music of the enslaved negro community the greatgrandchildren of the antebellum negro are singing of their travail four generations removed with considerably more determination and the better day considerably closer the theme song of the nonviolent movement we shall overcome is infused with that same optimism though the original form of this freedom hymn is an old prayer meeting hymn some oldtimers say the prayermeeting hymn developed from a religious folk song at any rate whatever its origin the integrity of its message has not been lost in its evolution nor in the modem adaptation within the nonviolent movement in the south for the sake of comparison the two forms are arranged as were the earlier examples ill overcome ill overcome we shall overcome we shall overcome ill overcome someday we shall overcome someday someoooh if in my heart i do not yield day ill overcome someday oooh deep in my heart i do believe we shall overcome someday one cannot describe the vitality and emotion this one hymn evokes across the southland i have heard it sung in great mass meetings with a thousand voices singing as one ive heard a halfdozen sing it softly behind the bars of the hinds county prison in mississippi ive heard old women singing it on the way to work in albany georgia ive heard the students singing it as they were being dragged away to jail it generates power that is indescribable it manifests a rich legacy of musical literature that serves to keep body and soul together for that better day which is not far off 
the lesson of birmingham the experience of birmingham preaches that the administration must quickly seize and act on the truth that the accent in race relations has moved from gradual to speed it must litigate it must exert executive power in connection with many federal construction and job training programs more vigorously and imaginatively than it has it must stand ready with troops to keep the peace justly and impartially for a number of southern governors are either not willing to do so at all or if willing intend to keep an unjust racist peace and the administration must be prepared to conciliate and mediate as assistant attorney general marshall did in birmingham and has done in other southern cities to the end that the parties may begin to work out among themselves problems to whose solution the law is not equal as yet and to whose complete and stable solution it may never alone be equal since robert kennedy and burke marshall will not always be in their present jobs it would be useful now to enlarge and formalize this conciliation and mediation function on a permanent basis in close coordination with the department of justice but visibly clothed with presidential prestige and authorityfrom the new republic
