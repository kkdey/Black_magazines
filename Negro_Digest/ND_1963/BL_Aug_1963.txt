the fiery voice of the negro revolt 
by l m meriwether
e must accept the fact w that disaster is one of the terms of living whatever you get you must pay your dues white people expect the negro to pay their the white mans dues they expect the negro to suffer for them be their whipping boy then they are astounded that negroes are not happy in their places and they say my but you are so bitter  those were the words spoken by author james baldwin whose latest book the fire next time has entrenched him firmly as the angry young voice of the new negro they were spoken on a california barmstorming tour the yearold novelist and lecturer recently undertook for the congress of racial equality core to raise funds for freedom in the strifetorn south at the university of california in berkeley and los angeles at the university of southern california at rallies in pasadena los angeles and san francisco an unprecedented horde of people turned out to hear this smallboned slender man with the bulging burning eyes speak calmly but with intense feeling on the american dilemma how it came into being and its solution as he saw it the atmosphere inside second baptist church in los angeles which was swollen to the rafters with an interracial crowd clearly reflected the tension and national climate of unrest all week long the newspapers and radios had kept the nation informed of the battle of birmingham and other racial conflicts which flared up in new york chicago and cincinnati speaking in this frame of reference baldwin said in essence the beginning of this country had nothing to do with the myths which have been created about it the words liberty and freedom are entirely misused the people who started this country came here for one reason and one reason only because they thought it would be better here than where they left anybody who was making it in england did not get on the mayflower part of the dilemma of this country is that it has believed the myths it has created in an effort to create the country called america today and escape the past a great many crimes were committed the first thing the settlers did when they touched these shores was to kill the indians not many american children being taught history in our schools get any real sense of how the pioneers really achieved this extermination and then they made a legend out of a massacre today americans present the spectacle of cowboys and indians on tv to reassure ourselves that there really was no crime  another thing done in order to conquer the country was to enslave the africans slavery like murder is one of the oldest human institutions in enslaving the african america obtained cheap labor without which it would have had a difficult time in creating its capital the only way these christians who started the country could justify slavery was to say that a slave wasnt a man and therefore no crime was committed that lie is the basis of our current trouble it was the black mans necessity when he got here to accept the situation because he had to survive and outwit his christian masters the crime is not the most important thing what is important is that americans have spent so many generations pretending that it did not happen since society is made by man it can be remade by man but the price for this transformation is high white people will have to ask themselves precisely why they found it necessary to invent a nigger for they invented him out of necessities of their own and every white citizen will have to answer for that and every white citizen will have to realize that he is not innocent of those crimes which are being committed in his name black people will have to do something very hard too which is to love and help the white citizen in his first awkward steps toward maturity but negroes have been functioning in that capacity for a long time they were the first psychiatrists in this country at the conclusion of his speech baldwin who had received two standing ovations before he began was accorded another tumultuous ovation in the question and answer period which followed he stated that the muslim movement came into existence because white america has never kept its promises to its black citizens it is hard for any black person in this country today to arrive at a sense of his own merit he said through the muslim movement a black boy or girl can be invested with pride in being black baldwin however is opposed to the muslims because they do not work in practical areas like instituting a rent strike in harlem he also does not feel that a negro has to create the myth that he is better than white people because he is black he does not have to invent a reason to be proud baldwin said they have endured achieved and triumphed already over one of the crudest oppressions in the history of mankind i think we have every right to be proud that our mothers and fathers carried washing on their heads that they outwitted this civilization to the extent that they took the cross and made it into something which had more meaning than it ever had before they are the only mothers who have produced children who could walk through mobs to go to school i would hate to throw away this real heritage for an invented one another question directed at baldwin asked what the parents of a sevenyearold child should tell the youngster who had just confided that white people were better than negroes baldwin answered that the child was too young to have obtained this impression from the outside world so he must have gotten it in the home the answer is he said for the parents to stop trying to be white over and over he asserted that the negro must strive to become himself to find his own true identity after the rally  core demonstrators marched peaceably on city hall in a sympathetic picket for the birmingham cause at a press conference at the biltmore hotel in los angeles baldwins answers to questions of newsmen were so biting that some were visibly shaken in answer to a query as to what it is that the negro wants baldwin answered heatedly no grown person has a right to ask what does a negro want you know what you want then you know what i want what does any man want i am a man discrimination against negroes he told the reporters is the central factor in american life and everything that happens here refers back to that there is no way to exaggerate the racial problem what i tell you is minuscule a microscopic bit of what the situation really is it is very grave i want the country to cease pretending that im not a part of it in defense of his claim that conditions are just as bad in the north as in the south baldwin said the negroes dont walk down the same streets as nonnegroes you may think that the courts are the same arrests are the same getting insurance is the same but it isnt asked about violence baldwin stated that whether or not there is violence depends upon the whites the negro is just a simple human being theyre not angels i dont know how much they can stand speaking to a predominantly negro audience at a luncheon sponsored by the men of tomorrow in los angeles baldwin said in essence that the negro people spend a vast amount of energy in escaping from their past from the auction block from the white mans kitchen i ran a long way before i realized that my ancestry was all i had that would help me through this world baldwin told his audience that if one embraces the past its tyrannical power ends it no longer possesses you you then possess it the negro has a tremendous debt to pay to his ancestors and the only way to pay it is to be responsible to ones contemporaries and those who come after him he said part of this responsibility is to find out ones true identity he  added that many negroes in the north are completely demoralized by the age of  and become hopelessly bitter they are bitter because they have been so despised no nation can afford to misuse onetenth of its natural resources baldwin added part of our responsibility the responsibility of the socalled intellectuals is to create the opportunity for these demoralized individuals to take their future into their own hands to know that a black man can be and become anything that he wishes to become baldwin calls for a total embrace between blacks and whites in order to avoid a costly conflagration this total embrace he insists must be based on mutual love and respect and upon the true history of the negros role in america and not upon myth baldwins intensity comes from the fact that he reacts emotionally to every crisis quivers at every outrage in his own words i am naked    and pregnant with some strange monster although physically exhausted after his los angeles stint which also included numerous appearances at cocktail parties in beverly hills and sherman oaks where he was bombarded with questions he returned to san francisco to make a twohour documentary film which will be released later this year author of three novels the latest called another country and two other books of essays nobody knows my name and notes of a native son baldwin has been criticized by some as being too bitter and of overlooking the many gains the negro has made the oldest of nine children baldwin is the product of the ghettoes of new york an environment he despised and ran away from to europe after a tenyear exile in paris baldwin returned to the united states in  with the realization that his roots were here he insists that he loves america and that is why he is angry but no longer bitter at the same time baldwin was speaking in california the united presbyterians were holding their th general assembly in des moines iowa dr marshall l scott retiring titular head criticized his constituents for moving too slow on the race issue the crux of americas racial problem he said is found in the type of neighborhoods where presbyterianism flourish it is exactly in those communities where there is the loudest talk about freedom and the most shouting about communism that the very fundamentals of our constitutional system and our biblical faith are most vigorously violated dr scott said that there is no more racial discrimination in alabama than in hundreds of allwhite communities in the north and west until our allwhite suburban communities deliberately seek to break the walls of separation that now prevail the damnedup flow of negroes from the agricultural south to the industrial north and west will pile up to sicken and possibly destroy us while other militant voices throughout the country were digesting baldwins views favorably and otherwise still others were labeling the negro movement a peoples revolution whether one agrees completely with baldwins statements or not one cannot deny that his written and spoken words are searing and penetrating if he is not the voice of this peoples revolution then he is at least a disquieting echo 
estevanico and the cities of gold
by florence laughlin
stevanico they e called hima familiar and affectionate term in the spanish language meaning little steve not because he was small in stature but because he was a giant of a man handsome intelligent and admired for his courage his origin is not known exactly some historians refer to him simply as a negro others insist that he was a moor born in azamor on the coast of morocco one thing is certain however he was a slave to one of the conquistadors and his story comes down to us as one of the most fascinating chronicles of the earliest days of exploration in our own southwest it begins almost four and a half centuries ago when estevanico sailed to the new world with the expedition of panfilo or pamphilio de narvaez in june of  to search for gold and to colonize florida for the king of spain reaching the coast of florida the veteran explorer divided his forces he sent his five ships and  men south toward mexico while he and the remaining  together with the horses set off across the trackless jungles of florida  it was a disastrous venture they met with hunger disease and the arrows or hostile indians and were forced at last to eat the flesh of their horses some managed to escape by building crude barges and sailing across the gulf of mexico but even these were shipwrecked off the coast of texas and finally of the  only four remained alive and those four had the sad fate to be taken as slaves by the indians besides estevanico there were  three spaniardsandres dorantes castillode maldonado and alvar nunezbetter known in history by his odd title of cabeza de vaca which means head of a cow it is cabeza de vaca in his famous book the shipwrecked ones who has given us this part of estevanicos story and a fantastic story it is little steve and his companions were undoubtedly the first explorers from the old world to cross continental united states and what amazes us in the jetage is that it took them over seven years to go from ocean to ocean after spending several months in cruel bondage to the indians in texas they managed to escape and struck westward roaming through the wilderness they traveled through new mexico into arizona and possibly reached california and in alien country they were all equal for they had only their wit and re sourcefulness to protect them from danger many of the indian tribes were friendly they thought the strangers were superior beings or gods and gave them food and gifts and the four wanderers including estevanico became known as healers wherever the spaniards went in the new world they carried the cross and tried to christianize the natives now with prayer and with what knowledge they had of medicine and possibly with a bit of mumbojumbo thrown in they healed the sick and even according to cabeza de vaca performed the miracle of bringing a chief who seemed to be dead back to life their fame spread westward and as they traveled on they were joined by innocent and friendly indians who followed adoring and laughing behind them observant young estevanico learned from the indians too he learned their languages and their customs he ate new foodsjerked deer strange roots and the sweet red fruit called tuna from the desert cactus he saw animals such as he had never dreamed of the small opossum with its curious pouch for carrying its young the great shaggy buffalo which had never before been seen by the spanish and often around the campfires he heard the exciting and wonderful tales of the seven cities of cibolathe golden cities to the north which were to play such an important part in his life and in the long history of new spain many a night estevanico must have lain awake looking up at the golden stars wondering if he would ever see the seven cities the indians had said that they were rich beyond description with great houses with many rooms and gleaming with gold to the indians turquoise stones blue as the desert sky were sacred and valuable but they knew that the spaniards preferred gold finally the little party with its happy band of followers turned south into what is now mexico and at last after seven long weary years of wandering they were united with other men from spain at the city of culiacan on the west coast it must have been a moving incident and would have been a joyous one if it had not been marred by spanish greed    when some of the spaniards in port saw the friendly group of indians they decided to capture them and sell them into slavery cabeza de vaca begged for the freedom of the indians he was naturally kind and had had personal experience with oppression when he was in bondage to the indians and estevanico must have felt bitterness but regardless of protests many of the indians were taken into slavery here our three spaniards leave our story but estevanico stays with us for his greatest adventure is still ahead  first he was send to mexico city to serve the viceroy there but he never forgot his adventures in the land to the north and his dream of seeing the golden cities and when the viceroy decided to send an expedition in search of the fabled cities estevanico was chosen to go along with him was a franciscan missionary father marcos de niza and a group of indian guides    now it was a long way from mexico city to the seven cities of cibolaprobably close to two thousand miles and when father marco de niza reached the town of bacapa near what is now tucson arizona he decided to rest awhile but having confidence in estevanicos intelligence and experience he sent the big man on ahead with the guides telling him to send back a wooden cross if he found the trip worthwhile little steve was proud to go on ahead he was loved by the indians and made quite an impression as he proceeded farther to the north he was dressed in fine clothes and carried a staff decorated with bright feathers and dry gourds which rattled as he walked he planted crosses to mark the way for the missionary and sent back glowing reports about the riches ahead perhaps he became overconfident and because the pueblo indians in the valley were friendly estevanico became too bold north he went in arizona and east into the mountains and finally reached new mexico and at last he came to what historians now think was one of the fabled seven cities it was one of the seven villages of the zuni indians it was walled it had houses of many rooms but it was squalid and drab and dusty and the zunis eyed the approaching travelers with distrust and suspicion no explorer had ever reached their territory and they had probably never seen a dark giant of a man like estevanico he had grown too accustomed to friendly natives foolishly but  bravely he entered the village he was taken prisoner almost at once and the next day estevanico was killeda martyr to the spanish hunger for gold he was the first explorer to penetrate into the wild region of the zuni and the first to reach one of the cities of cibola he found no gold but he was not the last to search for it    the franciscan marcos de niza went back to mexico and told glowing lies about the richness of the fabulous cities coronado and de soto both searched for them and to this day you can hear exciting tales of the lost cities here in the west though his last adventure ended in failure this does not detract from the glory of this remarkable and fearless man   mr j george hilzinger writing in a book called treasureland published in  has this to say he was an honor to his race and the negro citizens of this republic should perpetuate his memory and we suggest a monument in central park new york  
george altman
by a s doc young
yearold tall  l it £ neat two  hundred pound gentleman who epitomizes a new breed among negro athletes a graduate of tennessee state a  i university in nashville he is a member of the everincreasing clan of collegiates who have populated baseball since world war ii he islike the mantles musials and nicklausesa capitalist as the great manager casey stengel once remarked about his new york yankees it is impossible to contain george in a single frame of reference it takes two at least in frameofreference no  the sporting news is his bible bat ball and glove are his tools major league talent is his stockintrade which brings him an estimated  a year in frameofreference no  the wall street journal is his bible dowjones averages are his tools investments are the product he sells unlike legions of his predecessors of infinite racial constitution george is a trailblazer for the new breed of negro athlete who prepares for his postathletic days by firming a foundation in a reputable profession while he yet wields a big stick and holds a hot hand with the fans george is in a sense as creditable a pioneer as columbus or daniel boone he is the first active negro major league baseball player to become a registered stock broker a rarefied orbit which he reached a few months ago when he passed a rigid examination administered by the new york stock exchange long before his playing days are over george will be entrenched in the stock brokerage business and if his ambitions dont play tricks on him at the conclusion of his baseball career he will slide into the intriguing world of tickertape multibilliondollar transactions and american mainstream operations without missing a baton or losing a nickel from early spring until late summer for the next eight or nine years george altman will concentrate most of his time and attention on an athletic career which has begun to assume spectacular proportions for the past two seasons he has been the leading hitter among the chicago cubs a versatile star capable of playing both outfield and infield on defense during the past offseason george was traded to the st louis cardinals whose frontoffice leaders expect him to contribute substantially to their national league pennant pursuits during the major league baseball season george will also devote his available spare time to the practice of his second profession stock brokerage he will seek prospects among all athletes whore  interested in converting their sports salaries into profitable nesteggs but he will concentrate his immediate efforts on the frank robinsons willie mayses ernie bankses bill whites and hank aarons who earn more than a halfmillion dollars annually in the frontline ranks of negro stars perhaps twice that much more in the lower echelons in early fall henceforth after the world series has been committed to history and the archives of the hot stove leagues george will pack away his spiked shoes and uniform his bat and glove assume the conservative attire commonly associated with wall and lasalle streets and attempt to bat  or better in the world of high finance lets backtrack to the past winter lets say you want to see george in this new world of his you enter chicagos financial district on lasalle street you search for no  south and you enter the lobby of the massive building there you scan the directory of offices under as you find the name and the office number george altman     you take an elevator to the eighth floor you arrive at the offices of golkin divine and fishman a stock brokerage firm which holds membership in the new york stock exchange the american stock exchange and the midwest stock exchange you enter this office and a courteous receptionist asks whom do you wish to see you say george altman please the receptionist places a call and in a matter of moments she says hell be with you in a minute you say thank you you wait meanwhile a mere glance reveals a sizeable main office of some two dozen desks manned by busy salesman many of them contributing to the general welfare of the american telephone and telegraph company or one of its affiliates in a minute as the lady promised your attention is attracted by the figure of a tall good looking neatlydressed brownskin man who is approaching you with a welcoming smile on his face a warm hand outstretched you take the hand its a strong one you are cordially invited to come in and take a seat on the other side of stock broker george altmans desk a blackboard with dowjones figures is overhead to his left an electronic board that flashes pertinent stock news throughout the day as long as the new york stock exchange remains opens is within easy view dead ahead of him the wall street journal is conspicuous in its presence on his desk as is a complicated telephone mechanism which appears to be a private switchboard this is about as far from base hits as a man can get this is big business millions of dollars in daily exchange this is the pulse of the american economy and george altman is more than an infinitesimal part of it the interview begins a rare story unfolds george altman says that if he had his college life to live over he would major not in physical education and minor in biology he would major in finance and economics he discloses that he had been interested in stocks and bonds for some time prior to joining the firm of golkin divine  fishman after talking to some of my teammates he says i felt that there was a need for a competent financial person in the business pro sports whom the fellows could trust at the time of his conversation with teammates george was living in a south side chicago hotel he mentioned his ideas to a hotel executive named carl marks marks introduced him to an officer of golkin divine  fishman this firm agreed to take him on as a trainee george spent three months in training following the  major league baseball season he put in another three months following the  season in december  he was ready for the new york stock exchange examination which he passed with flying colors achieving the rank of registered stock broker during his training period george earned nothing or next to nothing from stock sales he estimates that it will take five six or seven years for him to establish himself as a stock broker to the extent that he can anticipate full livelihood from this industry but he admits i feel that im a little better off than the average salesman because im not presently depending on the commission business for my livelihood therefore im better able to put the customers welfare in front i dont have to worry about pressure selling im here to provide a service in these years between now and retirement from baseball im looking to build up a clientele a very good relationship with the people despite his affiliation with sports george altman does not plan to limit his sales pitches to the baseball fraternity i will not sell to a specialized group my service is available to all however i would like to think that i would be able to help the athletes as a group a projection reveals that if george sells to none but athletes to none but negro athletes say hell be dealing in big money working in a field of fertility the top  negro major league baseball players alone earned more than  in  a halfdozen championship fighters such as joe louis sugar ray robinson henry armstrong ezzard charles floyd patterson and archie  moore grossed well over   million if george altman merely captures the negroathlete market he is in clover with the aid of special correspondence courses other diligent study and research george has become an expert on his industry this is he says a business of integrity actually many millions of dollars change hands every day without any physical handling through word of mouth through agreement the business keeps you abreast of whats happening all over the world as well as right around you everything that is of importance reflects itself in the stock market it gives you a sense of responsibility also a sense of participation in the american system of free enterprise i believe that if more of us negroes would invest in these companies those represented on stock exchanges we would have more to say about hiring and firing as part owners it goes back to the whole thing of racial equalitywe havent been participating fully there are many financial advantages to be derived from investments in stocks and bonds you can use your stocks as collateral for a loan they give you a good return on your money plus there is the allimportant factor of capital appreciation there are also taxexempt securities for substantial income earners there are all types of securities for all types of people our job is to fit the security to the person this industry is stringently regulated by both the new york stock exchange and the federal government when george is a stock broker not a baseball player he works  hours a day his  to  day coincides with the activities of the stock market itself after that he must study research seek clients    daily any time youre in the company of a person he says hes a potential prospect he adds you have to stay alert to current events things that are happeningin other words you have to try to stay on top of the news theres a lot of anticipation you have to do this entails a lot of  reading and assimilating of news in his private life george altman is deeply interested in youth work he is a member of the board of directors of a chicago youth organization he is a humane person who though he would welcome riches from the stock brokerage business is a sportsman in the business as well as he is in baseball there is a fine sense of fair play of sportsmanship as well as competitiveness to be found in his carry over of attitudes and abilities from baseball to the stock market a good salesman he says is one who puts the customers interests firstalways george himself knows how embarrassing a bad investment can become with a group of ballplayers he invested in what appeared to be a lucrative chicago real estate deal a salesman approached him as he did other stars with a fancy brochure showing prime investment properties when the deal went down the ballplayers were stuck in a slum situation which cost  or more of them bad publicity as well as financial losses george was one of the few who thanks to his thenlaymans interest in investments sensed that something was wrong and pulled out cash intact the fellows george says speaking of the participating ballplayers didnt know what they were getting into the man showed us a brochure  i learned then that theres no substitute for investigation i tell that to all my clients you should know the situationand things that affect the situation on the subject of direct carryover between sports and the selling of stocks and bonds george said theres a definite carryover here in the stock brokerage business you have tough times you have a drought as when the market is in a down trend and people are reluctant to get into the market you might have a good solid investment and the people arent in a mood to buy its like when you go to bat with a good attitude but cant get any hits yet in neither case can you afford to become discouraged in this respect sports provides excellent training for the field im in in baseball i have confidence in myself it has paid off i believe i can become a very good broker as well like baseball this job entails a lot of work you have to get out and expose yourself in both fields i could sit at the desk two months and never get a call as in any field if you want to succeed youve got to work i have to get out visit people sell myself during an average day at this stage of the stock brokerage game george enters the golkin divine  fishman office early of a morning reads the wall street journal checks the dowjones news reports checks the investment advisory news service on the day of the interview he noted that the owners of his team the anheuserbusch company of st louis were doing quite well financially and the general economic news as a golkin divine  fishman representative george fits into a sales team every salesman is a part of the company he says as with any other sales organization we all work together as much as possible we receive the same financial services and advice in his role as a stock broker george altman will attempt to dispel the moreorlessgeneral notion that a person has to be wealthy in order to invest in this market a lot of people he says have the impression it takes a lot of money to invest but the bulk of investors earn an average income between  and  a year a person can buy as little as  worth of stock every three months the mutual funds are good for small investors and others who are unfamiliar with the market it provides for the pooling of funds the money is managed by professionals investment clubs also are a good medium for those who wish to become familiar with this industry one last question is asked of george do you think that other negro athletes will follow in your footsteps once theyve heard about you george replies id like to think it will encourage other negro athletes to enter the field but they had just as well know its a tough business unless you have a sense of projection its difficult to understand how youll make it the commissions are so small    itll probably take five six or seven years before i make enough to live on its quite competitive a lot of people enter it but only a comparative few stay the odds are better than  to  that george will    stay 
tribute to a lady titan
by william barrow
hen a few months ago the wire services flashed the story that a major new york high fashion house had hired its first negro model the news stirred only a minor ripple in fashionconscious circles while the event did mark another breech in the crumbling wall of racial exclusion its impact was largely anticlimactic for the past five years followers of trends in haute couture had been watching beautiful negro girls modeling clothes by worldfamous designers all across the united states thanks to the ebony fashion fair which annually tours some  cities with fabulous designs from the salons of such stylesetters as dior givenchy fontana and lanvin the image of negro women in high fashion settings was already well established needless to say the wire services had not bothered to take note back in  when freda deknight then home service director of the johnson publishing company organized the first ebony fashion fair after talking her boss publisher john h johnson into supporting the idea mrs deknight set to work selecting and training models lining up local sponsors and planning an itinerary then with the confidence and determination that was characteristic of her she flew off to paris and rome for an unprecedented invasion of the ramparts of haute couture she returned in triumph with a collection of some of the most dazzling designs in europeand with a  bill for her boss the ebony fashion fair is now a national institution and negro models long ago ceased to be elegant creatures of curiosity but last january the dynamic woman who had done so much to unite high fashion and negro women in the eyes and minds of the world finally surrendered to the disease against which she had been bravely struggling for years in her new york apartment where  until coma claimed hershe had doggedly made plans for the  ebony fashion fair freda deknight died of cancer in death the wire services at last paid homage to mrs deknight in a united press international obituary story that was published by most of the major newspapers reference was made to her contributions to the worlds of food and fashion the fact that upi mentioned her at all was testimony to her stature but the details of her truly fabulous story remained untold that story began oddly enough on a train near topeka kansas one december morning in  her mother elenore alexander a traveling nurse lost her race against the stork and freda was born in transit only two years later fredas father frederick alexander a steward on the santa fe railroad died and early in her childhood freda alexander and her older sister went to live with the paul scott family in mitchell south dakota the scotts were caterers as well as farmers and they encouraged young freda in her interest in food and food preparation it was an interest which later would lead to some  precedentmaking activities in the young ladys career in the years that followed freda alexander lived with a number of families in such widely separated places as mason city iowa st paul minnesota and salem south dakota in the latter town she attended school in a convent an experience which profoundly influenced her religious outlook throughout life from this school she went on to south dakota wesleyan college from which she received a degree in home economics thus prepared she launched a series of elaborate food demonstrations in the midwest traveling to new york she further prepared herself in her field by enrolling in courses at both columbia and new york universities for a time she taught sewing and served as a guidance counselor for yorkville high school and other vocational training schools in manhattan then she met and married rene deknight arranger and pianist for the delta rhythm boys it was in  a year after ebony magazine was founded by publisher johnson that freda deknight joined the staff as food columnist a job that eventually led to the position as home service director for the johnson publishing company as mrs deknight liked to tell the story deliberately embellished it went something like this while visiting in chicago enroute to los angeles she was invited to dinner at the home of a wealthy couple who were longtime friends of hers shortly before the dinner hour the hosts learned that their caterer had broken a leg in an accident freda soothed her frantic hosts assured them that she would take care of everything in short order and promptly proceeded to do so sparing no expense she bought the ingredients and prepared a meal fit for royalty as fate would have it one of the dinner guests was young publisher john h johnson so impressed was he with the food that he asked mrs deknight to give him the menu hurrying off to catch her train she promised to send the menu back by mail when the menu arrived it was done in an exciting narrative style that made it seem like fun to cook publisher johnson was delighted he offered mrs deknight a job writing a regular food column for ebony and she readily accepted the feature was christened a date with a dish by mrs deknights husband and a new career was born as a date with a dish grew in popularity mrs deknights identification with johnson publishing company became more emphatic she moved to chicago and in due time expanded her influence to the fashion end of ebony magazines features two years after joining the company she collected several hundreds of her recipes and those of negro celebritiesinto a book called a date with a dish a roguish little brown chef became her trademark the book became a national bestseller from food and fashion editor freda deknight graduated to the position  created for her  of home service director when the johnson publishing company home offices were remodeled and expanded in  the third floor became her exclusive domain she supervised the planning and preparation of fullcourse daily meals for some  employes in the company cafeteria presided over the first ultramodern test kitchen in a negro publishing firm and coordinated the selection and photographing of clothes and models for all ebony features on fashion during this period mrs deknight scored a record number of firsts for a negro woman in various food and fashion organizations appeared frequently on television to demonstrate such exotic recipes as violetpetal cake and rosepetal pudding and became a familiar figure at professional food and fashion gatherings where negroes had been seen before only as servants in the course of directing and organizing fashion features mrs deknight had scouted the country for fresh young faces with the kind of figures suited for modeling one of her best known discoveries was diahann carroll whose lithe form graced many pages in ebony magazine before she became a broadway and hollywood star another discovery was cordie king the beauteous chicago girl who mrs deknight helped to groom for fashion shows prior to the advent of the ebony fashion fairs it was during the height of the national popularity of the ebony fashion fairs that freda deknight learned she had cancer in  she underwent dramatic surgery in new york only days it seemed after she was discharged from the hospital she was on a plane bound for paris and the spring showings of haute couture she arrived in a wheelchair a medium of locomotion she was to use increasingly in the months that followed last year accompanied by her husband who had left the delta rhythm boys to remain constantly at her side mrs deknight flew to hawaii and then on to japan to select clothing for the  show the fashion fair with an oriental flair it was the first year she was too weak to force herself to travel with the show but she kept in close touch through occasional visits to nearby cities and via phone chats with the staff early in the winter it became evident that the disease which had ravaged her once vigorous frame and which long ago would have killed a less valiant woman finally had left mrs deknight with little strength to fight said one friend who had witnessed the amazing battle without the fashion fair  to worry about freda would have gone long ago and until consciousness abandoned her she did indeed plan for the upcoming  fashion fair because there were so many high points in freda deknights life it is easy to overlook the low but she liked to overlook them herself she grew up almost an orphan and she worked hard and long for success and she seldom received in equal measure what she always generously gave she was often ill even before the long siege with cancer and she had known agonizing poverty  but the legacies of her life are many and farreaching and one can find satisfaction in her many achievements even as one regrets her passing in a catholic digest article by margy

integration or black nationalism
by richard thorne
etween civil_rights and black nationalism the two main approaches to the solution of the black americans problems at this time i would definitely say that black nationalism has the better arguments ill state why i say this but first let me clarify my contention i dont mean to say that the civil righters are all wrong and that they are in no way helping to better the black mans conditions in america such would be an exaggeration following the premise that civil righters base their program on their conclusions are valid and sound they regard the conditions of the black american as being mainly deprived of certain basic human and constitutional rights for example they say that a particular black man is penniless because he is unemployed and he is unemployed because his particular race is discriminated against on the basis of color the solution there fore is to press for fair employment rights which will allow him an equal opportunity to be employed and he thus wont have to be penniless the logic here is incontestable no one would reasonably argue with it also since recent pressurings for civil_rights have accomplished some headway in this direction it follows also that some degree of good has been done some blacks who didnt formerly have jobs now have them what then is the basis of my contention obviously it is elsewhere let us therefore look elsewhere to find it in the first place the civil righters concentrated as they are in their one specific approach ignore it seems too vast an area of the overall spectrum of sociology and the dynamics of race relations in fact because of the peculiar orientation of a civil righters thinking it is i believe quite necessary for him to ignore more than he considers i will illustrate but first looking just at the term civil_rights itself implying by definition its own objective will already give a clue as to my meaning what actually is the civil righters objective obviously it is the acquisition of those lawful rights denied him for him it is essential that he has great and uncompromising faith in the letter and the spirit of the law the u s constitution what he should be as a human being and as a dutiful american citizen and what all  races in america should be is without question already spelled out for him nothing is omitted he shall not depart therefrom equally essential he must believe that the constitution at its face value is nonracial that is it doesnt cater to any one race more than the other but equally embraces all citizens white or black jew or chinese the constitution therefore becomes a nonpartial representative of the rights of all americansindeed more becomes the alpha and omega of political and social ethics of humankind itself and in it is found the future dignity and respect of the whole world incorporated in and symbolized by america now to what extent the civil righter believes this of course varies with the individual but something or another like this is believed by all of them often one will say when confronted by a black nationalist i am not just for one race i am for humanity meaning of course he is for the ideals of the constitution in thus believing the civil righter feels he stands for the freedom of all men and therefore he exalts himself in his own mind above the petty racial dissensions and nationalistic squabbles of racists he further feels that in order to solve americas racial problems it is only necessary to make whites and blacks alike see this point strong though this argument may sound it is actually very weak for again as has already been suggested it misses more than it considers in so far as the constitution might be limited and not include all the best interests of black people so the civil righter in not questioning it is also limited is the constitution then limited is it equally for the interests of all americans or does it promote the white race more than any other these are questions which must be answered if black peoples quest for dignity and freedom is to be attained let us look closer to answer them how may we do this one way i have found is to consider the premises upon which the black nationalists base their contentions in other words since my argument is that black nationalism in its outlook includes more in scope than does civil righters in theirs we need only look at those areas which black nationalism includes and which civil righters dont for example taking in a broader sociological spectrum the black nationalists feel that the white man ie the western world is embarked consciously or otherwise upon a mission to assert himself as the master and superior race of humankind he does this through various means sometimes in ways more outright and flagrant than others but always however through the bold assertion of his culture and himself along with his own physical self image upon the whole world to the extent that many nonwhite people it is pre sumed have been made to even think of god or any possible visitors from other planets as being more likely white than black what this means is that the white world in asserting itself has defined human valuesstandards of art and beauty etcand everything that men now consider of value including the terms civilization and culture themselves almost everything the world now holds dear corresponds to the white world at this point one might say so what what difference does it make which race defines human values someone has to do it why not the white race such questions however are very naive and fail to see a great many things to answer them we need only look at history which has through the process of the white race defining all human values worked out quite a bit more advantageously for the white race as a whole than it has for the darker races what happens is that when blacks born and unborn turn to the history books to see what great things their forefathers performed they find that most of the worlds great and laudable deeds were performed by the white race with very little contributed by other races and virtually nothing contributed by their own what effects this will and does have on shaping their attitudes toward the white race and their attitudes toward themselves as well as their outlooks in general are no insignificant matter it is at the core of race relations it is no doubt the very basis for both racial and individual initiative and will largely determine the direction in which initiative is taken civil righters if they are sincere in their efforts to help relieve the oppression blacks are under would do well to consider this point i have heard various misinformed americans from both races say at this point history is what it is we cant change the fact that the white race has made all of the worlds most noteworthy contributions if the black race hasnt done anything of merit it just hasnt thats all there is to it the appalling ignorance of such a remark always saddens me at the same time making me ever more suspicious of what motives the white world must have had while writing world history not writing it accurately yet when one does study history and finds how it has been written by whites in fact not quite so accurately at least it is more understandable how one could hold so mistaken a notion as the above also one might see why the person so believing could be so stubbornly committed to only the ideals of the western world yet never let it seriously be supposed that the black race is so unindustrious and uncreative as white history has made him out to be the only problem is that most of black history has lain in obscurity unknown to most blacks and whites alike it is always interesting to watch the eyes of a person formerly ignorant of black history light up when the startling wonders of africas past civilizationsthe songhay the mali the tanganyika the zimbabwe kingdoms etcare told africans of the past were always represented as being barbarians and savages semimonkeys as it were eating the flesh of other humans almost raw unclothed and with no concepts of morality fortunately however black nationalism realizing that such are but myths and distortions is promulgating the true history of africa and its people for the black nationalist now knows that history however it is written is that which largely gives a people their image of themselves and if their history is conspicuously absent in merit or superior for that matter their image of themselves will be likewise if now world history and particularly american history rather than being a chronicle of the poor race relations it has been had been a history of the equal struggles of all peoples to found a world society based on understanding and brotherhood the case for civil_rights alone would be a much firmer structure but being as it has the oppositethe chronicle of the western worlds land thefts murders and kidnappings enslavings and exploitations and in short hatred for and tyranny over the black raceit makes far less good sense for blacks to so dogmatically pursue only their civil_rights as if such were the sine qua non of any future hope they might have what they would be better busily doing besides anything else they might be doing is building themselves a surer historical foundation of their own not merely as whites would define it for them but according to their own cranial capacities to imagine what a partially black world should be like least of all should they continue to think of culture and civilization as the sum assertion of the white race only but rather as the aggregate cultures of the whole world and all races blacks should ask themselves where are their musical giants their bards of poetry and literature their sculptural and architectural contributions to the world where are their history books and their great men of renown if some day races are truly to be equal what kind of foundation ought they to be laying right now as blacks have tended to ignore these questions whites left to their own ways have come to conceive of themselves as so to speak the master builders of the world and blacks having observed no other world but that which whites have created have been more or less content to let it be that way at this point i am often led to think of the parable of the talents i recall that those servants who multiplied their talents were further rewarded while that one who buried his was  reprimanded and relieved of that talent he had which servant could the black race best represent the black nationalists for good reason i think seem to feel that there are ample evidences that the white world asserts itself in the manner already stated also they feel the evidences are numerous enough to disclose which race benefits the most by it there may be some question however concerning whether all whites past and present actually advance their own race out of a conscious effort to do so and with malicious intent toward darker peoples many avid black nationalists seem to feel that they do i personally would not agree with this point of view i would say rather that the way th present racial patterns are structured circumstances will automatically work out to the advantage of the white race and to the disadvantage of the darker races i do not mean that at no time have whites consciously promoted themselves and consciously done dark peoples harm stealing land from the indians was im sure a conscious effort to do good to themselves and to do harm to the indians also the robbery of africa might have been likewise but the white of today the one who gives money to negro charity or goes on the freedom ride or secretly hopes for the end of discrimination gradual though it may be and though he himself may do precious little to help bring it about but who is sure in his own mind that he wishes blacks no harm is usually quite unaware that he is promoting values which compliment only the white race he perhaps never thinks of the constitution as being a unique and exclusive achievement of the civilization of the west he too thinks of it as being a document of universal ethics promoting the human race and hence he himself in believing in it is for humanity while he is usually quite willing to integrate his fellow black american he takes it for granted that such integration will always be inward toward the white society which is so to speak a sort of center of gravity for all better race relations he never conceives of himself moving outward toward the black society naturally he also assumes that the black in order to be worthy or acceptable will continue to polish his behavior according to the prevailing standards of the society which of course just happen to be white standards although this white does not actually hate blacks he firmly feels that manners indigenous to blacks are only at best a subculture interesting in a fashion but overall culturally below and inferior to the more desirable culture of the white society to him black nationalism especially poses a threat to the stable and sovereign world which he has come to envision as the best of all possible worlds any black who talks of recovering his peopies lost heritage and giving his allegiance to it rather than to the white world is regarded with suspicion and trepidation and literally shatters the stereotyped image of the humble and peaceloving negro he was once so familiar with such an unaccountable negro must be abnormally bitter to hold such an extremist position and if allowed to promote his aims he will undoubtedly revenge himself upon first opportunity on the whole white race indiscriminate of individuals like himself who sincerely wish blacks no harm and will thrust the whole world into violence and destruction ending forever the beautiful race relations which were in the making at the this time now of course the above may be an exaggeration but any white actually believing anything like this is just being ridiculous i would think he is psychologically and unnecessarily punishing himself for his races bloodridden conscience and crimes against the black race if any violence is at all forthcoming it is such guilt projection on the part of whites manifesting itself in imagined counteraggressive attempts to thwart black nationalism or black supremacy as such a one is wont to regard it that will precipitate it if however this white is sincere and would avert violence rather than try to physically thwart black nationalism he would try to understand it using the more commendable achievements of his own race as a clue to the aims of the black nationalists he would also stand peacefully aside mustering in his own heart all the good will possible and allow black nationalism to begin elevating the black race to a cultural status that might allow both races to proceed on a more equal footing and start building the world into a more brotherly healthy and fearless environment to live in this i say is what whites should do though i venture to say they will not for though many of them have a degree of good will toward blacks it is not that good my prediction is that the white man and the black man alike will for the most part continue to decry black nationalism both conceiving of it fearfully the former as a threat to his own culture which is being looked upon as not being good enough and the latter as some awful new social catalysis stirring up the resentments of whites and thus limiting his own chances of finally being included into the white world now if anything i have said thus far is valid the great irony of course which the civil righters have missed is that the very act of heaping laurels on the constitution only further glorifies the white world which penned it the question should be asked must the whole world come to look on the social and political ethics of the western world as being the hallmark of civilized achievement it is here that civil righters will say but are we not also americans we have been here away from africa over three hundred years what other law or ethics could we normally have these questions again are valid the main issue is in what spirit are they asked are they asked out of an earnest desire to promote the best interests of black people or are they not rather asked out of a stubborn psychological predilection for western mores and a deep ingrained aversion to all mental identification with africa and africans as when one too closely empathizes only with western culture one definite approach to answering these questions might be to isolate each question and ponder it individually for example the black civil righter might ask himself in what sense is he an american how much does black culture here in america actually have in common with black cultures in africa and the world over he should study to find out i believe that if such questions were asked and earnestly answered the civil righter would perhaps feel a greater kinship to his people in america and to blacks everywhere nor would he feel so wounded and mortally insulted when the constitution is questioned he would find it unnecessary to be quite so vitriolic toward those blacks who are in the attempted process of building a selfimage which they themselves might respect as equal to that of any other people on the earth if civil righters were willing to grant this much pressure im sure would be relieved from the black nationalists which would in turn permit them to be less extreme and radical in their approach for example black nationalists have in the past insisted that every person with black skin possesses some racial quality or essence called soul which by implication has been made out to be superior to that which whites correspondingly have yet im sure the expounders of black soul actually know that what they refer to is more cultural than racial indigenous to the psychology that mutual suffering and common environment and ancestry have created civil righters in attacking what they gladly perceive as a fallacy or loophole in the black nationalists doctrine only succeed again in missing the whole point black nationalists have i will admit expounded a rather mysticsounding virtue called soul but their attempt in doing this was never meant to imply racial superiority but was rather intended to advance that one characteristic besides color which all blacks have in common this was in response to the common cry of many blacks trying to desert the race we dont have anything in common with  them for even those seeking escape the black nationalists realized were still wont to think of themselves as inheritors also of that peculiar cultural gift known as soul now if the black nationalists have not succeeded in their aim to unite the race in america it might only partially be their fault in the way they have presented themselves but the greatest failure must i believe be imputed to those who had no desire to unite with blacks they would have most likely rejected black nationalism no matter how it was presented other than the tendencies of some black nationalists to exaggerate black virtues black nationalists have on the whole essentially attempted to do much the same kind of things every other race has done to prosper the emphasis they put on racial virtues are incidental to the circumstances they find themselves in at this time without such emphasis how else might they turn the eyes of the world to regard their race which in esteem and importance time and history have all but forgotten the black nationalist is merely saying in the only way left him peoples of the world history time do not forget me i am here also significantly a part of the world if world values are being defined i insist that i be allowed to provide a part of that definition the irony of blacks saying this is admittedly very subtle and turns many of the race away from black nationalism for if blacks say that they want to help define world values they must by definition be black nationalists that is racistic and foras it is calledblack supremacy while to be for the constitution or some such embodiment of western ideals or mores which inadvertently promote the white race is to be for humanity having ourselves been reared in the western world the social implication of this is not always easy to see or is too foreign a way of thinking to risk now that we seem to be so rapidly nearing our solongsoughtafter goals this kind of thinking more prudent than courageous is understandable in view of how long blacks have suffered and waited civil righters are here embued with an old commonly held philosophy of many american blacks that of a bird in the hand is worth more than two in the bush meaning of course that civil_rights relatively in the hand are more assured than some  imaginary world of the future with equal portions of all ethnic cultures in the bush but if civil righters actually feel that what they seek is more in the hand than that which black nationalists seek perhaps we may benefit by looking at it in still another way civil righters have said and i imagine felt that much of the discrimination against blacks in america stems from institutions and mores that are themselves prejudiced they say that prejudiced institutions create prejudiced mores and thus a cycle is begun and passed along to following generations what they then would do is rid america of all prejudiced institutions set up institutions that are fair to all and thus break the cycle and spare future generations these prejudiced mores although the hope is truly beautiful will this ever happen black nationalists say no an ideal they say is one thing the practice quite another what about this supposed paradise of race relations who will define it whites naturally everyone knows its not going to be defined by blacks what this means then is that all changing and molding of character to fit the social norm will be black people reshaping their own to suit the white world let us not talk about capitalism and the need for a cheap labor market but just out of curiosity what will happen to those blacks in that segment of the population which for economical or social reasons or other never quite successfully make the change from a black personality to a white will they still be persecuted will they still be the social scapegoat will they still be denied equal privileges what will happen to them or doesnt it matter will they be kept waiting will they be the black civil righters of tomorrow i will not ask whether whites will ever do any changing to suit blacks of course they wont they are already wellsuited by virtue of being white they will continue to define dress speech mannerisms hair styles the way one walks be especially sure blacks you lose that despicable hep limp that particularly characterizes the beebop or the hoodlum whites dont like it indeed all modes of human behavior whites will define who else what about history you say it too will be written by them and about them oh i see well now civil righter in that case im beginning to suspect that this paradise of future race relations might not be such a paradise after all but will be the same old america of racial snobbery and airs of superiority only now more subtle than ever and more inveterate because it went so long unchallenged and therefore harder to eradicate george washington then crossing the delaware will still be magnified in importance whereas the slave revolt of gabriel will all but be kept secret gettysburg of  course will still be known but nat turner will be forgotten every american man woman and child black and white will say in unison our forefathers died there no one will say nor dare say of virginia and the slave revolt of  our forefathers also died there alas not americans but only negroes died there and negroes have since been forgotten now of course the above is an exaggeration but something like this is obviously in the making so bent upon obscuring their own self image are blacks and so internally driven toward acceptance into the white world awaken civil righters in terms of racial dignity and self images these matters are far more important than you have admitted for they are questions which fall outside the ken of the constitution such questions im sure carry a social implication and set up dynamics in a society much broader than the mere question of civil or legal rights let me state this once again finally considering that people white and black receive all their attitudes and values including their values of self from the world they live what values are they likely to get when reviewing history and the world around them they find the white race at the helmsman wheel in everything and the black man if included at all usually the mere recipient of what the white race has given him i have heard some civil righters say at this point that due to the recent exploits of the new negro posterity will inevitably regard the race as militant and virile and not content with inferior social status perhaps so but how much better it would be for posterity to say that black people everywhere were always socially adhesive took pride in their own race were great artists and builders of culture and political systems that truly promoted the general happiness and above all whenever enslaved looked forever to the day they might again rule themselves this leads us to one other point by analyzing the society one might be enabled to analyze the people in it both whites and black the loyalties of one will be the loyalties of both what this means is perhaps easier to see when matters are hypothetically reversed this is to say if values were defined by blacks according to themselves and all things being equal what we would find in america would be racially opposite to what we find now the whites in the society would be modeling after the blacks in dress in speech etc kinky hair would be beautiful rather than straight hair and black skin would be considered fairer than white skin instead of violins bolstering cultured music there would be the drum the sensual and suggestive hipgrinding dances of black folk would be the most principally accepted in the society not the waltz if also the whites were socially ostracized to the same extent as blacks are now and for the reversed reasons one would find the whites looking to the ethics of the black world for their deliverance this is remember only a hypothesis it is not being advocated in this event one might also find some whites openly calling themselves white nationalists advocating pride in their own concealed history in their thin noses and lips in their own music and dances would this  wonder be white supremacy if so that is exacdy what is now being promoted with no questions asked by both blacks and whites alike under the guise of simple humanitarianism  believe the failure to understand this has led the struggle of blacks away from the integrity and interests of the group and outward toward socalled humanity and individualism worst it has been directly responsible for the disunity and disintegration which have plagued the black race ever since it set foot in america as long as ones whole orientation ones thoughts and ones ambitions are away from ones own people ones loyalty must of necessity be away from them also people who dont respect each other though of the same race but who seem most inclined to respect those of another race can hardly be expected to stick together there will be little cooperation between them they will be rather quick to condemn each other will sell each other out at first opportunity here you will find snitchers backbiters prosecutors of their own kind and a thick veneer of vanity and boastfulness to conceal their own shortcomings in proportion to the degree the society which they do respect ignores them and their community they will disrespect and ignore themselves you will find in short among them the very phenomena you find among the black society at this time internal bickerings social chaos despair crime a deep longing for escape toward the white world a desire to integrate to marry light to change ones own ugly blackness into a more desirable whiteness to have straight glossy hair and all the rest of the things which black nationalists have brought into focus will earmark this society which doesnt first learn to respect itself in partial summary i would like to leave several questions bent upon integration and social acceptance by white society as many blacks are what will ultimately happen to the black race in america if their aims are accomplished will it finally be absorbed into the white race is this the ultimate goal intended and last if someone challenged a civil righter who used bleaching creams and hair straighteners would he reply oh no im not just for one race i prefer lighter skin and straight hair because im for humanity  
was russias greatest poet a negro
by homer smith
as alexander pushkin
w
d russias greatest and
p most beloved poet
  creator of the russian
literary language an
olympian among the russian literati
of the early th century enemy
of tyrants and lover of freedom
a negro
there has been much misinformation
and confusion about pushkins
genealogy and african racial
connection to the russians he
was and is a russian american
negroes pardonably and understandably
enough call him a
negro
 two examples of this misinformation and confusion both by american negroes come to mind harry belafonte when he visited israel in september  told the jersualem post in an interview that he wished to portray alexander pushkin in a film pushkin was half russian and half ethiopian mr belafonte stated jerusalem post september   writing in the afroamerican newspapers magazine section on august   john jasper stated that alexander pushkin was the son of an african general and a russian girl both of these examples immediately and clearly revealed to me that their writers had done very little or no genuine homework on alexander pushkins ancestry and as a longtime student of pushkins genealogy at the very fountainhead in russia i felt constrained to write the jerusalem post as follows    it was biologically impossible for alexander pushkin to have been half russian and half ethiopian if by this mr belafonte meant that one of pushkins parents was russian and the other ethiopian concerning mr jaspers farwrong statement i wrote the afroamerican the following correction through mv research in russia i found that pushkins father was count sergei pushkin white scion of an ancient noble russian family his pushkins mother was called the lovely creole  americas leading pushkinist professor ernest j simmons even goes to another extreme and denies that pushkin inherited any negro blood in his biography of the great poet professor simmons claims that pushkins first african ancestor in russia abram hannibal was an abyssinian and not a negro professor simmons even repeated the old fable that the ethiopians belong to the caucasian division of races all attempts to give pushkin a wholly caucasian family tree lineage contradict both peter the great and pushkin in a message to the russian diplomatic envoy in constantinople early in the th century peter the great requested that he be sent a young negro with good talent pushkin himself was always proud of the negro strain in his ancestry at the age of  ten years before his death he began writing a historical novel based on the life of his african greatgrandfather its title was to be the negro of peter the great i recall arguing the point of pushkins negro ancestry with professor simmons on one of his visits to russia in the late s we reached no accord with professor simmons adhering to his abyssiniancaucasian descent theory an american i recollect contending should be the last person to try to deny that alexander pushkin was of negro ancestrv indeed had pushkin lived in america he would have been classified even by the united states census bureau as a negro there are millions of colored persons living in america who are far lighter in color than pushkin was and who have equally large direct infusions of caucasian bloodyet in america they are classified as negroes abram hannibal is known to have been black and to have had woolly hair and it is doubtful that peter the great would have wanted his envoy in constantinople to send him a caucasian boy the russian czar no doubt wanted the real thing a leading european pushkinist of russian descent has written that hannibal had thick lips and inkyish hair of pushkin the same authority wrote that he greatgrandson of hannibal had a mass of tight curls on his head and wide nostrils i have visited the area in northern ethiopia from which hannibal came i saw no people there even remotely resembling caucasians all around me were black people with woolly hair it is quite possible that as young hannibal grew to manhood among nobles and aristocrats in russia for statusseeking reasons he might have attempted to claim caucasian ancestry even the black woollyheaded ethiopians of today claim they belong to the caucasian branch of races and in that part of the world whence hannibal came there always has been status seeking even as there is status seeking in america today in some parts of africa and in some eastern countries many persons seek to claim ancestry from some distant legendary hero important family or aristocratic progenitor some contemporary royalty claim however circuitous to have family roots going back to mohammed founder of the islamic religion even in old russia some of the great russian nobles no doubt for status purposes claimed that a legendary and illustrious german named radsha was among the roots of their family trees another contemporary example that has some pertinence to this theme exists today out in hannibals native country ethiopias past monarchswithout any proof except a legendclaimed direct descent from king solomon and the queen of sheba and emperor haile selassie perpetuating the legend claims that he too is descended directly from solomons liaison with sheba when it is recalled that solomon lived one thousand years before the christian era and that ethiopia has had hundreds of kings since then some of them of disparate tribes and all always having kept many concubinesit is certainly farfetched and manifestly incredulous that undiluted descent could have come down from such an ancient lovenest of the king of israel this statusseeking it is possible may have had some bearing on hannibals assumption of the family name of hannibal in  when he was a rising young man during his education the young african must have come across the name of the great carthaginian north african general and laid claim to ancestral ties with him some sources claimed  and hannibal and pushkin supported the claimthat hannibals father had been an abyssinian prince a royal vassal of the ottoman turks this perhaps was another effort aimed at giving hannibal added status and should be looked upon with a certain amount of skepticism it is highly doubtful that the turks would have sought out and seized the son of a prince when there were so many common and nonroyalblood negro boys available in tracing pushkins african genealogy one must go back to the year  peter the great was on the throne of russia the ottoman empire controlled the northern coastal region of abyssinia inland from the coast lived a negro family on the banks of the mareb river the region is known today as eritrea it was not unusual in those days for young negro boys to be captured or bought and shipped to turkey to become eunuchs in the harems of the turkish sultan and his grand vizier and other turkish potentates other young negroes were destined to grow up and become members of the janizary the sultans guard as a dashing young military officer abram gained entree to the best salons of paris where he became a great favorite especially among the french ladies he found life in france so much to his liking that when peter the great demanded that he return to russia abram always found excuses for extending his stay in france finally his excuses became exhausted and in  he returned to russia peter the great was delighted at the return of his young protege who had come back as russias first fully formally educated military engineer and fortifications expert peter the great died in  but not before he had appointed abram to a high engineering post in the russian army made him teacher of mathematics to the heir apparent to the russian throne and pledged him assurance that his future career was secured but shortly after the death of peter the great abram was shipped off to the russianchinese border to engage in fortifications work but when empress anna ivanovna ascended the russian throne in  she recalled abram to st petersburg and aooointed him to the highranking military post of captainengineer at the fortress of pemau in russias baltic lands during his life in france abram seemingly had developed a keen eye for beautiful women and his eyes fell upon a beautiful young girl of greek descent named evdokia daughter of a greek captain in the russian navy andrei dioper the girl disliked abram had no desire to become his wife remarking in an aside that he was as negro not of our kind however back in those days the final word in such matters rested with parents captain dioper consented to abrams request for the hand of his daughter abram and evdokia were married in  and it began to look as if hannibals in  abram had adopted the name of hannibal descendants would be of africangreek descent but the marriage did not last long evdokia was somewhat of a flirt not uncommon in those days and hannibal accused her of infidelity they separated in  as was the custom of the timeespecially when the charge was made by such an important person as hannibalevdokia was arrested not before hannibal had soundly thrashed her and secluded in a military stockade pushkin in one of his light moments remarked that the separation resulted from evdokia giving birth to a white baby girl but this allegation was without foundation for during their life together no child was born to hannibal and evdokia however she did give birth to a child but this was a few years after her separation from hannibal shortly after his separation from evdokia hannibal married christina scheberg daughter of a captain of german origin in the russian service it was rumored at the time that while hannibal was accusing evdokia of infidelity he himself was trysting with christina great compatibility and attachment marked the married life of hannibal and christina eleven children were born to them among them ossip hannibal who was to become the father of alexander pushkins mother nadezhda hannibal the lovely creole christina hannibal died in her seventysixth year abram hannibal lived on until his eightyfourth year he died honored wealthy and holder of the highest decorations that russian rulers could award i have not attempted to prove that because abram hannibal was a negro alexander pushkin must also on that account have been a negro pushkin was born felt thought and lived russian and he was as much russian as dr w e b dubois langston hughes roy wilkins thurgood marshall marian anderson frank yerby james baldwin and about twenty million other nonwhites in the united states are american nor would i be so rash as to attempt to attribute pushkins genius to his negro blood to attempt to solve the riddle of genius is an impossible exercise and it would be a no less impossible task strictly to define race within any restricted ethnological groove  despite the fact that dr dubois recently adopted ghana citizenship he did not by that act divest himself of the irrevocable reality that he was born and remains american

early in adolescence i fell under the spell of the freedom of the press idea which was being vaunted with patriotic fervor during those crucial days of depression and eminent war despite the nonetoosubtle opposition at home where the urging was toward the law profession i had decided with that nebulous bullheadedness which since has expanded to elephantine proportions that a journalistic career was for me already my addiction had involved me with a series of school publications and briefly with the production of an irregular  appearing typewritten carboncopied newssheet which i personally circulated in my neighborhood the latter publication unfortunately was advisedly suspended after a group of young neighborhood toughs took exception to some precocious civicminded observations made about their delinquent activities this personal thwart however was not sufficient to divert my interest from the fourth estate nor it so happens was a subsequent experience which nevertheless left me considerably more skeptical and measurably less respectful of the american press at a time when most boys were content with reading the comics and scanning the sports pages at best i devoured the whole paper with passion there was not much news in the detroit daily papers about negroes except tor crime stories but this did not botner me too much the race prooiem had not yet squatted fullseat on me and furthermore both tne micnigan chronicle and the pittsourgn courier arrived every saturday to detail with hyperbolics the fortunes failings and frustrations of colored folks now it is wholly true that there were ample additional grounds for me to question the newspapers practice of those principles upon which it based its claim for nearsanctity but nobody paid much attention to such criticism in those days the american press was fair and objective in its coverage the public was toldand apparently believed for the most partand the fact that negroes were routinely ignored or relegated to back pages and special sections was not acceptable evidence to the contrary also negro reporters on white newspapers were rare indeed there being not more than one or two in the whole country and the situation had not changed appreciably several years later whenclimaxing my stubborn pursuit i received my degree from wayne state universitys  school of journalism although according to my grades and the evaluation of my instructors i stood near the head of the class i was the only graduate who was not placed in a job by the school one kindly instructor conscious of the loneliness of my position was sympathetic enough to suggest that i might find suitable opportunity in india a nonwhite country which had recently gained its independence but i digress it is an earlier incident which i started out to describe so back to my adolescence    because negroes were mentioned so rarely in the regular columns of the daily papers it was especially noticeable when they were mentioned at all there was a column in one of the afternoon papers in which negroes were mentioned more frequently than anyplace else it was one of those homespuntype columns written with deliberate folksiness the emphasis always on what journalism coursesi later learned refer to as human interest in other words the columnist told lots of warmhearted little stories about ordinary people their ups and downs their trials and tribulations their fun and follies for a long time i was fascinated by the negro stories in this column occasionally there were cute stories about maids and cooks and other women domestics but most of the stories concerned a big black burly negro man although the stories tended to picture this negro as somewhat slowwitted childish and amiable he nevertheless struck me as being most remarkable in a primitive sort of way he seemed to be everywhere doing just about everythingeven if he did not do these things particularly welland the white people apparently found him as lovable as they found him laughable and then one afternoon came a disillusioning light there leading off the column was a story about the big black burly negro with the strength of hercules and the heart of gold while waiting to board a streetcar the hero had come to the rescue of an aged white woman too tiny and arthritic to hoist her poor old frame from the ground into the streetcar flexing his powerful muscles and moving in the negro had ever so gently lifted the old woman bodily and deposited her inside the trolley the passengers in the car had cheered so rich in human interest and goodwill was this yarn that the columnist did whatto my knowledgehe had never done before he published the name and address of the big black burly negro and as fate would have it the man lived next door to us at first i could not believe it was true surely there was some mistake it was not possible that the dumb bumbling peripatetic negro in the column could be the man i knew our neighbor was a graduate of the university of michigan a former track star and now a teacher and athletic coach in the public school system a volunteer ymca worker a husband and father surely a man with little time for wandering around the city getting involved in human interest incidents furthermore he was anything but big black and burly he was of average height and build the color of cafe au lait with an extra dollop of heavy cream and as lithe and leanlimbed as in his college days driven by incredulousness and an overwhelming curiosity i went next door and asked our neighbor if the incident described in the column actually had happened to him there was i remember something inexpressibly sad and wise in the smile he gave me yes son i helped the old lady on the streetcar he said when i simply stared at him in obvious bewilderment he went on to explain a lady on the streetcar asked my name and i guess she phoned the paper because the columnist later called me about it he paused a moment then said i hate to say this son but now i wish i hadnt done it i didnt tell him so but i also wished he hadnt done it i went home rather inexplicably depressed and for a long while after that i couldnt read that column at all in fact even after i finally resumed reading the column i never again quite believed all of anything i read in the papers long before i ever sat in a journalism class and learned about human interest stories i was making allowances for the quality called human interest in the stories i read and even though i bullheadedly continued to pursue a career in journalism i knew all along that the more sensible thing to do to say nothing of the more profitable thing to do would have been to study law as the grownups wanted me to the way it works out freedom of the pressand the attendant responsibilityturns out to be a less sacred precept in the practice than when it is being used as a clarion call but then in these united states that seems to be about par for the course 
should negro women straighten their hair
no   yes
ve stopped pressing  my hair after some i  years of sizzling hot combs an oftburned and always showing scalp hot weather worry and dirty grease on my pillow i have joined that growing breed of gals both negro and white who continued on page 
lagos firm is being
a
 criticised for its standing
order which for
bids its employees to
plait their hair the
critics say that the order is aimed
at destroying our national custom
and heritage
i beg to differ i think we carry
this national pride a bit too far at times even to the detriment of our countrys progress nigeria is not what it was three years ago there is a tremendous change in its physical outlook this is evident by the number of huge buildings that are springing up every day when the lagos executive development board wanted to clear the slums of lagos there was a lot of hullabaloo about the scheme unprogressive people threw a lot of dirty mud at wellmeaning board members but see the new lagos and compare it with the old ive had many letters here from critics for my articles on makeup hairdo and fashion adekunle osho of lagos said in dressing we imitate the english not minding our own attractive custom theresa on her part does not like to plait her hair and she has been instructing her female readers to burn straighten her hair shameful how beautiful was my mother when i saw her last in her onidodo hair plaits and so in this twentieth century and in this age of nuclear devices the adekunle oshos and other nigerians are asking this country to stand still and not to progress in the name of national heritage for it is not only in nuclear weapons nor mechanical devices do we need to advance other things appearances and mode of living are just as important now lets take the argument of another critic j o oyelaja of ijebuode who wrote to say that parliament should legislate against the wearing of western costume i wonder how comfortable a doctor would feela woman in wrapper buba and headtie a man in one of those flowing agbadasin a theatre performing an operation the scots irish and arabs have their national dresses but a kilt is hardly seen in edinburgh capital of scotland during working hours neither is the irish orange sash worn except on special occasions and i am yet to meet a more ardent nationalist than the scot the irish or the arab i run around a lot in this job when i wear the yoruba costume i find that i spend more time than i can afford retying the headtie and the bulky wrapper round my waist and have you tried typing in an agbada i am all for nationalisation but give it to me with some comfort and improvement the fact that women of today hard working with neveramoment to spare do not have premature wrinkles around the eyes and necks is thanks to creams lotion and detergentsin other words cosmetics which killjoys like osho dont seem to like and i challenge him to tell me what is unnigerian about cosmetics the fact is that those we use today save time nigerian women have been using cosmetics as far back as preeuropean days take osun for instance women use the red paste mixed with palm oil to rub their face and body they say it gives a glowing fresh look osun is still used today in many parts of nigeria especially by women whove just become mothers and it is available in the market the only snag is nobody has improved upon it so as not to stain our clothes in the north especially and certain parts of southern nigeria women still use lalispecial leaves which are ground mixed with lime juice and wrapped round the hands and feet there is no better nail varnish than lali for it stays longer on the nails and toes but it takes a long time process which the hustle and bustle of this modern world does not permit tiro is still used by modem nigeria women but it is not handy to take about and again it requires more time and technique which the eyebrow pencil does not demand but the effect in either case is the sameto beautify the eye and surely you readers have heard of ufie made from barks of special trees edo and uli which can be applied on the lips like the modem lipstick the women of eastern nigeria wear either of these shades black red and gold on special occasions and we have the equivalent in other parts of nigeria too and so the only offense we women of today commit is using timesaving applications we still follow tradition but in the modern way finally its time we accepted english clothes not as peculiar to europe alone but the whole world in general in other words lets see them as international dresses which are worn because of their practicability lets do away with inferiority complex 
have turned forever from the endlesss ranks of hair processors to soap and water and a good stiff brush i who have lived for all my shorthaired life in a nightmare of goldilocks shirley temple curls ponytails and fervent prayers that id awaken one morning with long silken tresses have decided to make do with what i have the decision was not an easy one it took a lot of coaxing a lot of tears and a lot of bucking the tide of criticism and i am a terribly conventional woman my hair problem like most negro womens started some years ago with my first trip to the hairdresser with wideeyed youthfulness i sat down in the chair fully expecting to leave looking like a fairy princess it was a great shock to find afterwards that not only did i have less hair but that my scalp was showing i soon heartened a bit however when i noticed other scalps beaming at me from my schoolroom desk  continued from page  fully believing my hairdressers claims that she would grow my hair i suffered hopefully until a high school semester in biology revealed to me that it was all a matter of genes and inheritance with this unpleasant knowledge and a brand new electric hot comb in my suitcase i set off for college there was only one other negro girl in my dorm so on every other friday we joined forces and spent a mysterious lockedup evening in my room frying hair and fanning the air i missed one of our sessions because of a meeting so one sunday night that ill never forget i was going it all alone when my bouncyblonde next door neighbor decided to visit panicstricken i pulled on my shower cap fanned the air one last desperate time and disposed of the evidence come in come in i said as casually as possible whats that odd smell she inquired sniffing about oh i dont know i offered rather convincingly and we were off on our usual discussion of poetry and new writers now this was one of my longwinded friendships and while i was reasonably absorbed in our discussion the fact that i was only halffried with that side probably sweating away under the shower cap and that it was past midnight weighed heavily on my mind hey im going to get my pins and set my hair while we talk she announced merrily at  am sleepy and thoroughly dismayed i mustered enough courage while she was gone to snatch off the shower cap and resume operations what on earth are you doing she marveled standing in the doorway i pulled her in slammed the door and answered with a bravery born of desperation pressing my hair why on earth are you doing that because it looks better well the undone side looks better to me she said proceeding to pin her hair as if i hadnt just gone through the single most harrowing moment of my life i turned to look at her and in that instant she ceased to be a college friend and became a distressingly smug white girl with the blonde hair that assured her of having more fun an intense hate and envy born of long suffering welled up in me well you pin curl your hair to change it i said venomously well i sure hope i never have to lock myself up to do it she said with a little smile we both laughedi for a reason ill never understand except maybe i was ashamed at being ashamed naturally i believed she was pulling my leg about the undone side and continued to do my own until i graduated and began working desperately wanting my hair to have that career girl look i must have gone to a halfmillion hairdressers all of whom eventually proved unsatisfactory with a perplexed scowl on their faces they either pressed my baby fine hair too straight and the curls didnt last or they didnt press it straight enough and the curls didnt last my hair along with my stomach for hairdressers slowly went to pot and finally i resumed doing it myself frustration led me to a wig which was not my bent and the revolutionary cold curl which worked just fine until i noticed that the brush rollers wound up with more hair than i had on my head i was truly at the end of my rope when i made the decision to go au naturelle i first got a close up view of the natural look at one of those open air art shows the girl was very pretty and i remember thinking at the time she looked absolutely stunning oh i had heard that it was somewhat of a rage in new yorkbut then new york was always having rages id even admired the look on entertainers like miriam makeba and odetta but i never really considered it for me in the meantime i met and married my husband who i might add is a worldtraveled raconteur of sorts and his frequent hints that he liked the au naturelle seemed only like so much conversation we live in america id answer with a laugh and cant you just see me going into my office with nappy hair my boss and everybody else would flip wisely now that i think back he always finally laughed off the issue until another time then one night we went to an au naturelle show featuring the singer abbey lincoln and several very attractive models from new york at a little gathering before the show miss lincoln remarked how her decision to go natural had done so much for her morale and i couldnt help being struck with her pronouncement that she was no longer ashamed of her hair which was impressively well groomed the show was a hit and for the first time for me so was the hairdo the models were stunning and i noticed several women in the audience who had beautifully groomed natural hairdos i also learned that night that there were different styles and different shapes of the hairdo and that it required just as much if not more care than pressed hair  of course my husband seized on this opportunity and i heard about the au naturelle every day for nearly a week until he came home one day with the address of an exclusive north side hairdresser and announced that hed made an appointment for me the next day he positively assured me id be more beautiful and unable to resist that possibility i went merrily to the hairdresser the hairdresser who was white and had several other negro customers admonished me for the condition of my hair i dont know why negro women with delicate hair like yours burn and process all the life out of it he complained if youd just wash it oil it and take care of it it would be so much healthier you have no more reason to be ashamed of your hair than white women do of their straight hair i dont know how all this straightening foolishness started anyhow he argued snipping away i couldnt have been less interested in his lecture i was far too anxious for the results i was immensely pleased with my new look until i got back to the south side and faced a lot of searing looks and disapproving stares i brooded through dinner despite my husbands raving reassurance there was certainly nothing i could do but wear it it was far too short to straighten the very next day i had my first bout with open criticism i was walking along thinking about absolutely nothing when a little old mediumisticike woman walked up to me and whispered sympathetically i can grow your hair for you dearie got growing hands i flashed her a withering look and snapped i just paid five dollars to get it cut dearie she backed away in amazement and i enjoyed my first triumph over criticism the next day at work was not so simple with weak knees and a bowed head i went through what seemed an ocean of haveyougonecrazy stares one friend even took me aside to ask if id gone crazy or if i was suffering from some other exotic disease i most certainly was suffering from the illness of outspoken and insensitive people at this point i suppose i would have weakened and run home if it hadnt been for those few and foreverdeartome friends who simply smiled approvingly or said nothing they and my husband gave me a kind of strength ill always be grateful for i still dole out on the average of  to  a month for scalp treatments and cuts but i dont begrudge the money half as much as when i spent it to get my hair mistreated and strangely enough ive received more compliments although mostly from whites on my hair than ever before people have walked up to me and remarked you look absolutely stunning and that does my battered morale a lot of good im not so involved in the neoafrican aspects of the au naturelle look nor in the getbacktoyourheritage bit and to those fortunate healthyhaired negro girls who still press and dont have to i say onward and upward all i know is that me and my baby fine locks never looked or felt better
